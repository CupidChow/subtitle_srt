4
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,500
Mom.

5
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,150
What are you going to do?

6
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,170
Geng, don't be afraid.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,280
Soon, it won't hurt anymore.

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,780
Gou!

9
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,030
Gou, where are you?

10
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,449
Gou, where are you?

11
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,440
Gou!

12
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,640
Gou!

13
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,340
Gou…

14
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,900
Gou.

15
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,370
Gou, wake up.

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,860
Gou, I searched half of the city

17
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,540
to finally find you.

18
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,210
Don't scare me.

19
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,340
Mom.

20
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,530
What…

21
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,040
What did I do wrong?

22
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,000
Why…

23
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,020
Why did you

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,820
do this to me?

25
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,329
Geng, don't be afraid.

26
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,780
I'll always be with you.

27
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,750
Sister.

28
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,420
The Immortal Clan has done too many evil deeds.

29
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,670
Eventually,

30
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,620
the Immortal Realm will be breached,

31
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,950
and the Immortal Clan will be overthrown.

32
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,200
I wish you could come around soon.

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,300
What happened to Xin State today

34
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,760

Geng.

37
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,890
Sister.

38
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,060
Why did you have to do this?

39
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,110
Your Highness.

40
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,020
Your Highness, the evil empress is dead.

41
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,610
Let's get out of here.

42
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,540
Gou, you scared me.

43
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,710
Fortunately, you're fine.

44
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,870
Where is this place?

45
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,620
Mom.

46
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,540
Just now, why did you...

47
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,530
Geng.

48
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,830
My divine spirit has been drained.

49
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,550
I can only bid you farewell

50
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,540
in this dream.

51
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,860
Farewell?

52
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,190
Mom, where are you going?

53
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,659
I was a priestess of the Immortal Clan.

54
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,960
I could predict the future.

55
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,740
Before you were born,

56
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,750
I'd already known this disaster would happen today.

57
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,140
I took out a shred

58
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,140
of your spirit essence

59
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,740
and kept it in the mortal world

60
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,870
to make you survive today's calamity.

61
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,460
Geng.

62
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,140
Now that your divine spirit is back,

63
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,740
you're whole again.

64
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,650
I stabbed you in front of everyone

65
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,270
just to fake your death.

66
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,820
From now on,

67
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,100
Prince Wu Geng no longer exists.

68
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,190
You're just a commoner called Gou.

69
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,020
Geng.

70
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,180
You'll start all over

71
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,780
with that identity.

72
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,880
You'll experience the hardships of life

73
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,640
and develop unforgettable relationships.

74
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,860
Life

75
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,909
will be harder for you than ever.

76
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,250
But that's the only way

77
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,420
that you can find

78
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,900
your own path.

79
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,580
Geng.

80
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,060
Stay alive.

81
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,290

Who are you talking about?

151
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,430
You're having another episode, silly.

152
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,790
How's it possible

153
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,220
that I have such a demeaning name?

154
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,100
Listen.

155
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,820
My name is…

156
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,050
From now on,

157
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,520
Prince Wu Geng no longer exists.

158
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,030
You're just a commoner called Gou.

159
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,310
What's your name?

160
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,480
Come on.

161
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,220
Get up. Get up. Get up.

162
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,890

163
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,420
Listen.

164
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,460
Gou is having another episode.

165
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,700
Don't provoke him.

166
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,390
Gou.

167
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,700
Look at this.

168
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,140
Surprised?

169
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,640
Yesterday,

170
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,080
in such a chaotic situation,

171
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,900
I still managed to find

172
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,700
your favorite dried persimmon.

173
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,500
Eat.

174
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,460
Eat up.

175
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
You don't want it?

176
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,270
Then I'm going to finish it in one bite.

177
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,140
Eat up. Eat up.

178
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,940
Gou, take a bite.

179
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,100
Try it.

180
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,260
Gou. Gou.

181
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,180
What are you doing, Gou?

182
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,580
What's wrong with you?

183
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,340
Do you know

184
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,140
I risked being killed

185
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,660
by the Bai Army

186
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,790
to find this for you?

187
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
Since yesterday,

188
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,340
you've been acting weird.

189
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,820
If I hadn't dragged you back,

190
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,220
you would've died there.

191
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
What…

192
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,790
What's your name?

193
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,560
What's wrong with Gou?

194
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,470
My name?

195
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,180
My name is Bai Cai.

196
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,380
Don't you remember?

197
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,620
What's wrong with Gou?

198
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,260
What's wrong with Gou?

199
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,300
He doesn't recognize us.

200
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,090
What happened?

201
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,300
Why can't he recognize us?

202
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,630
Did you hit your head and get brain damage?

203
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,030
No.

204
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
You've always been brain-damaged.

205
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,800
No.

206
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,150
It looks like you're all right now.

207
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,220
But how could you

208
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,470
have forgotten me?

209
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,270
Where are you going this time?

210
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,700
Xin State has fallen.

211
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,500
My father…

212
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,430
Xin King was killed.

213
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,580
As a citizen of Xin State,

214
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,890
I should protect my country

215
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,950
and fight against the Immortal Clan.

216
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,100
Have you really gone mad?

217
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,100
Xin King was so powerful

218
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,180
but still couldn't defeat the Immortal Clan.

219
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,040
You'll only get yourself killed.

220
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,060
Coward.

221
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,100
Come back!

222
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,860
You can't go!

223
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,990
What are you doing?

224
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,330
Let go of Bai Cai!

225
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,300
Hit him! Let go!

226
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,550
What are you doing?

227
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,260
What's this? It stinks.

228
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,980
It's dried cow dung used for making fire.

229
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,740
Idiot.

230
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,260
Cow dung?

231
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,940
You savages!

232
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,290
You're audacious!

233
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,700
To prevent him from doing more stupid things,

234
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,780
tie him up.

235
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,620
Okay. Tie him up.

236
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,220
Tie him up.

237
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,460
-Tie him up.
-Okay.

238
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,860
You savages!

239
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,060
How dare you humiliate a prince like this?

240
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,380
Prince?

241
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,280
Gou, you really need to look in the mirror.

242
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,950
Bai Cai.

243
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,210
Gou is saying weird things.

244
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,920
He's too sick

245
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,850
and believes he's a prince.

246
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,250
Yeah.

247
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,470
Let's go check on him.

248
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,090
Let me see.

249
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,140
You indeed

250
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,520
look a bit like that imbecile.

251
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,440
But Gou,

252
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,730
looking like him doesn't mean you're him.

253
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,020
You're not a prince.

254
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,050
You…

255
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,460
Bring it on if you dare…

256
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,350
Strange diseases, go away.

257
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,050
Strange diseases, go away.

258
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,040
Strange diseases, go away.

259
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,750
Do it!

260
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,420
Yes!

261
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,660
Listen carefully.

262
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,210
Bai State has put bounties

263
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,020
on the officials of Xin State

264
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,160
to tie up the loose ends.

265
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,800
If you were really a prince,

266
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,720
I'd hand you over for the bounty.

267
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,660
Can you be honest with me now?

268
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,200
Are you sure?

269
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,480
Biggie.

270
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,500
Okay.

271
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,900
I'll ask you one last time.

272
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,130
Who are you?

273
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,070
I remember now.

274
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,180
I'm…

275
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,030
I'm Gou.

276
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,420
You…

277
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,540
Are you sure you're Gou?

278
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,580
Yes. You're Bai Cai.

279
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,300
Yes, it's me.

280
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,620
Am I right?

281
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,540
He's really Gou.

282
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,600
-Yeah.
-Untie him.

283
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,500
Hurry up. Untie me.

284
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,310
Untie my hands too.

285
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,060
Your hands?

286
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,030
I can't untie them.

287
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,310
I need to observe you a little longer.

288
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,630
What if he goes crazy again?

289
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,070
Am I right?

290
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,670
Yes.

291
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,550
-That won't happen.
-Time to eat.

292
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,880
Time to eat.

293
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,960
Let's eat.

294
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,600
Time to eat.

295
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,310
Thank you.

296
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,950
You guys must be hungry.

297
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,590
Yes.

298
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,230
Here, Snotty.

299
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,680
Biggie, here.

300
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,350
Gou, have some porridge.

301
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,550
It surprises me

302
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,310
that you can get that slop down.

303
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,280
What did you say?

304
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,470
Slop?

305
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,720
No.

306
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,300
I mean,

307
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,630
in a time of unrest,

308
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,980
you've still managed to eat porridge

309
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,710
that's half filled with grain.

310
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,710
It's nothing short of a miracle.

311
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,660
You scared me.

312
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,280
I thought you went mad again.

313
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,589
You must be hungry.

314
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,240
You haven't eaten anything since you woke up.

315
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,030
Here.

316
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,710
No, thanks.

317
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,470
My head hurts.

318
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,829
It really hurts.

319
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,510
I feel like vomiting now.

320
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,510
I won't eat it.

321
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,470
Are you okay?

322
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,390
I'm fine. I'm just having a headache.

323
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,110
Okay.

324
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,030
I'll save it for you.

325
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,490
Eat it when you're hungry.

326
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,350
Okay.

327
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,240
Bai Cai.

328
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,990
I want another bowl of porridge.

329
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,750
Me too. Me too.

330
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,560
Okay.

331
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,590
Here.

332
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,600
Thank you, Bai Cai.

333
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,750
I want more too.

334
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,360
Me too, Bai Cai.

335
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,510
It hurts so much.

336
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,800
I want more too.

337
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,230
This rude girl

338
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,120
humiliated me again and again.

339
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,430
Gou, fish.

340
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,750
You need to eat

341
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,390
to recover quickly.

342
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,790
Move. Move.

343
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,590
Hurry.

344
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,880
I pledged my loyalty to Xin King.

345
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,840
I'm ready to die for righteousness!

346
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,750
Bai State disrupted the order of nature,

347
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,080
willing to be the Immortal Clan's lapdog.

348
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,600
It won't end well for you!

349
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,220
[Gongchen Gate]

350
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,480
In the past,

351
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,570
the tyrannical Xin King swooned over the evil empress

352
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,820
and deceived the public for his own interests.

353
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,520
He defied the Immortal Clan

354
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,420
[Gongchen Gate]

355
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,480
and caused tens of thousands of people in Xin State

356
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,870
to lose their lives.

357
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,680
Now,

358
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,870
the tyrant is dead.

359
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,790
To warn the world,

360
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,040
from now on,

361
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,750
at noon every day,

362
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,270
his corpse will be flogged

363
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,220
as a warning to the others.

364
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,720
How dare you do that?

365
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,910
Now, under the great leadership

366
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,080
of Bai King,

367
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,730
[Gongchen Gate]

368
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,430
the human race

369
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,800
will continue to devotedly serve the Immortal Clan.

370
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,120
Anyone who wants to rise against the Immortal Clan

371
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,820
will end up like him.

372
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,090
Zhou Qiao.

373
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,390
Tai Bu.

374
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,910
I'll make you pay for the humiliation

375
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,830
you inflicted on my father today.

376
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,310
Looking away

377
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,560
is a sign of defiance.

378
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,280
You'll end up like them!

379
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,550
Open your eyes!

380
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,580
Open your eyes!

381
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,950
Are you deaf? Open your eyes!

382
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,310
Open your eyes!

383
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,360
You not only have to watch

384
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,070
but also have to insult him.

385
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,720
Insult him! Insult him!

386
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,630
Insult him! Do it now!

387
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,430
Insult him! Do it!

388
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,560
Insult him loudly.

389
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,430
Do it now!

390
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,310
Insult him!

391
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,720
Do it!

392
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,600
You tyrant!

393
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,590
You fell for the evil empress

394
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,650
and disrespected the will of heaven.

395
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,190
You deserved to die!

396
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,490
Louder!

397
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,540
You stood against the Immortal Clan

398
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,150
and put us innocent people in hot water.

399
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,440
Xin King.

400
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,890
You should rot in hell!

401
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,350
This serves you right!

402
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,830
You guys!

403
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,600
Insult Xin King with him.

404
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,160
Do it.

405
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,550
You tyrant!

406
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,310
Do it now!

407
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,350
Louder!

408
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,470
The wise go with the flow.

409
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,200
Xin State no longer exists.

410
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,620
The former officials of Xin State who pledge their loyalty to Bai State

411
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,180
can be exempt from death sentences

412
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,480
and be rewarded with important positions.

413
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,470
Father, to prevent your people from becoming slaves,

414
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,110
you died fighting.

415
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,390
Yet this is what you get.

416
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,080
Father, don't worry.

417
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,180
I won't let you suffer further humiliation.

418
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,520
Xin King fought against the Immortal Clan!

419
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,080
He died for a righteous cause!

420
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,530
He shouldn't be humiliated like this!

421
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,290
We'll save His Majesty's dignity!

422
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,590
The remnants of Xin State's army!

423
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,550
Take them down!

424
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,960
I'm glad to see

425
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
there are still righteous people in this world.

426
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,670
Brother,

427
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,190
let's fight our way out.

428
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,240
General An.

429
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,590
Let's get my father's body

430
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,390
back.

431
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,320
What did you say?

432
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,710
Father?

433
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,310
You…

434
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,630
You're still alive.

435
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,150
Great. Great.

436
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,230
Xin King

437
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,810
has an heir left.

438
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,600
Go.

439
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,440
See His Majesty off.

440
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,910
Go!

441
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,590
Kill!

442
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,030
Father.

443
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,740
I'm not a good son.

444
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,290
Forgive my incompetence.

445
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,670
I hope, by this moment,

446
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,750
you've reunited with Mom.

447
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,590
Kill all of those Xin soldiers!

448
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,220
Your Majesty, farewell!

449
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,100
You damn rebel!

450
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,370
Do you remember me?

451
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,020
You're…

452
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,570
It's you!

453
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,740
Shoot!

454
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,200
Defense formation!

455
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,070
Leave. I'll cover you.

456
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,030
Go!

457
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,320
Let's leave together.

458
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,180
Your Highness.

459
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,570
Stay alive.

460
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,070
Go!

461
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,070
General An!

462
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,790
Gou?

463
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,170
Your Highness.

464
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,040
General An.

465
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,630
Remember.

466
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:42,970
I'm no longer

467
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,490
Prince Wu Geng.

468
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,860
My name is Gou.

469
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,170
I live with a girl

470
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,330
called Bai Cai

471
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,760
and four little orphans.

472
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,120
They're all out.

473
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,420
When they come back,

474
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,810
don't blow my cover.

475
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,810
Yes, Your Highness.

476
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,080
Gou, don't worry.

477
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,550
Come.

478
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,520
Come with me.

479
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,840
Sit here.

480
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,190
You…

481
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,660
How did you…

482
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,490
My mom

483
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,450
was once a priestess of the Immortal Clan.

484
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,270
She anticipated

485
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,480
the disaster today.

486
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,350
So she took out a thread of my spirit essence

487
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,010
and put it in the mortal world.

488
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,560
She faked my death

489
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,080
so that I could continue my life

490
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,800
with a new identity.

491
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,380
All right. Let's not talk about that.

492
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,650
Let me check on you.

493
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,010
No, General An.

494
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,210
I need to take you to the clinic.

495
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:09,740
Let's go.

496
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,750
No.

497
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,420
I can't go.

498
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,120
Bai State's soldiers

499
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,330
must be

500
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,570
searching for us

501
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,560
everywhere.

502
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,570
Going to the clinic now

503
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,530
will definitely expose us.

504
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,240
But your wounds...

505
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,750
I'm fine.

506
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,730
His Majesty has passed away.

507
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,620
Xin State has fallen.

508
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,590
I thought…

509
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,430
I thought you died

510
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,920
with Her Highness as well.

511
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
I didn't expect

512
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,200
to see you again.

513
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,670
I can die with no regrets now.

514
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,710
I won't let you die.

515
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,070
Now,

516
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,210
you're all I have left.

517
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,620
Bai Cai and the others

518
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,070
go out to collect herbs every day.

519
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,240
I'll go look for the herbs.

520
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,120
There must be some herb that can heal your wounds.

521
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,830
Wait for me.

522
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,510
When did you come in?

523
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,510
When you were looking for herbs.

524
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,760
What? Are you hiding something from me?

525
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,870
No.

526
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,240
I just saved…

527
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,040
Enough.

528
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
I saw it.

529
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,120
You went to protect the country

530
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,580
to avenge Xin King, right?

531
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,150
Here, take it.

532
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,720
Miss,

533
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,390
you must be

534
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,790
Miss Bai Cai, right?

535
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,800
Sorry for the trouble.

536
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,640
It's okay.

537
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,040
You're badly injured.

538
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,720
Gou.

539
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,160
Go treat his wounds.

540
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,510
Go. Go, go.

541
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:18,810
Here.

542
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,920
Miss.

543
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,500
Don't worry.

544
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,330
Once I recover,

545
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,480
I'll leave immediately.

546
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,430
Don't worry.

547
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,760
I won't ask you to leave.

548
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,490
Stay here as long as you need to.

549
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,050
Thank you.

550
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,930
If she asks me

551
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,280
about General An later,

552
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,670
what should I say?

553
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,320
Gou, what are you waiting for?

554
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,870
Come and get the stuff. We should get going.

555
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,850
When the kids come back later

556
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,610
and find nothing to eat,

557
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,080
they'll cry again.

558
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,740
Hurry up.

559
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,740
Here, take it.

560
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,410
Why did you hit me?

561
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,800
Take it.

562
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,880
You fool.

563
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,490
You're too compassionate.

564
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,130
It's fine that

565
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,330
you didn't come back with any food.

566
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,550
But you shouldn't have brought back a fugitive.

567
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,110
He's not just a random guy.

568
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,210
You'll get beheaded for helping him.

569
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:34,720
In the future,

570
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,000
there will be one more mouth to feed.

571
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,930
I don't even know what to say to you.

572
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,610
Thank you for helping him.

573
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,790
I'll be grateful to you

574
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,190
as long as you don't bring more people back.

575
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,650
You've seen what's going on outside.

576
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,720
It's not safe

577
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,700
to stay here.

578
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,440
Should we consider

579
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,510
sending the four kids

580
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,630
somewhere else?

581
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,840
They're all orphans.

582
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Where do you want to send them?

583
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,210
Where can you send them?

584
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:02,990
Besides,

585
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,630
you brought

586
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,720
Snotty back.

587
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,310
We're responsible

588
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,840
for them.

589
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,550
Right.

590
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,270
Then, we'll

591
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,630
keep them safe.

592
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,120
Alright. Let's go.

593
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,110
Grab your stuff.

594
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,340
The envoy from the Immortal Clan is here.

595
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,950
Your Excellency.

596
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,550
I don't need to read it to you, do I?

597
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,920
The King of Immortals orders Bai State

598
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,070
to submit 1,000 boxes of bloodstones every month.

599
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,350
No mistake is allowed.

600
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,640
It's Bai State's duty

601
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,470
to mine bloodstones for the Immortal Clan.

602
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,470
But the war that just ended

603
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,750
has drastically reduced the population.

604
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,710
I've sent men out

605
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,050
to recruit adult forced laborers.

606
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,389
But they're still not enough.

607
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,960
The Xin laws state that

608
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,159
unmarried young citizens

609
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,500
and married citizens without children

610
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,389
are not recruitable.

611
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,270
Now that Xin State has fallen,

612
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,130
you can change the laws

613
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,310
to legalize recruiting unmarried citizens

614
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,770
and married citizens without children.

615
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,199
In the mine,

616
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,570
they can still have children.

617
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,320
Their children

618
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,800
and their children's children

619
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,510
will keep working for the mine as slaves.

620
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,909
Isn't that great?

621
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,639
But if I do that,

622
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,350
Bai State's workforce will greatly decrease.

623
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,750
If there aren't enough people

624
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,770
working in farming and sericulture,

625
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,929
I'm afraid it may cause famine.

626
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,000
You worry too much, Bai King.

627
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,389
The King of Immortals

628
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,750
knows about your concerns.

629
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,850
These are premium fruit seeds

630
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,370
from the Immortal Clan.

631
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,090
The fruit is called the Eternal Fruit.

632
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,910
After you sow them in the field,

633
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,920
they'll bear fruit in less than three days.

634
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,150
With them,

635
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,390
your misgivings

636
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,330
can be dismissed.

637
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,670
Thank you for your gift.

638
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,710
Your Excellency,

639
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,950
please tell the deities

640
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,940
that Bai State will soon issue new laws

641
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,080
to ensure the monthly tribute of bloodstones

642
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,590
as required.

643
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,270
You're smart to know your place, Bai King.

644
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,600
Under the aegis of the Immortal Clan,

645
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,680
Bai State will surely prosper

646
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,680
for thousands upon thousands of generations.

647
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,630
What are you doing?

648
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,950
I thought we were here to catch fish.

649
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,470
I'm making bait.

650
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,590
Have you really got brain-damaged

651
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,590
in that accident?

652
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,950
What are you waiting for?

653
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,680
Catch fish. Hurry.

654
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,800
Go in.

655
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,910
I've prepared something good

656
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,000
for you.

657
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,040
Your Highness. Your Highness.

658
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,120
I'm very satisfied

659
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,520
with the supplement this time.

660
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,480
Thank you for your compliment, Your Divinity.

661
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,710
It's my honor

662
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,850
to serve you.

663
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,430
I'll leave you

664
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,830
to enjoy the supplement.

665
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,270
I'll take my leave.

666
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,790
He looked so much like him.

667
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,280
But he's dead.

668
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,890
Guards.

669
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,270
Your Highness.

670
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,080
Pass the word.

671
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,990
Search the whole country

672
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,390
for people who bear a resemblance in stature and appearance

673
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,830
to Prince Wu Geng of Xin State.

674
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,270
Kill every one of them.

675
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,550
By the way,

676
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,010
we've run out of firewood.

677
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,830
There is firewood over there.

678
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,290
Gou, put these things down.

679
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,750
Let's go gather some wood.

680
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,310
Who did this? Who did this?

681
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,270
Let me out.

682
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,810
Tell me. Who are you?

683
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,760
I'm Gou.

684
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,790
Liar.

685
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,800
Gou knows

686
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,510
that I can make stones shine.

687
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,510
Besides, nothing about you

688
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,860
is like Gou.

689
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,880
Spill. What have you done

690
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
with the real Gou?

691
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,590
I…

692
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,960
I am Gou.

693
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,910
It's just that

694
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,750
I'm not the Gou

695
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,430
I used to be.

696
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,400
What are you talking about?

697
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,380
I mean,

698
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,310
after I got hurt,

699
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,040
I remembered

700
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,640
lots of childhood memories.

701
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,600
I remembered that

702
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,330
my father was a blacksmith.

703
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,450
He often taught me martial arts.

704
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,270
He often took me to the mountain to dig iron stones.

705
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,240
One day, I accidentally

706
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,880
fell down the mountain.

707
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,400
I hit my head

708
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,870
and forgot many things

709
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,330
that happened in the past.

710
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,820
In that case,

711
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,770
why did you

712
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,080
burn Xin King's body?

713
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,110
I see.

714
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,190
I get it.
