In ancient times,

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,520
the ancient Immortal Clan lived in the Xuanhuang Wasteland

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,390
They were born with great powers.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,840
Among them, Hei Long, the black dragon,

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,750
was born with the force of chaos.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,350
He had a violent nature

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,150
and was the most powerful.

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,070
Gen Gu, master of the Immortal Clan,

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,630
feared Hei Long's power

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,270
and wanted to kill Hei Long.

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,790
They fought for a hundred days

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,860

14
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,510

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,790
of Gen Gu and the ancient Immortal Clan.

16
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,710
In this battle,

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,850
Hei Long's lover, Bai Long, was sacrificed.

18
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,230
Hei Long was furious and heartbroken.

19

to rule the three realms.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,950
Hei Long crowned himself the King of Immortals

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,470
and made the Xuanhuang Wasteland the Immortal Realm.

22
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,130
Henceforth, the new Immortal Clan was created.

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,830
For the next 100,000 years,

24
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,950
the Demon Clan was sealed underground by Hei Long,

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,830
where they experienced eternal night

26
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,310
and never saw the sun again.

27
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,190
For generations,

28
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,250
they experienced the pain of Petrification Sickness.

29
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,270
Some Immortal Clan members were dissatisfied with Hei Long

30
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,390
and left the Immortal Realm.

31
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,310
They created the Shenyin Clan

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,710
and survive in the mortal realm.

33
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,180
The Sea Spirit Clan was enslaved by the Immortal Clan

34
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,070
and became the Immortal Realm's

35

eternal gatekeepers of the sea.

36
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,930
The human race was ordered by Hei Long

37
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,520
to mine for bloodstone for generations to worship the Immortal Clan.

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,520
They were tortured and humiliated,

39
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,400
and their days had no hope.

40
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,190
The three realms

41

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,750
Father, he tried to assassinate you.

177
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,600
General Mo.

178
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,210
If we don't get rid of the Immortal Clan,

179
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,010
Xin State will never be at peace.

180
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,820
If you really care about the nation,

181
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,840
you should fight for the people

182
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,670
of Xin State

183
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,150
even if you have to die in battle.

184
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,830
If we want peace in Xin State,

185
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,200
I must kill you first!

186
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,910
Your Majesty,

187
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,770
if you insist on this,

188
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,390
the human race

189
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,640
will be doomed forever.

190
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,940
Humans

191
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,290
can never defeat the Immortal Clan.

192
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,890
Humans can never defeat the Immortal Clan.

193
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,910
Humans can never defeat the Immortal Clan.

194
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,310
Humans can never defeat the Immortal Clan.

Geng.

197
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,590
Remember.

198
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,700
When stances are different,

199
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,230
even allies may sometimes

200
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,460
become enemies.

201
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,590
Father,

202
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,070
I want to fight the enemies.

203
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,110
No.

204
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,390
Why not?

205
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,270
As the Prince of Xin,

206
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,750
I should contribute to the nation.

207
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,420
That's why I have

208
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,080
a more important task for you.

209
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,360
From tomorrow onward,

210
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,110
Xin capital will open the granary and give out food.

211
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,900
I want you to receive

212
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,230
the refugees entering the city

213
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,310
and settle them in.

214
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,220
But, Father...

215
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,740
Don't give me that.

216
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,790
This is the king's order.

217
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,510
Do you want to disobey it?

218
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,860
I dare not.

219
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,020
I know what you're thinking.

220
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,340
You are my son.

221
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,600
But I want to tell you

222
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,520
that work here at the back

223
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,940
is no easier than killing enemies at the frontline.

224
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,200
Sometimes, it's even more complicated.

225
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,630
Father,

226
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,250
we declared war against the Immortal Clan

227
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,800
and paid such a big price.

228
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,620
Is it really worth it?

229
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,470
Do you know

230
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,470
where Heaven is?

231
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,790
Heaven?

232
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,630
Here.

233
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,589
I heard that

234
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,310
at the peak of the sky,

235
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,790
where the sun rises every day,

236
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,470
there is a domain that humans can't reach.

237
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,220
It's called

238
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,230
the Immortal Realm.

239
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,440
My father

240
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,890
once told me

241
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,890
the human race was born

242
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,130
to provide

243
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,410
for the Immortal Clan.

244
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,320
Is that the case?

245
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,750
Should that be the case?

246
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,080
No.

247
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,110
I believe

248
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,390
destiny should be

249
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,390
in your own hands.

250
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,410
I don't want to accept my fate.

251
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,330
I don't want the human race to accept its fate.

252
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,540
Why should I take the lead and rebel against the immortals?

253
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,350
Because I believe that

254
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,230
one day, the human race

255
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,510
will arrive there.

256
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,710
We will

257
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,670
personally tell the King of Immortals

258
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,870
that the human race

259
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,150
will no longer be their slaves.

260
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,850
We'll control our own destinies.

261
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,500
Yes.

262
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,210
We'll control our own destinies.

263

I've been hungry for days. Snakes!

Boss,

279
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,750
we had a hard time

280
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,710
finding these medicinal materials.

281
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,040
How much will you pay us?

282
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,640
They're all dead. They're not worth much.

Four shells.

284
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,510
Four shells?

285
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,340
Even a dead snake

286
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,750
is worth at least ten shells.

287

The war is critical now.

288
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,550
It's hard to get these supplies.

289
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,790
Exactly. The war is critical now

290
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,750
and there's a lack of medicinal materials.

291
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,870
As citizens of Xin State,

292
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,020
you should be righteous.

295
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,670

I don't think I need to tell you

302
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,620
how much these supplies normally cost.

303
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,790
Given the current situation,

304
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,670
medicinal materials will only be more expensive.

305

I'll treat it as a friendship discount.

I'm so sincere.

312

Move. Move.

but you got trampled like this.

00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,810
The price went up again.

351
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,290
8 shells?

352
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,090
How can the price go up so easily?

353
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,870
Yes.

354
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,060
Stop arguing.

355
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,350
The price of grain now is 8 shells a bag.

356
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,070
Sir,

357
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,710
it was just 4 shells just now.

358
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,310
How can the price go up so easily?

359
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,510
That's right.

360
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,150
What are you doing?

361
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,430
Don't think I don't know,

362
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,470
but the imperial court had opened its warehouses to distribute grain,

363
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,700
so the price of grain shouldn't be so expensive.

364
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,580
Exactly.

365
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,630
Let go of me!

366
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,780
Or I'll beat you up!

367
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,190
Don't you dare touch me.

368
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,990
-You...
-Gou!

369
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,470
What are you doing?

370
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,730
Will you lower the price?

371
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,100
The price was set by my boss.

372
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,270
It's not up to me.

373
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,030
It hurts!

374
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,750
My hand is about to break.

375
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,580
Forget it, Gou. Let him go.

376
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,180
It has nothing to do with him.

377
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,300
Come and buy some. 8 shells.

378
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,300
You won't get to buy it if you don't buy it now.

379
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,590
You don't have the money. Stay back.

380
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,350
Line up.

381
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,430
Don't push.

382
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,700
One by one.

383
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,120
Thank you for your help, Mr. Tai Bu.

384
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,580
Our shop wouldn't be as popular without you.

385
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,580
You aren't earning the money for nothing.

386
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,300
I understand. We will split 3 to 7.

387
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,830
What should we do, Gou?

388
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,150
We only have 4 shells now.

389
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,510
We can only buy half a bag with 4 shells.

390
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,230
Half a bag is only enough for you.

391
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,190
What about

392
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,070
the four kids at home?

393
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,200
What am I going to do?

394
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,830
Such a shady profiteer!

395
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,860
You're the only one

396
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,350
laughing at this point.

397
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,070
Your Highness.

398
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,050
Your Highness.

399
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,250
Y-Your Highness.

400
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,110
So this is the prince.

401
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,960
Why does he...

402
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,770
look so much like Gou?

403
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,430
Don't push. Don't grab.

404
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,430
Line up properly.

405
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,960
I'm talking about you.

406
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,670
Your Highness.

407
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,910
I'm here to patrol,

408
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,510
and to see if there are any profiteers here

409
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,860
who hoard and sell at exorbitant prices.

410
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,990
Your Highness,

411
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,750
our grain prices are low.

412
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,480
The people are very satisfied.

413
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,320
Yes.

414
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,790
Your Highness.

415
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,700
Your Highness, there's something you don't know.

416
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,070
This shop...

417
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,420
The owner of this grain shop

418
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,740
is a good man.

419
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,870
He sells each bag of grain for only 1 shell.

420
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,710
In Xin capital,

421
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,410
there are no other shops

422
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,010
that sell cheaper than this.

423
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,660
Really?

424
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,830
Yes, yes.

425
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,310
Yibei.

426
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,790
Come on.

427
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,070
Line up! Line up! Line up!

428
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,780
So,

429
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,830
I'm going to buy two more bags today.

430
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,550
Sir, give me four bags of grain.

431
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,380
Excuse me.

432
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,590
Come on.

433
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,070
Don't grab. Don't grab!

434
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,270
Gou! Gou!

435
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,770
Everybody, buy more.

436
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,910
A bag of grain only costs 1 shell.

437
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,420
Buy more.

438
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,710
Come on.

439
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,380
Gou, hold it well.

440
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,830
Gou.

441
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,460
Everybody, buy more.

442
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,390
A bag of grain only costs 1 shell.

443
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,300
Gou, let's go.

444
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,240
Let's go.

445
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,510
Don't grab. There's enough for everyone.

446
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,840
Stop, you two!
Doggy!

447
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,830
Gou, they're catching up.

448
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,100
Hurry and run!

449
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,270
Stop! Stop!

450
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,170
Help! There's a robbery!

451
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:46,730
Stop!

452
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,310
Mr. Tai Bu ordered

453
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,280
for you to return the grain.

454
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,300
Why should I return the grain

455
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,510
when I had paid for it with my own money?

456
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,550
A bag of grain costs 8 shells.

457
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,510
Unless

458
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,550
you make up for the remaining money today,

459
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,350
otherwise,

460
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,070
you aren't going to take it away from me.

461
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,590
You're really a two-faced official.

462
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,870
You were the ones who colluded with the profiteers

463
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,710
to raise the price.

464
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,260
Now, you're blaming me instead.

465
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,550
Hand the grain over.

466
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,350
No, I won't.

467
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:10,710
Hand it over.

468
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:10,990
No.

469
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,940
No! No!

470
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,630
Beat them up!

471
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,390
No!

472
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,210
Gou!

473
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,590
How dare you steal food!

474
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,220
Beat him to death!

475
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,100
Beat him!

476
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,930
Beat him hard!

477
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,640
Your Highness.

478
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,500
Your Highness.

479
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,180
Gou.

480
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,990
Are you alright?
Your Highness.

481
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,050
What are you doing?

482
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,670
How dare a commoner like you

483
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,220
take on the officials?

484
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:06,270
They were the ones who wanted to rob us of our grain first, and even hit us.

485
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,470
Is she telling the truth?

486
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,750
Your Highness, please don't listen

487
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,510
to the nonsense of this scoundrel.

488
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,580
Actually, she paid with fake shells just now.

489
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,330
That's why

490
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,710
I wanted to take back the grain

491
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,740
that she had cheated from us.

492
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,340
I didn't expect this scoundrel to hit me.

493
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,470
Your Highness, look at her.

494
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,270
Nonsense!

495
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,780
You're the one who raised the price,

496
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,310
Now?
Letâ€™s raise the price.

497
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,710
Didn't you just say

498
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,770
the price was fair?

499
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,900
Since you each have your own say,

500
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,270
go back with me

501
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,840
and make things clear.

502
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,930
Take them back.

503
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,000
Yes.

504
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,660
Let's go.

505
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,550
Go.

506
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,020
You...

507
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,070
Gou.

508
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,920
Gou, take it.

509
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,580
Gou. Gou.

510
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,570
Gou, be good.

511
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,790
You take the grain home first,

512
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,550
okay?

513
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,860
Silly boy, be good.

514
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,670
Whoever gets home first,

515
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,630
gets an extra half a bowl of rice for dinner.

516
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,660
Hurry up. Go!

517
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,590
Go, Gou!

518
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,120
Help!

519
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,720
The evil prince is bullying us!

520
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,460
The evil prince is bullying us!

521
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,580
You still want to escape?

522
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,460
Should I be waiting for you to kill me?

523
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,510
If you are innocent,

524
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,430
what are you afraid of?

525
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,230
If you want to frame us

526
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,950
and give us a charge,

527
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,860
wouldn't that be easy for you?

528
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,470
What innocence

529
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,930
can we claim as commoners?

530
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,070
It's useless to say more.

531
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,110
I will find out

532
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,130
who's right or wrong.

533
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,890
Bah!

534
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,190
As a prince,

535
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,470
you are worse than my Gou.

536
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,550
You only bully the weak.

537
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,080
What kind of prince are you?

538
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,060
Geng.

539
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,790
Come back quickly.
Let go of me!

540
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,100
Mother.

541
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,150
You're looking for me so urgently.

542
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,210
What's the matter?

543
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,670
Geng, come.

544
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,390
I have something to tell you.

545
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,510
Geng.

546
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,230
Every word and every sentence

547
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,460
that I'm about to say,

548
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,950
you have to remember deep in your heart.

549
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,950
Okay.

550
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,380
As the Xin Prince,

551
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,160
[Moon Fox]

552
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,870
do you know what kind of responsibility

553
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,400
you have on your shoulders?

554
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,710
Naturally, that would be defending Xin State,

555
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,910
so that the people of Xin

556
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,170
can live better lives,

557
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,030
and make Xin State even stronger.

558
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,920
Then, do you know

559
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,770
how are you going to

560
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,600
protect Xin State?

561
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,070
With my sword,

562
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,510
and with the courage

563
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,710
my father and mother had taught me.

564
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,510
Geng,

565
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,120
you can't defeat the enemy

566
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,640
on your own.

567
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,100
Besides being smart,

568
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,300
and having the courage to move forward,

569
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,510
you must also have

570
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,380
a benevolent heart

571
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
that loves the world and its people.

572
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,830
Only when you learn to love your people,

573
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,990
will they fight together

574
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,960
with you,

575
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,930
and protect Xin State.

576
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,990
Mother.

577
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,810
Why are you

578
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,310
suddenly telling me this?

579
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,750
This day...

580
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,670
is finally here.

581
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,320
Geng,

582
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,570
you must remember.

583
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,650
The road ahead

584
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,230
is sure to be treacherous

585
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,050
and fraught with difficulties.

586
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,330
You have to remain aware at all times,

587
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,030
in order to

588
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,190
see the light

589
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,490
in this ever-changing world.

590
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,790
You have a duty to protect the people,

591
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,190
observe their hardships, and empathize with their emotions.

592
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,230
Only in this way,

593
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,050
you can become a real king.

594
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,710
Okay.

595
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,870
I'll be sure to keep that in mind.

596
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:24,970
Your Majesty,

597
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,350
once you choose this path,

598
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,190
there's no turning back.

599
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,190
Have you really decided?

600
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,670
For the human race,

601
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,220
for the people of Xin,

602
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,080
and also for our children,

603
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,810
I must fight.

604
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,190
All these years,

605
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,600
have you ever regretted it?

606
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,030
Giving up everything for me,

607
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,690
becoming an ordinary person,

608
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,690
and experiencing hardships, bullying,

609
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,020
and loneliness.

610
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,370
You were even misunderstood by your own family.

611
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,350
I have never regretted it.

612
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,530
Spending time with you

613
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,790
has been the happiest time

614
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,030
of my life.

615
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,270
My Lady,

616
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,480
you've experienced all the bitterness of the mortal world.

617
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,540
But this time...

618
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,630
This time, it's different.

619
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,150
This time,

620
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,100
you might have to

621
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,760
go through it with me.

622
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,470
I'm not afraid.

623
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,200
As long as I'm with you,

624
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,430
I'm not afraid

625
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,990
of any difficulties,

626
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,390
or life and death.

627
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,150
But,

628
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,790
I can't stop worrying about Geng.

629
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,070
Don't worry.

630
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,550
Geng has grown up.

631
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,429
It's just that...

632
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,900
We'll have to let him know,

633
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,409
no matter what happens,

634
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,929
we will always be by his side.

635
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,550
Gou.

636
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,070
Gou!

637
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,630
Gou!

638
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,100
Gou!

639
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,230
I have investigated and found out that

640
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,950
the two of them

641
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,190
were indeed hoarding the grain that were

642
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,100
distributed by the King,

643
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,160
and then selling it at a higher price.

644
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,190
Spare my life, Your Highness.

645
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,900
Spare my life, Your Highness.

646
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,830
You two

647
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,390
have got some nerve.

648
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,670
How dare you

649
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,860
secretly disobey the King's orders,

650
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,030
deceive the people,

651
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,120
and rake in ill-gotten gains.

652
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,190
Spare my life, Your Highness.

653
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,830
Spare my life, Your Highness.

654
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,570
These two are absolutely sinful.

655
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,370
Tomorrow,

656
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,310
along with their allies,

657
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,980
they shall be executed in public.

658
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,940
Inform them

659
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,620
to open the warehouse tomorrow morning,

660
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,510
and distribute more rations again.

661
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,310
Yes.

662
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,000
Take them away.

663
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,760
Come on.

664
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,970
Line up.

665
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,830
Thank you, boss.

666
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,390
Boss.

667
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,870
More, give me more.

668
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,830
Give me more.

669
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,430
Some more, boss.

670
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,400
[Grain]

671
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,830
Good job executing them.

672
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,510
The wind is so powerful.

673
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,730
What's going on?

674
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,440
Your Highness, the Immortal Clan is attacking.

675
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,370
It's the Immortal Clan!

676
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,340
The Immortal Clan is coming! The Immortal Clan is coming!

677
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,940
The Immortal Clan is coming!

678
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,890
Finally,

679
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,710
they are here.

680
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,270
Look how scared they are.

681
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,700
But I think they are

682
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,500
so pitiful.

683
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,880
Pitiful?

684
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,110
What for?

685
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,910
They are just

686
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,290
a overly confident human race.

687
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,980
How dare you try to fight the Immortal Clan?

688
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,850
You know you don't have what it takes.

689
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,870
I do admire

690
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,270
their courage.

691
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,280
You mean the courage to seek death?

692
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,110
Let me meet the human race.

693
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,080
Tian Kui.

694
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,870
Slow down.

695
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,580
It won't be fun

696
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,170
if we kill them all at once.

697
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,030
That's right.

698
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,860
How could I miss out

699
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,950
on something so interesting?

700
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,220
Let me have some fun with all of you.

701
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,490
Gou.

702
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,840
Gou!

703
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,480
[King Qi Zhou Fa]

704
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,970
[Zhou Qiao]

705
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,990
What are you waiting for?

706
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,240
Charge into Xin capital

707
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,340
and kill all of the human race

708
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,160
who have violated the law.

709
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,530
Kill them all!

710
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,540
Soldiers of Bai, listen up.

711
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,870
Charge into the capital and kill them all!

712
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,200
Gou.

713
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,450
Gou!

714
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,650
Gou, where are you?

715
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,920
Gou!

716
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,230
Your Majesty!

717
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,470
The Immortal Clan is attacking.

718
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,790
Please let us out.

719
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,590
Your Majesty!

720
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,750
The Bai Army is now right outside the capital.

721
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,870
It's more dangerous to go out now.

722
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,780
Father,

723
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,520
what are you doing here?

724
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,530
Go to Zhaixing Pavilion and protect your mother.

725
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,190
No.

726
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,450
I want to fight

727
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,550
alongside you, Father.

728
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,990
If Mother was here,

729
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,830
she would agree with my decision.

730
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,710
You are my son,

731
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,730
and also the prince of Xin State.

732
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
You were born

733
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,620
to fight for the fate

734
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,630
of the human race.

735
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,290
Your mission

736
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,990
is not here.

737
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,270
Father,

738
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,070
I don't understand.

739
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,390
Why do you keep refusing to

740
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,830
let me go to war?

741
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,750
Am I not qualified

742
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,550
to fight for Xin State

743
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,660
in your heart?

744
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,070
Today,

745
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,140
I must fight the Immortal Clan,

746
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,200
for the people of Xin and Xin State.

747
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,520
Youâ€™re great, Your Highness.

748
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,790
We support you.

749
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,150
Good job, Your Highness.

750
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:29,900
Your Highness.

751
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,710
You have our support, Your Highness.

752
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,220
Good job.

753
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,310
Wang Zigeng.

754
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,420
This fool

755
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,180
is actually a hero.

756
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,050
We support Your Highness!

757
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,600
Wu Geng from Xin State,

758
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,550
come with me to fight the battle.

759
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,950
Yes, Father.

760
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,590
Gou.

761
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,130
Gou!

762
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,040
Gou!

763
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:06,790
Gou! Wait for me, Gou!
