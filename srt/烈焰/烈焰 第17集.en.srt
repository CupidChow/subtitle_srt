4
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,750
Shi Xing.

5
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,509
This is the Seal of the Dead.

6
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,950
Shen Yan, the Grand Elder,

7
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,030
gave it to me

8
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,630
to punish you.

9
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,110
The seal holder

10
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,830
will never live nor die

11
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,230
and forget everything.

12
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,710
You will become

13
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,210
a beast who only knows killing.

14
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,400
Every time the seal is activated,

15
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,669
you will experience

16
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,710
the pain of losing your lover again.

17
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,390
There is no better punishment

18
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,470
than a pain that repeats itself.

19
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,310
This...

20
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,430
is the result of your disobedience.

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,470
Shi Xing has begun to become a beast.

22
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,730
His divine power has also improved a lot.

23
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,400
Xing...

24
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,600
Xing!

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,890
Xing!

26
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,150
Xing!

27
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,210
Xing!

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,270
Xing.

29
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,829
Xing!

30
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,810
Mother! Mother!

31
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,329
Mother!

32
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,360
Mother!

33
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,260
Shut up!

34
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,610
Mother!

35
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,120
Shut up!

36
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,390
Xing!

37
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,350
♫An inch of love in my heart♫

38
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,800
Xing. I can feel

39
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,850
♫Against your unresolved obsession♫

40
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,790
your pain.

41
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:35,230
♫Riding alone, the battle horse leaves a trail of dust behind♫

42
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,350
I know

43
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,630
you don't want this, right?

44
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,930
♫Carve a line of heartless words♫

45
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,830
I don't blame you.

46
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,970
♫The name I dare not mention♫

47
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,659
I knew this day

48
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,370
♫Hiding my feelings and heart away secretly♫

49
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,900
would arrive sooner or later.

50
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,630
But I'm not scared at all.

51
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,800
♫The wind soothes a moment of yearning♫

52
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,250
Because every minute,

53
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,510
every second,

54
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,770
and every moment spent with you

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,190
♫But I can't go beyond it♫

56
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,070
has been the happiest time

57
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,520
♫We're not fated to be♫

58
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,170

♫Look, the heavy rain is approaching♫

60
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,140
It's such a pity that

61
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,530
♫We can't stop it from flooding the city♫

62
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,070
we haven't seen

63
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,240
♫Like the late realization of obsession♫

64
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,780
the scenic rivers and mountains

65
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,420
♫The wet tears♫

66
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,510
and blooming flowers together...

♫Slowly, I come to my senses♫

68
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,160
♫I want to go crazy with you♫

69
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,010
♫Remove our armor and bathe in the light of the blades♫

70
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,320
♫When we're seriously injured, we shall retreat♫

71
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,510
You...

72
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,590
♫And confine ourselves to my city forever♫

73
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,070
Mingyue!

74
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,470
Mingyue!

75
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,230
Kill!

76
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,710
Maybe

77
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,190
only Mingyue can awaken

78
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,390
Shi Xing's kindness.

79
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,940
Gou, I have an idea

80
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,800
that could snap Shi Xing out of it.

81
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,670
I'll pretend to be Mingyue.

82
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,800
I believe that deep in Shi Xing's heart,

83
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,340
there is still a light that hasn't perished.

84
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,310
No.

85
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,660
I can't let you take the risk.

86
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,620
Trust me.

87
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,910
I know what he wants.

88
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,960
Lan, leave this place to me.

89
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,710
Take Bai Cai to Mingyue's room

90
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,710
and keep her safe.

91
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,710
But you...

92
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,440
I'll leave Bai Cai in your care.

93
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,870
Be careful.

94
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,310
Come on, Shi Xing.

95
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,850
Show me your undying body!

96
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,440
Interesting.

97
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,910
Not enough.

98
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,150
You can't kill me

99
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,620
with that level of power.

100
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,350
Hurry up, Gou is still fighting.

101
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,110
Go!

102
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,950
Okay.

103
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,010
Who is helping us in the dark?

104
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,150
You disappoint me.

105
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,110
Kid,

106
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,680
I thought you would be like Hei Long

107
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,060
and end my suffering with the divine power

108
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,540
of the Colorless Realm.

109
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,380
But you

110
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,410
can't even accomplish the Divine Activation.

111
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,170
You disappoint me.

112
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,180
Since you can't kill me,

113
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,650
what's the point

114
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,350
of keeping you alive?

115
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,950
Uncle Ziyu.

116
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,590
Great Swordsman.

117
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,490
You have finally picked up your sword

118
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,320
to meet me again.

119
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,940
My sword

120
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,540
is meant for upholding justice,

121
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,110
not for pointless

122
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,780
battles with you.

123
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,720
I didn't want to kill.

124
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,390
But today,

125
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,790
you want to hurt

126
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,390
the person I want to protect.

127
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,020
I can only fulfill your wish.

128
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,670
Good.

129
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,950
Then don't let me down.

130
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,350
That feels great, Great Swordsman.

131
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,740
After so many years,

132
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,590
I finally feel

133
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,670
the joy of death.

134
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,950
Your qi cultivation

135
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,910
has reached

136
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,910
the integration of human and sword.

137
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,840
You are worth

138
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,860
the wait.

139
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,150
What a pity, Great Swordsman.

140
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,290
Before you fought me,

141
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,120
you've already consumed a lot of qi cultivation.

142
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,410
Otherwise, this strike

143
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,350
could have badly wounded me.

144
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,930
I see.

145
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,190
So you helped

146
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,520
this brat strengthen his qi cultivation.

147
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,400
No wonder he

148
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,670
mastered qi cultivation overnight.

149
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,320
You consumed your own qi cultivation

150
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,620
and helped a loser.

151
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,150
As a result,

152
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,470
both of you will die.

153
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,490
How foolish.

154
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,850
Predecessors pave the way

155
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,560
for future generations,

156
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,560
so the future generations

157
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,070
can continue to move forward.

158
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,940
This is the human race.

159
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,190
Unfortunately,

160
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,550
you immortals

161
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,130
will never understand it.

162
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,470
Uncle Ziyu.

163
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,069
You did that for me?

164
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,349
Geng!

165
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,530
Uncle Ziyu!

166
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,990
How boring.

167
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,230
So useless.

168
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,480
As the son of Hei Long,

169
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,170
I can't die even if I want to.

170
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,280
You can't kill me.

171
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,550
It's not only because

172
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,450
I'm created from Hei Long's divine spirit,

173
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,040
but also because Xinyue Kui

174
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,430
placed the

175
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,710
Seal of the Dead on me.

176
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,850
Life

177
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,350
brings countless pain to people.

178
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,790
Since you can't kill me,

179
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,950
I'll end

180
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,150
your life instead.

181
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,000
Not bad.

182
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,110
The stronger the pressure,

183
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,230
the more powerful

184
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,590
the energy in your body.

185
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,930
Let me see

186
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,590
what your limit is.

187
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,640
There's always

188
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,190
an unbreachable gap

189
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,990
between humans and immortals.

190
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,150
Immortals who choose to be with humans

191
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,040
are so foolish.

192
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,980
You're wrong.

193
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,990
You have no right to humiliate the human race!

194
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,210
Fine.

195
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,070
Release all your power!

196
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,790
Immortals are not invincible!

197
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,360
Divine Activation?

198
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,520
The divine power of the Colorless Realm.

199
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,080
The divine power of the Colorless Realm?

200
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,630
Great.

201
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,710
Let's continue fighting.

202
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,010
The Seal of the Dead

203
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,460
left you with nothing but killing intent.

204
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,390
Without love,

205
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,020
you're filled with pain.

206
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,180
So,

207
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,950
you don't know

208
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,430
the real meaning of life.

209
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
I can't die.

210
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,200
I can't die!

211
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,670
Come on.

212
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,110
Kill me with your divine power

213
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,790
of the Colorless Realm!

214
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,450
I won't let you die.

215
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,310
But I will never let you

216
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,190
be my obstacle again.

217
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,710
So,

218
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,110
go to sleep forever!

219
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,000
Gou!

220
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,820
I have a way to release Shi Xing from the punishment.

221
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,190
Shi Xing is just like us,

222
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,860
we're all victims of the Immortal Clan.

223
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,830
Trust me.

224
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,550
I really have an idea.

225
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,760

When we were in the Immortal Realm,

00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,850
everyone said that

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,240
♫Standing between heaven and earth♫

242
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,030
the Immortal Realm was the best place

in the three realms.

♫My mind is purified♫

245
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,870
Then I came to Liusha City,

246
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,930
and I realized that

247
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,510
the Immortal Realm is far inferior to the mortal world.

248

Because you are in the mortal world.

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,790
How was it like

252
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,890
living in the Immortal realm?

253
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,630
The Immortal Realm

254
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,230
is indeed

255
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,750
a beautiful place.

256
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,870
But, despite the beauty,

257
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,430
it is like a cold prison.

258
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,390
There is no such

259
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,860
passionate feelings

260
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,520

261
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,650
Neither is there the warmth of the mortal world.

take away my sight

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,790
alright?

348
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,850
♫I turn around and depart♫

349
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,940
♫Leaving the mortal world behind♫

350
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,770
♫All that love and obsession♫

351
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:32,270
♫Disappear with the wind♫

352
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,080
I remember now.

353
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,350
That woman's name

354
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,100
was Mingyue.

355
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,050
She was the person I loved the most.

356
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,430
It was me. I killed her myself.

357
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,660
Shi Xing.

358
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,790
Mingyue.

359
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,430
Mingyue!

360
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,030
Impossible.

361
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,590
That's impossible.

362
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,500
The Seal of the Dead

363
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,980
is an ancient forbidden curse.

364
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,909
No other form of power can break it.

365
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,130
Unless

366
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,650
it's ancient divine power.

367
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,909
This is...

368
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,080
ancient divine power?

369
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,280
Ancient divine power?

370
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,679
Is this why High Priest

371
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,400
told me to kill Bai Cai?

372
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,260
Greetings, Grand Elder.

373
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,290
I have something important to report.

374
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,920
Grand Elder,

375
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,580
this is a serious matter.

376
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,840
This is about the ancient crystal

377
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,730
that the King of Immortals has been investigating.

378
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,880
While I was in the mortal world,

379
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,420
I found that the ancient crystal

380
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,020
had reincarnated as a woman in the mortal world.

381
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,470
And this woman

382
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,880
is currently with the son of the Xin King,

383
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,790
Wu Geng.

384
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,070
All signs indicate that

385
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,450
this woman is no ordinary woman.

386
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,950
So I’m here to report.

387
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,640
Please make a decision.

388
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,470
Do you have proof?

389
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,400
I...

390
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,930
I have been investigating.

391
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,700
You mean to say

392
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,960
that you are

393
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,320
wasting my time

394
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,950
with your speculation

395
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,950
and guesses?

396
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,000
I dare not.

397
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,660
The chief of the six tribes

398
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,100
should be the High Priest, Xinyue Kui.

399
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,180
Grand Elder, you're right.

400
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,310
It is Xinyue Kui.

401
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,080
You crossed the line and acted on your own.

402
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,110
Grand Elder, please spare my life.

403
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,950
I am acting on the concern

404
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,510
for the safety of the Immortal Clan.

405
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,670
Don't be too nervous.

406
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,000
I will keep

407
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,190
your actions a secret.

408
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,440
Thank you, Grand Elder.

409
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,910
I’m willing to serve you

410
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,170
to my best capability.

411
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,430
I don't want your speculations

412
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,290
or unconfirmed guesses.

413
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,580
What I want

414
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,500
is proof

415
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,840
of the crystal girl's existence

416
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,030
and her exact whereabouts.

417
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,990
Do you understand what I mean?

418
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:35,090
I totally understand.

419
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,340
I’m on it.

420
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,390
I’m on it.
