00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,930
[Episode 18]

4
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,039
You don't have to do this.

5
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,450
I am

6
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,590
no longer immortal.

7
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,520
I remember everything.

8
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,950
I remember Mingyue's name.

9
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,200
All these years,

10
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,150
all my memories of her

11
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,270
were sealed.

12
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,550
Without love

13
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,230
and memories of her,

14
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,670
I turned into

15
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,390
what she hated the most.

16
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,510
I became a murderer

17
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,230
and a beast.

18
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,430
Thank you.

19
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,510
for helping me get rid of my pain.

20
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,270
Indeed.

21
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,000
Losing your love

22
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,840
will make your life miserable.

23
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,850
You mentioned that

24
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,250
Bai Cai has ancient divine power in her body.

25
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,190
Only the ancient divine power

26
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,550
is powerful enough

27
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,120
to remove

28
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,950
the curse of the

29
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,430
Seal of the Dead on me.

30
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,750
That's why

31
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,430
I released

32
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
the divine power in her body.

33
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,950
Will the ancient divine power

34
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,470
affect Bai Cai in any way?

35
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,870
Maybe

36
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,590
it can make her stronger.

37
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,829
Great Swordsman.

38
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,670
You're right.

39
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,870
I don't understand humans.

40
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,220
But in this world,

41
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,310
the human I wanted to understand

42
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,430
is already gone.

43
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,020
Maybe

44
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,860
humans can do

45
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,020
what immortals cannot do.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,400
Gou,

47
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,030
if it were you,

48
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,190
maybe you can do it.

49
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,700
Mingyue,

50
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,030
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,850
I made you wait for so long.

52
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,510
Soon,

53
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,830
we can meet again.

54
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,980
The Crystal Glory.

55
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,390
All these years,

56
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,590
we couldn't find

57
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,990
where the crystal was.

58
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,510
So it has reincarnated into a human.

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,310
Bai Cai's body

60
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,750
contains

61
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,350
the ancient divine power of the Crystal Glory.

62
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,720
What a pleasant find.

63
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,920
If we present her to the King of Immortals,

64
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,750
it would be a great merit.

65
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,070
The six tribes immortals should have lived and died together.

66
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,900
Now, Shi Xing is dead,

67
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,980
and Gui Mu is useless.

68
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,820
The rest of you

69
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,800
should work together.

70
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,500
Speaking of Tai Ji...

71
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,180
I know

72
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,750
you two love each other.

73
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,610
When he accomplishes his task,

74
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,950
I will report your matter

75
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,470
to the King of Immortals.

76
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,790
It’s been years since the Immortal Realm

77
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,650
had any festivities.

78
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,900
Accomplish his task?

79
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,310
What is Tai Ji doing?

80
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,020
I heard

81
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,450
Tai Ji is in the oracle hall right now.

82
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,270
He has been trusted by Xinyue Kui lately.

83
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,330
Shi Xing the undying,

84
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,350
strongest of the six tribes,

85
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,350
was actually killed

86
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,909
by a mere human.

87
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,680
First, Gui Mu.

88
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,120
And now, Shi Xing.

89
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,330
There are more and more useless immortals

90
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,050
among the six tribes.

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,240
We underestimated them.

92
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,550
Xin King's son, Wu Geng,

93
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,790
is very talented.

94
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,620
I can't believe he activated the divine power of the Colorless Realm.

95
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,790
I’m afraid he's really the reincarnation of God of War.

96
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,970
No matter how talented he is,

97
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,610
he's still a human.

98
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,910
Our Zhui Ri

99
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,670
is also the genius of our family.

100
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,850
Shut up.

101
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,320
Zhui Ri.

102
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,110
Team up with Tai Ji

103
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,950
and kill Wu Geng.

104
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,560
He's a mere human.

105
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,390
Do we even need to team up?

106
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,480
Am I not clear enough?

107
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,780
Understood.

108
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,780
I won't let you down, High Priest.

109
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,300
Understood.

110
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,110
It seems

111
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,920
she has something to tell you.

112
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,190
In that case,

113
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,390
I'll go first.

114
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,150
Grand Elder said you went to the oracle hall.

115
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,710
So you didn't go there alone.

116
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,090
Boring.

117
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,710
Were you suspecting me?

118
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,910
He wanted me to think that way.

119
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,840
But I didn't.

120
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,540
That's good.

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,659
Grand Elder

122
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,690
doesn't want you to go to the Mortal Realm.

123
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,309
He wants me to stop you.

124
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,870
To be precise,

125
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,190
he doesn't want Xinyue Kui

126
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,360
to have the chance

127
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,230
to earn any merits.

128
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,850
Although Xinyue Kui has a high status,

129
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,170
it's not enough for her

130
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,590
to deploy the six tribes directly.

131
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,480
So, as long as it’s not an order from the King of Immortals,

132
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,230
even if you stay here in the Immortal Realm,

133
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,370
you're not disobeying her order.

134
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,470
You don't want me to get involved

135
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,900
in the fight between

136
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,370
Grand Elder and Xinyue Kui, right?

137
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,070
That's all I want to say.

138
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,260
Whether you leave or stay,

139
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,620
it's up to you.

140
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,180
Those evil Immortals are unforgivable.

141
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,190
If they didn't

142
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,520
use the Seal of the Dead,

143
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,390
Shi Xing wouldn't have turned

144
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,230
from a respected city governor

145
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,790
into

146
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,720
a horrible bloodthirsty monster.

147
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,950
Mingyue and he wouldn't have...

148
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,990
There are too many injustices

149
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,110
between the Immortal Clan and the humans.

150
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,240
The Immortal Clan looks down on humans

151
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,150
and forbids romantic relationships between the two races.

152
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,210
What they're doing

153
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,190
not only oppresses the human race

154
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,870
but also

155
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,240
their own clan members.

156
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,860
Even an Immortal like Shi Xing

157
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,070
just wanted

158
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,150
to be with

159
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,310
someone he loved.

160
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,260
And yet, he couldn't escape

161
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,660
the fate of being hurt by the Immortal Clan.

162
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,670
Forcing lovers apart from each other...

163
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,350
If I were to

164
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,870
suffered such treatment,

165
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,350
maybe

166
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,520
I'd end up like Shi Xing.

167
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,010
By the way, Gou.

168
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,020
How's the Shenyin Village?

169
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,950
Before I was abducted,

170
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,270
Kong Que was pregnant.

171
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,890
Did she encounter any danger?

172
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,870
Don't worry.

173
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,470
Everyone is fine.

174
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,790
And the child of Clan Leader Kong Que

175
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,990
has already been born.

176
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,790
Really?

177
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,590
Everyone in the village

178
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,050
is very worried about you.

179
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,190
Yun Zhongzi

180
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,310
even lent me his

181
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,310
treasured gourd.

182
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,110
Lan, too.

183
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
She didn't say anything,

184
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,000
but she came with me to King's City

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,930
because she was worried about you.

186
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,480
To be honest,

187
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,990
Lan is the same as everyone

188
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,830
in the village.

189
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,470
She has long regarded you

190
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,860
as one of her own.

191
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,830
Lan.

192
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,780
Thank you for letting bygones be bygones,

193
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,510
and for coming to King's City

194
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,830
with Gou.

195
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,710
When Shenyin Village was under attack,

196
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,230
you also contributed a lot.

197
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,690
Therefore, it is only right that I come here.

198
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,190
Let's go back to the village

199
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,270
to visit everyone.

200
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,440
Old Man, too.

201
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,550
I miss him.

202
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,830
What's wrong?

203
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,740
Old Man

204
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,370
was taken away by Xinyue Kui.

205
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,250
What?

206
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,030
Gou.

207
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,630
We need to find a way

208
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,680
to save Old Man.

209
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,400
We'll talk about the matter of the Immortal Realm another time.

210
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,910
Uncle Ziyu.

211
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,840
The situation prior was urgent,

212
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,670
so I didn't have time to introduce her to you.

213
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,720
This is Bai Cai.

214
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,410
Since my parents passed away,

215
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,470
Bai Cai

216
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,930
has always been by my side.

217
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,470
Uncle Ziyu, I'm Bai Cai.

218
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,760
My name means cabbage.

219
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,510
I haven't thanked you yet.

220
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,110
Thank you

221
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,830
for helping Gou.

222
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,230
By the way,

223
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,790
the steamed buns you made were delicious.

224
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,070
Bai Cai.

225
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,150
Uncle Ziyu

226
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,910
is the greatest swordsman of the human race.

227
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,590
During the war of Xin,

228
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,220
he fought alongside Xin King

229
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,470
and battled Hei Long together.

230
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,390
That's amazing.

231
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,740
Uncle Ziyu,

232
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,150
we just met by chance,

233
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,300
but you helped us.

234
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,230
If you like

235
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,320
my steamed buns,

236
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,120
I'll make them for you right now.

237
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,550
No need.

238
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,600
You haven't recovered yet.

239
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,300
There's no rush.

240
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,450
Besides,

241
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,910
Gou and I

242
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,970
don't need such formalities between us.

243
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,990
So, you don't have to be so polite too.

244
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,250
You, on the other hand,

245
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,100
must have suffered a lot

246
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,790
with Gou.

247
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,070
Thank you.

248
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,750
I'm more than happy

249
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,390
to be with Gou.

250
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,870
If it weren't for him,

251
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,950
I would still be digging

252
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,550
for bloodstones in the mine.

253
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,670
You wouldn't have had the chance

254
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,950
to eat the steamed buns I made either,

255
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,670
right?

256
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,510
Yes.

257
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,030
The Seal of the Dead has been removed

258
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,650
and the barrier outside is gone.

259
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,670
Those puppets left peacefully.

260
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,720
What about the villagers?

261
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,230
They have long died.

262
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,390
The Seal of the Dead

263
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,610
left them wandering here like undead ghouls

264
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,900
for many years.

265
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,810
It's good that

266
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,570
they can rest in peace now.

267
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Great Swordsman.

268
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,910
Do you know

269
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,110
if there were any skilled members of the Demon Clan

270
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,550
among those puppets?

271
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,150
Demon Clan?

272
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,310
Why do you say so?

273
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,430
During last night's battle,

274
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,780
someone was secretly protecting Bai Cai.

275
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,770
I suspect

276
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,750
it was someone from the Demon Clan.

277
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,350
Your guess is reasonable.

278
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,710
Humans

279
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,240
don't have such abilities.

280
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,650
Besides,

281
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,400
the Immortal Clan has been against us.

282
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,080
It’s impossible for them to help us.

283
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,050
So,

284
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,390
the only possibility

285
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,080
is someone from the Demon Clan.

286
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,550
They used

287
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,220
weapons from the Demon Clan.

288
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,070
Are they enemies or friends?

289
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,030
Was their purpose

290
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,250
to help us

291
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,910
or to kill Shi Xing?

292
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,780
I've heard that

293
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,270
the King's City

294
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,520
was not only a prison to imprison Shi Xing

295
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,350
but also a massive boulder

296
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,010
on the heads of the Demon Clan.

297
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,910
The demons and immortals

298
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,770
can never tolerate each other.

299
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,710
So,

300
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,790
the only individuals

301
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,190
willing to help us defeat Shi Xing

302
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,510
must be from the Demon Clan.

303
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,110
In that case,

304
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,290
I want to go to the Demon Realm.

305
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,670
What for?

306
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,620
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

307
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,100
Since we're going to attack the Immortal Realm,

308
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,830
we'll need more help.

309
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,510
The Demon Realm is very dangerous.

310
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,240
Besides,

311
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
we don't know much about that place.

312
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,130
Now the Great Swordsman is...

313
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,310
Gou,

314
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,830
you have your own path to explore

315
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,390
and someone you want to protect.

316
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,020
I'm happy for you.

317
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,110
You

318
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,030
can make decisions for yourself.

319
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,300
Such strong sword energy.

320
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,790
If I could kill

321
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,500
the master of this sword energy,

322
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,520
it wouldn't be considered a disgrace to me.

323
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,540
It's Zhui Ri,

324
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,530
an immortal of the six tribes.

325
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,560
Perfect timing.

326
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,790
I’d like to see who's stronger,

327
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,390
my divine power of the Colorless Realm,

328
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,150
or him.

329
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,740
Gou, your wound...

330
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,330
Gou.

331
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,030
I didn't expect that a human

332
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,540
has awakened the divine power of the Colorless Realm.

333
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,640
Unfortunately,

334
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,210
you consumed too much in the battle with Shi Xing.

335
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,650
You haven't recovered yet.

336
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,390
You're no match for me now.

337
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,510
You immortals

338
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,470
love to

339
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,940
take advantage of others' weaknesses.

340
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,630
Although killing you now

341
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,910
is a low blow,

342
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,790
if I let you go,

343
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,540
you'll become a great threat to the Immortal Realm.

344
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,750
Accept your fate.

345
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,590
Lightning Power.

346
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,310
That's the ultimate move of the Wanxiang Realm.

347
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,350
Don't take it head-on.

348
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,490
Be careful, Gou.

349
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,340
It's really a demon.

350
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,390
[Suifeng Qiwu]

351
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,950
Someone from the Demon Clan is here too.

352
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,680
You immortals love to bully the weak.

353
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,910
I will let your soul

354
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,880
perish today.

355
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,230
What a joke.

356
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,830
You demons

357
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,340
broke your oath and left the Demon Realm.

358
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,980
You're openly opposing the Immortal Realm.

359
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,550
Tai Ji had no courage to join me today.

360
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,300
If the six tribes were all here,

361
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,640
you would all be turned into ashes.

362
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,540
Stop making excuses.

363
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,010
Shi Xing is dead, and Gui Mu is crippled.

364
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,980
You don't have the six tribes of the Immortal Realm anymore.

365
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,900
You will pay the price

366
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,750
for your arrogance.

367
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,810
Thank you

368
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,020
for helping me.

369
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,080
Thank you.

370
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,110
May I know your name?

371
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,550
I'm Suifeng Qiwu.

372
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,790
There's no need to thank me.

373
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,280
I was ordered by the Grand Marshal

374
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,600
to protect you.

375
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,320
Everyone, my mission is completed.

376
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,220
Goodbye.

377
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,640
Miss,

378
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,750
please wait.

379
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,470
I want to see

380
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,600
your Grand Marshal.

381
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,280
Do you know the situation of our clan right now?

382
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,300
Besides,

383
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,980
even though the Grand Marshal ordered me to help you,

384
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,440
it doesn't necessarily mean we're friends.

385
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,750
Whether we are enemies or friends,

386
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,340
I didn't think about that.

387
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,310
You helped us

388
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,510
at a critical moment.

389
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,830
I will remember that

390
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,990
and repay you.

391
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,450
I hope that when you return,

392
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,780
you can report that to your Grand Marshal.

393
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,900
Wu, bring them here.

394
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,090
Yes.

395
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,260
Time is running out. Zhui Ri is defeated.

396
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,510
I'm afraid more immortals

397
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,200
will come here.

398
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,330
Come with me to meet the Grand Marshal.

399
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,820
Uncle Ziyu, here.

400
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,860
Geng.

401
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,470
Since the demons

402
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,070
are not hostile towards you,

403
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,380
I won't

404
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,630
go with you.

405
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,790
Uncle Ziyu,

406
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,550
we just...

407
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,360
Geng.

408
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,110
You should know that

409
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,590
this place can't trap me.

410
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,590
I didn't come to you

411
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,790
for so many years

412
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,830
nor asked about you

413
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,070
because of what your mother said.

414
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,630
What did my mother say?

415
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,710
Your mother told me

416
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,710
to believe in you.

417
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,710
No matter where I was,

418
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,910
you would find me.

419
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,910
Now,

420
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,970
I finally understand what she meant.

421
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,830
If I searched for you,

422
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,790
your identity would have been exposed.

423
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,470
Your mother believed,

424
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,470
that no matter how hard it was,

425
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,590
you would follow her will

426
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,150
and find me.

427
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,530
Geng.

428
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,120
I have to thank you.

429
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,580
for helping me.

430
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,480
The death trial is over.

431
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,840
My sword energy is reborn.

432
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,310
I can finally

433
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,630
leave this place.

434
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,990
Bai Cai is a good girl.

435
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,510
You have to treat her well.

436
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,670
Find a chance

437
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,630
to tell her your real identity

438
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,190
so that there won't be any

439
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,120
misunderstandings in the future.

440
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,150
I know, Uncle Ziyu.

441
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,150
But

442
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,600
I haven't avenged my parents yet.

443
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,890
I don't want to create more trouble.

444
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,480
Geng.

445
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,590
I'm sure that if your father

446
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,630
and mother

447
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,070
see the state of you

448
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,710
right now,

449
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,270
they will be very proud of you.

450
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,750
Uncle Ziyu,

451
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,230
I've never forgotten that

452
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,670
I want to accomplish

453
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,860
what my father couldn't.

454
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,000
I also hope

455
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,850
you can be by my side

456
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,220
and witness

457
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,590
my realization

458
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,590
of what my father wanted to achieve.

459
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,550
But I know

460
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,630
it's not the time yet.

461
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,770
I just hope you can take care of yourself.

462
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,720
When the time is right,

463
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,090
let's fight alongside each other again.

464
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,840
As long as you need me,

465
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,070
I'll be back anytime.

466
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,220
Uncle Ziyu,

467
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,640
from now on,

468
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,600
I will protect you.

469
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,990
Although the Demon Realm

470
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,500
has no ill intentions towards us,

471
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,110
we must be cautious.

472
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,100
There must be a reason

473
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,730
why they helped us in need.

474
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,640
But she did save us just now.

475
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,350
You heard it.

476
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,140
She's just following orders.

477
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,430
As a mortal,

478
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,660
if anything happens to you

479
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,200
in the Demon Realm,

480
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,640
it'll be a narrow escape.

481
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,470
Lan.

482
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,350
Everyone

483
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,830
has his own value.

484
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,230
You don't have to use force

485
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,290
to solve problems.

486
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,590
What can you do?

487
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,640
One more person means one more source of power.

488
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,880
At the critical moment,

489
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,470
I might be able to help you.

490
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,750
Kill Bai Cai when necessary.

491
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,910
Gou and I

492
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,030
have been together since childhood.

493
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,060
Before we came to King's City,

494
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,150
we had never been separated for so long.

495
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,950
From now on,

496
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,690
I don't want to be apart from him anymore.

497
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,510
You follow him around

498
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,430
because he is Gou.

499
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,550
If he weren't,

500
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,710
would you still be like this?

501
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,750
Gou is Gou.

502
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,200
In my heart,

503
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,430
he will always be Gou.

504
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,430
I believe

505
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,390
we are special

506
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,390
in each other's hearts.

507
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,230
Okay.

508
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,470
I've told you.

509
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,200
If anything happens

510
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,470
in the Demon Realm,

511
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,870
don't blame me.

512
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,330
Thank you.

513
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,630
Lan.

514
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,870
I know.

515
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,160
You're worried

516
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,830
I'll be a burden to Gou.

517
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,830
But don't worry.

518
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,340
From now on,

519
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,160
I won't allow anyone

520
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,960
to use me to hurt Gou

521
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,760
even if I have to forsake my life.

522
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,270
I won't allow it.

523
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,670
Wu Geng.

524
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,230
The future

525
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,570
must be a bright path.

526
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,200
It's also a dangerous journey.

527
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,350
You must remember your father

528
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,270
and mother's teachings.

529
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,630
Uncle Ziyu,

530
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,170
I'll never forget

531
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,350
your kindness to me.

532
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,750
Have you seen enough?

533
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,620
Gou, who are you talking to?

534
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,490
You're indeed the son of destiny.

535
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,630
You can see through

536
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,470
the divine power of the Kongshi Realm.

537
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,270
Good.

538
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,370
I can't wait to see you.

539
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,890
This brat

540
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,840
seems to know you're watching him.

541
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,030
Even the six tribes immortals

542
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,030
can't sense

543
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,410
the divine power of the Kongshi Realm.

544
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,890
How did he notice it?

545
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,120
Wu Geng.

546
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,110
I won't let you go.

547
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,040
Where is Zhui Ri?

548
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,190
I was about to report to you about it.

549
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,700
Because of the Demon Clan's intervention,

550
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,050
Zhui Ri failed.

551
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,750
How dare you say that?

552
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,590
Why didn't you join Zhui Ri?

553
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,190
The four of us should join forces

554
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,410
and kill Wu Geng together.

555
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,220
Wait.

556
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,510
Since they don't know what's good for them

557
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,830
and want to visit the Demon Clan,

558
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,360
I'll take this opportunity

559
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,110
to see what the Demon Clan is planning.

560
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,790
I’m back.

561
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,070
Brother.

562
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,150
This sword

563
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,590
was specially crafted by Xin State's

564
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,150
best craftsmen

565
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,230
and gifted to me by you.

566
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,310
It accompanied me as I wandered the world,

567
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,430
searching for a peaceful

568
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,830
and free life.

569
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,030
But you

570
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,760
shouldered the responsibility of protecting Xin State

571
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,690
for the happiness of the citizens.

572
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,750
You withstood the pressure of the Immortal Clan

573
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,080
so that I could have

574
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,740
♫Like a beam of light♫

575
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,230
a free life.

576
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,860
♫Piercing into the desolation♫

577
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,090
♫I see my old face in my dreams again♫

578
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,770
♫How peaceful♫

579
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,890
♫Soothing the young boy's wounds♫

580
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:54,800
♫Take me by the hand to say farewell to the world and return home♫

581
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,030
Brother.

582
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,260
You broke the curse

583
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,460
♫Waking up under the moonlight♫

584
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,390
that humans could never challenge immortals.

585
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,600
♫Alone in a dangerous pass, I watch the wind blow away the clouds♫

586
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,300
But I didn't expect that

587
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,440
♫The past has gone with the wind♫

588
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,430
our reunion in Xin City

589
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,780
♫The sword of Nirvana ignited in my heart♫

590
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,580
would become

591
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,430
our farewell day.

592
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,000
♫Singing between heaven and earth♫

593
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,630
This is my eternal regret.

594
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,490
♫Annihilating time♫

595
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,720
But luckily,

00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:25,880
♫Bury all the pain in the wilderness♫

597
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,070
Geng has grown up.

598
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,350
He inherited your will.

599
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,620
♫Standing between heaven and earth♫

600
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,190

♫My mind is purified♫

602
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,960

♫The longings along the way♫

604
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,670
Geng also has

605
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,750
the aura of a ruler,

606
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,770
♫Turn into gorgeous colors all over the sky♫

607
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,830
just like you.

608
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,870
So,

609
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,470
I chose to fight alongside him.

610
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,950
Just like

611
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,750
♫All that love and obsession♫

612
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,730
how we fought together back then.

613
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,710
It made me feel

614
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:54,930
♫Disappear with the wind♫

615
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,110
the meaning of existence

616
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,150
and hope once again.

617
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,310
[Demon Realm]

618
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,710
Bai Cai!

619
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,830
Lan!

620
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,470
A new star

621
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,400
appears with a bright shine.

622
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,880
Who are you?

623
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,950
You just activated

624
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,020
[Yongheng Zhiye]

625
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,350
the sea of stones.

626
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,760
I haven't seen it

627
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,510
this bright in a long time.

628
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,080
Do you think

629
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,290
it's too dazzling?

630
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,110
100,000 years ago,

631
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,390
the ancient Immortal Clan

632
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,550
had a great war.

633
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,270
The winners entered the Immortal Realm

634
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,240
and received great prestige.

635
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,680
The losers entered the underground

636
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,620
and never saw the sun and moon again.

637
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,110
They suffered great torture.

638
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:11,250
The human race on the surface

639
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,880
was oppressed by the Immortal Clan.

640
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,030
Only the appearance of the War Immortal Star

641
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,510
can change the three realms.

642
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,060
And now,

643
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,150
it's becoming more dazzling.

644
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,010
It's been 100,000 years.

645
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,699
You finally showed up.

646
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,150
So,

647
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,120
you knew I would come to the Demon Clan

648
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,780
and waited for me.

649
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,670
I'm not the only one

650
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,310
who knew you were coming.

651
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,650
Whether the fate of the Demon Clan can be changed

652
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,830
depends on today.

653
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,050
You can predict the future?

654
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,830
You're an immortal.

655
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,060
I do have the divine power of the Kongshi Realm.

656
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,960
But I've been underground

657
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,550
for 100,000 years.

658
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,690
Only my weary body is left.

659
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,520
Do you know why I'm here?

660
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,010
He who claims to be noble walks a lonely path.

661
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,600
Not many people have the same ambition.

662
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,650
Even I can't understand

663
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,350
your fate with Nitian Erxing.

664
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,140
I just hope

665
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,880
your wish will come true.

666
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,790
That would be a blessing to the Demon Clan

667
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,360
and the three realms.

668
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,810
The eternal night

669
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,950
is going to end.

670
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,780
I can help you

671
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,010
reunite with your friends.

672
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,690
But before that,

673
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,730
I'll give you six words of advice.

674
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Sir.

675
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,280
I don't know your name yet.

676
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,480
Eternity is coming to an end.

677
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,310
Day and night will return.

678
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,470
The Demon Clan has such a unique taste.

679
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,510
How could they like

680
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,100
such a strange statue?

681
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,540
Beauty.

682
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,350
You're awake, beauty.

683
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,310
Who are you?

684
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,500
Where's Gou?

685
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,320
What dog are you talking about?

686
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,710
Beauty, don't be afraid.

687
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,910
Or else, you won't

688
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,070
look beautiful anymore.

689
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,600
Gou...

690
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,390
The two of us

691
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,950
are looking forward to

692
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,470
trading you for a reward from our lord.

693
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,250
Don't touch me!

694
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,750
Or you'll regret it!

695
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,270
Well,

696
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,430
our lord

697
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,310
loves feisty types like you.

698
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,550
It's most fun

699
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,830
to skin them alive.

700
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,090
Go!

701
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,400
Don't touch me!

702
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,260
Who are you?

703
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,750
Who is it?

704
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,160
Grand Marshal.

705
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,470
[Nitian Erxing]

706
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,280
Coward!

707
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,840
What stupid grand marshal?

708
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,950
If our lord finds out,

709
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,210
he will skin you alive.

710
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,220
We should kill him.

711
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,030
When our lord becomes the grand marshal,

712
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,670
the two of us will gain the most merit.

713
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,870
Go!

714
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,440
A dirty hand

715
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,910
for your lives.

716
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,470
If you dare to commit crimes again,

717
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,840
I'll collect the debt.

718
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,350
Thank you, Grand Marshal.

719
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,450
Thank you, Grand Marshal. Let's go.

720
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,050
Send a message to your lord.

721
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,110
A wise individual would surrender as soon as possible.

722
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,910
Otherwise,

723
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,160
I'll lead troops to destroy Mount Zheluo.

724
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,680
Yes. Yes.
