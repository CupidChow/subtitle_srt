00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,060
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,590
Of course he knows what this is.

5
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,240
Not only that,

6
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,110
but he also knows

7
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,870
the secret of this flower.

8
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,630
The Flower of Dawn

9
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,759
can cure the Petrification Sickness?

10
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,650
What a joke.

11
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,060
Not only is the flower not the antidote,

12
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,630
but the pollen

13
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,950
is actually the root cause

14
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,980
of the Petrification Sickness.

15
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,900
What?

16
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,070
The Grand Marshal has been lying to us.

17
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,840
The Flower of Dawn

18
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,750
is the cause

19
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,430
of the Petrification Sickness.

20
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,350
The Grand Marshal

21
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,110
Nitian Erxing deceived us!

22
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,790
Nitian Erxing deceived us!

23
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,470
No.

24
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,870
That's impossible.

25
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,530
Don't listen to her nonsense.

26
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,350
Impossible?

27
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,670
If it's impossible,

28
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,280
then why would he rather destroy it

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,070
than let you

30
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,750
touch the Flower of Dawn?

31
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,110
If it's impossible,

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,350
then where did the poisonous fog

33
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,150
come from?

34
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,590
Wake up.

35
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,110
There is no antidote

36
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,790
for the Petrification Sickness.

37
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,990
The Grand Marshal

38
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,950
who will save you all

39
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,950
doesn't exist either.

40
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,430
There's only a liar

41
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,579
who is coaxing you all

42
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,150
to be the canon fodder and stepping stone

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,950
for his so-called great cause.

44
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,630
Liar! You liar!

45
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,110
Nitian Erxing, I'm going to kill you!

46
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,829
There is no Flower of Dawn.

47
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,630
Liar! Liar!

48
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,910
You liar!

49
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,870
Liar!

50
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,150
Why did you lie to us?

51
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,550
Why did you lie to us?

52
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,590
Liar!

53
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,550
Liar! Liar!

54
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
Remember,

55
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,410
the truth of the Flower of Dawn can't be exposed.

56
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,030
It's the only thing

57
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,250
giving the Demon Clan the hope to keep living on.

58
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,350
You're just a liar.

59
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,630
Liar! You liar!

60
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,910
You're a big liar!

61
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,630
You are a liar.

62
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,830
You lied to us so horribly.

63
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,710
Why did you harm us?

64
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,310
Liar! Liar!

65
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,640
I said long ago

66
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,040
that you're not reliable.

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,360
You're far worse than your brother.

68
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,370
Without the Flower of Dawn,

69
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,210
what can Little Dragonfly do?

70
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,140
What can my daughter do?

71
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,270
Tell me.

72
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,910
What can my daughter do?

73
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,170
What can she do?

74
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,830
You're right.

75
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,910
I thought

76
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,810
that I preserved the clan's hope.

77
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,500
In reality, I made the whole thing

78
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,150
even crueler.

79
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,670
The tragedy of fate

80
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,790
will not change

81
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,150
because of me.

82
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,909
If it were you...

83
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
What would you do?

84
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,590
If I were you,

85
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,990
I would choose to tell the truth.

86
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,030
But even if I told the truth,

87
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,990
there might not be

88
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,950
a good result.

89
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,870
In this world we live in,

90
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,990
you either conquer or be conquered.

91
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,830
Without realizing it,

92
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,950
we're already covered

93
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,390
in scars.

94
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,530
Grand Marshal,

95
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,910
success

96
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,990
never happens at once.

97
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,670
On the way forward,

98
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,510
the pioneer is never understood

99
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,590
by too many people.

100
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,590
Back then,

101
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,030
in order for

102
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,350
the people of Xin State

103
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,990
to no longer live

104
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,720
as slaves of the Immortal Clan,

105
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,610
my father led a rebellion,

106
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,150
but it resulted in a massacre.

107
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,970
He sacrificed his life

108
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,350
to protect his people,

109
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,470
but do you know

110
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,020
what they said about him?

111
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,390
They called him an unjust king.

112
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,630
They said he disregarded

113
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,200
the lives of the people.

114
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,470
I once felt injustice

115
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,470
for my father.

116
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,310
I also didn't understand

117
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,150
why he made those decisions.

118
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,030
But later, I understood him.

119
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,990
People live

120
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,110
to uphold justice,

121
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:55,790
to have

122
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,230
no shame before heaven and earth,

123
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,630
no regret in one's heart,

124
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,630
and no fear against cruelty.

125
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,190
My father always hoped

126
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,670
that the people of Xin State

127
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,230
could live with dignity.

128
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,070
So, he was able to

129
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,170
have no shame, regret, or fear

130
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,350
until the moment he died.

131
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,330
No shame before heaven and earth,

132
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,590
no regret in one's heart,

133
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,550
and no fear against cruelty.

134
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,040
Grand Marshal,

135
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,910
Xin State was destroyed.

136
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,770
Throughout this entire journey,

137
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,470
I've always kept my parents' teachings

138
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,549
in my heart.

139
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,190
I didn't ally with you

140
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,380
for your clan's power.

141
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,350
Instead, I saw

142
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,870
how insignificant my own strength was.

143
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,970
Since we want to accomplish this,

144
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,630
we must first see

145
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,630
the strength of our opponents,

146
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,260
the insignificance of ourselves,

147
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,920
and the importance of allies.

148
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,710
In the past,

149
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,790
I asked many times before my brother's tomb

150
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,200
about whether truth or hope

151
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,550
was more important.

152
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,870
Now,

153
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,380
I think I know the answer.

154
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,310
Wu Geng,

155
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,630
thank you.

156
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,550
From now on,

157
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,470
I will step down from my position as Grand Marshal.

158
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,070
Grand Marshal!

159
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,930
Grand Marshal,

160
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,110
you devoted your life

161
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,190
for the Demon Clan.

162
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,230
I believe

163
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,630
you must have your reasons

164
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,020
for hiding the Flower of Dawn's truth.

165
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,670
It must be for the good of the Demon Clan.

166
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,660
The truth is in

167
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,670
all of our hearts.

168
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,110
That's right.

169
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,350
Yes, Grand Marshal.

170
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,750
Yes, that's right.

171
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,070
I, Tiexue Wushuang,

172
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,110
only accept you as the Grand Marshal.

173
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,970
Who else can lead us

174
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,910
to attack the Immortal Realm?

175
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,440
Yes.

176
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,070
Make the Demon Clan great again.

177
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,310
Grand Marshal, we believe in you.

178
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,020
I've made up my mind. No need to speak further.

179
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,510
Tomorrow,

180
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,710
I will go to the cemetery

181
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,430
to receive the Whipping Punishment.

182
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,230
At that time,

183
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,830
I'll give you all an explanation.

184
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,800
Good.

185
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,420
Nitian Erxing,

186
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,390
you said it yourself.

187
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,480
Everyone here must be a witness,

188
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,290
lest he goes back on his word.

189
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,400
That's right.

190
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,510
Good.

191
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,370
I'm a man of my word.

192
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,590
I will not go back on my word.

193
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,510
Grand Marshal!

194
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,430
Grand Marshal.

195
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,430
You should be the Grand Marshal.

196
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,150
That's right.

197
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,750
He's here.

198
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,710
You should die!

199
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,020
It's you who brought this disaster to us!

200
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,430
Over these years,

201
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,390
we've always trusted you!

202
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,630
It's been so many years!

203
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,950
Is it how you treat us?

204
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,470
My son died because of you!

205
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,710
Nitian Erxing!

206
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,150
At this point,

207
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,950
why are you still putting on airs

208
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,510
as if you're the same old smug Grand Marshal?

209
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,470
Just take off your clothes so we can whip you!

210
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,710
Stop occupying a post you're not suited for!

211
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,070
Yeah!

212
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,550
The position of Grand Marshal

213
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,340
should've been taken by our lord long ago!

214
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,170
That's right!

215
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,830
Hurry! Hurry!

216
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,570
What are you doing?

217
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,260
Be quiet!

218
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,430
Be quiet!

219
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,990
Be quiet!

220
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,510
The grand marshal assembled you here today

221
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,790
just to give you an explanation.

222
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,590
The harm can't be undone.

223
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,150
What's the point of explaining?

224
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,350
How can he explain it?

225
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,310
Tiexue Wushuang.

226
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,710
Who's gonna believe him?

227
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,430
I'm no longer the grand marshal.

228
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,510
Now I'm just a sinner.

229
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,350
In fact,

230
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,470
it's been a long time since I got the Petrification Sickness.

231
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,070
What?

232
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,190
I'm afraid that my days are numbered.

233
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,750
Petrification Sickness?

234
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,910
He's also infected with the Petrification Sickness.

235
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,830
For one thing, I withheld

236
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,470
the truth about my condition.

237
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,390
For another thing, in order to gather more power

238
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,920
to fight the Immortal Clan,

239
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,510
I used the rumors about them

240
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,270
to confuse you.

241
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,630
Everyone here is listening!

242
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,830
You've admitted all your wrongdoing!

243
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,630
Yeah!

244
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,150
Yeah. What a liar!

245
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,750
Now he's finally admitted it!

246
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,630
Yesterday,

247
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,990
due to my long-standing acts of deception,

248
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,390
the Immortal Clan seized a chance to attack the Demon Realm

249
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,720
with poisonous powder,

250
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,800
which nearly killed everyone in our clan.

251
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,410
According to the rules set by our ancestors,

252
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,070
I, Nitian Erxing,

253
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,530
deserve the Whipping Punishment.

254
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,410
-That's right!
-Yeah!
-Right!

255
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,570
Get it started now!

256
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,790
Receive your punishment!

257
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,650
What is the Whipping Punishment?

258
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,990
The Whipping Punishment

259
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,190
is one of the cruelest penalties

260
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,190
in the Demon Clan.

261
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,790
The complete process of it

262
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,910
includes 81 whips

263
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,070
on the one being penalized.

264
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,200
However, throughout history,

265
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,230
those who were punished this way

266
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,550
all ended up dead

267
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,200
before ten whips were over.

268
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,710
[Tomb of My Late Brother Haikuo Tiankong]

269
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,030
Haikuo Tiankong, I'm sorry.

270
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,030
The lie about the Flower of Dawn

271
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,430
can't continue anymore.

272
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,830
We once vowed to

273
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,390
fight the Divine Clan and kill Hei Long.

274
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,110
But now the Demon Clan

275
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,030
has lost

276
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,360
the strength and courage to move forward.

277
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,490
[Tomb of My Late Brother Haikuo Tiankong]

278
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,190
Haikuo Tiankong,

279
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,950
can you tell me

280
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,510
what I should do?

281
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,710
It can break iron without making a noise!

282
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,710
Haikuo Tiankong,

283
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,640
is the making of this broadsword finally completed?

284
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,750
It has taken 81 days

285
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,590
of burning in flames

286
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,470
and countless times of quenching

287
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,870
followed by shattering and recreating

288
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,110
for this unparalleled treasure

289
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,390
to be shaped.

290
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,190
Man,

291
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,670
remember,

292
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,190
only after experiencing the worst pain

293
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,110
can you start a brand new life.

294
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,720
I believe our Demon Clan

295
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,910
will eventually have a bright future.

296
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,320
Maybe one day,

297
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,510
we'll all be dead.

298
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,110
But our spirit

299
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,480
will be inherited by the next generation.

300
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,990
That's exactly what

301
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,470
makes our Demon Clan stay unbowed forever!

302
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,230
Hurry up! Don't waste time!

303
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,690
Let the punishment begin!

304
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,680
No more dawdling!

305
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,470
Yeah!

306
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,300
What's the dawdling for?

307
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,680
The punishment begins now!

308
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,140
Do it.

309
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,980
Man!

310
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,330
Bravo!

311
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,940
Go on!

312
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,800
Go on!

313
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,910
At this rate, he might die.

314
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,600
I know I've made huge mistakes,

315
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,690
and I'd probably fail to fulfill my older brother's dying wish.

316
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,060
But over the past one hundred thousand years,

317
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,190
we've already suffered great losses.

318
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,630
The Immortal Clan took

319
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,470
the whole beautiful world away from us!

320
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,790
There will be a day

321
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,790
when we get everything back!

322
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,900
Our generation

323
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,920
is beyond redemption,

324
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,320
or hope of survival.

325
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,410
But our next generation still

326
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,480
stands a chance of having a bright future.

327
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,550
I implore you

328
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,440
to keep fighting

329
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,770
despite my wrongdoing!

330
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,910
For the future of the Demon Clan,

331
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,740
we must stand together in solidarity,

332
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,570
to overthrow the Immortal Realm.

333
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,310
That's the only way we can escape from this hellish netherworld!

334
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,300
Man!

335
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,550
Grand Marshal!

336
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,330
Go on.

337
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,190
Go on with it!

338
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,760
Or you'll be punished based on military law!

339
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,030
Keep whipping!

340
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,050
Tiexue Wushuang!

341
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,500
Didn't you hear what the grand marshal said?

342
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,830
Execute the whipping, or you'll be punished based on military law!

343
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,630
Gou,

344
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,830
we don't get a say

345
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,430
in the Demon Clan's affairs.

346
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,590
Tiexue Wushuang,

347
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,470
I know you are

348
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,930
a loyal and upright person

349
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,310
who'd hate to hurt the grand marshal.

350
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,110
But every member of the Demon Clan

351
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,790
would rather uphold justice

352
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,190
than harbor a wrongdoer.

353
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,110
They're all watching this,

354
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,550
and they won't tolerate

355
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,150
you bending the law to protect the marshal!

356
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,950
Young fella,

357
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,870
you're making a scene in the wrong place!

358
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,070
You're in no position

359
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,000
to meddle with our clan's affairs!

360
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,870
Nitian Erxing did do something wrong.

361
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,830
He shouldn't have concealed the truth,

362
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,350
and withheld information.

363
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,230
But if it hadn't been for him uniting the clan members,

364
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,350
ending internal feuds,

365
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,970
and helping you recuperate,

366
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,840
how would you have gotten to where you are now?

367
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,310
The grand marshal has been trying to lead the Demon Clan

368
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,530
to put up a fight against the Immortal Clan,

369
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,390
just in order to

370
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,790
ensure the survival

371
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,670
of your descendants, hasn't he?

372
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,630
However,

373
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,870
you've done nothing

374
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,000
but enjoy the benefits brought by him.

375
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,880
You're repaying his kindness with hatred.

376
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,510
For those of you who still

377
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,770
feel grateful for the grand marshal,

378
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,150
don't you have

379
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,030
a guilty conscience?

380
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,070
Nitian Erxing,

381
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,280
as the grand marshal of the Demon Clan,

382
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,350
you've done a lot for them.

383
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,680
We're all witnesses to your hard work.

384
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,690
But the members of the Demon Clan

385
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,190
would rather see you

386
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,470
being beaten to death

387
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,950
than lend a helping hand.

388
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,590
I don't think they're worthy of your efforts.

389
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,790
Gou,

390
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,750
I appreciate

391
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,230
your kindness.

392
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,630
But you're probably unable

393
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,830
to understand the spirit of the Demon Clan.

394
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,110
For the past one hundred thousand years,

395
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,600
we've been on a strenuous quest filled with blood and tears.

396
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,230
Even dying a hundred times won't change our aspirations!

397
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,110
This is

398
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,440
the nature of all the men in the Demon Clan!

399
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,440
Go on with the whipping!

400
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,960
Tiexue Wushuang,

401
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,670
go on!

402
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,470
Fine.

403
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,590
This is the last time

404
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,250
I'd call you "Grand Marshal"!

405
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,750
Now that you want to die,

406
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,410
I'll make that happen for you!

407
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,980
Nitian Erxing,

408
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,550
you'd rather be killed by me

409
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,230
than die on the battlefield.

410
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,390
You've promised

411
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,440
to lead the demon clan to conquer the Immortal Realm,

412
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,710
and defeat Hei Long,

413
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,710
haven't you?

414
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,590
What about the hope you've been talking about?

415
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,650
What are you gonna do with your brother's dying wish?

416
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,350
Where is your team spirit?

417
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,350
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!

418
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,920
Grand Marshal!

419
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,390
The Grand Marshal

420
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,390
is an indispensable part of our clan!

421
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,830
Grand Marshal, please be our leader!

422
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,120
We'll fight the Immortal Clan till we die!

423
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,290
Yes! We'll fight till we die!

424
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,350
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!

425
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,710
-We stand in solidarity!
-We stand in solidarity!

426
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,790
Grand Marshal!

427
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,060
We'll fight the Immortal Clan till we die!

428
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,870
-That's right!
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!

429
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,360
For the future of the Demon Clan,

430
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,190
you must make united efforts.

431
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,250
You must stay away from the Immortal Clan's instigation.

432
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,440
Only in this way

433
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,990
can the Demon Clan be completely free

434
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,650
of this hellish netherworld!

435
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,350
Yes!

436
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,470
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!

437
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,910
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!

438
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,710
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!
-Grand Marshal!

439
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,380
Wu, Mu has checked my wounds.

440
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,240
I'm fine.

441
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,880
Man...

442
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,620
I really wish I could hate you

443
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,670
for being so committed to the clan,

444
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,930
and for being so impartial and selfless.

445
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,820
Your heart has a spot for everyone,

446
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,190
except yourself!

447
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,950
I hate you for never

448
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,550
responding to my affection.

449
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,740
Why do you always

450
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,350
have to push me away?

451
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,190
Bai Cai

452
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,580
has given me some medicine

453
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,840
that the human race uses to treat wounds.

454
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,750
I'll apply it on you.

455
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,430
You've already

456
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,760
been severely injured.

457
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,790
Why would you still accept

458
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,050
the challenge posed by Qiongxiong Ji'e?

459
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,070
Obviously, he's been meaning to

460
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,750
use that occasion to kill you.

461
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
If I am to convince Qiongxiong Ji'e,

462
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,700
and unite the Demon Clan again,

463
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,580
this is the best opportunity for me to do so.

464
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,560
Man,

465
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,790
you'll definitely lead the Demon Clan

466
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,050
to see sunshine again.

467
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,110
But you don't have to rush

468
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,770
to persuade Qiongxiong Ji'e.

469
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,350
We can discuss with Gou

470
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,590
and make plans.

471
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,440
Plus,

472
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,920
I can help relieve your burden.

473
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,500
Wu,

474
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,600
there isn't much time left for me.

475
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,650
Man,

476
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,720
I know what choice you've made.

477
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,830
The task of leading the Demon Clan to fight immortals

478
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,740
can only be done by you.

479
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,470
But your ultimate enemy will be Hei Long!

480
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,050
Could you promise me

481
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,570
that before the final battle,

482
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,180
you won't get yourself injured again?

483
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,790
I hope

484
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,250
when I return to the beautiful bright world,

485
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,310
I can still see you by my side.

486
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,080
Man!

487
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,280
Qiongxiong Ji'e,

488
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,190
the day I've been waiting for has finally arrived.

489
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,290
Nitian Erxing,

490
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,400
I've chosen today for our match

491
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,590
not because I wanna take advantage of you,

492
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,390
but because your behavior today

493
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,150
has finally

494
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,170
made me find you less contemptible.

495
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,900
Instead of trivial tussles,

496
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,390
let's have a showdown.

497
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,670
First things first,

498
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,820
we're gonna follow the old rules.

499
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,950
Winner takes all.

500
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,350
If you win,

501
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,950
the position of Grand Marshal will be yours.

502
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,500
Good!

503
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,790
Come at me! Do you look down on me or what?

504
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,550
Deadly Wringer!

505
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,630
Are you traumatized by those whips,

506
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,150
or is that Petrification Sickness sneaking up on you?

507
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,410
Is this all you've got?

508
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,230
Then let's bring it on!

509
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,630
Watch my Ferocious Mace!

510
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,540
Extreme-Realm

511
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,660
Night Light Slash!

512
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,240
Have you

513
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,450
actually reached the Extreme Realm?

514
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,390
From now on,

515
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,660
you should call me Grand Marshal.

516
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,840
You'd better not let me down again.

517
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,670
Get out of the way!

518
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,270
Get up!

519
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,860
You don't own this place.

520
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,120
You'd better watch your manners!

521
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,440
Are you kidding?

522
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,150
Half of the Heaven-Breaking Army's soldiers

523
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,430
were brought by me.

524
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,710
Don't I get to sit in this stupid chair?

525
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,840
Qiongxiong Ji'e,

526
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,400
don't you dare

527
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,430
be so smug!

528
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,790
Out all of the people here,

529
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,070
you're the one I most wanna pick a bone with!

530
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,550
-Bring it on!
-Come on!
-Let's fight!

531
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,490
Stop!

532
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,870
To defeat the Immortal Clan,

533
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,470
it's necessary

534
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,230
to form an alliance with the anti-immortal army.

535
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,630
I'm going to say it again.

536
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,300
The key to victory

537
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,620
is unity.

538
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,670
Gou,

539
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,070
you assembled the anti-immortal army.

540
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,950
You tell them.

541
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,790
Nitian Erxing, what do you mean?

542
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,750
You are asking an outsider

543
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,950
to be our commander-in-chief.

544
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,430
I'm not convinced.

545
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,410
Grand Marshal,

546
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,590
this is the Demon Clan's territory after all.

547
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,550
I don't think this is appropriate.

548
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,190
Gou

549
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,790
is a man

550
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,350
who has the divine power of the Colorless Realm.

551
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,210
His power is not weaker than mine.

552
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,390
First, he broke the seal

553
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,450
that trapped the Demon Clan for 100,000 years

554
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,680
to help the Demon Realm see sunshine again.

555
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,160
Then he risked his life to get the Fire Bodhi

556
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,900
to relieve the Demon Clan from the pain caused by the Petrification Sickness.

557
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,860
He is compassionate, loyal,

558
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,260
resourceful, and brave.

559
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,750
He is the perfect person

560
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,230
to lead the anti-immortal army.

561
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,710
Everyone of the Demon Clan,

562
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,970
there's no need for further discussion.

563
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,600
Gou, let's begin.

564
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,150
Everyone,

565
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,150
the people here today

566
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,790
are not only from the Demon Clan,

567
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,250
but also the human race and the Shenyin Clan.

568
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,710
The human race has been threatened

569
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,220
by the Immortal Clan for 100,000 years.

570
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,510
The people have been in misery.

571
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,670
They can only make a living

572
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,310
by excavating bloodstones.

573
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,750
The Demon Clan has also been suppressed

574
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,080
by the Immortal Clan to live underground.

575
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,200
Whether they are old men or children,

576
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,350
every one of the Demon Clan can't see the light throughout their lives.

577
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,150
They've also suffered

578
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,410
the pain of the Petrification Sickness.

579
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,360
The Shenyin Clan

580
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,160
refused to collude with the Immortal Clan

581
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,070
out of their kindness.

582
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,200
They have also been hunted down by the Immortal Clan.

583
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,390
Actually, we gather here today

584
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,030
for the same goal.

585
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,540
That is to attack the Immortal Realm

586
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,790
and kill Hei Long.

587
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,510
To achieve this goal,

588
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,760
the ancestors of the Demon Clan

589
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,430
and Xin King of the human race

590
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,110
have never stopped

591
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,720
fighting against Hei Long.

592
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,390
For the undying vision

593
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,920
over the past 100,000 years

594
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,810
and for our freedom and light

595
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,270
in the future,

596
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,550
we must work together,

597
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,590
trust our companions around us,

598
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,550
and beat up our enemies.

599
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,750
So I, Gou,

600
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,670
am willing to form an alliance with your clans

601
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,990
to fight against the Immortal Clan.

602
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,320
I'm not afraid of death.

603
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,990
When the time is right,

604
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,290
I'm willing to give up everything,

605
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,750
including my life.

606
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,590
Gou, well said.

607
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,980
I admire you.

608
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,380
Impressive.

609
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,210
Fearless of death in order to fight against the Immortal Clan.

610
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,949
Fearless of death in order to fight against the Immortal Clan.

611
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,650
Fearless of death in order to fight against the Immortal Clan.

612
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,310
Fearless of death in order to fight against the Immortal Clan.

613
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,980
Fearless of death in order to fight against the Immortal Clan.

614
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,670
Fearless of death in order to fight against the Immortal Clan.

615
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:27,130
Fearless of death in order to fight against the Immortal Clan.

616
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,000
Lan,

617
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,790
you were a member in the Immortal Realm before.

618
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,060
Tell everyone

619
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,520
about the Immortal Realm.

620
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,469
90,000 years ago,

621
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,840
the Immortal Clan had a fierce battle with the Sea Spirit Clan

622
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,699
in order to capture the Sea Realm.

623
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,870
Eventually, the battle ended

624
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,570
as the first ancestor of the Sea Spirit Clan knocked down the Wuyao Mountain.

625
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,699
The Wuyao Mountain?

626
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,909
What is that place?

627
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,400
Back then, the Immortal Clan

628
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,210
lived on the top of the Wuyao Mountain.

629
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,030
After the first ancestor of the Sea Spirit Clan was defeated,

630
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,750
he used his last bit of strength

631
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,580
to knock down the Wuyao Mountain.

632
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,170
So the current Immortal Clan

633
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,500
lives under the wreckage of the mountain.

634
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,550
And they call it

635
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,760
the Immortal Realm.

636
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,510
So those deities

637
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,210
live in a pile of stones.

638
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,230
The Immortal Realm

639
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,870
is surrounded by a vast sea.

640
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,510
The gate to the Immortal Realm on the sea

641
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,970
is guarded by sea spirits.

642
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,910
They call it

643
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,070
the Lost Sea.

644
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,510
Passing through the Lost Sea,

645
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,620
we'll reach the periphery of the Immortal Realm.

646
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,670
It is the Immortal Clan's biggest place

647
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,470
for battles.

648
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,450
It's called the Ruins on the Sea.

649
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,350
There are many islands there.

650
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,610
The terrain is complicated.

651
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,670
Also, it's the best defensive place

652
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,110
for deities.

653
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,440
In the same area,

654
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,770
there is also the most notorious prison:

655
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,310
the World's End.

656
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,650
Many deities

657
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,770
have been imprisoned there

658
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,390
because they went against Hei Long's will.

659
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,480
Behind the Ruins on the Sea

660
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,770
is the square of the Immortal Realm.

661
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,790
That is the most important

662
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,750
barrier.

663
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,150
Once we break it,

664
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,070
we can go up the Crystal Mountain

665
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,690
and go to the Tomb of Heaven,

666
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,510
where Hei Long lives.

667
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,790
Looks like it's not that impressive.

668
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,870
Let's just fight our way

669
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,730
to the place where Hei Long lives.

670
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,950
Do you think they would

671
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,610
let us arrive there so easily?

672
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,010
There are two central institutions in the Immortal Realm:

673
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,710
Xinyue Kui's Oracle Hall

674
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,130
and Shen Yan's Sage Hall.

675
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,430
The Immortal Realm's six immortals you know

676
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,950
are from

677
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,950
the Oracle Hall.

678
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,490
The Sage Hall has 100 members

679
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,910
and three Great Sages.

680
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,710
Their power

681
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,190
is stronger than that of the six immortals.

682
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,010
So in order to see Hei Long,

683
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,790
we have to defeat them first.

684
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,990
-Well...
-Defeat them?

685
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,950
How?

686
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,270
I don't know.

687
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,310
It's too difficult.

688
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,190
The only route to attack the Immortal Realm

689
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,190
is the sea route.

690
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,860
Grand Marshal, we'll listen to you.

691
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,910
Gou,

692
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,330
what do you think about this route?

693
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,990
If the anti-immortal army

694
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,630
wants to sail on the sea,

695
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,670
we'll need

696
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,630
large and solid battleships.

697
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,670
Back then, Xin State's maritime trade was flourishing.

698
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,070
Many officials

699
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,670
are proficient in navigation and good at shipbuilding.

700
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,630
Although Xin State

701
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,230
has fallen into the hands of Bai State,

702
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,270
I still want

703
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,030
to go back and try my luck.

704
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,680
Okay, it's a deal.

705
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,350
I'll wait for you

706
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,350
to bring us good news from Xin State.

707
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,180
But before this,

708
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,780
I need to meet an old friend first.

709
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,030
Thank you for the medicine.

710
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,340
In the past, on the battlefield of Xin State,

711
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,970
you fought side by side with my father.

712
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,540
Today,

713
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,070
you gave me

714
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,230
the Fire Bodhi, an ancient divine item.

715
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,290
I will never forget

716
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,950
your great kindness.

717
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,510
I'll remember it forever.

718
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,740
Wu Geng,

719
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,320
when you successfully assemble the anti-immortal army,

720
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,800
remember to meet an old friend here.

721
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,230
Undying Bird.

722
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,350
I came as promised.

723
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,150
Please tell me who the old friend is.

724
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,690
Shi Xing?

725
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,430
He's still alive?

726
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,380
That's right.

727
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,550
Shi Xing should have died.

728
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,510
But he fell to my place.

729
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,750
I've been trying to wake him up.

730
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,870
He is stubborn and won't wake up.

731
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:56,990
Let me try.

732
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,880
If I can wake him up,

733
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,870
let him join

734
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,150
our anti-immortal army.

735
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,510
With his divine power,

736
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,140
he will make our strength

737
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,350
stronger.

738
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,740
Just like me,

739
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,270
he has the belief

740
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,070
of overthrowing the tyranny of the Immortal Clan.

741
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,350
Just like Undying Bird,

742
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,200
are you here to persuade me?

743
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,890
Give up.

744
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,860
I? Persuade you?

745
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,910
You were already defeated by me

746
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,530
when you were hit by the Seal of the Dead.

747
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,140
You lost to me.

748
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,480
And the divine power

749
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,360
in your body now

750
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,910
is too weak.

751
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
It won't

752
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,600
be of any help to the anti-immortal army.

753
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,190
Brat,

754
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,790
who did you say is weak?

755
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,920
There are only the two of us here.

756
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,050
Who else could it be?

757
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,460
I'm not weak.

758
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,490
I killed Mingyue myself

759
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,520
and made King's City a lifeless place.

760
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,030
My soul

761
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,950
should be in pain forever.

762
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,480
That's how I can atone for my sins.

763
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,660
In King's City,

764
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,310
you said you couldn't understand the human race.

765
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,110
You laughed at us for being weak.

766
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,630
Now I know

767
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,890
you are actually the weak one.

768
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,230
You know clearly

769
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,830
you did what you did back then

770
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,760
because you were controlled by Xinyue Kui.

771
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,310
It was not what you wanted.

772
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,500
But you've been hiding.

773
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,470
Instead of taking revenge on her,

774
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,470
you are willing to be cursed

775
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,710
and bewitched.

776
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,210
That's because

777
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,130
you don't have the courage.

778
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,620
You don't have the guts!

779
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,950
Stop talking nonsense.

780
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,650
What did you just say?

781
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,280
Atone for your sins?

782
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,350
Actually, it's just

783
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,680
your wishful thinking.

784
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,620
What kind of immortal are you?

785
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,470
You are selfish, stupid, cowardly, and incompetent.

786
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,580
You knew clearly the Immortal Clan

787
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,150
would object to your marriage with Mingyue

788
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,510
and would harm Mingyue,

789
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,300
but you insisted on holding the wedding.

790
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,350
In the end,

791
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,790
Mingyue

792
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,590
and the people of Liusha City died because of you.

793
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,310
This is why you are selfish and stupid.

794
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:41,870
No.

795
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,510
You know the Immortal Clan is the real murderer.

796
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,790
-No.
-But you don't have the guts to take revenge.

797
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,150
You've been using death as an excuse for being freed.

798
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,790
This is why you are cowardly and incompetent!
