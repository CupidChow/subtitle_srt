00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,020
[Burning Flames]

3
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,979
Greetings, Mr. Chen Jing.

4
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,070
What can I do for you?

5
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,150
Gou, this is the Plague Immortal.

6
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,000
That is the prince of Bai State.

7
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,590
I'm pleased to meet Mr. Immortal,

8
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,390
and Your Highness.

9
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,479
They'd like to know

10
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,229
about the man-eating monster.

11
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,470
Tell them now.

12
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,390
The man-eating monster...

13
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,190
Hold on!

14
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,270
You, lift your head up.

15
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,190
Let me see your face!

16
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,990
I seem to have seen you in Bai capital.

17
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,870
Your Highness have seen me before?

18
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,730
That's such an honor for me.

19
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,490
How dare you!

20
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,970
In Bai capital, there was a time

21
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,310
when you and some hateful survivors of Xin State

22
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,910
burned Xin King's dead body.

23
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,790
At that time, I already noticed your resemblance to him.

24
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,790
I put a bounty on you years ago.

25
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,230
It turns out that you've been hiding here.

26
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,030
Guards!

27
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,270
Take him down!

28
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,030
Yes!

29
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,710
Your Highness, have you mistaken me for someone else?

30
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,310
Sir, I'm innocent!

31
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,730
How dare you play dumb?

32
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,630
Chen Jing,

33
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,950
Godfather,

34
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,670
take a closer look at him.

35
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,020
Doesn't he look

36
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,630
strikingly similar to Xin King's son

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,790
Wu Geng?

38
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,860
I did once see the face

39
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,750
of the defiant king's unruly son.

40
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,829
But it was a long time ago.

41
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,520
I can't recall much about him.

42
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,470
Nonetheless, I'm sure

43
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,400
this boy didn't use to be a prince.

44
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,350
Look what a lowlife he is!

45
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,280
In the past, he set fire

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,590
to Xin King's dead body.

47
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,140
-Those detestable survivors of Xin State were...
-Your Highness!

48
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,200
It was my fault.

49
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,750
It was all my fault.

50
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,130
It was me who did that.

51
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,190
Being greedy and foolish,

52
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,920
I tried to make profits out of a dead man.

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,430
Otherwise, why would I have burned that dead body?

54
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,500
That said, I can assure you

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,829
that I'm not a vile survivor of Xin State,

56
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,310
or Xin King's son.

57
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,670
I am

58
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,750
willing to spend the rest of my life in the mine

59
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,060
digging bloodstones

60
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,600
so as to make amends for my wrongdoing.

61
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,710
I-I hope Mr. Chen Jing,

62
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,510
Mr. Immortal, and Your Highness

63
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,260
can spare my life.

64
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,820
Please spare my life!

65
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,510
Please spare my life!

66
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,560
Your Highness,

67
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,190
look at this boy. He's just a coward who's afraid of death.

68
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,670
He has nothing in common with Xin King.

69
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,790
How could they be father and son?

70
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,740
Qiao,

71
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,130
back then, that evil concubine of Xin King's

72
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,300
and her rebellious son

73
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,510
both died in flames.

74
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,310
You witnessed that.

75
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,190
Besides, the High Priest was there too.

76
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,230
There couldn't have been a mistake, right?

77
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,840
It's not that. He...

78
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,710
Your Highness,

79
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,550
it's not unusual for two people to look alike.

80
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,670
I swear allegiance to Bai State,

81
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,830
and the Immortal Clan.

82
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,750
I would never harbor a wicked survivor of a previous dynasty

83
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,230
in my mine.

84
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,630
Your Highness,

85
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,010
I implore you to make a fair judgment.

86
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,830
This young man has been

87
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,670
doing hard labor here for four years.

88
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,830
If he had

89
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,430
colluded with the vile survivors of Xin State

90
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,030
to steal Xin King's body,

91
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,810
then he should work

92
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,740
in this mine till he dies.

93
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,230
Isn't that the best way

94
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,940
to punish him?

95
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,530
But letting him live is an act of mercy he doesn't deserve.

96
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,610
Instead of killing a man,

97
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,440
making his life a living hell

98
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,980
is much crueler.

99
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,310
Mr. Immortal is right.

100
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,930
Your Highness,

101
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,830
this young man

102
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,909
now has become a centurion in the mine.

103
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,150
The output of bloodstones here

104
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,030
has improved,

105
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,830
and part of that success is attributed to him.

106
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,110
If we kill him,

107
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,630
I'm afraid the excavation of bloodstones will be hindered.

108
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,750
Why don't we make the most of his usefulness?

109
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,270
We'll have him

110
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,950
work in the mine till he dies,

111
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,850
and contribute his whole life to the Immortal Clan.

112
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,710
Given what Master has said,

113
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,710
this time, I won't kill you.

114
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,850
Thank you, Your Highness!

115
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,350
Thank you, Mr. Immortal!

116
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,790
Thank you, Mr. Chen Jing!

117
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,730
Get up.

118
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,160
Now tell the story about the man-eating monster.

119
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,190
Yes.

120
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,830
About a month ago...

121
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,940
Search around!

122
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,510
Now in the mine,

123
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,790
not a day passes without people feeling panicked.

124
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,390
They go out in pairs or groups,

125
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,710
as they're afraid of being left alone,

126
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,550
and captured by

127
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,010
that man-eating monster.

128
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,370
It's just a lousy deceptive trick

129
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,990
designed to bewilder people!

130
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,740
Godfather,

131
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,590
if the mine is indeed haunted by a monster,

132
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,160
the output of bloodstones might be affected.

133
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,350
Anyway, I'm going to stay here

134
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,420
for a while.

135
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,740
Why not let me

136
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,070
investigate this man-eating monster?

137
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,150
What do you think?

138
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,890
Chen Jing,

139
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,510
what's your opinion?

140
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,190
Your Highness is brilliant.

141
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,280
I'm sure

142
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,760
the man-eating monster will be caught soon.

143
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,810
However,

144
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,390
if Your Highness have an accident during the investigation,

145
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,110
the consequences will be too grave for me to bear.

146
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,970
How about this?

147
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,150
I'll let Gou be Your Highness's aide.

148
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,490
Gou,

149
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,840
should anything happen to His Highness,

150
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,480
I'll hold you accountable!

151
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,910
Yes.

152
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,470
Sir, let's go back and take a rest.

153
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,710
Gou!

154
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,830
I don't care who you are,

155
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,840
or what you had done

156
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,159
before you came here.

157
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,190
This is the Northern Mountain Mine,

158
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,150
and you're a slave here now.

159
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,830
Just focus on your job as a slave.

160
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,990
I hope for nothing

161
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,870
but an opportunity to lead a peaceful life

162
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,350
with my son Zhazha.

163
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,580
If anyone dares

164
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,850
to ruin my son and my

165
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,270
quiet life,

166
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,150
I'll show no mercy to that person.

167
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,870
Sir, don't worry.

168
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,270
I promise not to cross any boundaries,

169
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,120
or irritate Prince Zhou Qiao.

170
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,310
Plus,

171
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,770
tell all the young boys and girls

172
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,240
in the mine

173
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,310
to avoid Immortal Gui Mu.

174
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,550
If he requests to meet you young people alone,

175
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,020
do not go.

176
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,510
Understood?

177
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,270
Understood.

178
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,670
The man-eating monster is here!

179
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,270
It's over there! Go after it!

180
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,300
It's running that way!

181
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,430
Go after it!

182
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,070
Don't let it run away!

183
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,810
Your Highness,

184
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,030
now it's already dark.

185
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,610
Why don't we

186
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,020
look for the man-eating monster tomorrow?

187
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,850
Tonight, we're here

188
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,070
to pick someone for Godfather.

189
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,390
The hunting for the man-eating monster

190
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,670
is just an excuse.

191
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,940
It's over there! Go!

192
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,910
You can't get away!

193
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
You're dead meat!

194
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,430
This isn't over yet!

195
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,750
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

196
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,410
Scram!

197
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,670
It...

198
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,710
Pick up the sword!

199
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,550
Let's go!

200
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,500
He's back! He's back!

201
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,950
I had so much fun today.

202
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,910
I taught Zhou Qiao

203
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,550
a good lesson.

204
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,780
How is it now?

205
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,180
Have you sent away

206
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,280
those six miners?

207
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,190
I guess they've left the mountain by now.

208
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,030
During this period of time,

209
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,470
we've helped more than 100 miners escape.

210
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,190
It's so smart of you to come up with

211
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,720
this idea of inventing a man-eating monster.

212
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,390
There you go.

213
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,880
It does look quite lifelike.

214
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,310
How are we gonna call this monster?

215
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,370
What about

216
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,840
"man-eating monster"?

217
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,650
The man-eating monster!

218
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,920
The man-eating monster is here!

219
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,590
Go over there. Follow me! Run!

220
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,830
This way, run!

221
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,110
The exit

222
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,910
is in the forest behind the mine.

223
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,290
When you get out, run towards the south,

224
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,750
and cross through a swamp.

225
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,000
You'll reach a nearby town in two days.

226
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,300
Be careful when you're on the road. Don't let others see you.

227
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,360
Remember to cover your slave stamps.

228
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,370
Spare my life! Don't eat me!

229
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,520
Please don't kill us!

230
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,220
It's Gou!

231
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,980
Go now, guys!

232
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,630
Let's go! Thank you!

233
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,190
Run!

234
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,790
Gou,

235
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,270
what are we gonna do here?

236
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,030
We're faking a man-eating monster.

237
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,110
At least there should be some evidence of its man-eating activities.

238
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,030
Sorry, guys.

239
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,880
I'm afraid I have to

240
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,960
borrow something from you.

241
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,390
Now everyone is convinced

242
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,750
that there's a man-eating monster.

243
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,180
Next time, I'd like to send

244
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,590
more people away in just one attempt.

245
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,050
There won't be a next time.

246
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,870
Why?

247
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,630
Why?

248
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,350
There are visitors from the Immortal Clan.

249
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,950
I don't think our little stunt

250
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,150
can deceive them.

251
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,090
If we keep this going,

252
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,860
none of us will be able to leave.

253
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,590
As time goes by, there will be more danger.

254
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,950
All of you should leave tonight.

255
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,890
What about you?

256
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,950
I'll finish what we started here

257
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,750
first,

258
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,990
and then go find you.

259
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,830
I'm gonna stir up trouble in this mine

260
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,190
to distract those guys

261
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,550
from the case about the missing miners.

262
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,270
No.

263
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,410
We'll leave together no matter what.

264
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,170
Yeah.

265
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,630
I'll be fine.

266
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,710
Don't worry.

267
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
I've got everything under control.

268
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,710
Alright. You guys should go now.

269
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,600
Come on.

270
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,620
What kind of man will I be

271
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,930
if I leave a close friend in danger? I'm gonna stay.

272
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,760
Me too!

273
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,510
Are you sure?

274
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,640
We'll stay with you no matter what.

275
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,390
Okay.

276
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,740
Bai Cai,

277
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,870
come on, do me a favor.

278
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,310
Pull it out.

279
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,480
What is it for?

280
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,310
Don't shiver.

281
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:47,990
What are you doing?

282
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,910
Hold it tight.

283
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,750
Gou!

284
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,430
-Gou!
-Gou!
-Gou!

285
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,070
We'd better complete the show we've put on.

286
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,710
The most important scene is coming up.

287
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,870
So the man-eating monster talked to you?

288
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,590
It even asked you to give me a message,

289
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,350
saying that if I didn't close the mine,

290
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,030
it would turn this place into a total mess,

291
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,240
right?

292
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:23,910
Yes.

293
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,760
The man-eating monster

294
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,950
is so brutal.

295
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,390
I saw it

296
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,140
eat a miner.

297
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,710
I tried to stop it,

298
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,230
but I couldn't fight him off.

299
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,990
I ended up being injured by the monster.

300
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,510
Then,

301
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,030
it wanted to eat me too.

302
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,510
Luckily, Bai Cai and the guys came

303
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,750
to my rescue.

304
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,990
If we had arrived later,

305
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,250
Gou might have been...

306
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,910
Being outnumbered by us,

307
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,640
the man-eating monster immediately ran away.

308
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,310
It left that message

309
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,630
before it fled.

310
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,900
We all heard it.

311
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,780
Yeah. We all heard it!

312
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,950
The man-eating monster

313
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,230
actually speaks human language.

314
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,670
Since Gui Mu came to the mine,

315
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,610
the man-eating monster

316
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,530
has appeared more frequently.

317
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,470
Could there be a connection

318
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,130
between these two incidents?

319
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,920
Father!

320
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,150
Father!

321
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,460
Zhazha!

322
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,870
What's wrong?

323
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,030
Why the long face?

324
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,670
Who has upset you?

325
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,870
I'll teach him a lesson for you!

326
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,200
That lousy prince is a good-for-nothing!

327
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,830
Zhazha,

328
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,620
mind your language.

329
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,290
Why don't you

330
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,730
let me hunt for that man-eating monster?

331
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,230
Zhazha,

332
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,560
that man-eating monster is very fierce.

333
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,310
As a kid,

334
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,790
you aren't able to defeat it.

335
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,750
I hate that stupid curse

336
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,550
cast by the Immortal Clan!

337
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,230
That's why I can never grow up!

338
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,070
Father,

339
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,770
if you ever say I'm a kid again,

340
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,040
I'll be mad at you!

341
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,890
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

342
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,540
I shouldn't have brought it up.

343
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,990
I won't do it again.

344
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,400
Please don't be mad.

345
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,589
Although I haven't grown any taller,

346
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,109
I've indeed become stronger.

347
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,579
Yes. Sure. You're so strong.

348
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,069
Father, please let me do it.

349
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,349
Now every day, you're busy

350
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,190
teaching that lousy prince about qi cultivation.

351
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,369
You wouldn't spend time with me anymore!

352
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:18,910
I know...

353
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,470
Since that man-eating monster appeared,

354
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,349
you've even forbidden me to go to the woods!

355
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,990
I'm being bored to death!

356
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,829
Don't be mad.

357
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,910
Please don't be mad, Zhazha.

358
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,150
It turns out that Zhou Qiao

359
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,510
came here to learn qi cultivation.

360
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:28,950
Father,

361
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,670
just let me take a few guards out

362
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,580
to catch that man-eating monster. I'm so bored!

363
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,620
Zhazha, my baby,

364
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,790
how about this?

365
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,710
After these few days of hectic work,

366
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,910
we'll have a fun outing together, okay?

367
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,230
Never mind!

368
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,270
Maybe I should go and play

369
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,910
with Uncle Gui Mu

370
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,440
whose limbs are all broken.

371
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,270
Zhazha, did I grasp you too hard?

372
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,260
It hurts!

373
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,630
Let me see.

374
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,950
What has Uncle Gui Mu

375
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,070
told you?

376
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,550
Nothing.

377
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,830
Nothing?

378
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,030
That'd be great. Great.

379
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,470
Zhazha, listen to me.

380
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,550
Whatever Uncle Gui Mu says to you,

381
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,340
do not buy

382
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,630
a word of his.

383
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,110
Don't go anywhere with him.

384
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,910
Just try to avoid him. You got it?

385
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,310
Why, Father?

386
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,030
Because...

387
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,390
Because Uncle Gui Mu

388
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,710
is a grump.

389
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,670
Look how naughty you are.

390
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,870
I'm afraid

391
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,350
that if you irritate him,

392
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,190
he'll spank you!

393
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,430
The very thought of Zhazha being in touch

394
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,230
with Gui Mu terrifies Chen Jing.

395
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,470
There must be a secret behind this.

396
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,350
Well...

397
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,610
I wanna go hunting in the mountain tomorrow!

398
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,510
Okay. I agree.

399
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,230
Just take some more guards with you tomorrow.

400
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,340
Really?

401
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:47,950
Really.

402
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,670
I'll be going hunting in the mountain!

403
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,650
I'll be going hunting!

404
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,900
Gou,

405
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,070
now that you've been injured,

406
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,710
you can rest for a few days,

407
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,260
and take a short leave from work.

408
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,190
Take him away.

409
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,790
Slowly. Be careful.

410
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,790
Godfather, Chen Jing has started teaching me

411
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,050
about qi cultivation.

412
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,130
All you can think about

413
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,530
is learning qi cultivation from Chen Jing.

414
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,150
Do you know

415
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,180
how many days it's been since I last got any nutrition?

416
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,390
Now I'm just clinging to life.

417
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,270
Godfather, last night, if it hadn't been for

418
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,190
that man-eating monster's sudden appearance,

419
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,910
I would've got you

420
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,070
a human to eat.

421
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,190
Godfather, don't worry.

422
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,510
I'll go to the mine again,

423
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,570
and find you a prey.

424
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,490
This girl seems to be the perfect candidate.

425
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,090
Godfather, rest assured.

426
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,930
I'll definitely bring her

427
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,390
to you.

428
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,510
Good boy.

429
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,670
Cheer up.

430
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,870
I'm not feeling pain at all.

431
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,770
Look!

432
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,510
I'm fine, aren't I?

433
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,110
This is all just an act.

434
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,770
You could've just

435
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,790
covered yourself with some blood.

436
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,550
Why must you stab yourself?

437
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,950
We were trying to fool Chen Jing and Gui Mu.

438
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,710
If we hadn't made things look real,

439
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,030
how could we have deceived them?

440
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,650
Then you should've

441
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,990
told me about that in advance.

442
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,940
I was holding that knife.

443
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,110
What if it had gone too deep in you?

444
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,530
What if I had endangered your life and...

445
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,730
Keep your voice down.

446
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,950
Just don't worry.

447
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,670
We still have

448
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,470
the divine medicine given by the Old Man, don't we?

449
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,110
Even if the knife had pierced through my back,

450
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,820
as long as I could still breath,

451
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,630
I believe

452
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,760
that divine medicine would revive me.

453
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,360
The divine medicine...

454
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,190
Counting on that divine medicine now, aren't you?

455
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,770
What are you doing?

456
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,110
Are you afraid that I might die?

457
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,190
I sure am!

458
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,030
If you die,

459
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,170
who am I gonna beat up when I get angry?

460
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,830
That's what you're worried about?

461
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,030
What else could it be?

462
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,860
Where did you

463
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,830
get this thing?

464
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,990
What do you mean?

465
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,310
I made it myself.

466
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,670
As it turns out,

467
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,540
what you've been secretly working on

468
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,910
is this thing. Right?

469
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,340
Now I'm sternly warning you.

470
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,400
Do not risk your life

471
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,390
to do anything again.

472
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,060
You can't achieve anything great if you lose your life.

473
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,750
Only when you're alive can you...

474
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,390
Alright. Stop it.

475
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,350
I understand.

476
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,510
How come you're behaving

477
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,440
the same as my mom when she's young?

478
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,550
Come on. Try it on.

479
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,950
Right now?

480
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,580
What do you think? Does it fit?

481
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,590
It fits.

482
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,510
I've finally caught you.

483
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,910
You're such a fat bunny!

484
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,610
Today, I'm gonna have

485
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,100
roast rabbit with Father!

486
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,180
Who are you? Stop running!

487
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,790
Young Master!

488
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,050
-Young Master, don't go!
-Young Master!

489
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,470
-It's a monster!
-A monster!

490
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,300
Your Highness,

491
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,830
you saw that, right?

492
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,670
It's what we call qi.

493
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,870
The key to qi cultivation

494
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,590
is to control the invisible qi

495
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,150
surrounding you,

496
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,870
and to let them form a shape.

497
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,710
As each cultivator's talent varies,

498
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,750
the qi he or she gathers

499
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,950
will be presented in a different shape.

500
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,630
It can be a weapon like a knife,

501
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,670
a mountain, or a creek.

502
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,240
Those who have mastered the skill

503
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,150
can turn qi into things that are identical to what we see in real life.

504
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,950
Your Highness, give it a try.

505
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,430
Okay.

506
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,350
Alright.

507
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,830
Your Highness, no need to rush.

508
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
When you get the gist of it,

509
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,390
I believe

510
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,570
you'll make great progress quickly.

511
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,070
Sir!

512
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,150
Sir!

513
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,550
Sir!

514
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,550
The young master has been captured by the man-eating monster!

515
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,350
What?

516
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,780
Young Master Zhazha,

517
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,710
you've been hanging here for a long time, haven't you?

518
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,230
You're in agony, right?

519
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,360
I'll get this out of your mouth.

520
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,110
Gou, help me!

521
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,680
Help me, Gou! Now!

522
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,390
Help you?

523
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,430
It took me much effort

524
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,790
to finally catch you.

525
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,850
Why would I

526
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,040
let you go so easily?

527
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,350
Oh! It's you who kidnapped me!

528
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,190
You're the man-eating monster!

529
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,090
Young Master, you're brilliant.

530
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,390
It's no wonder Mr. Chen Jing

531
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,680
loves you so dearly.

532
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,890
Now, I bet Mr. Chen Jing

533
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,870
must be in a panic

534
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,640
about your disappearance.

535
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,040
How dare you lose my son Zhazha!

536
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,430
No penalty than death

537
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,890
is more suitable for you!

538
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,350
Set me free now!

539
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,110
Listen, Gou.

540
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,390
If you let me go,

541
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,850
I can spare you from death.

542
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,000
Otherwise, when my father finds you,

543
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,820
you'll die miserably!

544
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,710
Really?

545
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,680
However, as I heard, Mr. Chen Jing

546
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,900
is being punished by the Immortal Clan,

547
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,790
and is prohibited from leaving

548
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,120
the Northern Mountain.

549
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,340
What a coincidence!

550
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,110
This place

551
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,230
happens to be away from the Northern Mountain.

552
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,470
How is he supposed to come find you?

553
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,950
Gou, you...

554
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,070
Mr. Gou,

555
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,990
please let me go.

556
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,030
If you do that,

557
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,000
I'll ask my father to give you a promotion.

558
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,530
Don't even bother.

559
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,760
After suffering from all your bullying,

560
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
who would believe anything you say?

561
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,060
Gou, I'm so sorry.

562
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,580
I was wrong to bully you.

563
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,340
Please forgive me.

564
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,030
Just let me go, Mr. Gou.

565
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,960
Apologizing to me now, aren't you?

566
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,630
Besides me,

567
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,630
what about the other slaves?

568
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,470
You let the White Tiger bite whoever it wanted.

569
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,110
You shot arrows at the slaves for fun

570
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,630
as if they were targets for archery.

571
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,030
You even lied and abetted your father in punishing the slaves.

572
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,490
It'll take days and nights

573
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,910
for me to count the evil deeds

574
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,840
you've done!

575
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,310
Mr. Gou won't let me go!

576
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,310
Father! Father!

577
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,070
Come help me, Father!

578
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,480
Alright. Stop crying!

579
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,510
You're making so much noise!

580
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,750
Father!

581
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,620
I can let you go,

582
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,270
provided

583
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,350
that you memorize the following statement.

584
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,720
If you can remember it by heart,

585
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,150
I'll set you free.

586
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,860
Okay! Okay!

587
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,150
"From now on, I will treat the slaves

588
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,190
politely.

589
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,430
I won't insult, or yell at them.

590
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,750
I will be a merciful man."

591
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,870
I'll come again tomorrow.

592
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,110
When I see you again,

593
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,710
I need you to recite what I said 100 times.

594
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,790
I-I haven't memorized it!

595
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,050
Haven't memorized it?

596
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,640
Do whatever it takes to memorize those words!

597
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,270
It's time to jangle your father's nerves a bit.

598
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,270
You! Tell everyone my command!

599
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,150
Search every corner of the Northern Mountain

600
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,790
to find my son!

601
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,640
Plus, from this moment on,

602
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,230
the mine will be on lockdown!

603
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,200
All the slaves

604
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,470
must stay in the caves they sleep in,

605
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,710
and never come out!

606
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,340
Yes!

607
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,100
Mr. Chen,

608
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,670
locking down the Northern Mountain Mine now

609
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,530
isn't appropriate, is it?

610
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,670
What's not appropriate about it?

611
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,750
If the bloodstones can't be submitted as scheduled,

612
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,410
you'll be in serious trouble.

613
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,550
Previously, due to that man-eating monster,

614
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,410
I was forced to lock down the mine.

615
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,300
I-I don't care what this is gonna cost me!

616
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,390
Now nothing is more important

617
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,710
than saving my son!

618
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,560
Are you really giving priority

619
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,790
to your son over the Immortal Clan's bloodstones?

620
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,070
This is the Northern Mountain Mine.

621
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,200
I have the final say!

622
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,550
Go! Speed up!

623
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,650
What is this about?

624
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,430
That man-eating monster

625
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,530
has once shown up in the mine.

626
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,730
Now these people are planning

627
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,150
to feed it with our flesh!

628
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,920
Hurry up! No more dawdling!

629
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,710
Your Highness, here she is.

630
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,230
You may leave now.

631
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,730
Is your name Bai Cai?

632
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,320
What do you want?

633
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,390
I have a question for you.

634
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,550
About your friend Gou,

635
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,730
is he Wu Geng?

636
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,000
What are you talking about?

637
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,270
Gou is an orphan.

638
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,600
We've been living together all along.

639
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,160
Don't you lie to me!

640
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,760
Why would I lie to you?

641
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,950
I'm telling the truth.

642
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,630
I don't know who you're talking about.

643
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,230
He's the prince of Xin State,

644
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,710
and the son of Xin King!

645
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,510
Have you recalled anything?

646
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,330
Tell me!

647
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,150
You're really mistaken!

648
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,330
On the day when Xin State was conquered,

649
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,990
Gou was with me the whole time.

650
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,590
Look what a wretch he is.

651
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,210
He's by no means a prince!

652
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,870
You're still lying for him, aren't you?

653
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,590
Slaves die in the mine on a daily basis.

654
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,950
It's really common.

655
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,070
Tell the truth now,

656
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,180
or you'll be tortured to death

657
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,860
in a million ways.

658
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,960
Fine, I'll say it!

659
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,430
It's true

660
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,630
that Gou burned Xin King's body that day,

661
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,830
but he only did it for money.

662
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,860
What could he possibly have to do with the royalty?

663
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,350
If you had

664
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,790
told me the real truth,

665
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,130
I could've let you live longer.

666
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,630
Guards!

667
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,920
Take her to the secret chamber.

668
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,890
-Yes!
-Yes!

669
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,830
Shitou!

670
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,650
Gou, that man has gone far.

671
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,030
Everyone, I have something to say.

672
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,240
Please come here.

673
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,910
-Come on, guys!
-Come!

674
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,560
Come on now.

675
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,490
Gather around.

676
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,230
There's something

677
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,310
I need to tell you.

678
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,350
In fact,

679
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,310
we've been faking the man-eating monster.

680
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,600
Faking it?

681
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,510
Why?

682
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,560
We've dug a tunnel

683
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,270
leading to the outside world.

684
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,010
We planned to escape alone,

685
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,630
but we just couldn't bear the thought

686
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,230
of all of you suffering here.

687
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,310
So we came up with an idea

688
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,110
of faking a man-eating monster.

689
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,790
Those who you're assuming

690
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,190
to have been eaten

691
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,790
have actually been sent away by us.

692
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,590
That's great!

693
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,890
What's all this noise about?

694
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,430
Are you so thrilled about having a day off

695
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,230
that you need to be disciplined?

696
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,050
Gou!

697
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,710
Gentlemen,

698
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,160
let me tell you about it.

699
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,310
Just now, we gathered

700
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,510
for a chat.

701
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,480
Then,

702
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,630
we actually came up with

703
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,150
a good plan

704
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,870
to find Young Master Zhazha.

705
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,070
Really?

706
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,310
What's your plan?

707
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,430
Tell us about it.

708
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,820
At this point,

709
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,910
whoever manages to find Young Master Zhazha

710
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,510
will be thought highly of!

711
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,030
Look,

712
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,150
I'm gonna tell you the plan.

713
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,150
Come here.

714
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,830
Hurry up!

715
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,350
Hurry! Carry them in!

716
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,190
Be quick!

717
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,190
Shitou!

718
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,030
Lead the way.

719
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,430
Sure.

720
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,990
De, get everyone out of here. Now!

721
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,840
Guys, go faster. Follow me!

722
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,070
Keep up with me!

723
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,670
Godfather,

724
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,350
I've brought you

725
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,570
the girl you laid your eyes on.

726
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,240
Who are you?

727
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,070
What is this place?

728
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,630
How dare you not know

729
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,550
I am the marvelous Immortal Gui Mu?

730
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,420
You ignorant slave!

731
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,250
But it doesn't matter.

732
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,060
Soon you'll become

733
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,390
a delicious dish.

734
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,460
A dish?

735
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,500
Yes.

736
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,020
A dish for me.

737
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,710
I will eat every

738
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,409
bone of yours.

739
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,389
I'll nibble your flesh, and drink your marrow.

740
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,060
Why aren't you trying to run away?

741
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,010
Why aren't you trying to run away?

742
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,469
Do you not fear me?

743
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,790
What's the use of fearing you?

744
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,860
Contemptible immortals like you

745
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,710
have no respect for human lives whatsoever!

746
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,870
I know you want to see me

747
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,110
tremble with fear,

748
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,389
to frighten me, to torture me,

749
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,110
and to kill me!

750
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,040
I won't give you the satisfaction!

751
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,750
Qiao!

752
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,830
We've got a brave slave here.

753
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,710
Gou,

754
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,710
the survival of the slaves in the mine

755
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,070
are now hinging on you.

756
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,950
I can't be with you on this journey anymore.

757
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,640
It's almost done. Let's go.

758
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,790
Come on. Let's go.

759
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,550
Go!

760
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,430
This is the taste I enjoy.

761
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,030
Godfather,

762
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,750
what is this?

763
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,720
Qiao,

764
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,990
this time,

765
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,890
you've brought me

766
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,260
a precious gift!

767
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,630
Hurry! Hurry up!

768
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,310
Go home, guys!

769
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,350
Keep going. Go!

770
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,830
We're finally out of the mine!

771
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,270
We made it!

772
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,070
We're finally free!

773
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,750
Just go, guys!

774
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,960
We're out of the mine!

775
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,750
Keep going!

776
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,430
Go now!

777
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,950
Let's go!

778
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,860
Gou! Gou!

779
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,750
Bad news!

780
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,750
Bai Cai has been

781
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,810
taken away by the prince of Bai State!

782
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,580
Tell me!

783
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,590
What spell did you just cast?

784
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,260
Tell me about it!

785
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,360
If you dare to come near me again,

786
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,120
I'll show you what I've got!

787
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,310
Sounds good.

788
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,390
Try me, I dare you!

789
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,450
The Fire of Chaos.

790
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,600
Why is there

791
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,620
a curse mark of our Immortal Clan's?

792
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,080
Are you okay?

793
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,600
What despicable immortal is that?

794
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,180
I can't believe he'd eat humans!

795
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,070
For the sake of his own cultivation,

796
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,210
he's actually been feeding on living humans!

797
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,810
How dare he call himself an immortal?

798
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:38,570
Bah!

799
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,390
You are

800
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,870
a vile animal!

801
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,450
It seems like the King of Immortals is being too kind to you,

802
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,590
so you've forgotten the duty you're born with,

803
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,850
lowly slaves!

804
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,750
Immortals

805
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,990
let you live in this world

806
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,960
so that you can be our servants.

807
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,570
What's wrong with eating a few of you?

808
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,590
Bai Cai,

809
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,630
I'll try to stall them.

810
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,030
Once you catch an opportunity,

811
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,290
just run to the tunnel.

812
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,310
Do you think I'll leave you behind

813
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,710
and run away alone?

814
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,870
Fine.

815
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,950
Let's stick together for better or worse.
