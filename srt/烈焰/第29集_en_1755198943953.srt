[Episode 29]

4
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,310
Xinyue Kui.

5
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,910
You underestimated

6
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,270
how much Bai Cai trusted in me.

7
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,400
This is the first mistake you've made.

8
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,509
Good.

9
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,830
Very good.

10
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,110
Neat trick.

11
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,360
You've learned to play your enemy's game.

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,500
But so what?

13
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,270
So what?

14
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,170
I'll attack the Immortal Realm

15
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,910
and bring down all the people in power

16
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,110
like you!

17
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,070
Wu Geng.

18
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,430
You challenged me and lured me into this game.

19
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,540
Even now, you're still overplaying your hand.

20
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,270
Can you alone take on

21
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,630
four Grand Immortals?

22
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,430
Alone?

23
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,670
I, Wu Geng, fight for the world.

24
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,150
So people from all over the world will gather together to help me.

25
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,950
This

26
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,370
is the second mistake you've made.

27
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,310
Enough trash talk.

28
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,060
Zhui Ri.

29
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,730
What are you doing?

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
It was not me.

31
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,300
Grand Marshal, it's good to see you again.

32
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,310
We played your game

33
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,360
and will stick together to the end.

34
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,230
We've been ready.

35
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,870
The trap has been laid.

36
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,300
It turns out that Zhou Qiao is your minion.

37
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,870
Xinyue Kui.

38
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,390
If Zhou Qiao hadn't tipped you off

39
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,190
and told you

40
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,900
that everything was ready,

41
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,800
you wouldn't have graced us with your presence.

42
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,580
Wu Geng is going to pay tribute

43
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,940
to his parents before the palace?

44
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:39,860
Yes.

45
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,750
[Tomorrow]

46
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,040
He'll do it at noon the day after tomorrow.

47
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,670
One movement triggered another,

48
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,430
and they were all meticulously planned.

49
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,820
Wu Geng.

50
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,560
You've finally grown up.

51
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,700
You showed solid leadership

52
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,240
and great strategic brilliance.

53
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,040
Wu Geng.

54
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,930
It's my honor

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,560
to be your friend.

56
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,540
Uncle Ziyu.

57
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,740
Grand Marshal.

58
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,030
Today,

59
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,790
we finally have a chance

60
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,680
to avenge our families

61
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,790
and friends.

62
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,710
Shi Xing?

63
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,440
You're still alive?

64
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,070
In burning flames,

65
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,710
I gained time.

66
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,050
Compared to the pain at that time,

67
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,830
death

68
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,390
is nothing.

69
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,870
Wu Geng.

70
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,520
Looks like you miscalculated too.

71
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,150
Shi Xing.

72
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,110
Wu Geng defeated you in the King's City.

73
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,570
It was such a humiliation.

74
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,670
Don't you want to settle the score with him?

75
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,270
You're right.

76
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,430
There are scores

77
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,070
that must be settled.

78
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,030
There are promises

79
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,990
that must be fulfilled.

80
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,590
Xinyue Kui.

81
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,360
No evil deed

82
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,380
goes unpunished.

83
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,390
Shi Xing, let me remind you.

84
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,670
You're the son of the King of Immortals.

85
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,550
What?

86
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,190
Are you going to fight against the King of Immortals

87
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,300
with the human race?

88
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,310
The person I am now

89
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,440
is no longer the son of the King of Immortals.

90
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,270
I'm just a homeless man

91
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,110
who's full of hate and has forgotten

92
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,990
his name.

93
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,510
Are you doing all this

94
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,050
just for that lowly human Mingyue?

95
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,940
Xinyue Kui.

96
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,870
You've been in power in the Immortal Realm for too long.

97
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,870
Humans' love,

98
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,590
humans' friendship,

99
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,110
humans' resilience,

100
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,429
humans' wisdom,

101
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,900
you won't understand any of them.

102
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,480
Today,

103
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,350
you guys will pay

104
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,830
for Mingyue's death with your lives.

105
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,030
The Demon Clan now declares war on the Immortal Clan.

106
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,870
High Priest Xinyue Kui.

107
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,230
Today,

108
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,630
your death

109
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,400
will mark the start of this war.

110
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,390
Xinyue Kui.

111
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,870
You're malicious

112
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,640
and have committed too many sins.

113
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,070
You hurt my mother

114
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,670
and oppressed the human race and the Shenyin Clan.

115
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,130
You used the Flower of Dawn

116
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,110
to trample on the Demon Clan.

117
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,660
Today,

118
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,630
all the people who have been hurt by you

119
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,690
have gathered here

120
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,200
to kill you themselves.

121
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,280
Brother, don't make any more mistakes.

122
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,310
Bai Cai.

123
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,670
I'll deal with Xinyue Kui.

124
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,070
You shall use the Air Vanishing Spell

125
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,390
to evacuate those left in the palace

126
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,710
to a safe place.

127
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,920
Okay. Rest assured.

128
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,720
Xinyue Kui.

129
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,900
At this point,

130
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,310
I can only say you're stewing

131
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,740
in your own juice.

132
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,590
You're dead!

133
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,190
Zhui Ri, stop fighting.

134
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,670
Don't make more mistakes.

135
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,710
We're all your kinsfolk.

136
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,390
You betrayed the Immortal Clan.

137
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,070
We're enemies.

138
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,710
The Immortal Clan these days

139
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,990
is rotten to the core.

140
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,840
You know that better than I do.

141
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,070
I don't like their way of doing things either.

142
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,170
But if the Immortal Clan is overthrown,

143
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,810
the three realms will definitely be thrown into chaos.

144
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,010
You're trying to change the status quo,

145
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,330
but have you thought about the future?

146
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,510
The human race

147
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,060
will rule in place of the Immortal Clan.

148
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,120
Can't different clans live in peace?

149
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,870
Must there be a ruler?

150
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,100
For hundreds of thousands of years,

151
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,510
the Immortal Clan has been leading the human race.

152
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,190
Upon the downfall of the Immortal Clan,

153
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,710
humans will be at a loss.

154
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,260
For too long,

155
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,750
the Immortal Clan has been

156
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,730
giving themselves too much credit.

157
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,750
Actually, without the Immortal Clan,

158
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,710
humans can still thrive.

159
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,260
It's meaningless

160
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,910
to go on with this topic.

161
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,110
Clan Leader,

162
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,170
he can't be reasoned with.

163
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,000
Talking to him is a waste of time!

164
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,720
Only by beating him to a pulp

165
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,310
can he realize that he's wrong.

166
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,790
I already defeated you,

167
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,510
yet you still have the guts to challenge me.

168
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,280
Ziyu.

169
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,510
You're just a human now.

170
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,630
You should know better

171
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,270
than to challenge an immortal.

172
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,470
You're right.

173
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,410
I made a mistake.

174
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,710
I was too confident.

175
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,240
To defeat the six Grand Immortals,

176
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,070
I should've gone all out.

177
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,080
So you didn't go all out?

178
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,130
What are you talking about?

179
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,590
Immortals never get tired

180
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,310
because they have divine spirit.

181
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,230
And my sword

182
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,590
is designed to counterbalance divine spirit.

183
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,600
When this sword is drawn,

184
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,060
humans and immortals become equal.

185
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,200
I was supposed

186
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,100
to use this sword to fight Hei Long.

187
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,070
But today,

188
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,390
I'll use it

189
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,870
to kill you first.

190
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,170
Sky Burning Flames.

191
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,330
Hey, you.

192
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,950
Don't worry.

193
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,030
For the sake of your sister,

194
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,980
we'll show you mercy.

195
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,900
Show me mercy?

196
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,829
Do you know what you're talking about?

197
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,790
You've exhausted your divine spirit

198
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,510
and can't conjure Assassination Butterflies anymore, right?

199
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,770
You're wrong, Zhui Ri.

200
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,560
I called back my Assassination Butterflies

201
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,230
because I didn't want them to get hurt by accident.

202
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,030
By accident?

203
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,270
Do you still dare

204
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,000
to use the Power of Thunder now?

205
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,160
I do.

206
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,550
I can't do it without hurting him.

207
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,480
Zhui Ri!

208
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,840
Shi Xing.

209
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,690
I once said

210
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,070
you had every reason

211
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,190
to surpass me.

212
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,000
I've been looking forward to seeing that.

213
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,270
But now, you're not capable enough.

214
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,230
If you can't defeat me,

215
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,390
your wishes

216
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,200
will never come true.

217
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,310
You're a bigot.

218
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,960
No matter how many people like you stand in my way,

219
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,030
I'll crush you all.

220
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,890
I swear,

221
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,290
I'll send you to hell myself.

222
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,840
Immortal technique:

223
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,230
Mountain Breaking Punches.

224
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,720
This is not enough.

225
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,860
Mountain Breaking Punches

226
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,380
is an attacking technique that leaves the fighter defenseless.

227
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,060
This is my last chance.

228
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,140
Shi Xing.

229
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,670
Well down.

230
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,750
You've completely surpassed me.

231
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,120
It's inevitable.

232
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,900
Only one of us

233
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,900
can live.

234
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,530
I came back

235
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,470
with only one goal.

236
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,310
What you've spent your whole life defending

237
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,930
is what I have to destroy

238
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,150
at the risk of my life.

239
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,820
This way,

240
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,820
I can

241
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,420
pay you

242
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,140
what I owe you.

243
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,460
You're not paying me back.

244
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,400
I'm taking it back myself.

245
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,710
Godfather.

246
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,070
You've gotten tired

247
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,600
of this place, haven't you?

248
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,870
How about I take you out

249
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,600
to see something interesting?

250
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,870
What do you think?

251
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,850
So much blood.

252
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,030
Move.

253
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,270
Move!

254
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,880
Move.

255
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,820
Keep moving.

256
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,020
High Priest.

257
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,540
-High Priest, help me!
-Move!

258
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,180
High Priest, help me!

259
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,650
High Priest.

260
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,810
Godfather.

261
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,240
Look at you.

262
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,260
You're making me feel sorry for you.

263
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,960
Qiao.

264
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,540
Qiao.

265
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,470
I'm your godfather.

266
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,260
Have I ever done you wrong?

267
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,590
Have I, Qiao?

268
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,970
I'm your godfather.

269
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,790
Wu Geng.

270
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,750
I, a prince,

271
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,410
have always been lucky.

272
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,510
Whoever I chose to side with

273
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,150
always ended up winning.

274
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,390
When I destroyed Xin State,

275
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,820
I chose the right side.

276
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,340
Then I bet that you could beat Gui Mu.

277
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,070
I was right again.

278
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,550
Today,

279
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,950
I'll make another bet.

280
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,070
I bet on you!

281
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,680
His divine spirit is delicious.

282
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,270
Zhou Qiao, what can you get

283
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,070
from doing this?

284
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,310
Have you forgotten what Shi Xing said just now?

285
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,930
You can't understand

286
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,550
humans' thoughts at all.

287
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,070
Be patient.

288
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,990
Gui Mu has died.

289
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,030
You'll die very soon too.

290
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,070
After we kill you,

291
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,310
Hei Long will be the next.

292
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,000
Wu Geng.

293
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,990
You can finally

294
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,590
take your revenge today.

295
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,390
Wu Geng!

296
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,560
Don't be easy on her.

297
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,790
Is Wu Geng really destined

298
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,990
to be the death of the King of Immortals?

299
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,770
No.

300
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,940
No.

301
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,660
[Xuanfeng Great Sage]

302
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,730
[White Lotus Great Sage]

303
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,270
You see?

304
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,990
I told you that fighting and killing

305
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,120
are the most boring.

306
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,030
Look.

307
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,750
It's a total mess.

308
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,480
How is this going to end?

309
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,290
Over the years,

310
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,830
I've never been to the Central Plain.

311
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,320
As far as I remember,

312
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,630
I've never met a slave

313
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,670
who has no respect for immortals at all.

314
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,230
These slaves are very special.

315
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,430
It's only been a few years

316
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,230
since the last human rebellion.

317
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,360
It seems that

318
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,470
Xinyue Kui has difficulty

319
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,200
controlling the mortal realm.

320
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,430
It may threaten

321
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,290
the safety of the Immortal Realm.

322
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,990
Grand Elder.

323
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,160
Shi Xing has turned against the Immortal Clan.

324
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Gui Mu and Tian Kui have been killed.

325
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,560
Only half of the six Grand Immortals are still alive.

326
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,790
Now, it seems

327
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,430
they'll be killed too.

328
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,700
If all the six Grand Immortals died,

329
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,760
the King of Immortals would be upset.

330
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,910
It's time for Sage Hall

331
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,770
to intervene.

332
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,870
Where's Zhen Chan?

333
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,240
He's so undisciplined.

334
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,600
I won't take action unless he does.

335
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,550
I hate fighting.

336
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,760
Xuanfeng Great Sage, White Lotus Great Sage.

337
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,640
Go down to clean up the mess.

338
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,820
Do we have to do it?

339
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:21,910
Yes, Grand Elder.

340
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,390
Yes, Grand Elder.

341
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,810
Stop struggling, Xinyue Kui.

342
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,460
Look at the people around me.

343
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,990
Every one of them has suffered a lot

344
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,030
because of you.

345
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,630
Every one of them

346
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,540
has lost their families

347
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,330
because of the Immortal Clan.

348
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,430
No matter how insignificant each of us is,

349
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,470
when we team up,

350
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,950
we can be invincible.

351
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,910
You immortals

352
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,150
are all too arrogant

353
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,550
to see this power.

354
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,720
This is the last mistake

355
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,430
you've made.

356
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,590
King of Immortals.

357
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,890
I've done my best.

358
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,230
Xinyue Kui.

359
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,030
It's your turn!

360
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,270
Zhui Ri! Zhui Ri!

361
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,270
Air Vanishing Spell?

362
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,469
This is not the Air Vanishing Spell.

363
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:41,070
It's much faster than the Air Vanishing Spell.

364
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,110
I have no intention to be your enemy.

365
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,430
I just need to bring High Priest

366
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,910
back to the Immortal Realm.

367
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,710
Guys,

368
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,150
can you do me a favor and let us leave?

369
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,370
The divine power of the Colorless Realm?

370
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,960
Unfortunately,

371
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,230
you're still not strong enough.

372
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,430
Are you sure it's wise to turn your back to your enemies like this?

373
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,280
You're taking on the wrong guy.

374
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,700
I just need to bring her back.

375
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
I'm not the one you need to deal with.

376
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,790
The petals are poisonous.

377
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,260
It's the divine power of the Earth Realm.

378
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,060
It's the White Lotus Great Sage.

379
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,940
[White Lotus Great Sage]

380
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,350
Did you just say

381
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,210
you want to take down Hei Long?

382
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,480
I appreciate your courage.

383
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,790
But I can tell you this:

384
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,270
if the gap between the six Grand Immortals

385
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,870
and us Great Sages

386
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,710
is like that between a baby and a strong man,

387
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,470
then the chasm between us Great Sages

388
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,700
and Hei Long

389
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,070
is like that between an ant and a giant.

390
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,600
I'm not trying to scare you.

391
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,750
The divine power of the Earth Realm.

392
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,260
Dead Spiritual Energy.

393
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,950
All the creatures

394
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,150
that have ever flourished on this land

395
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,630
will eventually die.

396
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,750
Their remains have to rot

397
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,670
before returning to dust.

398
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,550
Dead Spiritual Energy

399
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,190
makes use of that rotten power.

400
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,880
However,

401
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,510
when you're targeted

402
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,630
by this power,

403
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,950
you'll have to die.

404
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,270
Humans.

405
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,110
I'm an immortal.

406
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,490
If I let you live,

407
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,670
you'll live.

408
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,390
If I want you dead,

409
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,630
you'll die.

410
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,510
Enough, White Lotus.

411
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,950
Come back.

412
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,180
Grand Elder.

413
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,270
I can't stop now.

414
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,590
Great Sages

415
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,790
kill people in one strike.

416
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,750
We don't get into fights

417
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,530
like slaves.

418
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,470
That's beneath us.

419
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,590
You're right.

420
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,940
I don't need to be so serious

421
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,370
about these slaves.

422
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,050
I'll remember all of you.

423
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,150
I'll watch you from afar

424
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,710
as you struggle,

425
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,190
lose hope,

426
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,730
and die.
