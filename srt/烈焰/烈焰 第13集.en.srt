[Episode 13]

4
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,470
Don't run around.

5
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,030
Wu Dong. Wu Xia.

6
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,789
Take the villagers this way.

7
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,990
Hurry up!

8
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,830
Go!

9
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,790
Hurry!

10
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,230
Hurry!

11
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,630
Mother, wait for me.

12
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,310
Gou. Bai Cai.

13
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,750
Get out of here first.

14
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,430
Shenyin Village is too dangerous now.

15
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,230
Immortals from all the six tribes

16
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,390
are all coming at us.

17
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,190
Help me evacuate the villagers.

18
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,430
I'll go see an old friend.

19
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,110
Maybe I can

20
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,750
buy you some time.

21
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,470
Let's go.

22
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,570
Father.

23
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,579
Long time no see.

24
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,070
You traitors

25
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,430
finally fell into my hands.

26
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,350
The six tribes of the Immortal Realm.

27
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,550
I, Tai Ji,

28
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,710
finally get to

29
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,550
lash out today.

30
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,990
Take the villagers away.

31
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,790
I'll find a way to distract them.

32
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,710
Let's go!

33
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,910
Run!

34
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,270
Help!

35
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,510
Are you hurt?

36
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,450
No.

37
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,909
Bai Cai, take them to

38
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,840
hide in Yun Zhongzi's wine cellar.

39
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,870
Protect yourself.

40
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,510
Okay.

41
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,860
Wu Dong, Wu Xia, come with me.

42
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,030
-Okay.
-Letâ€™s go.

43
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,870
Hurry up.

44
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,350
Go!

45
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,750
Tian Kui.

46
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,480
This is a reunion of me and my daughter.

47
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,340
Maybe you should stay out of this.

48
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,040
Tai Ji Immortal-Killing Formation.

49
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,510
Father, what a grand gesture.

50
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,010
I knew you'd come,

51
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,790
so I made

52
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,050
a little preparation.

53
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,200
I wonder

54
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,870
if the most outstanding High Priest of the Immortal Realm, Fu Xi,

55
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,580
has ever foreseen

56
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,750
his ending today?

57
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,110
Go after her!

58
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,110
Phantom Clone.

59
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,260
Such a simple trick.

60
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,790
Only those three idiots

61
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,920
would fall for this.

62
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,550
Go.

63
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,720
The human race also knows how to use divine power?

64
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,960
Interesting.

65
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,960
Interesting indeed.

66
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,070
Master.

67
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,880
After the Great Swordsman,

68
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,030
I haven't met

69
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,530
a mortal with such great martial skills for a long time.

70
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,030
Gou!

71
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,740
Gou!

72
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,280
Gou!

73
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,510
Fragile mortals.

74
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,650
So vulnerable.

75
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,390
Kui.

76
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,470
Do you still remember

77
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,370
the way of tea-tasting that I taught you?

78
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,780
Yes.

79
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,070
I remember everything

80
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,150
you taught me back then,

81
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,150
Father.

82
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,980
At this point,

83
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,780
you still don't get it.

84
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,540
Forget it.

85
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,430
Try this first tea.

86
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,650
Deep down,

87
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,920
you're like this tea cup,

88
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,900
both black and white.

89
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,410
Only you can decide

90
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,050
what kind of immortal you want to become.

91
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,490
How does this first tea taste?

92
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,070
It's bitter and astringent.

93
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,230
It tastes terrible.

94
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,070
What on earth are you up to?

95
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,990
You even activated

96
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,870
the Tai Ji Immortal-Killing Formation.

97
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,870
It can't just be for

98
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,730
having a cup of tea with me, right?

99
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,530
The way of tea-tasting

100
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,790
is similar to the way of cultivation.

101
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,390
At first, it's boring and bitter.

102
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,110
But you

103
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,950
were never willing to

104
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,280
lay the foundation well since childhood.

105
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,230
You only wanted to slack off and take shortcuts.

106
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,880
So,

107
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,600
it's understandable that

108
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,970
you don't like this first tea.

109
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,590
Here.

110
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,230
Try the second tea.

111
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,030
No need.

112
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,950
I can drink it myself.

113
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,350
In your eyes,

114
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,170
of course nothing about me is satisfactory.

115
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,390
I'm not even a bit as obedient and sensible

116
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,750
as your second daughter.

117
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,300
So how does this second tea taste?

118
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,700
It's even more bitter.

119
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,510
That's right.

120
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,410
On the way of cultivation,

121
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,790
it's like making the boat go against the current. If you stop moving forward, you'll go back.

122
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,910
Even if you get through

123
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,240
the bore and bitterness at the beginning,

124
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,260
you will still face bigger challenges.

125
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,110
Enough.

126
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,760
The one who's willing to hear your empty words

127
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,510
is already gone.

128
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,950
It's your turn

129
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,030
to taste my tea.

130
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,790
You...

131
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,099
Why are you...

132
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,190
Do you want to ask

133
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,510
why I know the Tai Ji Immortal-Killing Formation

134
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,109
that you created?

135
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,030
Of course

136
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,369
it was my good sister who taught me that.

137
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:28,230
I just shed a few tears,

138
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,070
and my kind little sister

139
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,070
taught me everything

140
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,380
that you taught her

141
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,590
unreservedly.

142
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,280
It's a great pity that my kind little sister

143
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,990
turned into ashes on Zhaixing Pavilion.

144
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,800
Enough!

145
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,470
If it weren't you who taught her

146
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,830
that all beings are equal,

147
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,300
saying that the Immortal Clan

148
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,230
shouldn't enslave the human race,

149
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,830
how would she have gone to the mortal clan

150
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,630
and fallen in love with a mortal?

151
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,390
You, Fu Xi,

152
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,230
are the real murderer

153
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,790
who killed Xinyue Hu.

154
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,830
Don't forget

155
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,630
what your sister was practicing

156
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,790
was also the major skill of the Kongshi Realm.

157
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,590
All of this

158
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,590
was her own choice.

159
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,150
And she paid for it.

160
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,060
What about you?

161
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,160
You've been practicing the forbidden curse.

162
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,630
It'll come back to bite you sooner or later.

163
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,870
Are you ready for that?

164
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,790
I've been doing this for the Immortal Clan.

165
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,390
You were the High Priest back then,

166
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,430
yet you did nothing.

167
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,110
You never prioritized the interests of the Immortal Clan,

168
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,790
claiming that

169
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,270
all beings in the three realms are equal.

170
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,070
That's why you framed me?

171
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,110
Father.

172
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,720
What you did wrong is

173
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,550
you shouldn't have disobeyed King of Immortals' order.

174
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,470
You were the noble High Priest of the Immortal Clan,

175
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,870
yet you spoke for the despicable human race.

176
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,230
No wonder King of Immortals got angry.

177
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,950
You must be punished.

178
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,430
And your position of High Priest

179
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,630
will be taken by me.

180
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,020
What on earrth did you say to Hei Long?

181
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,920
You have no right to know.

182
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,550
Kui.

183
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,090
I'm the High Priest of the Immortal Clan.

184
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,070
I only accept the judgment from the sage hall

185
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,030
given by Immortal Grand Elder.

186
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,510
Without the orders of Hei Long and Immortal Grand Elder,

187
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,560
you have no right to punish me.

188
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,790
Is that so?

189
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,630
It's my fault

190
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,950
for not teaching you well back then

191
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,880
that you end up being like this now.

192
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,470
In that case,

193
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,690
I'll be the one to stop you.

194
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,670
Do you know what the difference is

195
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,230
between you and your younger sister?

196
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,580
It's not about the level of cultivation,

197
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,410
nor how much effort you put into it.

198
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,270
The thing is

199
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,590
no matter what happened to your younger sister,

200
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,990
she never complained.

201
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,710
But you

202
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,870
only know to blame others.

203
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,070
You can never compare to her.

204
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,490
Only I can deal with him.

205
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,180
This is getting more and more interesting.

206
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,390
I have something even more interesting

207
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,390
prepared for you.

208
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,400
This is my latest

209
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,510
secret weapon,

210
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,310
Taboo Cannon.

211
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,780
Taboo Cannon?

212
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,330
Is there anything great about it?

213
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,060
Although it looks ordinary,

214
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,190
it is extraordinarily powerful

215
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,750
with my explosive powder.

216
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,170
Even the Immortal Clan

217
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,990
can't withstand it.

218
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,350
So, can we

219
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,270
make a bunch of these Taboo Cannons?

220
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,190
In this way,

221
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,410
we won't have to be afraid of the Immortal Clan anymore.

222
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,070
Mr. Yuan Yi,

223
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,470
do you have any concerns?

224
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,910
Any destructive

225
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,240
invention and creation

226
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,730
will eventually become tools of war.

227
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,910
I don't want the Taboo Cannon

228
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,040
to become like that.

229
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,030
I'm afraid I don't agree.

230
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,650
I think weapons

231
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,270
can both be used to kill

232
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,790
and

233
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,570
to protect people around you.

234
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,990
Promise me.

235
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,350
Don't use it

236
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,270
unless there's no other option.

237
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,630
More importantly,

238
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,370
don't let it become a tool of war.

239
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,450
Mr. Yuan Yi.

240
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,420
Your secret weapon

241
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,270
is finally coming in handy.

242
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,310
Master.

243
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,210
You're too badly injured.

244
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,710
I'm okay.

245
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,540
Is Shi Xing dead?

246
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,510
The Taboo Cannon is too powerful.

247
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,470
Even the divine power of the Golden Warrior Realm

248
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,600
can't withstand it.

249
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,230
Even Shi Xing had 10 lives,

250
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,470
he wouldn't have been able to withstand it.

251
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,270
Gou.

252
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,830
Gou, are you okay?

253
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,870
I'm okay.

254
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,010
What about you?

255
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,350
Lan.

256
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Let's go.

257
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,510
Okay.

258
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,110
Come on.

259
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,390
What is that?

260
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,490
He was already blown to pieces,

261
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,150
but he survived.

262
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,710
It feels so good.

263
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,110
It's been a long time

264
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,040
since I last felt this kind of pain.

265
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,500
Are you worried about that brat

266
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,790
who escaped from the mine?

267
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,210
You think you're so smart.

268
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,170
By the way,

269
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,640
I forgot to tell you something.

270
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,630
Do you know Wu Geng?

271
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,310
He's my sister and Xin King's

272
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,790
bastard son.

273
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,990
Before sister committed self-immolation,

274
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,270
she stabbed a dagger into his heart.

275
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,910
That little bastard cried

276
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,070
and begged his mother

277
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,590
not to kill him.

278
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,910
In the end, he was burnt into ashes

279
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,240
with my sister.

280
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,590
Everyone,

281
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,290
including the Immortal Clan,

282
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,470
is convinced that

283
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,230
the little bastard is dead.

284
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,460
Now that the entire Xin King's family is dead,

285
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,350
no one in this world

286
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,140
can threaten Hei Long anymore.

287
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,910
You can go back

288
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,970
and report to your King of Immortals.

289
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,400
You're from the human race,

290
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,030
yet you can control divine power.

291
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,110
It seems that

292
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,940
you have other powers in you.

293
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,510
Come on.

294
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,260
Show me your full power.

295
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,910
Gou!

296
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,280
Gou!

297
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,620
Gou!

298
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,370
Don't worry.

299
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,230
I won't kill him.

300
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,030
Brat.

301
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,670
You must remember the pain you're feeling now.

302
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,810
You have to take revenge on me.

303
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,440
You have to hate me and kill me.

304
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,350
If you can't kill me,

305
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,550
I will torture you to death.

306
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,010
Gou!

307
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,070
Gou! Gou!

308
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,240
Let her go!

309
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,150
Come at me if you dare!

310
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,030
You care about her so much?

311
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:43,820
Good.

312
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,070
I'd like to see

313
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,150
how you can save her.

314
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,490
Could this power be

315
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,690
the divine power of the Colorless Realm?

316
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,590
I didn't expect a mortal

317
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,190
could have such power.

318
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,750
This is the retribution of divine power.

319
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,480
If you can't control yourself,

320
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,230
your body will explode.

321
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,120
Gou!

322
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,460
I can't control it!

323
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,350
Gou!

324
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,850
Control yourself!

325
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,390
Gou!

326
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,510
Wu Geng activated divine power?

327
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,590
The divine power reversed

328
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,310
and is swallowing his body.

329
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,110
Mentor, you shouldn't

330
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,970
have taken the human race's side.

331
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,350
Mentor.

332
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,270
Are you trying to

333
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,670
take us all down with you?

334
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,690
You raised Soul-Devouring Spirits?

335
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,390
Kui, you...

336
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,390
What did you sacrifice

337
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,270
to them?

338
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,220
I...

339
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,470
I sacrificed

340
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,610
my Eye of Prophecy.

341
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,130
Are you insane?

342
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,940
Are you insane?

343
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,150
The Eye of Prophecy is the most important thing

344
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,480
to every priest.

345
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,780
How could you have sacrificed it?

346
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,790
So unrepentant.

347
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,630
Since you betrayed the Immortal Clan,

348
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,830
return the Eye of Prophecy!

349
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,870
Kui, don't make any more mistakes.

350
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,790
Enough!

351
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,530
Kill me.

352
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,679
Kill me.

353
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,690
Mentor.

354
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,000
Why do you have to be like this?

355
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,460
My dear father.

356
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,710
I never wanted to kill you.

357
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,830
I just want to see

358
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,190
what secret is hidden

359
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,500
in your Eyes of Prophecy?

360
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,470
I see it.

361
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,710
I see.

362
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,830
So the brat

363
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,750
you saved from the mine

364
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,210
is my sister's son,

365
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,570
the prince of Xin State, Wu Geng.

366
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,980
I knew he's still alive.

367
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,510
You want to destroy your eyes

368
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,230
just to protect

369
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,830
my sister's son.

370
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,910
Father.

371
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,790
Do you love Xinyue Hu that much?

372
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,790
What about me?

373
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,460
I'm also your daughter.

374
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,870
Have you ever loved me?

375
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,490
As the High Priest of Immortal Clan,

376
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,330
I won't be like you.

377
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,300
I won't let

378
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,750
a traitor's son off.

379
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,310
Kui... Kui...

380
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,100
Fu Xi.

381
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,870
You'd better live long enough

382
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,140
to see

383
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,540
your most despised daughter,

384
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:46,140
I, Xinyue Kui,

385
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,510
become the greatest priest

386
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,790
in Immortal Clan's history.

387
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,160
Take him back to the Immortal Realm

388
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,470
and throw him into the World's End.

389
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,290
Your life

390
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,870
is over.

391
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,710
Wu Geng.

392
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,530
Your Divine Activation was a failure.

393
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,310
One of your arms is broken.

394
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,510
You're a cripple now.

395
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,230
How can you

396
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,470
be my opponent?

397
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,190
If you want to kill me,

398
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,390
it's not too late to do it now.

399
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,070
I won't kill you.

400
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,910
I'll wait until you come to kill me

401
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,860
when you become stronger.

402
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,910
She's the one who inspired your Divine Activation.

403
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,110
Now I'll take her away.

404
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,870
You need to improve your cultivation

405
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,220
to the highest level

406
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,810
and come to King's City to find me.

407
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,150
If you don't come to me,

408
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,270
I will kill her.

409
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,690
Let her go!

410
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,210
Gou!

411
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,150
Are you okay?

412
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,460
It seems

413
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,030
I missed a great show.

414
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,840
We meet again.

415
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,560
I'll kill

416
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,530
whoever wants to kill him.

417
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,120
King of Immortals wonâ€™t let you off.

418
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,970
My life has been a living hell.

419
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,820
I've had enough of it.

420
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,590
I'll wait for him

421
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,900
to come and take my life.

422
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,150
You lunatic!

423
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,690
Brat.

424
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,870
Remember what I said.

425
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,430
I'll wait for you in King's City.
