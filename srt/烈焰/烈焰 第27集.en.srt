[Episode 27]

4
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,509
Shi Xing's death

5
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,729
already disgraced

6
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,720
the Immortal Clan.

7
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,150
High Priest,

8
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,229
let me go to the mortal realm to check it out.

9
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,160
There's no rush.

10
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,640
We can wait a little longer.

11
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,140
The most interesting thing

12
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,509
has already happened.

13
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,070
You mentioned your mother just now.

14
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,400
But my Gou

15
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,950
has never had a mother.

16
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,470
Do you understand now?

17
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,750
It seems your Gou

18
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,950
is hiding many things from you.

19
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,810
So you are the mysterious person.

20
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,829
You're a member of the Immortal Clan.

21
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,190
You're Gou's enemy.

22
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,790
But I'm not your enemy.

23
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,230
You can trust me.

24
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,840
You saved me

25
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,630
and helped me.

26
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,070
I trust you.

27
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,650
The divine spirit feels so familiar.

28
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,860
I can't believe this hairpin

29
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,570
still contains

30
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,130
my sister's divine spirit.

31
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,230
I didn't expect

32
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,930
he'd give his mother's thing

33
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,230
to you.

34
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,710
Of course.

35
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,070
Gou trusts me the most.

36
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,880
I believe that.

37
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,360
But

38
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,630
sincerity

39
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,630
is like the moon in the sky.

40
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,900
The moon is still the same moon.

41
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,670
But it's hard to say

42
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,470
whether it's a new moon

43
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,310
or a full moon.

44
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,470
It's even harder to say

45
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,829
how sincere he is to you.

46
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,410
You didn't know

47
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,990
he had a mother until today,

48
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,829
right?

49
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,640
Then do you know

50
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,750
who his mother was?

51
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,270
You must have realized it.

52
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,510
Such a valuable thing

53
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,350
couldn't belong to an ordinary woman.

54
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,750
Let me tell you.

55
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,120
This hairpin

56
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,230
belonged to Xinyue Hu,

57
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,150
Queen of Xin State.

58
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,160
As for your Gou,

59
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,270
he's actually

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,130
the prince of Xin State,

61
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,390
Wu Geng.

62
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,200
Bai Cai, thank you.

63
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,680
Without your cooperation,

64
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,010
I couldn't have saved Zhou Fa,

65
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,210
nor could I have foiled

66
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,280
Gui Mu's scheme

67
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,190
and saved our people.

68
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,190
Really?

69
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,320
I've always been cooperative.

70
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,480
Our people?

71
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,140
They should be your people,

72
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,940
Prince Wu Geng's people, right?

73
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,230
Why was I so stupid?

74
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,670
Why did I always believe

75
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,990
that you were Gou?

76
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,190
From now on,

77
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,790
should I call you Gou

78
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,180
or Prince Wu Geng?

79
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,990
I'm Wu Geng, and I'm also Gou.

80
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,120
Really?

81
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,390
Then tell me

82
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,150
where my Gou is!

83
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,350
So, Gou

84
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,550
will never come back,

85
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,370
right?

86
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,480
Bai Cai.

87
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,040
I should have

89
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,750
told you everything earlier.

90
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,670
Don't

91
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,990
say sorry to me.

92
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,070
I...

93
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,310
I should apologize

94
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,310
to Gou.

95
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,150
Actually,

96
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,900
I've been noticing something.

97
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,150
But I dared not think about it

98
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,550
or face it.

99
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,300
I even lied to myself

100
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,860
that you were my Gou.

101
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,630
The Northern Mountain Mine, the Shenyin Clan,

102
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,320
King's City, and the Demon Realm.

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,270
All this time,

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,720
I didn't

105
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,140
ask you.

106
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,140
Tell me.

107
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,630
Tell me how sad my Gou

108
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,070
must be.

109
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,790
He must have been blaming me

110
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,070
for mistaking someone else

111
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,990
for him.

112
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,510
Bai Cai.

113
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,430
It's me.

114
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,600
I am your Gou.

115
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,110
No! No!

116
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,910
You two are different.

117
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,550
You're Prince Wu Geng.

118
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,740
You're above

119
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,830
everyone else.

120
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,990
You saved the slaves in the mine

121
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,520
and the people of Bai State.

122
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,590
You even saved

123
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,520
the immortals of the Shenyin Clan.

124
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,950
You're burdened with the hatred of losing your country and family.

125
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,750
You're responsible for the life of everyone in the world.

126
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,480
You will rebel against the Immortal Clan one day!

127
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,790
But what about my Gou?

128
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,590
My Gou was silly.

129
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
He couldn't do martial arts.

130
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,870
He wasn't resourceful.

131
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,909
He just

132
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,680
relied on me wholeheartedly.

133
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,900
He couldn't do anything without me.

134
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,450
But...

135
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,300
But I lost him.

136
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,190
Bai Cai.

137
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,830
Don't touch me!

138
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,750
Listen to me.

139
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,830
I can tell you

140
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,790
everything.

141
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,230
I won't hide anything from you anymore.

142
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,560
I also hope

143
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,740
you can accept every part of me.

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,050
I can't accept you!

145
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,000
I can't.

146
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,120
Sorry. Let's...

147
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,909
Let's both calm down.

148
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,350
Is there any other way

149
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,190
to keep my father alive?

150
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,720
Unfortunately,

151
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,190
he has completely lost the will to live.

152
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,110
Qiao.

153
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,750
Let me die.

154
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,670
Father.

155
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,140
Qiao.

156
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,710
Father.

157
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,390
Qiao.

158
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,850
What do you want to say?

159
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,510
Father, don't worry.

160
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,320
I will do my best

161
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
to maintain Bai State's dignity.

162
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,450
I won't let any outsider see your body.

163
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,390
Father,

164
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,110
Gui Mu's scheme has been foiled.

165
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,910
The people of Bai State are fine.

166
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,470
Father, are you trying to tell me

167
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,630
not to fight against immortals

168
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,160
like a mouse chasing a lion?

169
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,470
Father.

170
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,870
Qiao,

171
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,070
walk...

172
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,630
your own...

173
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,670
path...

174
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,310
Father.

175
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,550
Father.

176
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,680
Father!

177
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,080
Father.

178
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,960
I was surprised

179
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,880
that you could manage to cry

180
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,030
just now.

181
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,750
Right.

182
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,600
Now that my father is dead,

183
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,670
the world belongs to me.

184
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,870
I should be happy.

185
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,230
I was also surprised

186
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,270
that I could cry.

187
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,030
You didn't beg Uncle Ziyu

188
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,270
to extend Bai King's life

189
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,750
as much as possible

190
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,830
out of filial piety, right?

191
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,910
Wu Geng,

192
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,390
you can really see through people.

193
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,630
If I had wanted to fulfill my filial duties,

194
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,390
I should have ended my father's suffering

195
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,000
earlier.

196
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,270
I knew it.

197
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,940
You wanted

198
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,630
to delay your succession

199
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,270
as much as possible.

200
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,320
You took a move against Gui Mu in the Bai capital.

201
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,670
The Immortal Clan will seek revenge soon.

202
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,810
Whoever ascends to the throne

203
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,230
will die.

204
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,040
When I was young,

205
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,750
my father always said,

206
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,690
"Look at Wu Geng, Prince of Xin State."

207
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,790
Since then,

208
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,670
I've always hated you.

209
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,750
I've always wanted to defeat you

210
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,470
and have you under my feet.

211
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,790
I've wanted to let my father

212
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,950
and the whole world know

213
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,870
that one day,

214
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,670
I will be high up,

215
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,500
and you, Wu Geng,

216
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,140
will bow to me.

217
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,970
Didn't you already achieve it

218
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,370
when Xin State was destroyed?

219
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,130
You stepped on me

220
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,510
and even burned and humiliated

221
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,640
the body of Xin King,

222
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,750
who was loved and respected by his people.

223
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,360
If I hadn't done that,

224
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,990
would the Immortal Clan have spared Bai State?

225
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,600
Why don't you understand?

226
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,750
You're foolish.

227
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,830
So were your father.

228
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,790
Even my father

229
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,150
was old and foolish.

230
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,510
He was so foolish

231
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,910
that he did the same thing as Xin King

232
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,200
and fought against the Immortal Clan.

233
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,070
Zhou Qiao, you are wrong.

234
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,630
That's exactly why

235
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,050
Bai King won people's respect

236
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,350
and why people will hold memorials for him.

237
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,310
I will respect him, too.

238
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,070
Throughout his life, he wanted me

239
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,130
to maintain the dignity of Bai State.

240
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,750
He asked me to put my state

241
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,580
and my people first.

242
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,200
He did it.

243
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,310
But I didn't expect

244
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,950
he'd ask me to walk my own path

245
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,270
again

246
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,290
before he died.

247
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,270
To be a rebel

248
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,850
or the Immortal Clan's henchman,

249
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,830
everyone chooses their own path.

250
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,870
No one is born a slave.

251
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,590
Zhou Qiao,

252
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,550
Bai King hoped

253
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,190
you could find

254
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,220
a path you wanted.

255
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,830
He hoped you could find the right path.

256
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,510
Come on, Wu Geng.

257
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,950
There's no other path

258
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,670
for the human race.

259
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,830
I will keep my 2 promises

260
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,790
to you.

261
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,670
But today,

262
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,510
I'm not in the mood

263
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,910
to discuss them with you.

264
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,640
What are you worried about?

265
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,260
I'm thinking...

266
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,310
It's impossible to keep the strange thing that happened in the Bai capital a secret.

267
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,910
Those in the Immortal Realm must have known it.

268
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,230
But why haven't Xinyue Kui

269
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,970
and the others

270
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,660
taken any action?

271
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,840
Uncle Ziyu.

272
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,350
Swordsmanship is my only obsession.

273
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,750
I'm not a master

274
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,700
of strategy and trickery.

275
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,190
Fine. In that case,

276
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,200
instead of waiting passively,

277
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,950
we should take action first.

278
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,990
I'm meeting a ship builder.

279
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,560
We're going to build a ship.

280
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,510
It's time to tell this

281
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,990
to the Shenyin Clan and the Demon Clan.

282
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,590
Before the storm comes,

283
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,400
it must be extremely peaceful.

284
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,870
Same goes for swordsmanship.

285
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,830
You mean

286
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,290
they're getting ready

287
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,450
for a sudden attack?

288
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,190
Geng, rest well.

289
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,400
It's useless to think too much.

290
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,870
My father once told me

291
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,310
that before a battle, valiant royal soldiers

292
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,680
would build a dragon gate and defensive walls

293
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,200
and raise our flags

294
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,610
to strike fear into the enemy's camp.

295
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,069
Since you are determined,

296
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,470
you should stay composed.

297
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,390
Every time I think of

298
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,829
my father and mother,

299
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,030
I feel sad.

300
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,510
Zhou Fa

301
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,829
at least has a grave.

302
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,390
But what about my parents?

303
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,310
When I think about the blood feud,

304
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,830
I really can't stay calm.

305
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,990
After I avenge

306
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,500
my parents,

307
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,270
I also want the life they had.

308
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,630
I want a warm home

309
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,830
and descendants.

310
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,860
You shouldn't be telling me this.

311
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,350
Swordsmanship is my only obsession.

312
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,630
I'm not a master of love.

313
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,470
Uncle Ziyu,

314
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,310
is this

315
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,770
the only thing you can say?

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,550
Fate is hard to predict.

317
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,360
Once you part from someone,

318
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,880
you may never be able to be with them again.

319
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,670
At the end of the day,

320
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,550
whether 2 people can be together

321
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,950
depends on

322
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,830
their own choice.

323
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,190
I want to find a chance

324
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,830
to explain to Bai Cai.

325
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,300
But at present,

326
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,470
the rebellion against immortals is an urgent task.

327
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,310
There are many things in the Bai capital

328
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,510
keeping me occupied.

329
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,030
Although you

330
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,390
saved lots of people,

331
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,950
the Eternal Fruit

332
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,110
still turned many people into trees.

333
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,910
There's no way to turn them back.

334
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,590
So,

335
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,470
our priority

336
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,750
is to get the people

337
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,990
out of this predicament.

338
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,170
Your Highness.

339
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,790
This is

340
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,590
the old official I mentioned.

341
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,670
He's a master of shipbuilding.

342
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,590
Back then,

343
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,230
Xin State's military ships

344
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,630
were all built under his supervision.

345
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,040
Director Zhang,

346
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,590
do you remember me?

347
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,670
We met when I was young.

348
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,940
We met before?

349
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,780
You are...

350
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,510
When I was young,

351
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,830
I wanted to go sailing

352
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,560
and asked you to build a small ship for me.

353
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,150
In the end,

354
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,020
my father beat me up.

355
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,670
He said,

356
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,030
"You asked an official of Xin State

357
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,870
to build you a small ship

358
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,500
just for sailing!"

359
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,280
I remember now.

360
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,430
"Xin State will never have peace

361
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,710
until the Immortal Clan is eliminated.

362
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,750
If you really are a man of Xin State,

363
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,150
you shouldn't spend all your time playing.

364
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,150
You should study hard and practice martial arts

365
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,990
so you can fight for the people of Xin State

366
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,510
in the future."

367
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,470
Are you really the prince?

368
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,670
Director Zhang, it's me.

369
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,470
I'm back.

370
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,530
Please accept my bow, Your Highness.

371
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,870
Director Zhang, please rise.

372
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,090
Director Zhang, please rise.

373
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,710
I still remember

374
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,190
Xin King's words.

375
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,110
Now, you continued

376
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,510
his unfinished work.

377
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,840
It's a comfort

378
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,470
to his soul.

379
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,850
Great!

380
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,400
Director Zhang,

381
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,190
I came to you this time

382
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,670
because I want to go out to sea...

383
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,530
Your Highness,

384
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,830
the design of the Hongmeng Giant Ship

385
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,670
has been completed.

386
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,190
This way, please.

387
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,320
Please take a look, Your Highness.

388
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,370
[Deckhouse] [Top of deckhouse]

389
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,570
It's said

390
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,330
the Sea of Chaos that leads to the Immortal Realm

391
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,630
is guarded by the mysterious Sea Spirit Clan.

392
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,230
They'll surely set up many defenses.

393
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,720
So, our giant ship

394
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,750
must be not only strong and durable

395
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,290
[Bulkhead] [Boardwalk in the air]

396
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,630
but also able to fight.

397
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,300
Later,

398
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,030
I will ask our men

399
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,910
to practice for battles on the sea.

400
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,970
But

401
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,750
we know nothing

402
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,450
about the Sea Spirit Clan.

403
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,070
If we run into

404
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,470
immortals who are proficient in using the divine power of the Wanxiang Realm

405
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,710
like Liu Yue and Zhui Ri,

406
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,020
they will definitely

407
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,330
create a storm and a tsunami on the sea

408
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,430
to stop us.

409
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,110
So our ship

410
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,270
must be able to resist

411
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,730
these natural disasters.

412
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,680
I'll do my best.

413
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,630
At the end of the Ruins on the Sea

414
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,030
is the World's End.

415
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,190
It's where

416
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,600
the Immortal Clan holds immortals convicted of crimes.

417
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,960
My grandfather

418
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,590
is probably there.

419
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,030
I heard the Ruins on the Sea

420
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,270
is a piece of land.

421
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,990
When our ship gets there,

422
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,270
it can't

423
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,800
keep going forward, right?

424
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,350
Let's play it by ear.

425
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,510
Okay.

426
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,200
Director Zhang,

427
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,030
when can you start building the ship?

428
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,190
Anytime.

429
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,230
You just need to give the order, Your Highness.

430
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,070
Okay.

431
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,100
Is that you, Lan?

432
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,270
Have you been spying on me?

433
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,430
Wu Geng is the key to defeating the immortals.

434
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,790
Regarding Wu Geng's matter,

435
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,720
I have no choice but to be cautious.

436
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,430
I am the one who wanted to track you.

437
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,230
It has nothing to do with Wu Geng.

438
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,590
To you,

439
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,910
are Wu Geng and Gou

440
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,470
really important?

441
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,120
I'm aware that, as compared to Wu Geng,

442
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,250
Gou's existence is not relevant.

443
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,910
No one

444
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,310
ever cared about Gou too.

445
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,270
But to me,

446
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,270
Gou is very important.

447
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,110
But to Wu Geng,

448
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,080
you are also important.

449
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,430
I have very little impression

450
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,430
of Prince Wu Geng.

451
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,030
I only remember the time when

452
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,060
he misunderstood Gou and I

453
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,270
for buying food.

454
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,340
In my memory,

455
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,590
Prince Wu Geng

456
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,000
is merely a person who bullies the weak

457
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,800
and can't tell right from wrong.

458
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,180
Although so many years have passed

459
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,190
and he has been changing,

460
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,340
to me,

461
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,650
Gou is the one who changed,

462
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,070
not Wu Geng.

463
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,390
How do you expect me to accept the fact that

464
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,270
my Gou

465
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,360
is actually Wu Geng?

466
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,540
True.

467
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,990
For you,

468
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,640
it is definitely hard to accept it in a short time.

469
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,630
How about you?

470
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,270
Disregarding his identity,

471
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,110
as well as

472
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,710
your mission to protect him,

473
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,310
do you have any other feelings towards him?

474
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,150
Are you

475
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,950
also hiding something from him?

476
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,950
Don't come and save me.

477
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,430
Protect Wu Geng at all cost.

478
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,590
Kill Bai Cai if necessary.

479
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,350
So,

480
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,690
regardless of the type of relationship,

481
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,670
lies will always exist, won't they?

482
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,200
In this world,

483
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,910
many lies and concealments

484
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,110
are well-intended

485
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,470
and are not meant to hurt people.

486
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,270
No.

487
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,070
There were no lies

488
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,150
between Gou and me.

489
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,870
We grew up together since young.

490
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,270
We had never

491
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,630
lied to each other.

492
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,750
He eventually changed

493
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,350
and turned into who he is now.

494
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,470
Still, I chose to trust him.

495
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,630
I trusted that our relationship

496
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,830
would be inseparable

497
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,550
and our feelings would remain the same.

498
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,700
But the outcome tells me that

499
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,750
all of this

500
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,260
was built upon

501
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,020
lies and deception.

502
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,870
Maybe I am too foolish.

503
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,740
I always feel

504
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,750
the most important thing in a relationship

505
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,550
is honesty.

506
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,430
I'm leaving.

507
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,530
Where are you going?

508
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,910
I think

509
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,880
the eateries in town should be open by now.

510
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,030
I'll go buy some bitter gourd meatballs

511
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,360
for Biggie and the rest.

512
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,270
By the way,

513
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,950
can you help me buy some flour?

514
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,400
I'll make buns tonight.

515
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,870
Gou loves them.

516
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,670
High Priest,

517
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,150
although there's a grudge

518
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,680
between Bai Cai and Wu Geng,

519
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,590
she doesn't have any intention

520
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,230
to kill Wu Geng.

521
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,310
Zhou Qiao!

522
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,880
What a despicable and shameless rogue.

523
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,630
You slaves!

524
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,030
When I'm out,

525
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,050
I'll make sure to devour

526
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,650
all of you slaves!

527
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,570
Good darling.

528
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,470
Come up.

529
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,290
That's right, keep moving forward.

530
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,960
Darling, you're so well-behaved.

531
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,630
Move forward.

532
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,350
Come up. It's okay.

533
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,110
Come on, move forward.

534
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,270
Yes! Yes!

535
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,430
I left the Poison Locust here.

536
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,910
Godfather,

537
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,670
I need your help with something.

538
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,750
You being chained up

539
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,230
is inconvenient.

540
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,290
Gui Mu,

541
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,590
where have you been these days?

542
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,020
Reporting to High Priest,

543
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,190
I was plotted against by Wu Geng

544
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,990
and my divine spirit was sealed.

545
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,430
I implore High Priest to quickly come and rescue me.

546
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,190
How dare you say that?

547
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,150
High Priest,

548
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,270
Xin State's remnant, Wu Geng,

549
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,870
burned the Eternal Fruit

550
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,350
and even plotted against my godfather.

551
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,670
I plead with High Priest and the other Immortals

552
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,150
to descend to the mortal realm

553
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,680
and punish Wu Geng.

554
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,590
Is that so?

555
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,240
Gui Mu.

556
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,920
Everything Qiao said

557
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,440
is true.

558
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,030
High Priest,

559
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,980
I was ambushed by Wu Geng.

560
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,400
Luckily, Qiao saved me.

561
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,470
However, Bai State is now

562
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,270
under Wu Geng's control.

563
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,430
If High Priest does not intervene soon,

564
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,680
the dignity of us Immortal Clan

565
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,150
will be utterly lost.

566
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,690
Zhou Qiao,

567
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,990
now that half of my plan

568
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,270
has succeeded,

569
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,670
I would need you

570
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,360
to complete the other half.

571
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,000
May I know

572
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,740
what the other half

573
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,870
that the High Priest needs me for entails?

574
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,910
I need an opportunity—

575
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,030
an opportunity for Wu Geng

576
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,630
to die without a burial place.

577
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,400
If this task is done well,

578
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,990
I promise,

579
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,670
you, Zhou Qiao,

580
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,790
will rule the mortal world forever.

581
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,620
High Priest,

582
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,700
I happen

583
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,950
to have such a chance.

584
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,180
Don't let me down.

585
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,850
Congratulations.

586
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,420
With the starburst,

587
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,590
you can contact the High Priest

588
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,390
any time.

589
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,940
Qiao.

590
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,100
You saw it just now.

591
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,530
I hid the fact that

592
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,640
you've offended me

593
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,470
from the High Priest

594
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,230
and even helped you gain merit

595
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,760
in front of the High Priest.

596
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,320
I did a good job, right?

597
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,810
Thank you, Godfather.

598
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,200
You're welcome.

599
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,440
You're welcome, Qiao.

600
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,610
Godfather is very weak now.

601
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,080
I need nourishment.

602
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,450
Hurry.

603
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,720
Find me

604
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,000
some maids.

605
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,720
When I regain my divine spirit,

606
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,410
cooperating with the High Priest

607
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,120
to destroy Wu Geng

608
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,020
will be easy as pie.

609
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,390
Qiao.

610
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,540
What are you doing?

611
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,070
Godfather is smart and wise.

612
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,410
Shouldn't you be able to tell?

613
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,350
Well.

614
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,110
You truly are

615
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,480
my excellent student.

616
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,800
You know to be cautious about everything.

617
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,810
How dare you kill me?

618
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,860
Now,

619
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,270
of course not.

620
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,990
Yes.

621
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,110
When my Immortal Clan arrives,

622
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,000
Wu Geng will definitely be turned into ashes.

623
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,060
By then,

624
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,270
you can take advantage of the chaos

625
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,670
and say,

626
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,000
"Immortal Gui Mu,

627
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,170
with limited skills and strength,

628
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,500
exhausted all of his divine spirit in the battle."

629
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,390
Qiao.

630
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,880
Qiao.

631
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,270
Spare me.

632
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,420
Qiao.

633
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,310
Zhou Qiao!

634
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,270
Young man,

635
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,900
thank you.

636
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,640
Thank you.

637
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,410
Prince Zhou Qiao ordered

638
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,750
that we move the Eternal Tree

639
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,370
of our family ourselves.

640
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,530
But,

641
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,500
we are old and strengthless.

642
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,270
Without your help,

643
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,310
we really

644
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,600
can't do this task.

645
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,790
It's fine.

646
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,880
You're welcome.

647
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,600
Isn't this Prince Wu Geng?

648
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,280
Prince Wu Geng!

649
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,550
Prince Wu Geng. Prince Wu Geng.

650
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,650
Prince Wu Geng.

651
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,750
Our family has been in the army for three generations.

652
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,840
My father, me

653
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,300
and my son.

654
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,590
We all

655
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,830
fought wars for the Xin State.

656
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,150
Now, only the old, weak and young

657
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,350
are left in town.

658
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,929
They can't carry hoes

659
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,710
nor guns.

660
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,570
Tell us,

661
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,719
how should we live?

662
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,429
Sir.

663
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,100
Get up, sir.

664
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,180
Sir, please get up.

665
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,370
Sir.

666
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,850
With me, Wu Geng, here,

667
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,110
you can rest assured.

668
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,550
Thank you.

669
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,670
Thank you, Prince Wu Geng.

670
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,550
Thank you.

671
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,660
Thank you, Prince Wu Geng.

672
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,960
Thank you.

673
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,030
We can't find anything to eat

674
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,630
in this accursed place.

675
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,270
So what if it barks out of hunger?

676
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,590
Can't it complain when it's hungry?

677
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,870
Is there still justice?

678
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,600
Is there still righteousness?

679
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,190
Thank you, everyone.

680
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,590
Thank you, everyone.

681
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,270
Gou,

682
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,940
do you still remember me?

683
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,070
Zhazha?

684
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,710
Do you think

685
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,350
once you leave Northern Mountain Mine

686
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,030
everything will be over?

687
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,430
You're too naive.

688
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,430
I've had a hard time looking for you.

689
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,970
Do you want to

690
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,410
find another remote place

691
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,940
to reflect on your mistakes

692
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,450
or let me teach you something now?

693
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,840
No.

694
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,230
You misunderstood me.

695
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,360
I'm not here to settle scores with you.

696
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,140
Master Gou,

697
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,970
please take me as your disciple.

698
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,790
Zhazha, get up.

699
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,230
Kid.

700
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,990
Get up.

701
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,790
Stop messing around.

702
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,870
What are you doing?

703
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,270
Since young,

704
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,550
Father has been protecting me well

705
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,870
Everyone in the mine was afraid of me

706
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,430
and dared not to mess with me.

707
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,970
You were the first one

708
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,620
who dare to hit me,

709
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,070
scold me,

710
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,320
and even taught me

711
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,300
many principles of living.

712
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,900
Ever since you left,

713
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,860
I treat people and deal with things

714
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,190
the way you taught me to.

715
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,560
I treat the slaves well.

716
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,300
and see them as friends.

717
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,030
It feels good to have friends.

718
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,070
It makes me happier

719
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,030
than those false compliments I've received in the past.

720
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,790
So,

721
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,190
I'm telling you, Gou.

722
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,870
If you don't become my master,

723
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,070
I'll go back to the mine,

724
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,870
no,

725
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,220
I'll go around the whole country

726
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,160
and bully people everywhere.

727
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,870
I want to become

728
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,030
a super bad guy

729
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,230
and tell them

730
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,030
you were the one

731
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,360
who taught me to do this.

732
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,070
I don't care.

733
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,750
I want you to be my Master.

734
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,470
-Kid.
-Zhazha.

735
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,190
I don't care.

736
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,390
- Get up first.
- Hey, Kid.

737
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,590
Get up first. Get up.

738
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,870
Kid, listen to me.

739
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,230
If others

740
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,690
apprentice themselves to a master like you,

741
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,420
they'll get beaten till their backsides are worn out.

742
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,180
Got it?

743
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,590
Zhazha.

744
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,780
I might have to

745
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,310
leave Bai capital soon.

746
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,810
There's nothing much I can teach you.

747
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,950
That's easy.

748
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,070
Wherever you go,

749
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,470
I'll follow.

750
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,030
Please?

751
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,910
I beg you.

752
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,400
I beg you. Please?

753
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,510
You agreed implicitly, don't you?

754
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,540
Thank you, Master Gou.

755
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,090
Master Gou.

756
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,430
Take care.

757
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,470
See you next time.

758
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,350
Hurry up.

759
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,390
Pack up and go home.

760
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,750
Oh, this rain.

761
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,910
Boss.

762
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,700
Two bags of flour, please.

763
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,510
Okay.

764
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,230
Ah Lan!

765
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,500
The kids have recovered.

766
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,190
With you taking care of Wu Geng,

767
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,330
I can rest assured.

768
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,410
I'm returning to the Demon Realm.

769
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,010
That is my true home.

770
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,020
Please convey to Wu Geng,

771
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,420
there's no need to miss me

772
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,870
nor come looking to me.

773
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,910
Oh no.

774
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,110
Here.

775
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,990
Even when you're so hungry,

776
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,950
you didn't eat

777
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,810
any Eternal Fruit on the way here.

778
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,610
You're considered lucky.

779
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,550
I recognise that thing.

780
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,390
My father said it is very bad.

781
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,270
Back then, Gui Mu wanted my father

782
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,670
to plant them in the mine.

783
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,350
My father tried many ways

784
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,680
only could he reject it.

785
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,310
Hurry and go back

786
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,750
when you're done eating.

787
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,590
No.

788
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,420
Didn't you say I could follow you?

789
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,180
Master.

790
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,070
You're just a kid.

791
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,880
You can't be wandering around.

792
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,470
Your father must be

793
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,150
looking for you everywhere.

794
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,990
But,

795
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,150
even if he's worried about me,

796
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,920
he can't leave the mine.

797
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,400
Zhazha,

798
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,130
I've always been curious.

799
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,100
Why did the Immortal Clan choose your father

800
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,030
to manage Northern Mountain Mine?

801
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,110
Father was once a big shot.

802
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,200
He’s the leader of the Wanqu Tribe.

803
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,990
There were many trees in the tribe.

804
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,750
The Immortal Clan wanted to renovate their place

805
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,440
and invaded the Wanqu Tribe.

806
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,820
Father led his people to fight back

807
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,070
but failed.

808
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,430
Later, the Immortal Clan

809
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,030
saw that my father was highly skilled in lian qi technique

810
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,350
and wanted to subdue him.

811
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,410
Father refused to,

812
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,790
so they threatened him with me

813
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,790
to let Father

814
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,750
be cursed willingly

815
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,370
and stay in Northern Mountain Mine forever.

816
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,770
I also heard this from others.

817
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,670
So this is what happened.

818
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,640
I didn't know your father well.

819
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,030
I didn't expect that.

820
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,150
Therefore,

821
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,430
Master,

822
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,190
since I'm so pitiful,

823
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,430
just let me follow you, okay?

824
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,590
I want to learn your skills

825
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,070
to defeat the Immortal Clan,

826
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,510
so that Father can leave

827
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,440
the bloody Northern Mountain Mine as soon as possible.

828
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,990
Okay?

829
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,270
Zhazha, take a seat first.

830
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:16,750
Take a seat.

831
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,430
Yes, sit down.

832
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,430
How about this, Zhazha?

833
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,590
You go back to the Northern Mountain Mine first.

834
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,350
After I'm done with

835
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,070
the important mission I currently have,

836
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,630
I do need your help

837
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,950
with something.

838
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,550
Keep your promise.

839
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,070
Of course I will.

840
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,390
Master,

841
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,590
you said it.

842
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,960
I said it.

843
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,560
♫Wild geese pass by in the autumn wind♫

844
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,930
♫Leaves know the sky is cold♫

845
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:49,320
♫In a drunken stupor; I'm desolate♫

846
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,090

847

♫The moon in the sky is not me♫

848
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:00,030
♫Fair or unfair, it's all wrong♫

849
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,560

♫If it's unforgettable, why do I ponder about it?♫

854
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,810
What's the matter?

855
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,070
Are you leaving just like that?
