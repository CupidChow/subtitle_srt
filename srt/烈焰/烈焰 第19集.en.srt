[Episode 19]

4
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,930
A dirty hand

5
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,750
can be exchanged for your lives.

6
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,680
If you dare to commit crimes again,

7
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,430
I'll naturally collect the debt.

8
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,789
Thank you, Grand Marshal!

9
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,100
Thank you, Grand Marshal!

10
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,710
Let's go.

11
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,600
Send a message to your king.

12
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,300
Those who recognize the current trend should surrender as soon as possible.

13
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,110
Otherwise,

14
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,509
I'll lead troops to destroy Mount Zheluo.

15
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,190
Yes. Yes.

16
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,150
Are you okay?

17
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,790
I am the Grand Marshal of the Demon Clan,

18
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,750
Nitian Erxing.

19
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,790
I guessed it

20
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,790
when they called you

21
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,120
Grand Marshal earlier.

22
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,990
Thank you for saving my life.

23
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,590
Ms. Bai Cai, you're welcome.

24
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,560
You know me?

25
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,910
Not only do I know you,

26
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,590
but I also know that you undid

27
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,510
the Seal of the Dead in the King's City

28
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,590
and helped your companions

29
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,990
defeat Shi Xing.

30
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,390
I admire

31
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,590
your courage.

32
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,590
Speaking of my companions,

33
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,110
we got separated when we entered

34
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,400
the Demon Realm.

35
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,400
Don't worry.

36
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,000
You'll see each other soon.

37
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,579
Let's go. I'll bring you somewhere.

38
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,390
Lan?

39
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,320
Where's Bai Cai?

40
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,190
We got separated.

41
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,990
Old Demon,

42
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,470
don't keep the good stuff for yourself.

43
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,510
Remove this stone.

44
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,589
Paired with the heart, lungs, and kidneys,

45
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,950
it'll be enough for you to eat for three days.

46
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,270
It's not too much to exchange

47
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,670
some water for it, right?

48
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,290
They're doing this just for a few drops of water?

49
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,590
Looks like the Demon Realm

50
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,470
is far beyond

51
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,470
our imagination.

52
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,080
I didn't expect people here

53
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,460
to suffer

54
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,270
more than the human race.

55
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,710
Let's find Bai Cai first.

56
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,030
Let's go.

57
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,900
The Flower of Dawn will bless us.

58
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,080
The Grand Marshal is picking it for us.

59
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,030
Water.

60
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,890
I thought the people of Xin State

61
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,390
were already pitiful enough

62
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,750
to live oppressed lives

63
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,070
as slaves.

64
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,040
I didn't expect

65
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,500
this place is even more...

66
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,630
Why does the Demon Clan choose

67
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,870
to live underground?

68
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,520
They didn't choose it. They had no choice.

69
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,130
In the Immortal Realm's war

70
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,840
100,000 years ago,

71
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,320
Hei Long forced the rebellious Immortal Army

72
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,390
underground

73
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,390
to never see sunlight again,

74
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,780
accompanied by illness and violence.

75
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,510
They killed each other again and again

76
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,750
in despair

77
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,990
and became demons.

78
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,790
So, the Demon Clan

79
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,050
used to part of the Immortal Clan.

80
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,710
Then aren't they like the Shenyin Clan?

81
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,950
From the perspective of rebelling against Hei Long

82
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,510
and originating from the Immortal Clan,

83
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,750
they are indeed the same.

84
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,409
However, they're demons now.

85
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,950
We should be careful.

[Grave of Brother Haikuo Tiankong]

87
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,110
Hello.

88
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,750
I want to ask

89
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,350
if you've seen

90
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,270
a young girl

91
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,200
about this tall.

92
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,070
No.

93
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,870
No.

94
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,510
Thank you.

95
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,430
We got lucky.

96
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,470
They are so tender.

97
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,600
I can't even bring myself to kill them.

98
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,350
It's a deal.

99
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,430
No one is allowed to fight.

100
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,440
Everyone here gets a share.

101
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,670
Great!

102
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,300
It's you again.

103
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,750
You have sharp eyes.

104
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,090
You recognize me?

105
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm not blind.

106
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,380
I noticed you long ago.

107
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,770
They don't seem to be from the Demon Clan.

108
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,000
Tell me.

109
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,960
Where are you from?

110
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,590
If I say

111
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,830
we fell from the sky,

112
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,150
would you believe it?

113
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,210
From the sky?

114
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,940
He fell from the sky!

115
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,270
If he really

116
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,530
fell from the sky,

117
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,600
could he be

118
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,490
from the Immortal Clan?

119
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,760
The Immortal Clan?

120
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,520
The Immortal Clan?

121
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,280
They have oppressed our clan for 100,000 years.

122
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,750
Cut them into millions of pieces.

123
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,480
They deserve a horrible death.

124
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,830
They deserve a horrible death.

125
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,429
I think they really are from the Immortal Clan.

126
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,150
The enemy is right in front of us.

127
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,840
Attack!

128
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,420
What happened?

129
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,360
Look.

130
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,160
The sky...

131
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,900
The sky has collapsed.

132
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
The sky has collapsed.

133
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,970
Go!

134
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,670
Let's go.

135
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,030
This is...

136
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,680
It's the 100,000-year seal

137
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,610
of the Demon Clan.

138
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,380
It has finally been broken.

139
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,390
It's broken.

140
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,350
The seal has been broken.

141
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,750
The seal has been broken.

142
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,040
It's broken.

143
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,870
It's broken.

144
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,410
Let's charge onto the Immortal Realm

145
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,190
and take the Flower of Dawn!

146
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,790
Hei Long forced

147
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,640
my clan underground

148
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,590
100,000 years ago,

149
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,470
causing my clan

150
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,200
to live in eternal night,

151
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,150
unable to live well

152
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,710
and unable to die.

153
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,910
Only the few strong figures

154
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,670
can go above ground.

155
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,790
My Master once said

156
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,580
that only the divine power of the Colorless Realm

157
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,380
can open the Celestial Stone Sea

158
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,390
to break the seal.

159
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,630
The divine power of the Colorless Realm...

160
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,720
It's Gou.

161
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,910
It must be Gou.

162
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,670
What's your name?

163
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,150
Little Dragonfly.

164
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,200
Little Dragonfly.

165
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
What's wrong, Little Dragonfly?

166
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,530
It hurts.

167
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,280
It hurts.

168
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,940
There must be something wrong

169
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,920
with what you ate.

170
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,260
Where is the clinic here?

171
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,630
I'll take you to the clinic.

172
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,810
Sir, don't worry.

173
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,120
This is how the funuo fruit is.

174
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,180
Your stomach will hurt after eating it,

175
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,650
but after a while,

176
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,070
it'll get better.

177
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,040
You can't eat this anymore.

178
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,330
But I'm hungry.

179
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,700
How about you eat this?

180
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,190
What's wrong, Little Dragonfly?

181
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,390
Is this human food?

182
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,240
How do we eat this?

183
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,030
Put it in your mouth

184
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,110
and just eat it.

185
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,590
You can't eat the paper outside.

186
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,590
Here.

187
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,570
Why aren't you eating?

188
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,310
I've never eaten such delicious food before,

189
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,240
so I want to save it for my father.

190
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,110
Here, have some water.

191
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,640
I can...

192
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,600
You must be careful

193
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,840
and protect it.

194
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,050
We don't have

195
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,860
drinkable water here.

196
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,510
If the bad guys find out,

197
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,440
they will snatch it away.

198
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,350
It's okay.

199
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,710
You can drink more.

200
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,990
I have more.

201
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,340
It really did become full.

202
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,640
You're so nice to me.

203
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,420
Do you

204
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,260
need my help?

205
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,630
I came here

206
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,070
to find a friend.

207
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,230
Don't worry.

208
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,310
I can help you

209
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,610
find your friend.

210
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,190
Nitian Erxing's tribe

211
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,470
is right ahead.

212
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,520
How do you know that Nitian Erxing

213
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,280
can find the person we're looking for?

214
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,360
Of course.

215
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,680
The Grand Marshal is so powerful.

216
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,570
Most of the demons in the Demon Realm

217
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,850
listen to him.

218
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,430
If he wants to find someone,

219
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,560
he'll definitely be able to find then.

220
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,060
Don't tell my father

221
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,620
what I just said.

222
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,360
If he finds out

223
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,590
that I complimented the Grand Marshal,

224
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,020
he'll be so mad.

225
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,710
So, there are also

226
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,250
demons who don't like the Grand Marshal?

227
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,300
Little Dragonfly,

228
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,140
if you take us there,

229
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,790
won't your father be angry?

230
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,720
It's fine.

231
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,810
I often play around anyway.

232
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,430
He can't control me.

233
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,830
Lan,

234
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,110
what are you thinking about?

235
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,430
I'm thinking about

236
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,830
Nitian Erxing's attitude towards you.

237
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,350
In King's City,

238
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,710
he took the initiative.

239
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,150
Does he want to join forces?

240
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,990
If that's the case,

241
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,630
that will be great.

242
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,350
I came to the Demon Clan this time

243
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,150
because I hope

244
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,100
to get more forces

245
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,630
against the Immortal Clan.

246
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,670
I believe

247
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,720
that as long as

248
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,850
I show enough sincerity and patience,

249
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,770
I can definitely make gains.

250
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,360
Sir, I'll take you there.

251
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,620
Grand Marshal.

252
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,240
The seal of the demon has been lifted.

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,630
[Tiexue Wushuang]
[Guimei Senlin]

254
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:28,980
We can finally

255
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,190
attack the Immortal Realm.

256
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,730
The Grand Marshal is wise and powerful.

257
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,010
With your protection,

258
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,950
the seal of the Demon Clan has been lifted.

259
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,190
The rebellion against the Immortal Clan is imminent.

260
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,430
I'm not the one who lifted the seal.

261
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,160
It was someone else.

262
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,730
And this person

263
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,350
is the friend of the one

264
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,410
who broke the seal,

265
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,710
Bai Cai.

266
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,220
I am Tiexue Wushuang.

267
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,550
Greetings, Ms. Bai Cai.

268
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,590
Miss, where are you from?

269
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,570
She's from the mortal realm,

270
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,510
but she's a demon.

271
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,860
A demon from the mortal realm?

272
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,320
I've never met one before.

273
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,920
Ms. Bai Cai,

274
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,250
I'm Guimei Senlin.

275
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,590
Why do you

276
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,230
look different from us?

277
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,030
No, I'm not a demon.

278
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,440
What do you mean?

279
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,820
Your Crystal Glory

280
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,710
in the King's City

281
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,770
was one of its kind.

282
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,780
I once saw it on the young daughter

283
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,510
of a couple from the Demon Clan.

284
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,160
Later, they escaped from the Demon Realm

285
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,080
and disappeared.

286
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,510
Although you've lived in the mortal realm for a long time,

287
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,380
this is your hometown.

288
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,910
I am an ordinary human,

289
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,080
not a demon.

290
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,260
I've been an orphan since childhood

291
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,110
and I don't have the Crystal Glory either.

292
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,270
You're mistaken.

293
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:47,990
I can't bear

294
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,670
your mistaken feelings.

295
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,330
Even if you deny it,

296
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,480
the memory of your ancestors

297
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,290
are already

298
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,580
in your bloodline.

299
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,390
These crystals

300
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,990
came to the Demon Realm

301
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,710
with the ancestors of the Demon Clan.

302
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,589
I've only seen this kind of

303
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,430
divine power resonance

304
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,490
on one girl before.

305
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,260
Bai Cai,

306
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,260
you are a demon.

307
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,710
We've walked alone

308
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,120
in the darkness for 100,000 years.

309
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,630
Finally, we found

310
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,350
a way for the Demon Clan to survive

311
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,430
underground,

312
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,360
but it's still painful.

313
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,380
We will never give up

314
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,310
on leading our clansmen to escape from the darkness

315
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,390
and go to the light.

316
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,510
Bai Cai,

317
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,930
I'm glad

318
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,590
you went above-ground early

319
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,470
and bathed under the sun.

320
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,240
But I know

321
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,630
you were alone

322
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,070
in the outside world.

323
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,470
Don't worry.

324
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,200
From now on,

325
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,240
the Demon Clan is your home.

326
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,160
The people of the Demon Clan

327
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,790
are your family.

328
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,370
Grand Marshal,

329
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,710
I appreciate your kindness,

330
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,390
but

331
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,040
I already have a family.

332
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,070
Come and have a look.

333
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,860
Look.

334
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,830
Bravo! Bravo!

335
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,750
Sir, look!

336
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,480
There's a big monster!

337
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
What's wrong?

338
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,100
I have a feeling

339
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,650
Bai Cai is right here.

340
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,250
Sir,

341
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,170
let's go over there.

342
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,930
Have a look!

343
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,270
This sharp-mouthed monster was baked from

344
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,670
the lava of Mount Zheluo.

345
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,750
Kiddo, buy one!

346
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,030
Buy one.

347
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,600
Let's go over there.

348
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,950
Do you know what this is?

349
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,950
No.

350
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,710
It is said

351
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,470
this is the tomb treasure of

352
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,420
of our 28th Grand Marshal.

353
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,300
Kid,

354
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,860
come and take a look at this.

355
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,300
It's good.

356
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,590
Take one.

357
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,740
Let's go over there.

358
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,350
Have some.

359
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,810
Take a look.

360
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,070
Flower of Dawn!

361
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,830
Old sir, I want another one too.

362
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,470
Okay.

363
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,110
I want this.

364
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,990
Good girl.

365
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,310
Here.

366
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
What is this?

367
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,390
You don't know what this is?

368
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,330
This is the Flower of Dawn.

369
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,710
This divine flower blesses the Demon Clan

370
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,710
and removes the curse of the Petrification Sickness.

371
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,210
The curse of the Petrification Sickness?

372
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,590
It's so bright.

373
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,410
Yes.

374
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,740
What happened?

375
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,940
Did something happen?

376
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,570
Why is it so bright?

377
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,980
What's going on?

378
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,030
It's suddenly so bright.

379
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,590
What's that? It's so dazzling.

380
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,350
Look.

381
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,140
It's the sun. It's the sun.

382
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,760
The sun!

383
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,760
It's light. I've never seen it before.

384
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,100
It's really the sun.

385
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,660
It's the sun!

386
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,670
Great!

387
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,160
It's really light.

388
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,710
Look.

389
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,640
Move aside.

390
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,350
It's cold.

391
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,410
It's on my head too.

392
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,240
Why is it cold?

393
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,310
What's falling down from above?

394
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,970
I don't know. It's coming down in little pieces.

395
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,190
Be careful.

396
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,470
Look.

397
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,310
It feels cold.

398
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,830
It seems to be the snow recorded in ancient books.

399
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,590
Snow! Snow!

400
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,720
Snow is a real thing!

401
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,810
♫Like a beam of light♫

402
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,920
♫Piercing into the desolation♫

403

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,840

♫Soothing the young boy's wounds♫

407
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,530

408

♫Standing between heaven and earth♫

417
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,310

422
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,670
Bai Cai.

423
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,430
Why are you

424
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,890
in Nitian Erxing's tribe?

425
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,310
It's a long story.

426
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,430
In the past few days,

427
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,290
Grand Marshal has helped me a lot.

428
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,070
I'm glad to see you

429
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,990
safe and sound.

430
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,550
Mr. Gou, Ms. Bai Cai.

431
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,420
Grand Marshal wants to see you.

432
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,870
Go meet him.

433
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,550
I'll take care of Little Dragonfly.

434
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,580
Be careful.

435
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,030
Okay.

436
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,490
I'm Gou. Greetings, Grand Marshal.

437
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,190
Bai Cai told me

438
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,230
you helped her a lot.

439
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,390
Thank you.

440
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,990
I'm Nitian Erxing.

441
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,550
You don't have to thank me.

442
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,630
It's my duty

443
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,170
to take care of Bai Cai.

444
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,230
If it weren't for your arrival,

445
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,950
the Demon Realm

446
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,680
would still be in darkness now.

447
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,310
For the light you brought here,

448
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,970
I'd like to thank you

449
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,870
on behalf of all the demons.

450
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,750
I just accidentally

451
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,430
opened the Celestial Stone Sea

452
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,490
and broke the seal.

453
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,590
Your divine power of the Colorless Realm.

454
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,830
surprised me.

455
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,350
I used to believe

456
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,550
Hei Long was the only one in the three realms

457
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,410
who possessed that divine power.

458
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,830
As the God of War in the mortal realm,

459
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,830
you've lived up to your reputation.

460
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,510
That's too grand a title.

461
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,030
I don't think I can carry its weight.

462
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,830
You demons are powerful as well.

463
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,430
Take Suifeng Qiwu as an example.

464
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,230
She's as powerful as Zhui Ri.

465
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,830
Actually, along my journey,

466
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,690
I've witnessed the bravery

467
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,960
of the Demon Clan

468
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,490
on several occasions.

469
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,820
But there's one thing

470
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,430
I don't understand.

471
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,870
What's it?

472
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,750
The curse of the Petrification Sickness,

473
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,750
how did it happen?

474
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,950
It seems that on your way here,

475
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,900
you've not only witnessed

476
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,300
the bravery of my people.

477
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,450
I just saw

478
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,470
the people here

479
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,990
living in hardship.

480
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,250
Their lives are a living hell.

481
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,020
Grand Marshal.

482
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,910
What happened to the Demon Clan?

483
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,830
Do you remember

484
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,990
the graveyard I took you to?

485
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,070
Of course.

486
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,220
The statues in the cemetery

487
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,870
are not statues.

488
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,190
They're the bodies of demons

489
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,850
who died from petrification.

490
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,440
The statues are how they looked

491
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,070
before they died.

492
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,870
I see.

493
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,120
So, for the past one hundred thousand years,

494
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,990
demons have been kept underground,

495
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,060
suffering from the Petrification Sickness.

496
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,590
Regardless of age,

497
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,110
every demon will get the Petrification Sickness eventually?

498
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,910
That's right.

499
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,390
Most demons

500
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,440
can't live past 40.

501
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,270
How did such a strange disease

502
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,670
spread in the Demon Clan?

503
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,230
It's a curse from the Immortal Clan.

504
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,550
Hei Long

505
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,550
cursed my ancestors who were deities before betraying him.

506
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,550
The Petrification Sickness has been passed down through generations.

507
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,950
No one can escape this fate.

508
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,880
After all that,

509
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,670
are you still going to

510
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,030
be sitting ducks?

511
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,400
Of course not.

512
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,030
We demons

513
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,790
will never bow to our fates.

514
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,830
Although we've struggled for survival

515
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,710
over the past one hundred thousand years,

516
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,030
the flame of resistance and revenge

517
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,770
has never been extinguished.

518
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,080
The future of the Demon Clan

519
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,380
is in our own hands but no one else's.

520
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,230
Grand Marshal, since you allowed us

521
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,950
to enter the Demon Realm,

522
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,830
you must know

523
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,190
what we came for.

524
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,110
It's a pity that I didn't join

525
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,770
the battle at the King's City.

526
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,030
You risked your life to fight Shi Xing,

527
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,550
so you must be determined

528
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,240
to fight against the Immortal Clan to the end.

529
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,790
What you want to do

530
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,330
is also what I want to do.

531
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,920
Although we have the same goal,

532
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,990
we may not agree with each other's ways

533
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,030
of doing things.

534
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,210
How about this?

535
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,630
Let's make a deal.

536
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,630
Let's give each other seven days.

537
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,630
After seven days,

538
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,830
we'll decide

539
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,370
whether we're willing to see each other as allies

540
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,170
whom we can trust our lives with.

541
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,350
Okay.

542
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,270
It's a deal.

543
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,230
Most demons can't live past 40.

544
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,310
But Gou,

545
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,790
look at them. They're laughing so happily.

546
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,630
Fate is unfair to them,

547
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,150
but they never gave up

548
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,610
the pursuit of happiness.

549
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,750
Maybe

550
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,550
that's the reason why Nitian Erxing

551
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,950
has made it this far.

552
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,390
He's like Xin King back then.

553
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,430
In his life,

554
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,310
having people worth protecting

555
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,100
and staying steadfast for

556
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,060
is a lucky thing.

557
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,110
You're lucky too.

558
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,840
You've been protecting me

559
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
and our friends in Shenyin Village.

560
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,710
And these demons.

561
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,660
What you're doing now

562
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,370
is protecting them, isn't it?

563
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,200
Yeah.

564
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,470
I hope that in the future,

565
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,550
we can all fulfill our wishes

566
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,270
and live a peaceful life.

567
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,470
We will.

568
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,720
Lan.

569
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,320
Thank you for everything you did.

570
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,910
I know,

571
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,900
you miss Shenyin Village,

572
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,630
Clan Leader Kong Que, and the other villagers,

573
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,190
but to protect me,

574
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,150
you came to the Demon Realm.

575
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,580
I'm your master.

576
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,790
It's my duty to protect you.

577
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,230
Besides,

578
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,630
along the way,

579
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,550
I've seen scenery I never saw

580
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,140
in Shenyin Village and met people

581
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,910
who were different from those from the Immortal Clan.

582
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,790
I'm very glad.

583
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,770
Don't worry, Lan.

584
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,950
After we defeat the Immortal Clan

585
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,990
and Hei Long

586
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,430
and save my grandpa,

587
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,930
the people in Shenyin Village

588
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,790
will no longer have to constantly migrate

589
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,190
and seek hideouts.

590
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,990
How did your conversation

591
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,250
with Nitian Erxing go?

592
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,790
Is he a trustworthy ally?

593
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,110
We've agreed to spend seven days

594
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,910
observing each other

595
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,790
to see if we can trust each other

596
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,190
with our lives.

597
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,710
Seven days?

598
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,750
That's not much time.

599
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,550
For me, it's more than enough.

600
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,150
You're right.

601
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,270
Back then, when High Priest

602
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,270
went to the Northern Mountain Mine to observe you,

603
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,230
it only took him two or three days

604
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,190
to be sure of your potential.

605
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,150
I wish

606
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,800
I could meet my grandpa as soon as possible

607
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,910
to tell him

608
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,950
I didn't let him down.

609
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,570
High Priest

610
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,770
will be proud of you.

611
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,010
My Lord. My Lord.

612
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,350
Please give us a chance

613
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,230
to make up for our mistake.

614
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,350
We can definitely

615
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,930
bring Young Miss back.

616
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,370
Move aside!

617
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,230
My Lord.

618
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,239
My Lord.

619
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,139
I sent you to protect Little Dragonfly,

620
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:22,610
[Qiongxiong Ji'e]

621
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,870
but you lost her.

622
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,030
How dare you beg me for mercy now?

623
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,710
My Lord, please spare my life.

624
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,550
Cut off his limbs.

625
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,690
Gouge out his eyes.

626
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,150
Pull out his tongue too.

627
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,420
Then throw him into the wasteland

628
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,980
to die on his own!

629
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:43,949
Yes, My Lord.

630
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,639
Please spare my life, My Lord.

631
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,030
My Lord.

632
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,710
My Lord, please spare me!

633
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,030
Everyone!

634
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,330
Go out to search for Little Dragonfly.

635
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,360
Today,

636
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,430
even if you turn the Demon Realm upside down,

637
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,810
you have to

638
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,810
bring Little Dragonfly back!

639
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,080
Yes!

640
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,740
My Lord.

641
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,540
My Lord.

642
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,040
Have you found Little Dragonfly?

643
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,810
The bat spy just sent back a message.

644
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,220
Young Miss…

645
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,430
What happened to her?

646
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,830
She went out to play

647
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:17,790
like usual.

648
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,550
Somehow,

649
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,110
she entered

650
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,310
Nitian Erxing's tribe

651
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,230
and never came out.

652
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,950
What?

653
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,070
Nitian Erxing.

654
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,710
Gather the Dragon Fang Warriors.

655
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,550
Let's go save her.

656
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,310
My Lord.

657
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,550
The other day,

658
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,230
we lost four more Dragon Fang Warriors

659
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,390
to the stone plague.

660
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,110
Gather all the warriors we have left!

661
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,020
If anything happens

662
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,460
to my daughter today,

663
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,540
you all have to go down with her!

664
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,120
Nitian Erxing.

665
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,710
You coward!

666
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,690
Hand over my daughter!

667
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,510
Nitian Erxing!

668
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,170
You coward!

669
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,050
Nitian Erxing!

670
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,730
Where is my daughter?

671
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,930
Give her back to me!

672
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,690
If there's a scratch on her,

673
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,240
I'll take your damn skull

674
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,890
to polish my Dragon Fang Mace.

675
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,080
Qiongxiong Ji'e.

676
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,510
Watch your mouth!

677
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,870
Your daughter is indeed in my tribe.

678
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,430
But I don't know

679
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,390
where she is now.

680
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,450
You should ask

681
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,150
that guy about it.

682
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,540
Why ask me?

683
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,010
I don't know her.

684
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,170
Today,

685
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,140
you brought her

686
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,470
to my tribe, didn't you?

687
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,210
Little Dragonfly?

688
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,820
Who are you?

689
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,120
Hand over my daughter!

690
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,000
Grand Marshal.

691
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,750
It's fine.

692
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,150
Let's see

693
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,630
what his divine power of the Colorless Realm can do.

694
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,180
Little Dragonfly is in the tribe.

695
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,840
Go in to look for her yourself.

696
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,360
Fighting with me here

697
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,620
is just a waste of time.

698
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,100
Ferocious Mace.

699
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,310
If you want to hurt Grand Marshal,

700
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,170
you have to get through me, Tiexue Wushuang, first.

701
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,550
All the soldiers

702
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,230
naturally rallied around him

703
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,960
and formed a formidable force.

704
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,910
Deadly Wringer!

705
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,140
I've killed countless people in my life,

706
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,000
but none of them were innocent.

707
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,910
I went easy on you

708
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,620
for the sake

709
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,290
of your dead brother.

710
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,470
Today,

711
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,760
you had the nerve to kidnap my daughter!

712
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,780
You gave me no choice but to kill you!

713
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,020
Daddy.

714
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,160
Daddy.

715
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,270
Little Dragonfly.

716
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,070
Daddy.

717
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,170
Little Dragonfly.

718
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,310
I was so worried about you.

719
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,310
Let me look at you.

720
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,430
Are you alright?

721
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,580
You killed people again.

722
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,430
No. Who did I kill?

723
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,590
Don't run away again.

724
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,430
Do you hear me?

725
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,190
I just wanted

726
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,470
to find something to eat before going home.

727
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,390
Daddy.

728
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,020
I don't want to eat bugs anymore.

729
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,720
Kid.

730
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,440
It's my fault.

731
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,320
I failed to let you

732
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,740
live a comfortable life.

733
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,470
Kid.

734
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,430
What's wrong, dear?

735
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,620
Let me see. Let me see.

736
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,840
Daddy's here.

737
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,880
Let me see.

738
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,840
It hurts.

739
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,810
What's wrong with her?

740
00:38:59,180 --> 00:38:59,960
It's the Petrification Sickness.

741
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,870
Daddy, it hurts.

742
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,550
Little Dragonfly, you'll be fine.

743
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,430
Daddy's here.

744
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,430
Daddy's here.

745
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,500
You'll be fine.

746
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,770
Bai Cai.

747
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,210
What are you going to do?

748
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,550
It hurts.

749
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,390
I won't let anything happen to you.

750
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,390
Daddy's here.

751
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,630
I have medical experience.

752
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,430
Can I check on her?

753
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,400
It hurts.

754
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,370
It hurts.

755
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,420
It hurts.

756
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,690
You'll be fine.

757
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,420
I'm here with you.

758
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,000
Daddy.

759
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,240
You'll be fine. I'm here with you.

760
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,000
I won't let anything happen to you.

761
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,110
It hurts.
