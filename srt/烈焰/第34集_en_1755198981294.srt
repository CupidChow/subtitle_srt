00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,900
[Episode 34]

4
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,270
Building a new world

5
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,590
is a beautiful wish.

6
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,950
But if one day

7
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,030
the three realms are wiped out,

8
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,390
can Illusion Island stay aloof?

9
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,230
Shang.

10
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,310
As your friend,

11
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,630
I don't want to sway you.

12
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,650
But only by refining qi

13
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,830
can mortals

14
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,190
be stronger.

15
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,390
I just need

16
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,750
a portion of the island.

17
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,200
So they can defend themselves

18
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,250
when they're attacked.

19
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,630
Then I'll be

20
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,470
helping you start the war.

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,670
So stubborn.

22
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,600
When we were in the mine,

23
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,310
no one believed

24
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,560
we could escape.

25
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,550
But in the end,

26
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,350
we did it.

27
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,750
Shang, trust me.

28
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,610
I can't make the decision.

29
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,470
But I'll ask Chief

30
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,430
if she agrees

31
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
to lend you a place for cultivation.

32
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,690
Gou!

33
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,010
Gou, you'd better not

34
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,470
leave me

35
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,950
ever again.

36
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,150
Come on.

37
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,430
I

38
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,070
won't leave you.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,950
Remember.

40
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,720
Are you thinking about her?

41
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,630
Uncle Ziyu.

42
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,390
I think there's always a wall

43
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,750
between Bai Cai and I.

44
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,550
Whenever we try

45
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,680
to live well,

46
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,510
fate

47
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,790
would get in the way

48
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,030
and disrupt our peace.

49
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,750
She's part of Immortal Clan now.

50
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,600
She even killed Lan.

51
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,850
I should hate her

52
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,550
like an enemy.

53
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,040
But I can't.

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,190
Others might believe in fate,

55
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,390
but I know

56
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,230
your father wouldn't.

57
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,670
I remember

58
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,270
he used to say

59
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,230
that fate

60
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,030
is in your own hands.

61
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,910
People

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,190
fight against fate

63
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,680
because things are unpredictable

64
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,390
and fate is full of disasters.

65
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,590
If your father

66
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,190
were someone who compromised,

67
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,990
he'd never had

68
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,270
gone against the immortals' oppression

69
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,870
for the mortals' interests,

70
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,750
or had you with your mother

71
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,430
while risking

72
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,600
condemnation.

73
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,190
Your parents

74
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,270
have been fighting

75
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,140
for the fate of humans.

76
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,550
Now,

77
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,670
it's your and Bai Cai's turn.

78
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,870
Remember what your father said.

79
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,909
Fate

80
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,140
is in your own hands.

81
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,560
Uncle Ziyu.

82
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,870
You've been here for so long.

83
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,550
Do you know

84
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,270
how one can recover

85
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,670
after

86
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,840
their divine spirit has been invaded?

87
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,480
I once heard

88
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,390
the ancient Grand Demon

89
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,400
can read minds.

90
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,430
He might

91
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,430
have the answer.

92
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,300
She agreed

93
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,300
to let you

94
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,030
bring mortals here to refine qi.

95
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,470
But you have to

96
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,550
stay in your area

97
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,350
and not disturb the islanders.

98
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,550
Great!

99
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,470
Shang.

100
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,510
Thank you.

101
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,030
I didn't make

102
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,630
the decision.

103
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,750
Even so,

104
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,070
I know

105
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,190
it's not easy to persuade

106
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,030
Venerable Bai Yue.

107
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,830
We were once

108
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,630
friends

109
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,070
in the mine after all.

110
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,790
Hurry.

111
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,110
Hurry. This way.

112
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,270
Move it over. Hurry.

113
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,030
Hurry up.

114
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,430
Hurry up.

115
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,590
Hurry up.

116
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,140
Hurry.

117
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,030
We're going on an expedition.

118
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,430
Show your drive!

119
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,360
Master!

120
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,340
Master!

121
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,190
Master.

122
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,190
Zhazha.

123
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,230
Where's your father?

124
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,110
Master.

125
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,170
My father asked me to give this to you.

126
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,240
Wu Geng.

127
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,670
I can't go to battle with you

128
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,150
and fight against enemies,

129
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,190
but you can use

130
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,429
Northern Mountain Mine

131
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,070
to help you hide your warships.

132
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,870
This is

133
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,710
all I can do.

134
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,270
The future of everyone in the mine

135
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,669
is in your hands.

136
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,900
I believe you can defeat Immortal Clan.

137
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,030
Master.

138
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,790
What did

139
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,530
my father tell you?

140
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,200
He said

141
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,950
to discipline you strictly,

142
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,070
so you don't cause any more trouble.

143
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,190
My father wouldn't say that!

144
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,860
Zhazha. Remember.

145
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,590
A real man

146
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,190
is a man of his word

147
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,430
and upright,

148
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,150
like your father.

149
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,190
Okay, I can do that.

150
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,030
Master.

151
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,130
I won't let you down.

152
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,630
Mr. Chen Jing,

153
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,660
thank you

154
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,280
for your help in this battle.

155
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,260
I won't let you down.

156
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,430
There's more sunlight here now.

157
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,150
Yes.

158
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,350
A Centurion

159
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,510
called Gou

160
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,320
made many reforms

161
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,760
throughout the mine

162
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,460
and improved

163
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,660
the slaves' lives.

164
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,590
The most important thing

165
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,670
is letting more sunlight

166
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,850
into the mine.

167
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,620
That's why they opened up the mine's ceiling

168
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,470
even more.

169
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,210
Look.

170
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,670
I know this Gou.

171
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,860
When he was in the mine,

172
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,480
he also planted a pot of morning glory.

173
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,670
Morning glory?

174
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,550
Are you talking about that area?

175
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,720
Look over there!

176
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,230
I'll take you there.

177
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,030
There.

178
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,750
Up here. Look.

179
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,370
Be careful.

180
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,950
This area.

181
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,190
All of them.

182
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,270
Sir,

183
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,550
I'll get back to work.

199
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,550
No matter

200
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,950
who you are in the future,

201
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,070
you'll always be my Gou.

202
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,220
♫It's always been like a dream♫

203
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,720
♫But this love is engraved in my heart♫

204
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,140
♫How many times do you need to look back if you spend a lifetime together?♫

205
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,770
♫If you're destined to be alone♫

206
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,750
♫There's no way out♫

207
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,320
♫Don’t ask why or about honor and disgrace♫

208
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,830
I'm warning you.

209
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,950
Don't ever

210
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,750
risk your life again.

211
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,470
Only when you're alive

212
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,420
♫I once trampled mountains and rivers♫

213
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,430
can you achieve great things...

214
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,190
All right.

215
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,080
♫And grieved over the suffering in the world♫

216
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,070
Got it.

217
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,280
♫Willing to fight against the recurrence of fate together♫

218
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,990
Bai Cai, look.

219
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,830
The morning glory

220
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,390
you used to treasure

221
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,940
♫Wherever we meet♫

222
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,190
are now blooming

223
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,190
♫The flowers fall♫

224
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,670
in crowds.

225
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,640
♫Don't ask why or about the path ahead♫

226
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,300
Why are you crying?

227
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,710
Nothing.

228
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,470
It's been so long since I had meat.

229
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,530
It's so delicious.

230
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,990
Why are you so nice to me?

231
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,990
Because you're Bai Cai

232
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,270
and I'm Gou.

233
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,880
♫Wild geese pass by in the autumn wind♫

234
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,250
♫Leaves know the sky is cold♫

235
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,640
♫In a drunken stupor; I'm desolate♫

236
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,410
♫Dreams of good times are in vain♫

237
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,400
♫The moon in the sky is not me♫

238
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:09,350
♫Fair or unfair, it's all wrong♫

239
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,190
Kid.

240
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,880
♫Life is unpredictable♫

241
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,670
Good job.

242
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,930
♫Forget the evenings; forget the mornings♫

243
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,070
Grandpa.

244
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,760
♫Laughing at lovers for torturing themselves♫

245
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,270
How are you now?

246
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,830
I'm ready

247
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,840
to head to Immortal Realm.

248
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,450
♫I can see the wind and rain outside the curtain♫

249
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,070
Hang in there.

250
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,030
I'll save you soon.

251
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,820
♫If it's unforgettable, why do I ponder about it?♫

252
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,830
Yang Datou!

253
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,630
Here!

254
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,350
Ming!

255
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,110
Here!

256
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,650
Your Highness.

257
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,910
These warriors are picked by

258
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,750
Mr. Chen and I

259
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,670
for qi refinement

260
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,990
at Illusion Island.

261
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,350
Liang? You're here too.

262
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,150
Centurion.

263
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,690
You still remember me?

264
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,950
Because of how

265
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,710
you

266
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,350
protected the weak and sickly,

267
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,070
we had

268
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,190
the will to live.

269
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,670
At that time, I swore

270
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,310
to follow you

271
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,590
if I got the chance.

272
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,150
Ridiculous.

273
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,630
How dare you call His Highness

274
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,620
"Centurion"?

275
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,750
It's okay.

276
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,230
Just call me Wu Geng.

277
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,070
You're likely

278
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,550
to die in this endeavor.

279
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,890
Aren't you afraid?

280
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,900
No!

281
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,430
My parents

282
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,890
were killed by immortals.

283
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,720
I must

284
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,990
take revenge.

285
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,550
Take revenge!

286
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,710
Take revenge!

287
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,910
Take revenge!

288
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,110
Take revenge!

289
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,390
Take revenge!

290
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,370
We are

291
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,630
not as powerful

292
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,770
as the immortals.

293
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,430
But we're united

294
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,630
with great teamwork

295
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,070
and fearless.

296
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,590
Go to Illusion Island

297
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,090
and refine qi diligently.

298
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,650
In face of your power,

299
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,210
those immortals

300
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,870
who trampled on you

301
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,790
will tremble!

302
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,700
Okay!

303
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,630
When are we

304
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,620
setting off?

305
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,830
Right away!

306
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,220
Uncle Ziyu.

307
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,430
From now on,

308
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,630
Uncle Ziyu will lead

309
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,790
their cultivation.

310
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,950
Okay.

311
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,690
Your Highness.

312
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,390
On our way here,

313
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,110
you said Illusion Island is dangerous.

314
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,190
How so?

315
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,670
It's so beautiful!

316
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,630
When I first came here,

317
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,270
I thought the same.

318
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,430
But danger will come soon.

319
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,630
So don't let your guard down.

320
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,620
My sword...

321
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,420
To become a qi refiner,

322
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,370
you need to first abandon material weapons,

323
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,790
and then refine qi

324
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,590
and use it to make your own weapon.

325
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,950
Great Swordsman.

326
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,030
Is this refined qi?

327
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,950
Yes.

328
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,910
All refined qi on this island

329
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,110
comes from

330
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,190
the giant tree

331
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,430
behind me.

332
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,020
Places with qi

333
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,550
are full of life.

334
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,070
It keeps circulating

335
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,350
around the island.

336
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,230
General An.

337
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,150
When can we

338
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,990
start cultivating?

339
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Great Swordsman.

340
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,440
Although we're martial artists,

341
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,390
we have no idea how to refine qi.

342
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,150
To achieve something,

343
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,430
it'll take

344
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,650
at least years.

345
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,790
Wouldn't the invasion plan

346
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,670
be delayed?

347
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,830
Don't worry.

348
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,230
One year here

349
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,030
is a day outside.

350
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,630
Geng must have told you.

351
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,870
Yes, he mentioned it.

352
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,670
Okay.

353
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,550
After Bai Cai struck me in the heart,

354
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,090
I fell off the cliff.

355
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,070
Why am I not dead?

356
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,190
I'm even back at Immortal Realm.

357
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,530
Lan, you're awake.

358
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,770
Grand Elder Shen Yan.

359
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,630
Why am I here?

360
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,150
You were hurt by the Crystal Glory.

361
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,870
You should've died.

362
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,790
I saved your life.

363
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,390
But I'm a traitor.

364
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,550
Why did you save me?

365
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,650
It’s Xinyue Kui's business to destroy you.

366
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,570
Now I’m entrusted.

367
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,140
I must be loyal.

368
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,330
Come on. I'll take you to see him.

369
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,830
Then you'll know

370
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,230
why I saved you.

371
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,470
Say whatever

372
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,960
you need to quickly.

373
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,670
The patrolling general

374
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,390
will be here soon.

375
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,960
High Priest!

376
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,880
High Priest.

377
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,990
High Priest.

378
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,070
Lan?

379
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,730
Lan, is that you?

380
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,230
Lan.

381
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,250
Yes, it's me!

382
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,910
Good.

383
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,990
Good girl.

384
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,590
It's useless.

385
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,550
Kid, it's useless.

386
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,230
I'm sorry.

387
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,170
High Priest.

388
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,590
I failed to protect Wu Geng.

389
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,540
Don't cry.

390
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,150
Kid.

391
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,670
You've done well.

392
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,100
High Priest.

393
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,230
Will you die?

394
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,400
Will Wu Geng die?

395
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,190
My Kongshi power

396
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,730
has been taken away by Xinyue Kui.

397
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,900
I can't feel Wu Geng's existence.

398
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,640
But I believe

399
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,440
Wu Geng

400
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,470
won't die so easily.

401
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,270
I also believe

402
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,830
you will live well.

403
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,190
High Priest.

404
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,500
What else can I do?

405
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,870
Kid.

406
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,710
Cooperate with Grand Elder Shen Yan.

407
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,360
He has

408
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,630
the same goal as us.

409
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,440
Rest assured, High Priest.

410
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,590
As you ordered,

411
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,990
I'll listen to Grand Elder Shen Yan.

412
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,230
Good. Good girl.

413
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,910
Go now.

414
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,880
Go now.

415
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,580
Go now.

416
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,570
I'm willing to

417
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,020
die for you.

418
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,850
Good!

419
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,550
Lan.

420
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,990
You're an excellent warrior,

421
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,780
and also smart and sensible.

422
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,630
From now on,

423
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,270
work for me

424
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,270
and you'll get

425
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,110
everything you want.

426
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,920
Thank you, Grand Elder.

427
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,670
Let’s go.

428
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,030
Colorless power?

429
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,110
What happened?

430
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,910
Isn't Wu Geng dead?

431
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,870
Wu Geng's not dead?

432
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,190
The invasion prophecy isn't gone.

433
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,870
Then let him die again.

434
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,210
The divine power

435
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,530
perfectly combined

436
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,810
with refined qi.

437
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,030
Geng.

438
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,030
This trip was worth it.

439
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,070
Great.

440
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,210
As expected of Your Highness.

441
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,390
Shouldn't we say goodbye

442
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,230
to Shang?

443
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,270
During our days here,

444
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,110
Shang never once showed up.

445
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,070
Shang?

446
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,780
I still don't agree

447
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,870
with your

448
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,270
revenge philosophy.

449
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,720
But we're still friends

450
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,270
who shared weal and woe.

451
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,630
So I'm here to

452
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,760
say a final goodbye.

453
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,020
Final goodbye?

454
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,560
Illusion Island is relocating

455
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,270
to be completely isolated

456
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,030
and stay out of the three realms' disputes.

457
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,870
I'm moving with it.

458
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,510
Shang, don't worry.

459
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,100
We are going to

460
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,390
end the three realms' disputes.

461
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,270
I hope you keep your promise.

462
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,470
Deal.

463
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,790
Deal.

464
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,230
You, use Kongshi power

465
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,590
to find him.

466
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,430
He went to Demon Realm?

467
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,700
Got it.

468
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,790
I'll ask Tai Ji and Liu Yue

469
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,720
to go with you...

470
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,970
How arrogant.

471
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,870
Nitian Erxing and the 13 Generals

472
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,830
are still at Demon Realm.

473
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,550
Are you so sure

474
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,680
you can kill Wu Geng?

475
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,390
If she fails

476
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,100
and gets hurt,

477
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,910
how can I explain to Immortal King?

478
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,270
I purposely released

479
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,430
my Colorless power.

480
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,590
Looks like you received my message.

481
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,220
Did you lure me here

482
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,670
to take revenge?

483
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,400
No.

484
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,510
To help you find yourself.

485
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,410
Ridiculous.

486
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,950
Do you think

487
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,350
such demonic formation

488
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,590
will work?

489
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,670
Let's find out.

490
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,310
Wu Geng, it's up to you.

491
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,680
Wu Geng, don't waste your energy.

492
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,870
Don't try to inspire me

493
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,430
with your love.

494
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,510
It's useless!

495
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,040
Since I made it in,

496
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,150
I'm confident.

497
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,910
Cut the crap and get out!

498
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,110
Burning your

499
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,310
divine spirit?

500
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,070
How stupid and stubborn.

501
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,930
But it's useless against me.

502
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,670
Since you're willing

503
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,070
to die to save others,

504
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,840
I'll grant your wish!

505
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,650
Aren't you giving up?

506
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,980
I never

507
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,390
give up.

508
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,590
See? I told you it'd change.

509
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,110
Wu Geng, Bai Cai's back.

510
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,710
You can take her away.

511
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,890
I've waited for 100,000 years,

512
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,570
just to see the Immortal Clan perish.

513
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,160
Can you make it happen?

514
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,710
We'll do our best.

515
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,530
Thank you, Senior.

516
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,290
Before leaving Illusion Island,

517
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,670
through the messenger crystal,

518
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,270
Nitian Erxin had agreed

519
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,390
to find Yongheng Zhiye

520
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,690
to set up the formation

521
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,010
and wait for you to walk into the trap.

522
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,930
Grand Marshal.

523
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,070
Thank you for all you did for me.

524
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,070
No need.

525
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,740
You should thank Wu Geng.

526
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,500
All this time, he took care of you

527
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,560
and protected you,

528
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,430
determined

529
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,630
to save you.

530
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,110
Bai Cai.

531
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,550
We've

532
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,280
been through so much together.

533
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,030
Nothing would make me

534
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,870
abandon you

535
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,440
at the critical moment.

536
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,430
So I never gave up.

537
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,910
Because I knew

538
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,310
you'd come.

539
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,790
All right,

540
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,030
we can talk

541
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,310
after we win the battle.

542
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,670
I've assembled my men.

543
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,930
We can set out anytime.

544
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,150
Uncle Ziyu and General An

545
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,630
are leading the mortal warriors

546
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,710
to the mine.

547
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,190
But if the demon army

548
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,590
and the mortal warriors gather in the mine,

549
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,469
it might alert Immortal Clan.

550
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,070
Chen Jing said,

551
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,290
four months later,

552
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,230
bloodstones

553
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,190
will be transported to Immortal Realm.

554
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,110
For now,

555
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,520
let's prepare for the battle separately.

556
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,880
When the time is right,

557
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,909
we can gather in the mine and set out.

558
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,670
I'll send my order now.

559
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,630
Let's go.

560
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,310
What's wrong, Bai Cai?

561
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,670
Gou, I remember everything.

562
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,030
I threw you off the cliff.

563
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,070
I also killed Lan and Zi Dian.

564
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,630
How can I face

565
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,469
Shenyin Clan?

566
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,690
You used the Crystal Glory

567
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,030
to detoxify me

568
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,110
and it backfired.

569
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,630
Trust me.

570
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,670
No matter what may come,

571
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,679
I'll face it with you.

572
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,080
Don't be afraid.

573
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,840
Let's go.

574
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,000
The prophecy scene has appeared.

575
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,680
Wu Geng's still alive indeed.

576
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,220
That's great.

577
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,170
Murderer!

578
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,990
You killed Lan and Zi Dian!

579
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,090
Pay with your life!

580
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,250
Murderer!

581
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,950
Wu Xia, you fool.

582
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,790
Don't attack her.

583
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,670
She might kill you too.

584
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,870
Everyone, calm down.

585
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,030
Listen to me.

586
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,750
Bai Cai has recovered.

587
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,100
She won't kill again.

588
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,810
I brought her back

589
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,300
to apologize to you.

590
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,470
I'm sorry.

591
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,190
I killed

592
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,900
Lan and Zi Dian.

593
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,350
On my way back from Demon Realm,

594
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,590
I've been thinking

595
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,870
about how

596
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,680
I can ask for your forgiveness.

597
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,090
But if I were in your shoes,

598
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,270
I wouldn't forgive someone

599
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,600
whom I treated as family

600
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,430
murdering me either.

601
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,430
So I can't

602
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,360
forgive myself.

603
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,220
Maybe...

604
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,880
I can only atone with my death.

605
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,430
Who knows if

606
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,560
you're lying again?

607
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,790
I'm sorry.

608
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,510
I was wrong.

609
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,990
If I have to die to apologize,

610
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,470
can you give me some time?

611
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,720
Let me join you

612
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,870
in the invasion

613
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,310
to seek justice

614
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,190
and take revenge

615
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,070
on Xinyue Kui.

616
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,830
If I come back alive,

617
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,790
I'll be

618
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,830
at your disposal.

619
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,350
You shouldn't

620
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,800
even have come back this time.

621
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,220
Wu Geng.

622
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,390
The Heaven-Breaking Army has many people.

623
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,420
We don't need her.

624
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,830
Why are you rubbing salt in the wound

625
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,030
by bringing her back?

626
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,870
I didn't

627
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,890
bring her back for nothing.

628
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,950
Senior.

629
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,760
I just don't understand one thing.

630
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,910
How is Bai Cai related to

631
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,990
Immortal Clan?

632
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,990
She is a key

633
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,000
that Hei Long has been looking for

634
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,670
for 100,000 years.

635
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,830
Key?

636
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,990
In the war 100,000 years ago,

637
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,240
Hei Long defeated

638
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,670
Gen Gu, the former Immortal Clan leader,

639
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,230
and Gen Gu

640
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,150
and the other Grand Immortals' spirits

641
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,470
were dispersed.

642
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,510
So, Gen Gu used his remaining power to seal

643
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,660
their divine spirits

644
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,070
in the Crystal Mountain

645
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,510
and threw the crystal key

646
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,070
out of Immortal Realm.

647
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,310
The key circulated in the three realms

648
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,670
before disappearing.

649
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,390
If Hei Long

650
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,870
gets this power,

651
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,990
then...

652
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,630
He'll have

653
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,610
the power to destroy the world.

654
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,120
Only by bringing Bai Cai back

655
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,190
can we ensure

656
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,630
a successful invasion.

657
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,790
Wu Geng.

658
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,000
Are you sure Bai Cai's

659
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,730
no longer under their control?

660
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,990
I've helped her

661
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,670
get rid of her dark spirit.

662
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,230
She won't be controlled anymore.

663
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,590
I swear on my life,

664
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,430
Bai Cai won't hurt

665
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,230
any of us

666
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,390
anymore.

667
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,390
Please trust her

668
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,670
and me.

669
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,230
Give her a chance

670
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,230
to fight with everyone.

671
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,310
The war is near.

672
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,910
I believe

673
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,470
she'll make amends

674
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,710
with her actions.

675
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,950
We'll keep that in mind.

676
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,340
We'll deal with her after the invasion.

677
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,080
Keep your promise.

678
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,470
Come back alive,

679
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,910
so

680
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,670
I can avenge Lan myself!

681
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,590
Okay, Wu Xia. Wait for me.

682
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,390
Come on.

683
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,360
Thank you, Gou.

684
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,670
I'd be lost

685
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,670
without you.

686
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,710
They just need

687
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,910
some time to

688
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,070
make peace with it.

689
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,290
Bai Cai has regained consciousness?

690
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,960
Immortal King, don’t worry.

691
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,430
I will bring Bai Cai back.

692
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,470
Your plan won't be ruined.

693
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,070
Clan Leader, thank you

694
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,670
for re-accepting Bai Cai.

695
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,270
Re-accept?

696
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,190
It's not that easy.

697
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,470
Since you and Bai Cai

698
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,870
came to Shenyin Village,

699
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,910
everyone treated you

700
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,470
as family.

701
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,310
We saw

702
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,870
our trusted Bai Cai

703
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,060
kill our people.

704
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,230
Rationally, I know

705
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,830
Bai Cai was controlled,

706
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,830
but I still

707
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,230
can't get over it.

708
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,910
I brought her

709
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,280
into this whirlpool,

710
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,990
such that the immortals

711
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,110
found a chance to use her

712
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,750
to hurt my friends.

713
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,360
But I believe

714
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,270
you know just as well

715
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,870
how kind and innocent Bai Cai is.

716
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,670
She'd never hurt anyone.

717
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,370
I hope everyone

718
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,360
wouldn't treat her as an enemy,

719
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,180
and give her some time

720
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,310
to regain

721
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,390
everyone's trust.

722
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,390
I know.

723
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,080
Don't worry.

724
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,230
We've lost

725
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,630
Lan and Zi Dian.

726
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,150
We can't lose

727
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,310
any more comrades.

728
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,560
Thank you, Clan Leader.

729
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,730
The mortal warriors

730
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,620
under Uncle Ziyu and General An's lead

731
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,500
and the demon army

732
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,710
under Nitian Erxing's lead

733
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,910
have assembled here.

734
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,070
We'll set off soon.

735
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,430
I'll order everyone

736
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,030
to be prepared.

737
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,510
Bei.

738
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,350
Gou told me

739
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,350
about you

740
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,470
saving him at sea.

741
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,870
Thank you for saving him.

742
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,120
You're welcome.

743
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,510
Gou?

744
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,190
Do you mean Wu Geng?
