Episode 4

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,640
What do you think? Do you like it?

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,800
It’s nice. You must have worked hard.

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,520
Oh, not at all.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,190
Now, the only thing left is to run straight to the election.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,940
As long as I have Manager Lee.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,060
Oh, Principal Hong, you’ve come.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,100
Oh, however, you look a little…

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,880
- This is nice here. Really nice.
- Yes.

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,920
Over there. Why don’t you sit comfortably and talk?

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,940
Please come in.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,380
Wow, this view is really nice.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,180
It’s really fine and very nice.

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,980
Please sit down.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,860
Yes.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,340
Why are you doing that?

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,920
Huh? Ah, nothing.

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,760
Should I get you a cup of water at least?

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,500
No, that’s okay. That’s okay.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,440
It’s nice.

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,080
However, that creature, at least for the time being,
he’ll be anxious, won’t he?

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,820
The more I think about it,
the more it pleases me.

24
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,280
Then for us, what is our next plan?

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Uh…

26
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,340
We’re in the middle of thinking about it.

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,400
We can just think about it.

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,280
We’ll have to think about it.

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,840
Oh, here, here, here!

30
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, why are you going over there?

31
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,320
Stay quiet. Stay quiet. Stay quiet.

32
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,460
Are you crazy?

33
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,440
Where do you think this is
that you came here to find me?

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,620
If you come to find me one more time, then...

35
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,140
Thanks to whom that you even have a son who is
like a gift from heaven?

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,000
I told you not to contact me first.

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,940
If you talk to the conspirator like this,
then I'm so disappointed.

38
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,720
So?

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,780
When are you going to sell the land?

40
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,200
That. It’s not going to be as easy as we thought.

41
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,880
I didn’t know that he would be so stridently
against it.

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,800
Still, how can you let it happen that the child
ended up at the police station?

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,980
Well, how was I supposed to know that he
would show up that day like that?

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,440
Still, whether you look at it this way or that,
according to the law, it’s mine.

45
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,400
So you just have to deal with him.

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,320
Don’t just blame it on the child.
Just take care of it.

47
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,880
And don’t do anything foolish.

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,460
Why are you leaving already?
I still have things to say.

49
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,480
Your nostrils! If you want to gain
something from me, then stay quiet.

50
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,800
I mean, am I the kind of person who will stay quiet
just because I’m told to stay quiet?

51
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,180
Surely, it's not that you have no plan, is it?

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,860
Anyway, Madam and I have become colleagues.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,020
I only judged that it would become a bigger
revenge against my husband.

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,250
Of course. It’s win-win for both of us.

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,540
However, what shall I do in the house from now on?

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,200
What?

57
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,880
Since we can’t look as if we’re too close.

58
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,450
I don’t think that is something that you have to worry about.

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
How is it that the two of you are coming in together?

60
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,060
Oh, we met here at the front of the house.

61
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,600
Yah, if you ride this, your spirits
will really feel good. Try this on.

62
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,660
I said no.

63
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,340
There is the sincerity of the person who came
here to see you. So, aren’t you being too much?

64
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,140
Baek Seo Yeon!

65
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,320
Seo Yeon.

66
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,320
A little while ago downstairs,
I saw you with a boy.

67
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,460
Who is he?

68
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,760
He’s a friend, of course.

69
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,680
A friend? Who?

70
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,300
If I tell you, would you even know him?

71
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,280
Is he a close friend?

72
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,940
Why? What is it that you want to know?

73
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,600
It’s just… Seo Yeon, perhaps, at your school

74
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,560
do you know Hee Soo?

75
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,080
How does mom know him?

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,320
Oh, he’s the son of a close friend.

77
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,020
And the child seems very nice.

78
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,720
Why? Do you wish you had a son like him?

79
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,320
No!

80
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,680
How could… No. It’s not that.

81
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,800
Hee Soo has been bullied by some bad kids at school.

82
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,180
What does Mom know to speak badly of my friends?!

83
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
You… you also bullied him with them?

84
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,540
Yes. Is there a reason why I can’t do that?

85
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
Seo Yeon!

86
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
So annoying.

87
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,300
Seo Yeon!

88
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,480
Why do you go around with kids like that?!

89
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,800
Seo Yeon!

90
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,060
Seo Yeon!

91
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,180
Talk to Mom! Okay?

92
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,280
Seo Yeon!

93
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,880
You can’t hang around with kids like that!

94
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,260
Seo Yeon!

95
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,500
Seo Yeon!

96
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,060
Seo Yeon!

97
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,940
Uh?

98
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,240
Right now? I understand.

99
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,400
Soo Gyum! Soo Gyum!

100
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,740
Son! Soo Gyum!

101
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,380
I think he wants to see you. That’s why
he’s pushing his meeting and coming by.

102
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,640
You know what’s important to do, right?

103
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,060
Yes.

104
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,880
You have to mind your manners and greet him properly.

105
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,600
Yes.

106
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,080
He’s coming.

107
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,180
Father, you’ve come.

108
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,480
If you had told me earlier, we would
have come to the airport.

109
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,200
Get in.

110
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,780
Yes.

111
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,260
Soo Gyum, get in over there next to your grandfather.

112
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,880
Aren’t you going in?

113
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,800
However... Isn’t there something a bit strange
about that kid as you look at him?

114
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,920
He seems okay, but then occasionally when you
look at him, you can’t tell at all what he’s thinking.

115
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,240
Didn’t you feel that?

116
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,820
Who would the son resemble?

117
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,260
I mean, you. No matter how much you’re like that

118
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,340
You couldn’t even just say “Father, you’ve come."

119
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,200
Is it my fault that you were pushed aside?

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,900
Pushed aside? Me?

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,820
To whom?

122
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,000
You’re making a lot of effort.

123
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,980
That’s why. If only you didn’t have that flaw…

124
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,200
No. That is... what I’m trying to say is…

125
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,440
It’s not that I’m saying it’s your fault…

126
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,600
It’s because I’m flawed that I met a man like you.

127
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,860
Hello?

128
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,880
Yes.

129
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,860
Yes. I understand.

130
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,660
You’ve come?

131
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,460
Yes.

132
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,040
Oh, he’s good looking!

133
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,720
He must be your grandson.

134
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,980
Give me a large portion of that.

135
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,020
What would you like?

136
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,140
I’ll have blood stew.

137
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,160
He’s definitely your grandson.

138
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,560
Blood stew - two of them!

139
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,160
My sons, because they have delicate digestive
systems, have never eaten that with me.

140
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,040
Since I was very young, on market days,

141
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,400
it’s something I ate with my grandmother.
So I like it.

142
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,200
Really?

143
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,420
Have a delicious meal.

144
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,280
You must think about your grandmother a lot.

145
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,380
Yes.

146
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,840
They said that you came as soon as she was buried.

147
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,600
Why did you rush too much?

148
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,980
I was curious about the family
who came looking for me now.

149
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,800
So now that you’ve seen them, how do they look?

150
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,620
What kind of a person do you think I am?

151
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,040
Like a chairman.

152
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,120
So I guess I don’t seem like a grandfather to you then.

153
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,540
What kind of a grandson does Grandfather want me to be?

154
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,120
Let’s find out as we go.

155
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,400
Let’s eat.

156
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,060
Yes. I’ll eat well.

157
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,250
One hour before the event, we will plan to have a rehearsal.

158
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,880
For a doctor’s conference, isn’t this a little too small?

159
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,820
We’ll change the location.

160
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,020
The conference room?

161
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,640
Yes. Please come this way.

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,160
So, you’ve gained a son?

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,040
If something like that happens, isn’t it good manners to tell the family properly?

164
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,180
Your husband telling Jeong Jun just in passing isn't enough.

165
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,080
I didn’t have a chance to do so.

166
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,920
Of course, it must have been that.

167
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,320
Has the Chairman seen the son yet?

168
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,560
Yes.

169
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,300
What will you do?

170
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,200
If he were young, you might had at least
a chance to develop some affection.

171
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,150
You should think it’s a relief that he’s all grown up.

172
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,940
Bring the child to Mother’s birthday.

173
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,180
We should see his face at least.

174
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,980
What? Did you have something more to say?

175
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,900
No.

176
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,400
Mi Sook!

177
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,360
This turned out well.

178
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,380
However, what kind of a place is this?

179
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,680
Unnie came along, too?

180
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,220
Should I leave now?

181
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,920
No. I just…

182
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,360
Let’s go. Let’s go.

183
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,260
You are saying that if you do this,
you’re able to relieve your stress?

184
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,460
I seem to have cut this.

185
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,260
How is Madam doing with this?

186
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,020
Are you relieving some stress?

187
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,480
Ah!

188
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,850
This does completely relieve the stress anyway.

189
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,800
Oh! Omona. You’re a specialist! A specialist.

190
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
Omo, what in the world.

191
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,540
She can be proud of herself. Very proud.

192
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,640
We did well.

193
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,860
It must have been the first time for our Madam as well.

194
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,280
I just wondered if it would relieve some of our stress.

195
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,280
Did something happen to you today?

196
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,460
It’s okay now since I’ve met you, Unnie.

197
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,820
That’s right. Whenever you get stressed, just call us over.

198
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,880
However, today, where shall we go for a second round?

199
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,480
Why? Do you have to go home?

200
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,040
No.

201
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,360
However, is Hee Soo okay?

202
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Oh, he’s able to take care of his dinner
by himself just fine.

203
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,800
That’s not what I meant…

204
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,300
I just wondered if the student Jung Wook
wasn’t still harassing him afterwards.

205
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,460
It also continues to worry me. But Hee Soo
just keeps saying that things are fine.

206
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,720
Oh, right!

207
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,460
Did you say her name was Seo Yeon?

208
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,180
Yes?

209
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,900
Your daughter!

210
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,960
I've been meaning to ask Hee Soo about her,
but I keep forgetting.

211
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,620
Let’s go. Let’s go.

212
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,320
Oh! What are you doing here, darling?

213
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,760
Oh. Yes. I. That is…

214
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,740
I asked to see her. I thought we could exercise
together in order to become closer to each other.

215
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,840
Oh, really?

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh. Get in! Get in!

217
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,800
Go. Go. I can just go by myself.

218
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,780
We just came to play some screen golf
and are about to go out for dinner.

219
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,700
It’s good that it turned out this way.

220
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,820
Why don’t you come with us? I had wanted to
invite you for dinner some time, anyway.

221
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,500
Isn’t that right?

222
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,340
Ayy...

223
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,760
No matter whether you say this or that,

224
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,080
a woman without a husband is the most pitiful.

225
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,900
Now, why am I shaking this? Ayy...

226
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,080
Oh, what a waste. This.

227
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,450
<i>"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas,
Unnies, Dongsaengs and Haraboji of Avengers Subbing Club"</i>

228
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,940
I think we may know each other.

229
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,660
I'm sorry! (in Japanese)

230
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,900
Aigoo. You’re putting on quite a show.

231
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,620
Our eyes had met!

232
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,280
You shove this in your mouth!

233
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,280
I'm sorry!

234
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,100
Aigoo! What is this?!

235
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,820
Hey, you Ajumma! Oh!

236
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,720
When did I meet your eyes?

237
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,160
Stop putting up that unbelievable pretense.

238
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,480
Ajumma!

239
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,680
That day, you were dressed shabbily
like this as well!

240
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,040
You’ve mistaken me for someone else.

241
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,540
Ajumma!

242
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,820
Because of Ajumma, I had to wear
a cast for a long time

243
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,500
and damaged my elbow!

244
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,320
Because of that, I couldn’t work. The treatment
bill and for suffering mental anguish...

245
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,920
So how much is all of that…

246
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,660
Don’t lie! You look perfectly fine.

247
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,720
Lie?

248
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,980
How dare this woman injure a man and
then raise her voice?! I should just…

249
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,950
Why did you come here so early?

250
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,830
What?

251
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,470
Who is this man?

252
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,420
Oh.

253
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,210
It's raining. Let's get in.

254
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,250
Hey.

255
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,500
What happened?

256
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,000
Aigoo.

257
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,250
Drink slowly.

258
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,240
By the way how did you two meet?

259
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,640
Why? We don't match?

260
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,880
No,

261
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,180
because you two look good.

262
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,930
You followed her around a lot, right?

263
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,930
I did.

264
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,350
She was so nice and beautiful,

265
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,000
far too good for me.

266
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,810
Then you must treat her well even now?

267
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,680
Ah.

268
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,860
Of course.

269
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,850
I watched the news yesterday. A famous professor was proven to be a criminal, guilty of domestic violence.

270
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,860
Are you alright?

271
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,860
Yes.

272
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,130
Yes. I heard your son who is studying
abroad is so good at his studies.

273
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,890
He was.

274
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,840
Should we consider also sending our son abroad to study?

275
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,840
Whatever.

276
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,720
My son.

277
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,230
Seo Jin.

278
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,810
Excuse me. I don't feel good in my stomach,

279
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,810
I will get up ahead.

280
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,320
- Sunbae, why don't you go with her?
- She's alright.

281
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,640
Then why don't you go with her?

282
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,250
Drink slowly.

283
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,160
Unnie.

284
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,940
Why are you doing this, making me feel uncomfortable?

285
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,260
Until when will you just avoid it?

286
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,360
It's my family matter.

287
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,540
- It's also an Avengers Club matter.
- I...

288
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,960
..need more time.

289
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,960
I will go ahead.

290
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,410
Jung Hye,

291
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,410
I'm going to Hong Do Unnie.

292
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,770
- I have something to tell her.
- I have something to tell her, too.

293
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,560
Right.

294
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,560
You should listen, too.

295
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,920
- Eh?
- I will tell you after we get there.

296
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,240
Have some.

297
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,440
Because it is said that chamomile has a soothing effect.

298
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,570
I can't get the taste.

299
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,210
Ah.

300
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,000
Camo... It is.

301
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,000
Thanks.

302
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,390
Leave them.

303
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,390
Are you okay?

304
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,770
- Didn't you get hurt?
- I'm okay.

305
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,620
What should I do with this?  I did it again.

306
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,620
I will surely pay for it.

307
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,840
No.

308
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,470
The phone.

309
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,240
Umm.

310
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,510
Are you coming now?

311
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,510
I see.

312
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,730
I think I'll be leaving now.

313
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,950
- But it's still raining.
- It's ok.

314
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,590
Wait a moment.

315
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,350
Use this while you're going home.

316
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,680
This alley is

317
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,690
rather dangerous for a woman to walk alone at night.

318
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,510
Please go home safely.

319
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,140
A woman? Who me? DH is talking to herself about how she could be seen as a woman.

320
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,940
<i>Seo Yeon,</i>

321
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,490
<i> Let's please talk today.</i>

322
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,020
<i>I trust you, Seo Yeon.</i>

323
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,770
<i>I am just worried.</i>

324
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,280
<i>If you keep going around with bad friends...</i>

325
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,210
- Why did they come?
- Get off, get off.

326
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,120
Hey wake up.

327
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,820
She will never ride it.

328
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,830
Why are you doing this?

329
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,360
Hee Soo!

330
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,550
Mom!

331
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,060
Hello.

332
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,420
Hey, hold tight.

333
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,810
Hee Soo!

334
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,630
Hee Soo!

335
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,240
- Are you alright?
- Are you okay?

336
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,240
Can you stand up?

337
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,010
Mom.

338
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,090
Aish.

339
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,600
I'm screwed.

340
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,760
- Hey, go!
- Uh?

341
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,350
I said go quickly,

342
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,780
Hey, Hwang Jung Wook!

343
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,440
- That punk!
- Seo Yeon!

344
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,700
Are you alright? Aren't you hurt?

345
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,170
- What happened?
- You saw it all.

346
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,120
Seo Yeon.

347
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,120
What's this?

348
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,750
Your daughter?

349
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,870
But why was she with Jung Wook?

350
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,870
- No she isn't.
- We're friends.

351
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,350
Seo Yeon.

352
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,770
Weren't you accomplices?

353
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,140
You should state that clearly.

354
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,820
Hyung, did you know her?

355
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,820
Yes. Just randomly.

356
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,280
- How much your mother must have been surprised.
- None of your business.

357
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,270
It's a relief you're only hurt this much.
It could have been much more serious.

358
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,240
It's all because of you.

359
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,610
You already know it, didn't you?

360
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,830
Unnie, you said you have something to talk about.

361
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,830
Why don't you say something?

362
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,680
My Seo Yeon...

363
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,510
is indeed a friend with Jung Wook.

364
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,080
So...

365
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,660
you’re saying your daughter is one of the party with Jung Wook?

366
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,570
No.

367
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,750
That wouldn't be so.

368
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,180
She is just a friend of them,

369
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,180
but she wouldn't do that.

370
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,220
- My kid just met wrong friends...
- Just met wrong friends?

371
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,530
That's what all parents say.

372
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,170
You also

373
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,690
want to say that your daughter is innocent.

374
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,110
- It's not like that.
- What's the difference between you and Jung Wook's mom?

375
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,770
Unnie, that's not so.

376
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,770
Please consider Mi Sook Unnie's stance, too.

377
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:18,760
Consider?

378
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,320
Consider what at this situation?

379
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,780
How can you say that seeing all that
Hee Soo and I had suffered?

380
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,640
You guys don't know.

381
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,830
All that's left to me is just my children.

382
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,600
You never know every morning,

383
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,030
how I feel seeing Hee Soo's back going to school.

384
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,150
I can't even show my worried face
because it may hurt his heart.

385
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,230
I think...

386
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,510
I can't help it.

387
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,510
I don't deserve to be...

388
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,520
in Avengers Club.

389
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,070
No, that should not be.

390
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,490
Unnie!

391
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,490
OK. Then quit it.

392
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,940
Mom!

393
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,090
Apologize to Hee Soo and his mother, come on.

394
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,600
Quickly.

395
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,660
Seo Yeon!

396
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,810
Hee Soo, I'm sorry.

397
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Mom, I'm okay.

398
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,720
Taxi! Taxi!

399
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,060
Why do you want to spend the money?
Let's take the bus.

400
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,590
Do you really want to see
Mom die of heartache?

401
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,760
Mom will not save money anymore.

402
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,070
Even if I don't have any, I'm going to live as if I have it.

403
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,530
So that you won't be disdained.

404
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,900
Why are you overreacting?

405
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,580
I've never been disdained.
I'm disdaining them.

406
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,860
As if, Jung Wook, that one guy wasn't enough,

407
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,860
it was Seo Yeon, that girl, as well.

408
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,860
Please stop.

409
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,150
Today was the first time I even knew her name was Baek Seo Yeon.
She was only riding in the back.

410
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,150
She got hurt more than I did.

411
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,120
Who is worrying about whom right now?

412
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,120
Mom,

413
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,120
I’m more worried about you.

414
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,290
The mom who worries only about me is my worry.

415
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,450
Everest, 8,848
K2, 8,611

416
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,450
Kangchenjunga, 8,586

417
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,120
Lohtse, 8,516
Majalu, 8,363

418
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,120
Cho Oyu, 8,201

419
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,880
Baek Seo Yeon.

420
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,680
Baek Seo Yeon.

421
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:33,040
- If you have something to say, do it later.
Now Seo Yeon is...
- Baek Seo Yeon, come here.

422
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,830
Baek Seo Yeon, come here.

423
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,280
What's this?

424
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,280
What are you doing around?

425
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,280
Aigoo, just leave her alone.

426
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,670
You aren't causing any trouble, are you?

427
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,800
You're the daughter of a
Superintendent of Education candidate.

428
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,710
You should have asked if I was alright.

429
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,160
- Go in, Seo Yeon.
- You always protect her like this
that's why she's like that!

430
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,700
I see, so let's talk.
You get in quickly.

431
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,700
Now more than ever, you must...

432
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,820
You...

433
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,710
Should you do it?

434
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,580
- More than the Superintendent of Education election,
what's more urgent to us is...
- It's all for our family...

435
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,860
Don't you know?

436
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,150
It's for you.

437
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,870
Seo Yeon.

438
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,200
Seo Yeon. It's alright. Mom is sorry.

439
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,330
Mom is sorry. Seo Yeon. Mom did wrong.

440
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,180
It's alright. It's alright.

441
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,000
Seo Yeon. It's alright. I'm sorry.

442
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,000
It's alright. It's alright.

443
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,470
It's alright. It's alright. Seo Yeon.

444
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,000
It's alright. It's alright. Seo Yeon.

445
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,230
Mom did wrong. Mom is sorry. Seo Yeon.

446
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,610
Seo Yeon. It's alright. It's alright

447
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,070
Look at Mom! Mom is...

448
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,790
The ajummas will reconcile soon.

449
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,320
They should.

450
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,120
Surely...

451
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,060
You aren't worried that the Avengers Club would really be broken, are you?

452
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,880
That you might not be able to take revenge?

453
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,000
It's not that kind of matter.

454
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,520
Eh, don't worry.

455
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,520
I will really do well.

456
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,890
My son is very sociable.

457
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,120
Hmm, isn't he?

458
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,800
You ate ox blood soup with Grandfather.

459
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,640
You're getting along with Mom well. Hmm?

460
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,760
Have you come?

461
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,690
My son,

462
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,360
how will you please me?

463
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,400
I'll prepare a gift for mother-in-law.

464
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,840
You don't have to take care of it.
I'll go there by myself.

465
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,960
What's your secret to getting along well
with your step mother?

466
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,960
I've lived with her for 10 years,
but I still don't know.

467
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,680
Ma'am, your flower bouquet is ready.

468
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,290
- You have to make a good impression
to the maternal elders.
- Yes.

469
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,910
Aren't we meeting Mother first before we go in?

470
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,110
Just come along.

471
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,930
Oh, Hyung!

472
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,620
- Have you been well?
- Ah, yes.

473
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,630
This is your uncle.
You should greet him.

474
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,200
Hello. How are you?

475
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,720
He seems to both resemble you
and not resemble you

476
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,770
at the same time.

477
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,420
Anyway, he’s good looking.

478
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,570
Well, of course. That means that he resembles me.

479
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,770
Yes.

480
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,700
You're here.
It would've been okay, though,

481
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,010
if you had done as you usually do
and just sent a present.

482
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,630
This time, I wanted to show you
the present directly myself.

483
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,710
Now, you won’t have to worry about
your daughter or me anymore.

484
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:11,950
Greet them.

485
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,140
My name is Lee Soo Gyum.

486
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,130
Happy birthday,

487
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,160
Grandmother.

488
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,280
Byung Soo, you’ll walk on a flower path from now on.
<i>**(means that he’ll live an easy life)</i>

489
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,420
Perhaps.

490
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,840
He has a way of upending flower paths after all.

491
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,320
Occasionally, the dirt has to be turned over
so that the farming can continue for a long time.

492
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,950
And do you have a contract for the farming?

493
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,780
Of course!

494
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,110
I already put in place all the
plans for setting up a new hotel.

495
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,080
They say you've gotten ahold of a decent possibility.

496
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,890
I guess that’s true.

497
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,790
Where is it?

498
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,300
I’ll discuss it with you separately.

499
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,520
You came?

500
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,450
Happy birthday.

501
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,440
Thank you.

502
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,560
She’s already received the present.

503
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,060
A very special present.

504
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,150
You’ll now be able to sympathize with mom’s feelings.

505
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,070
You can understand that kid's stance more than anyone.

506
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,990
Jung Min...

507
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,600
Oh, you didn’t know?

508
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,100
Since you both have the same background,

509
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,110
isn’t it a relief?

510
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,040
Noona, that’s enough.

511
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,500
I’m sorry.

512
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,080
I’ll leave first.

513
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:30,810
Why?

514
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,100
At least have some cake.

515
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,140
Noona, why are you eating mine?
- Then, you can eat some of mine, too.

516
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,980
Your fa--

517
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,810
I’m sorry, Unnie.

518
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,560
I told you not to call me your unnie.

519
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,620
Oh, wait.

520
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,250
How many years are there between you?

521
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,460
It must be embarrassing for you
to be called mom.

522
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,870
How can you live in the same house together when it must be so uncomfortable?

523
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,630
It’s fine.

524
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,060
Mother treats me very well.

525
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,850
Ohhh.

526
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,780
Your disposition is very good.

527
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,860
Because being born...

528
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,450
is not this child's fault.

529
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,410
<i>The call cannot be connected.</i>

530
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:38,760
<i>My Son</i>
<i>The call cannot be connected.</i>

531
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:38,840
<i>My Son</i>

532
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,580
<i>Sweetheart</i>

533
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,450
<i>The call cannot be connected.</i>

534
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,370
So everyone is avoiding me. Is that it?

535
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,120
That’s enough. Let her be by herself.  

536
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,320
Even still…

537
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,310
<i>Han Soo Ji</i>

538
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,980
That was the first time I saw you laugh so much.

539
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,480
Because it was the first time

540
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,840
that I said what I wanted to say
in front of those people.

541
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,290
All this time, have you been
restraining yourself?

542
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,560
Now I won’t anymore.

543
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,350
I made the Avengers Club after all.

544
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,350
That’s right.

545
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,350
So now don’t restrain yourself.

546
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,600
Since there is nothing that we’ve done wrong.

547
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,620
Oh, that...

548
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,450
By the way,

549
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,320
Have the ajummas made up?

550
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,470
They will have to.

551
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,160
So about that...

552
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:55,920
Oh, Soo Gyum?

553
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,160
- Yes, Soo Gyum?
- Ajumma, something bad happened!

554
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,120
What happened?

555
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,900
Soo Gyum!

556
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,650
What happened?

557
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,740
Then, I’ll go first.

558
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,530
What happened? He said you’re in trouble.

559
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,050
What's going on?

560
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,540
I don’t have money.

561
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,550
W-what did she say?

562
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,360
Can we really eat these here?

563
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,990
Why does it look so empty?

564
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,150
I rented the place.

565
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,350
The whole place?

566
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,740
Do you really want to...

567
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,490
...call off the Avengers Club?

568
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,760
You say something…

569
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,630
It... It’s my fault...

570
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,520
You did what?

571
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,340
It was me who overreacted.

572
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,530
I asked Hee Soo, and he said...

573
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,850
your daughter didn’t join them.

574
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,350
I was wrong.

575
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:43,470
So...

576
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,600
Should we stop or not?

577
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,690
What do you mean? We just started.

578
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,570
I'm not someone who eats and runs.

579
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,260
It’s because I’m inadequate.

580
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,200
It’s all my fault.

581
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,040
What do you lack?

582
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,990
You have your husband and child.

583
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:04,860
I'm still alive, too.

584
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,100
But still…

585
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:16,920
I'm still living, too.

586
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:22,590
Today is my mom’s birthday.

587
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,360
It's a great day, so why?

588
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,420
I’m like Hong Gil Dong.

589
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,820
I can’t call Mom as Mom...

590
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:37,100
and I can’t call Unnie as Unnie.

591
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,260
Is she drunk?

592
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,280
Well, she hasn’t even finished one glass.

593
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,880
But you two...

594
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,820
You have your family.

595
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,170
To be honest...

596
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,770
I am similar to Soo Gyum.

597
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,140
No.

598
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,250
At least Soo Gyum knows his mother’s face.

599
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,350
So...

600
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,800
Shall we call it off?

601
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,320
Or not?

602
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,530
Of course not!

603
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,520
I thought you owned the whole world...

604
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,180
We are now your sisters.

605
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,200
That’s right.

606
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,080
Your sister is here.

607
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,590
Avengers Club…

608
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,820
Avengers Club…

609
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,040
Fighting!

610
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:12,680
Bottoms up!

611
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,740
It feels strange to drink soju from this glass.

612
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,380
My goodness!

613
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,340
Aigoo, you were starving for a drink. If we hadn't given it to you, you might not have been able to go to sleep.

614
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:30,010
You said bottoms up…

615
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,550
You did well. You did well.

616
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,110
Aigoo, drink well.

617
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,080
Here, have some more.

618
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,890
Let’s drink and die.

619
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,190
Cheers!

620
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:48,380
Bottoms up!

621
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,330
Omona!

622
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,740
Omo! Hey, excuse me!

623
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,740
I! I am Soo Gyum’s mother.
- Omo! Omo! Omo!

624
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:00,830
Omo! Omo!

625
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:03,290
Omona! Excuse me? Excuse me!

626
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,200
- You can’t go inside! Omo!
- I'm going inside!

627
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,360
Ah! You can't go inside!

628
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,850
Oh my god...

629
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,470
Hey,

630
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,600
- Who are you?
- Oh my god...

631
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,820
Oh my god, my goodness...

632
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,680
This is totally my style.

633
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,440
You’ll get me in trouble!

634
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,600
I like it here so much.

635
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,910
So... Let's have a look around?

636
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:35,870
Hey, look here...

637
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,640
You can't go in there!

638
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,370
That's Madam’s room.

639
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,360
Oh, is that so?

640
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,400
I thought it was my son's room.

641
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,170
Soo Gyum’s room is on the second floor.

642
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,080
Follow me.

643
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,340
Hey, you! Hey!

644
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:04,170
Omo! Omo! Open the door!

645
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,530
Open the door!

646
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,350
Ahhh...

647
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,350
This is it?

648
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,340
Hey!!!

649
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,220
Wow...

650
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,540
Hey!!!

651
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,240
Ahh, totally my style...

652
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,960
Open the door!

653
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,550
So nice!

654
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,360
Hey!

655
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,040
Omo....

656
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,180
This suits me

657
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:45,200
so perfectly.

658
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,040
See!

659
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,980
This is the construction proposal.

660
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,690
It's for the school.

661
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,750
This is for the new school building
and other facilities.

662
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,280
So that the construction runs smoothly, the windows...

663
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,800
<i>I couldn’t contact you,
so I came to your house.</i>

664
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,050
Are you crazy!?
- <i>What time will you get off from work?</i>

665
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,900
Damn!

666
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,530
<i>Son!</i>

667
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,440
<i>Why didn’t you pick up the phone?</i>

668
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,260
<i>- I’m worried, so I came to see you.
</i>- Damn<i></i>

669
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,370
<i>Son, your house is not bad.</i>

670
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:15,450
Hyung!

671
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,720
Madam will come home soon.
Please leave immediately.

672
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,400
I say...

673
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,240
Can you get me something to drink?

674
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,320
Something expensive.

675
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,280
If I do, will you leave?

676
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,670
Ahhh... So good.

677
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,440
Take it.

678
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,370
Today, it’s our treat.

679
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:50,940
Go home.

680
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,080
What the hell do you think you’re doing?

681
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,250
So hot! I was nearly burned!

682
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,220
- You came?
- Leave right this very minute!

683
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,280
Ouch, what are you doing?! It’s not like
I went somewhere I can’t go to!

684
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:19,950
Hey!

685
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,220
Why! What is it!

686
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,420
Son, you're here.

687
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,950
Oh, Soo Gyum, go settle your mom.

688
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,160
What's up with him?

689
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,030
Let’s go out.

690
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,130
No.. No.. Ah, I’m coming.
Ah! Ah! Let's have dinner!

691
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,380
Only us! Ah! I'm leaving!

692
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,440
Ah, ah, ah! Ouch, ouch, ouch...

693
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,750
Startled me...

694
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:44,650
Fine, I know!
l’m leaving, I’m leaving!

695
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,680
But...

696
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,190
Now you know the consequences of ignoring me, right?

697
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,230
Damn it!

698
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,520
Damn it?

699
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,250
No matter how hard you deny it.

700
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,900
I’m still your mother,
and that's never going to change.

701
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:00,640
Pick up the phone.

702
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,600
Really, what were you doing?

703
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,850
I’m sorry.

704
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:31,850
Why should she be sorry?

705
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:34,450
You should apologize first.

706
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:37,150
Why? Why should I?
She came here first.

707
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,750
As a father, you should have handled it.

708
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,200
For causing hardships for you in
so many ways, I’m sorry.

709
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,500
For things that are not your fault,
don’t keep apologizing.

710
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,700
If it was something that I could resolve by trying…

711
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,650
well, then I would have tried whatever I could.

712
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:46,950
Why someone like that gave birth to me,
I really don’t know.

713
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,600
Even a mother like that,
at least you can meet her.

714
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,500
I also thought that at first.

715
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:08,700
However, it might have been better
had I rather not known her.

716
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:14,250
There is no one who gets to be born
choosing their own parents.

717
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:36,800
Yes?

718
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,850
Your delivery is here.

719
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,200
You didn’t have to bring so much.

720
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:59,700
It's said that it's good for dementia patients if they often move their fingers.

721
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,300
I’m sorry you had to come here.

722
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,300
It’s a good place to have a meeting to make
our plans. And, it’s so natural.

723
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,600
Excuse me for a moment.
I need to use the bathroom.

724
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,450
Your mother-in-law looks so serene.

725
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,600
She’s like a mother to me.

726
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,800
Mother-in-law?

727
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,400
Hello.

728
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,000
The sisters… why?

729
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,900
Mother-in-law…

730
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,600
Are these friends here to visit?

731
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,000
That’s right, we’re friends.

732
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:41,850
This one seems like a much, much younger sister.

733
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:43,550
Hello.

734
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,250
Mother, how could you say she looks like
a much, much younger sister?

735
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,600
That might make me the much, much
oldest sister. Very sad.

736
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,550
Mother, are you in a good mood?

737
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,850
Yes, I am.

738
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,000
My friends bought some tangerines.

739
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,750
Mom, please try some of this.

740
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,350
My marketplace is known for its fruits.

741
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,650
Seeing you smile, you're a girl.

742
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,800
I had a dream.

743
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:22,050
What did you dream about?

744
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,350
This is a secret.

745
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,300
Today...

746
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,650
...my grandson is coming.

747
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,750
That would be nice.

748
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,100
Yes, it’ll be nice.

749
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,050
It’s going to be a good day.

750
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,600
Yeobo, you didn't say you would come. How...
<i>***(yeobo means honey or darling;
a term of endearment used by married couples) </i>

751
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,600
I had a meeting near here.

752
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,600
Mom, I’m here.

753
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,650
You, horrible man.

754
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,900
Mom?

755
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:39,900
Get out!

756
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,900
Go!

757
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,700
Mother, what are you doing?

758
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,750
Horrible man! Get out!
Go!

759
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
Mom, why are you doing this?

760
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,400
Bring my Seo Jin. My Seo Jin.

761
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,850
Bring me my grandson, you jerk!

762
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:00,400
Please stop it! Seo Jin is dead!

763
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,750
I did wrong.

764
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:21,550
I made a mistake. I made a mistake.

765
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:24,850
Mother, it’s okay.

766
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,300
I made a mistake.

767
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,650
It’s alright.

768
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:32,850
Mom…

769
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,850
Please don't hit me!

770
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,700
Young Pyo, please leave.
This is not good for your mother’s blood pressure.

771
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,350
I made a mistake, yeobo.

772
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:51,750
I made a mistake, please don’t hit me.
Don’t hit me.

773
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,950
I made a mistake, yeobo.

774
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,950
Please leave now.

775
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,600
I made a mistake. I made a mistake.
I made a mistake….

776
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,900
Mother, it’s okay.

777
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,800
Please calm down. It’s ok. It’s ok.

778
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:35,700
It’s okay.  It’s okay.

779
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,900
Mi Sook…

780
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:59,900
Mi Sook, I feel so...

781
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,050
Please don’t cry.

782
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:35,850
Mi Sook, don’t cry.

783
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,050
Young Pyo! Young Pyo!

784
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,200
Stop it!

785
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,600
This is Seo Jin’s.

786
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,550
Stop it. Enough!

787
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:51,300
Enough of this.

788
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,450
Seo Jin…

789
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:34,050
No longer will I live just accepting everything.

790
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,800
That’s right.

791
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,050
Let me pay back some of the debt I owe you.

792
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:40,350
The exchange of revenge service
has to be done properly.

793
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:42,700
It's no longer an exchange of services.

794
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,900
Starting now, we’re family.

795
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,950
We live together, we die together.

796
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:51,600
Your revenge is my revenge.

797
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:54,150
Wait a moment.

798
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,100
Why?

799
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:10,050
