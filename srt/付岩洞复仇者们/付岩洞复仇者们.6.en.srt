2
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,160
I will try, yeobo.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,480
I will try to change.

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
Episode 6

5
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,180
Son of a dog.
Kill you.

6
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,540
Oh.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,880
Oh?

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,520
Son of a d…

9
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,720
Darling, you’ve come.
You said you would be late.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,640
Yes.

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,440
That’s right.
Son of a d…

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,000
Thoughtlessly, we’ve stayed too long.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,180
Look here!

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,880
Just a moment.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,400
Chicken fight

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,760
Oh.

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,800
We've met before, haven't we?

18
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,020
What to do?
I’ve unintentionally caused you some trouble.

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,940
Then we will really now…

20
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,060
We’ll go. We’ll go.

21
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,960
Here.
Unnie, unnie, here.

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,080
We had a little gathering of parents.

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,000
She’s Seo Yeon’s friend’s mom.

24
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,540
You should be careful of who you befriend.
That kind of person…

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,060
You like these.

26
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,600
Unnie.
We have to go to a second round.

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,780
Somewhere more fun than a hotel,
and without worrying about prying eyes.

28
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,120
Okay, okay. Sleep. Sleep.
You need some sleep.

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,300
And, Hee Soo has to make me some ramen.

30
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,780
Oh, Soo Gyum. We’re going right now,
but her condition is…

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,400
Anyway, when I call you, come out.

32
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
I wonder if Mi Sook will be okay.

33
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.

34
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,920
Okay, let’s say that Director Lee’s wife is fine

35
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,420
but the chicken fight woman, who is that?

36
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,620
She’s an ajumma I know from a shop I go to occasionally,

37
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,900
but it turned out that she is Seo Yeon’s friend’s mother.

38
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,660
Still, don’t bring just anyone home.

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,280
Especially, when it’s a time that a lot of rumors could start, so we have to be careful.

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,960
Yes, I will do that.

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,920
It’s a relief that father will be late.

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,040
Alcohol...

43
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,120
I did have something to tell you.

44
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,200
But, I think it would be better to save it for later.

45
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,200
Are you okay?

46
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,800
I’m okay.

47
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
It’s not that direction!

48
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,260
Huh?

49
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,140
I know. I know.

50
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,580
This way is my room.

51
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,620
Yes? Come in!

52
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,500
You called for me?

53
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,300
Yes. Come on in.

54
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,500
Teacher Hee Kyung seems to be a person of many talents

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,780
but you’re not letting them show as much as they could.

56
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,540
Yes.

57
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,420
That your natural talents are not shining is a regretful thing.

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,300
Why did you call me?

59
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,740
Yes? Yes.

60
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,820
Our Teacher Kim, do you make coffee?

61
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,660
Yes?

62
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,760
You know that Candidate Baek Young Pyo is coming tomorrow, don’t you?

63
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,380
Please help out. Present the flower bouquet. And, make some delicious coffee for us.

64
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,720
Principal, I’m a physical education teacher.

65
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,980
Yes, that’s why.

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,940
If the the physical education teacher also makes good coffee, that’s even better.

67
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,260
Don’t you think so?

68
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,640
No matter how true that might be…

69
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,000
Teacher Kim, tomorrow is pay day, isn’t it?

70
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,460
Shouldn’t you pick up your first paycheck doing your work properly?

71
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,580
Sweaty and dirty, continuously until the day your contract ends.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,020
Not too long ago, the contract teacher before she became a full time teacher also did everything and anything for the sake of the school.

73
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,320
That is an educator’s dedication.

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,420
Our Teacher Kim as well, don’t worry about it being fitting or not fitting your role, and just do your best.

75
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,400
Okay, and tomorrow, put on your best appearance.

76
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,960
If I had acted on how I felt,
I should have just sidekicked him!

77
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,900
Ha!

78
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,460
Don’t.

79
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,540
I told you not to just going around doing kicks anywhere, didn’t I?

80
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,000
I was just stretching.

81
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,480
You’re okay, right?

82
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,080
It was close. 

83
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,500
Oh! Oh, you’re our Hee Soo’s savior?

84
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,380
It just happened that way.

85
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,960
Oh, yah, I should buy some bread for you some time.

86
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,040
Do you want to go to the store?

87
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,040
I think we’ve already eaten that.

88
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,580
The kick.

89
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,180
Heor! You’re my type.
Oh, Lee Soo Gyum!

90
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,120
Hyung, I’ll leave first.
Noona.

91
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,940
Bye!

92
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,280
She’s Hong Do ajumma’s daughter, for sure.

93
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,620
Here.

94
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,140
After the expressway went in, the price of land has gone up tremendously.

95
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,320
Have you talked with that child?

96
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
Does it matter whether I do or not?

97
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,960
As soon as I’ve decided, then it will be done.

98
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,980
Still, legally…

99
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,440
I am that child’s guardian.

100
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,440
Oh, oh, oh! That, that,
that even a person like that could be a father.

101
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,280
Makjang. Makjang.

102
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,600
Whether in dramas or in real life,
there isn’t anyone who is a proper human being.

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,000
Reality is more makjang.

104
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,020
At least in dramas, the bad guys get their punishment.

105
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,900
Yeah. Since when did 'Encouraging good and punishing evil' become a fantasy?

106
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,620
Should I take a day off tomorrow?

107
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,240
Why? What’s wrong?
Did something happen again?

108
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,660
Pervert Hong?

109
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,320
No! No!

110
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,900
You’re not just continuing to pull grass are you?

111
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,680
As if! Whose daughter am I?

112
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,080
If they disturb one strand of my hair,
then I’ll with my sidekick just…

113
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,480
If something else happens, tell me immediately.

114
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,540
This time, I’ll just pull out all of his hair.

115
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,080
That’s right.

116
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,160
As befitting Madam Hong’s daughter, from the front.

117
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,820
Oh, I can’t watch this.
Turn to a different channel.

118
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,300
They say that there is a good drama on these days on Wed-Thurs.

119
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,320
Wed-Thurs?

120
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,940
Yes, something with a revenge plot.

121
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,840
That starts at 9:30.
What time is it now?

122
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,640
Where’s the remote control?

123
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,640
The remote? It’s gone.
Just go and turn the channel.

124
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,560
Noona, are you going to take much longer?

125
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,500
Go first!
I still have a lot to get ready.

126
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,020
Then I’ll go ahead and go.

127
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,800
I’ll be back later.

128
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,220
Bye.

129
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,720
Yes, today’s style,
I’ll pay extra attention to it.

130
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
Mom, I’m going!

131
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:38,980
Oh, okay.

132
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,200
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah!

133
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,280
Are you sure you’re going to school?!

134
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,100
Yes, it’s the dress code.

135
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,740
Oh. Who does she resemble that she…

136
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,460
Do you have to go to Seo Yeon’s school?

137
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,060
Is there a reason that I can’t go?

138
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,080
It’s because it’s uncomfortable for Seo Yoon. Perhaps you could discuss it with her first…

139
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,960
It’s because you’re so nervous like this that the child is going anyway she wants.

140
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,980
As much as your success, this is an important time for Seo Yeon as well.

141
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,260
I’m not doing this just so I can do well for myself.

142
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,680
I have to do well in order for you and Seo Yeon to do well.

143
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,920
Isn’t that so?

144
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,680
Ah! Thank you.

145
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,960
Why isn’t she here yet?

146
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,880
Ah. I had to take my contact lenses so I couldn’t see very well.

147
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,800
Teacher Kim, I asked to take special care.

148
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,200
Oh, I just finished class and I was in a rush to get here.

149
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,380
I’m sorry.

150
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,180
Oh, this is what I have to present to him, isn’t it?

151
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,120
No, that’s fine.

152
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,300
Go inside!

153
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,140
Hurry and go. Go!

154
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,420
Aigoo. Our Candidate Baek.
Thank you.

155
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,100
Thank you.

156
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,300
Oh, you are giving these to me directly yourself?

157
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,240
Thank you.
You’ve all worked very hard.

158
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:46,700
The candidate for the Superintendent of Education wanted to come here to directly hear the voices of the students himself.

159
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,740
Even though he’s so busy, he’s using his precious time to come see us.

160
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,360
For our Candidate Baek Young Pyo, a big round of applause.

161
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,060
Hello. Nice to meet you!

162
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,700
I’m Baek Young Pyo.

163
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,120
Student Seo Yeon.
Please come to the front!

164
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,700
What kind of a father our Candidate Baek is,

165
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,500
would Student Baek Seo Yeon like to brag about him?

166
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,840
Ask him directly!

167
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,300
Since we’re seeing each other at school, she must be a little embarrassed,

168
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,120
though she’s not like that at home.

169
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,880
Of course.
She’s at that age.

170
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,900
Okay then, students,

171
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,900
will you one at a time comfortably tell me what your concerns are?

172
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,420
She’s at that sensitive time.

173
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,020
Even I can’t disturb the female students too much these days.

174
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,160
No matter how much she’s going through puberty, she should have a sense of appropriateness.

175
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,480
It’s because her mother lets her get away with too much, so that the child is…

176
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,020
Yes, come in!

177
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,800
This is Director Lee’s son.
I called him in to introduce him to you.

178
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,700
Oh.

179
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,740
Make your greetings!

180
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,360
This is Candidate Baek Young Pyo, Student Seo Yeon’s father.

181
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,640
Hello. My name is Lee Soo Gyum.

182
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,240
Yes.
You resemble your father a lot.

183
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,080
I’ve been taking particular care of him.

184
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,660
And, I also told him to get along well with Seo Yeon.

185
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,140
Yes. Please take care of my Seo Yeon well.

186
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,940
Yes. I will.

187
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,620
Then...

188
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,580
Okay, you can go. Study hard!

189
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,560
And, my office is always open to you.

190
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,200
So, if there is any help that I can give you, don’t make it hard on yourself, just come find me.

191
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,040
Yes.

192
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,720
Director Lee has told you, hasn’t he? That he’ll give the merchandise to you soon?

193
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,780
Yes, I’ve heard from him.

194
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,460
Nonhyeon-dong, shall we meet there?

195
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,860
That would probably be best.

196
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,200
This day is really funny.

197
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,260
Mi Sook must not be able to come out.

198
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,320
For the time being,
she probably has to be careful.

199
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,200
Did you do some review at home?

200
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,080
Review?

201
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,760
Son of…

202
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,980
What?

203
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,880
This son of …

204
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,400
This son of …

205
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,160
We had some fresh ones come out.

206
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,200
This bulls**t

207
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,250
Ooh, with some emotion even… 
you have a talent.

208
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,220
Only one cup today?

209
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,400
Has our Madam become tired of the vending machine coffee already?

210
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,400
Why doesn’t it taste good today?

211
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,080
Have you not recovered from your hangover yet?

212
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,280
Today, do you want to go and completely recover?

213
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,320
For recovering from a hangover, a sauna is the best.

214
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,280
Let’s go in.

215
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,760
That looks good on you.

216
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,780
Then shall we go take a look around the place?

217
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,140
Since you shouldn’t lose this.

218
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
No… sit, sit, sit, sit.

219
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,180
Like this.

220
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,700
Okay.

221
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,040
Finished.

222
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,400
Let’s go!

223
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,200
Let’s go.

224
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,180
Hee Soo!

225
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,000
Yah, noona got her first paycheck today.

226
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,420
Come on out so that we can eat dinner with mom.

227
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,120
Where?

228
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,420
Ow.
They’re totally stuck to me.

229
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,440
Why? Are your legs too long, so it isn’t comfortable?

230
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,260
Stretch them out. Comfortably. Comfortably.

231
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,900
Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.

232
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,020
Let’s lie down together.

233
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,240
Lie down. Lie down.

234
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,300
It’s so nice.

235
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,460
So nice that I almost want to take the floor apart and take it with me.

236
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,960
It’s comfy, isn’t it?

237
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,020
Comfy.

238
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,900
Since we’re like this, it really feels as if we’re one family.

239
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,940
As if even if we were together, we wouldn’t look strange.

240
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,280
Did we look that strange?

241
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,760
Truthfully, it was kind of strange.

242
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,960
You two people and I are not exactly from the same clay.

243
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,700
I like the sauna a lot.

244
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,060
Should I put one in the house?

245
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,400
Which brand would be good?

246
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,420
Who made this?

247
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,260
Whose is this?

248
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,740
Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.

249
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,260
Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo. Aigoo.

250
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
Okay, I love you. I love you.

251
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,260
Here.

252
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,480
Let’s do everything that others do!

253
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,380
However, do you even know how to peel an egg?

254
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,040
Even I know that much.

255
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,660
Ttok-ttok

256
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,520
In a sauna, this is the right way.

257
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,520
Hee Kyung!

258
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,480
Oh, what are you doing?

259
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,140
Huh?

260
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,200
I’m a little sad.
Mom’s sauna partner is me.

261
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,020
Mom’s friend.

262
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,440
Friend?

263
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,240
You saw her last time, right?
Make your greeting.

264
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,420
Hello.

265
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,540
Me, too!

266
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,000
However, how did you come here?

267
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,000
Ah, I got my first paycheck today!

268
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,060
Ohhhhhh, you’ve worked hard, my daughter.

269
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,060
It’s already been a month.
You got your first paycheck, my daughter.

270
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,140
Please choose anything!

271
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,580
My daughter’s money, it’s so precious, how can I eat anything?

272
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,680
Is it okay if I order a lot?

273
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,400
For a paycheck meal, isn’t it too meager?

274
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,520
If it’s white rice and eggs,
then that’s plentiful.

275
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,820
I’ll eat well.

276
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,840
Did I do something wrong?

277
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,460
You’re Hong Do unnie’s daughter.

278
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,340
Did mom do something wrong?

279
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,880
Can I peel one more?

280
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,900
I hit my forehead.

281
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,740
Oh, did it hurt?

282
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,680
So, that is, the merchandise…

283
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,860
It’s a bribe.
I’m certain of it.

284
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,780
Lee Byung Soo is supporting Candidate Baek.

285
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,300
Still, that doesn’t mean that’s proof.

286
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,920
Let’s check the location.

287
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,400
Yes.

288
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,660
But where is it?

289
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,900
Nonhyeon-dong, there?

290
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,780
Wouldn’t it be a regular place for them?

291
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
It seems as if it’s some place they go to often. Do you not know of it?

292
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,520
There are a few places.

293
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,060
Find out!

294
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,840
Where?

295
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,640
Yes, I understand.

296
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,920
They say it’s not this place either.

297
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,900
If we tried ten places and none of them are it…

298
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,000
What if we arrange for the location?

299
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,080
Hm?

300
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,640
So that we don’t need to go looking for it, we bring them.

301
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,180
To the house.

302
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,760
Surely not, our house?

303
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,660
Of course.

304
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,180
Oh, that’s a good idea!

305
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,780
So, you’re saying, we’ll set it up.

306
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
Won’t that be dangerous?

307
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,200
And, how do we get them to change the location?

308
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,160
That.

309
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,620
Madam will…

310
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,840
Huh?

311
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,620
Yes, yes.

312
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,200
Just say that you want to support them, so invite them to the house.

313
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,820
Okay.
Let’s try it anyway.

314
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,680
Though, I don’t know if they will believe me.

315
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,220
It seems the stakes are slowly getting bigger.

316
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,120
With that in mind, I have something to tell you.

317
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:11,860
To a uselessly likable grandson, grandfather will tell you an amusing story.

318
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,880
I originally wanted to be an educator.

319
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,280
But, I learned too early to have fun making money.

320
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,320
In order to try to fulfill their father’s dream,

321
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,140
the older son claims he wants to build a school so he’s involved in a Superintendent of Education election.

322
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,380
The younger son wants to set up a foundation.

323
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,760
However

324
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,820
who do you think will fulfill my dream?

325
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,920
Or

326
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,580
do you want to do it?

327
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,410
There is a reason that father is obsessed with the election of
Mi Sook ajumma’s husband.

328
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,160
It's for the choice of the successor, right?

329
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,740
Then how about the bastard Hong Sang Man?

330
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,130
Wouldn’t he have been promised a position?

331
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:07,560
So, if he is elected, it would help Jung Hye’s husband’s business?

332
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,830
Or the contrary, if he fails, my father becomes disadvantaged.

333
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,310
This election

334
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,700
of the Superintendent of Education may be the chance to get both of them properly at the same time.

335
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,230
Will it be ok, Mi Sook?

336
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,080
It will hit your husband first.

337
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,190
That’s why we started this.
I hope our revenge succeeds

338
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,000
and Mi Sook unnie has no more hard times.

339
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,460
It would be good if we can beat all the bad guys at once.

340
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,560
Hello?

341
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,500
Did you call me to confirm it?

342
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,740
Your dad says that he can do as he pleases,

343
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,740
but that’s yours.

344
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,400
I don’t think it’s fun to steal someone else’s things away.

345
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,570
I will definitely not touch the land that

346
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,320
grandmother and grandfather left for me.

347
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,080
I thought that would be the case.

348
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,150
- Thank you for informing me.
- No need.

349
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,500
Since it’s just that I didn’t want to waste any effort.

350
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,150
Then…

351
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,550
You’re not able to trust in your father, are you?

352
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,490
Still, thanks to you, he was able to raise his stature.

353
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,170
Since actually, the designated heir

354
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,170
was determined to be your uncle.

355
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,760
I’m not curious about it.

356
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,880
You're quite amusing.

357
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,440
However, now, you’re going to have develop some interest.

358
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,800
Who are the people who can help you,
think about that carefully.

359
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,140
This is a little too much,

360
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,140
but even if you don’t want to,

361
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,780
I think we’ll see each other frequently in the future. You can go now.

362
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,830
So.

363
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,610
what do you think of my grandson?

364
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,460
He is worthy of the Chairman’s desire to have him.

365
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,750
You’re thinking of him after your second son, aren’t you?

366
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,460
There is no need to rush.

367
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,460
Since I don’t even know who is after me.

368
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,280
Okay.

369
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,120
The Chairman

370
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,250
probably doesn’t want you
to be close to your father.

371
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,120
Since that person is working closely with my uncle.

372
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,110
- Yes, that’s probably why you were needed.
- There are a legion of people checking me out,

373
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,400
all looking to see how to make the best use of me.

374
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,280
I also wanted to pull you in.

375
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,500
When you first said that you wanted to join the club.

376
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,370
However, the unnies were opposed,

377
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,360
saying that if we did, then like your blood relatives, we were just using you.

378
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,170
I totally like it.

379
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,500
With good spirits, I’ve allowed myself to be used by you.

380
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,640
Thinking about it now,

381
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,520
I wonder if I should have listened to the unnies.

382
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,730
It’s okay,

383
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,780
since I chose...

384
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,780
to be used by you.

385
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,480
<i>President Kim Jung Yun met with your son Soo Gyum...</i>

386
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:41,710
What?

387
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,450
Okay.

388
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,240
Yah, since you came in together, it looks good.

389
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,160
- We met outside.
- Father,

390
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,810
I met President Kim Jung Yun and figured out the issue about my land.

391
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,770
- Figured out?
- I told her explicitly that I have no interest in selling the land,

392
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,770
and she has accepted that.

393
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,160
I never agreed to sell it.

394
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,060
But, that would have been a good thing for you.
It would be for your own good.

395
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,060
It would probably be for your good.

396
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,730
What?

397
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,250
Go ahead and go up first.

398
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,680
- I’m not done talking.
- I’ll go up first.

399
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,290
In the future, whoever you meet, you have to report it to me.

400
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,360
You really seem like a proper mom.

401
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,720
Even knowing to protect the child.

402
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,880
I had wanted to ask you at least once.

403
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,440
Did you really only have that reason?

404
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,550
About what?

405
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,660
The reason that you brought your son here.

406
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,400
Well, then why else would I have brought him here? Without any point?

407
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,560
Though, I didn’t realize that he would go around doing foolish things like this.

408
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,190
Are you that lacking in self-confidence?

409
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,210
So that you have to use even your son’s inheritance?

410
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,360
Do you even know anything about business?

411
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,150
Anyway, since when do you have interest in things like this?

412
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,150
I may not have any interest,

413
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,300
but that you want to look good in front of President Kim Jung Yun

414
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,800
and that you're competing against your brother, even I know that much.

415
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,960
- Using your son.
- Am I doing this for myself?

416
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:29,210
- It’s all for the sake of the child.
- It is probably for your chances of being heir.

417
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,150
Oh, why is she so late?

418
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,920
<i>You call is not connected. It will switched to the voice mail...</i>

419
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:55,920
<i>Seo Yeon,</i>

420
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,140
<i>are you coming home?</i>

421
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,720
<i>Please call me.</i>

422
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,740
Is that you, Seo Yeon?

423
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,820
Oh my queen of support.

424
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,820
Wash and go to bed quickly.

425
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,550
You get zero points for child education.

426
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,000
Do you know what humiliation I suffered in Seo Yeon's school?

427
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,200
- Did something happen?
- It did.

428
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,200
Hey Baek Seo Yeon.

429
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,200
Come out here.

430
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,240
Seo Yeon hasn’t come home yet.

431
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,550
That bastard, does she know what time it is?!

432
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,040
After dragging her father through the mud!

433
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,690
When she comes, I'll tell her well.

434
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,910
That little…!

435
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,990
Baek Seo Yeon, you come here.

436
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,800
You bastard, how dare you be so rude?

437
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,110
Why? You will hit me too?

438
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,710
- If it makes you sane.
- Honey!

439
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,450
You won't come out here?

440
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,000
You won't come out here?

441
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,840
Come out!

442
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,870
Come out!

443
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,870
Come out!

444
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,450
- Seo Yeon. It's okay.
- Open the door!

445
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,840
Mom will take care of it.

446
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,410
Open the door! Open the door!

447
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,410
Open the door!

448
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,080
Open the door! Open the door!

449
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,080
Open it in the count of three.

450
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,820
One..

451
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,760
two..

452
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,520
Baek Seo Yeon open the door!

453
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,600
Hey!

454
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,640
Open the door!

455
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,010
Try it. So that all the neighbors can hear it and see it.

456
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,010
Are you crazy?

457
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,870
I told you I wouldn’t stand for it anymore.

458
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,580
If you don't change, I don't know what I will do.

459
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,150
I’ll tell everyone everything, all that you had done.

460
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,420
- This aw..
- So!

461
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,110
Stop it.

462
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,740
Baek Young Pyo!

463
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,130
Baek Young Pyo!

464
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,500
Is your business doing well?

465
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,500
Aigoo..

466
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,330
How are you?

467
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,090
Ay I want to eat too.

468
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,580
Aigoo. Hello.

469
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,550
Please sell a lot.

470
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,680
Aigoo.

471
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,520
Aigoo.

472
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,910
So we meet again, Seo Yeon’s father.

473
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,910
Ahh yes.

474
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,380
Should I be calling you Mr. Candidate now?
-Ai well…

475
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,440
Please manage our country's education well.

476
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,560
Yes yes..

477
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,420
- Mr. Candidate, let's move.
- Yes Yes.

478
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,000
You're working hard.

479
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,990
Thank you for your effort.

480
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,370
Mr. Candidate,

481
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,880
Education has to be proper…

482
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,570
so that malicious personalities who bully their friends won’t appear!

483
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:11,900
Eh.

484
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,280
Aigoo.. What's wrong with this world?

485
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,780
This one?

486
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,060
What do I do when I don’t have this?

487
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,970
Hey be quiet.

488
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,940
I’m going out soon!

489
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,860
He used to turn up the TV volume loudly.

490
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,390
Hah..

491
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,410
Uhm..

492
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,690
[Soo Gyum’s dad]

493
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,770
<i>Your call is not connected, it will be switched to the voice mail.</i>

494
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,760
If you act like this to me

495
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,520
then I have choice but to find another supplier.

496
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,710
Uhm..

497
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,370
Uhm..

498

499
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,450
Hello. I'm Soo Gyum's mom.

500
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,550
Shall we meet?

501
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,320
Who was it that made your face have that look?

502
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,130
I d<i>on’t know why, of all people, that kind of person gave birth to me.</i>

503
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,390
I f<i>eel like it was much better when I didn’t know.</i>

504
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,840
Hello, Kim Jung Hye-ssi.

505
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,520
Since leaving my child with you, my greeting has been delayed.

506
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,500
Why did you want me to see?

507
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,720
You’re more abrupt than I thought.

508
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,170
Since you answered my call,

509
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,170
you also...

510
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,310
must have reason to see me?

511
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,320
I don't have any reason to see you.

512
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,780
Then why did you come here?

513
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,360
I thought I should see you at least once.

514
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,120
So you had a reason.

515
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,670
So, how do you feel having seen me?

516
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,670
If we have nothing to talk about, let’s stand up.

517
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,670
I...

518
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,660
I am concerned about my son’s future…

519
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,720
so my Soo Gyum will be your family’s heir.

520
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,780
Well, Byung Soo-ssi or your father-in-law will think the same.

521
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,450
And you will want the same too.

522
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,730
Since Byung Soo has to become the heir

523
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,450
for it to be good for you.

524
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,680
- So?
- I heard…

525
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,140
You were infertile.

526
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,680
If I had not had my son,

527
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,690
If I had not sent him to your home,

528
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:00,620
Would you...

529
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,600
have been able to keep your position?

530
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,850
What do you want?

531
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,380
An appropriate payment?

532
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,040
So...

533
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,140
- it's money after all.
- There is no other way to...

534
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,480
reward besides money, isn’t that so?

535
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,090
Do you think you deserve it?
- Of course. There’s no reason I don’t…

536
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,270
If you really don't want to reward me I have another choice...

537
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,160
"Geon Ha Group's son-in-law

538
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,390
has a mistress like me."

539
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,680
Oh, that would be so much fun!
Should I meet with reporters?

540
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,670
Or should I post directly to internet?

541
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,090
Just do it.

542
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,240
It's been many days since a 19-year-old illegitimate son

543
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,160
came to Hae Rang Construction's first son's house.

544
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,810
If it was to going to reported, it already would have been.

545
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,230
Why do you think it has been quiet?

546
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,860
What do you mean?

547
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,860
Do you think my family, Geon Ha Group

548
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,120
wants to admit knowing that I'm raising an illegitimate child?

549
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,220
What you’re disturbing is not just one person.

550
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,760
Then,

551
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,750
- How about this?
- Whatever it is,

552
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,490
both you and Lee Byung Soo have no right to be parents.

553
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,450
I gave birth to Soo Gyum. He is my son.

554
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,400
No one can deny that.
- No.

555
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,050
I deny it.

556
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,340
Omo Son. How did you know I'm here? Sit down here.

557
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,870
Hey..

558
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,370
Hey..

559
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,000
I will deal with it…

560
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,200
Mother.

561
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,330
I'm okay.

562
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,990
Hey there, Kim Jung Hye-ssi, I’m not yet…
- Sit down.

563
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,040
Hey, I’m…
- I said sit down.

564
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Ajumma!

565
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,350
Aw that's Omo Hey!

566
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,010
Hey, you don’t know what that’s worth!
- Then how much am I worth?

567
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,100
What?

568
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,000
Was the reward you received from father not enough?

569
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,720
How much more do you want to grab, that you appear again so shamelessly?

570
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,790
Hey! Such a tiny amount of money is far from enough to shut my mouth.

571
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,860
Do you know how much I suffered when I had you in my youth?

572
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,640
- I still feel pain in my waist.
- Stop being noisy.

573
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,920
Let's never see each other again.

574
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,600
Son, why are you so harsh to your mom.

575
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,940
- Where on earth is my mom?
- Here I am, here.

576
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,330
My mom died...

577
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,230
...when you abandoned me.

578
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,990
Hey,

579
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,720
let’s speak properly, huh? Did I abandon you on the street or at an orphange?

580
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,180
I just left you to my mom and dad for a while.

581
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Right. For a while.

582
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,690
For 18 years. And speak properly.

583
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,360
If you’re a real mom, then you shouldn’t be acting like this.

584
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,930
Being an illegitimate child wasn’t enough, you shouldn’t try to make me into a mistress’ son.

585
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,480
You shouldn’t have sold your child.

586
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,000
You’re never lost for words. So?
Are you taking revenge on me?

587
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,460
Revenge?

588
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,280
Is it?

589
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,380
Do you know how hard I've lived so far?

590
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,220
How would I know? You’ve never given me a chance to know.

591
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,020
I should not…

592
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,800
have given birth to something like you.

593
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,800
Aigoo.

594
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,240
Why did you come here?

595
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,340
I met with that woman.

596
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,720
Ah, just ignore her.

597
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,080
I won’t bother you, I’ll handle it myself.

598
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,000
No.

599
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,680
I think the meeting was necessary.

600
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,810
Perhaps it has helped me realize what to do.

601
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,400
And what our family needs.

602
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,480
Yes, that's right.

603
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,250
Although...

604
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,530
At the start...

605
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,790
We didn't get along well with each other...

606
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,550
The three of us should make
more of an effort together.

607
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:53,950
Alright.

608
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,010
The three of us.

609
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,310
Then...

610
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,020
Including Soo Gyum?

611
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,370
I will try my best.

612
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,130
After all, you and I...

613
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,430
Need that kid.

614
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,870
Yes!

615
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,580
I knew you will stand by my side!

616
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,750
We’re family after all.

617
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,980
Yes, yes, yes.

618
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,520
Yes, he’s lonely and suffering, too.

619
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,350
Please take care of him.

620
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,370
Okay.

621
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,760
But don’t put high hopes on me.

622
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,490
Actually,

623
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,130
I have complex emotions about it.

624
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,700
But, you're the only person
who’s standing with me.

625
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,970
So, I’ll help you.

626
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,610
Aigoo...

627
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,280
Aigoo, thank you!

628
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,260
I’m so thankful!

629
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:38,780
But, help where?

630
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,460
Aren't you...

631
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,870
Struggling to help candidate Baek
be elected as the Superintendent of Education?

632
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,690
I’ll help, too.

633
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,000
Really?

634
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,290
Once he becomes
the Superintendent of Education,

635
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,640
Father-in-law will acknowledge you, right?

636
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,310
But of course!

637
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:54,880
Ah, that's right!

638
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,710
Aigoo! Really!

639
00:42:35,688 --> 00:42:36,408
Ah... this...

640
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,168
What the...

641
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,790
Aigoo, I...

642
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,760
It seems you’ve forgotten.

643
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,110
I’m just 19 years old.

644
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,300
Seeing such a picture…
I shouldn’t be delivering such a picture to you.

645
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,600
This is not how any
parent or adult should act.

646
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,160
Yah, things like this...
You should’ve told me beforehand.

647
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,880
Then I wouldn’t have let you
see that woman.

648
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,460
My real mom is “that woman.”

649
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,000
Stepmom is “Madam.”

650
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,930
Father,

651
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,940
You can’t give me a mother, can you?

652
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,430
Yah.

653
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,380
Don’t you worry.

654
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,400
I have...

655
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,940
Discussed this with your mother.

656
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,360
Your mother said...

657
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,090
That us three are a family...

658
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,900
So we should get along well.

659
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,600
Now, really...

660
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:24,430
We’re a real family.

661
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:24,980
Okay?

662
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,240
All this time,

663
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,340
You’ve worked hard.

664
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,750
In the future...

665
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,840
Let’s work together.

666
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,410
Good.

667
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,830
Finally, it’s D-Day.

668
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,710
We can do it, right?

669
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,460
The arrangement and plan has been set.

670
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,210
All good.

671
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,830
Now, those people...

672
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,330
Are like rats inside a trap.

673
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,390
That's right.

674
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,990
This time...

675
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,430
Let’s catch those rats.

676
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:55,790
Avengers Social Club...

677
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,420
Avengers Social Club...

678
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,220
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

679
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,520
Have you ever served as a hostess?

680
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,320
Nope.

681
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,590
Mi Sook, you have to help her.

682
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,660
Ah, alright.

683
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,210
Jung Hye,

684
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,500
Since we’re pretending to help our husbands,

685
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,210
We can’t act close like we usually do.

686
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,240
So, I should have to act like you, right Unnie?

687
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,240
Yes, that’s right, right.

688
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,310
Let’s practice.

689
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:16,720
Set up the table.

690
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,040
Then...

691
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,040
What should you say after serving food?

692
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,140
Do I need to say something?

693
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,340
“Although I haven’t prepared much,
please enjoy the food.”

694
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,650
Are we going to prepare
only a few dishes?

695
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,290
Just copy what she said.

696
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,070
Please...

697
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,800
Please enjoy the food.

698
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,110
Please enjoy the food.

699
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,520
Be more sincere.
Smile when you say it.

700
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,000
Please enjoy the food.

701
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,080
Alright, alright…
That’s good, good.

702
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,850
I should leave the house naturally, right?

703
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,010
Yeobo!

704
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,120
They’re here.

705
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,280
Hello, how are you?

706
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,580
Hello, welcome to our house.

707
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,690
Aigoo, thank you for inviting us.

708
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,100
It’s a little gift my wife made.

709
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,060
Aigoo, I’ve heard so much about
Mrs. Baek’s flower arranging skills.

710
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,000
As expected...

711
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:21,770
Thank you so much.

712
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,930
Hello, nice to meet you.

713
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,120
I’m Lee Soo Gyum.

714
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,540
Aigoo, we meet again.

715
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,500
Is he your son?

716
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,090
Yes.

717
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,130
He’s our son.

718
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,450
Don’t we look alike?

719
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,560
Total carbon copies of each other.

720
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,280
Indeed.

721
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,630
But, Soo Gyum...

722
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,830
Where are you going?

723
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,920
To the library...

724
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,120
Since I’m already a senior...

725
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,440
Aigoo, it must be tiring to constantly study.

726
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,930
Excuse me.

727
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,480
Well, study hard.

728
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,810
Sunbae, please come in.

729
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,910
Yes. Ah, your house is nice.

730
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,570
Aigoo...

731
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,660
Principal Hong isn't here yet?

732
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:58,800
Not yet, but he said he’ll arrive soon.

733
00:45:58,890 --> 00:45:59,290
Aigoo...

734
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,280
Aigoo...

735
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,480
This house is not bad.

736
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,360
It's nice.

737
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,360
Hello, sir.

738
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,160
Oh.

739
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,120
Soo Gyum.

740
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,230
They’re waiting for you inside.

741
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,910
As expected, what a gentle kid.

742
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,160
I’m here. Here!

743
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,920
What an extraordinarily sweet smell!

744
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,120
I’ve been starving since this morning.

745
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,960
Principal Hong, please sit here.

746
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,950
Our Superintendent of Education,
please sit here.

747
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,280
Ah, this crazy...

748
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,550
Ah, my wife said she wants to cook for us.

749
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,710
Hopefully, it’s delicious.

750
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,840
Did you cook all by yourself?

751
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,180
I am honored, Madam.

752
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:57,950
Ah, no...

753
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,120
Sister-in-law...

754
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,220
Yah, I...

755
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,440
Never thought that I’d eat dishes made by Jung Hye.

756
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,290
Yes.

757
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,380
I also never thought that I’d have
the chance to cook for Principal Hong.

758
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,920
I thought you two...

759
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:12,880
Only compete in beauty,
but as it turns out...

760
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,440
You also compete in the standards of being a good wife.

761
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,720
Aigoo!

762
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,640
How can Jung Hye compare with Mrs. Baek?

763
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,430
Aigoo, I can do some
house chores, that’s all.

764
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,980
You are welcome here anytime.

765
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,680
You three...

766
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,110
Can talk comfortably,

767
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,760
While I prepare the food.

768
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,100
Ah, how nice to have sister-in-law’s help.

769
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:34,000
We need to be cautious during election
period, so I invited you all to come here.

770
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,810
Next time...

771
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,730
I'll invite you to a better place.

772
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,200
Thank you.

773
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,240
Ah, what...

774
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,540
Hong Do Seafood!

775
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,660
Ah, you startled me! Let's go!

776
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,280
Window, open the window.

777
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:52,650
Turn it off, turn it off!

778
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,000
Next.

779
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,240
Go to the back.

780
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,080
Who’s going to record?

781
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:14,510
I will.

782
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,320
Change!

783
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,320
I will keep a lookout, you can rest.

784
00:49:29,144 --> 00:49:29,928
Aigoo...

785
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,360
By this time,

786
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,310
They should be eating, right?

787
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:55,770
Delicious, isn’t it?

788
00:49:56,088 --> 00:49:56,376
Uh.

789
00:50:58,325 --> 00:50:58,981
Delicious!

790
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,440
Me, too. Me, too.

791
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,420
Hmm…

792
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,640
Okay, set aside the food for us.

793
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,540
Let’s start.

794
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

795
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,600
Oh… vinegar.

796
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,860
It’s quite pretty.

797
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,540
Won't it be too obvious?

798
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,960
Taste it.

799
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,400
No, thanks.

800
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,500
Unnie?

801
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,460
Here. Ah.

802
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,740
Is it too much?

803
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,080
Just a bit.

804
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,080
-He says it’s too much.
-Just a little.

805
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,480
What’s wrong?

806
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
Does it not suit your taste?

807
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,480
No, that’s not it.

808
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,420
Because it's food with so much sincerity...

809
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,560
Please don’t force yourself to finish.

810
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,560
No, that’s okay.

811
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,460
It has a certain flavor.

812
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,380
Yes.

813
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:43,120
Jung Hye was bragging that the Director always praises her for doing so well.

814
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,780
Ah. Yes.

815
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:52,140
Your cooking today was very amazing.

816
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,600
Thank you.

817
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,860
Is your stomach okay?

818
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,900
In the future, it would be best if sister-in-law didn't cook.

819
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,700
I know but she insisted she wanted to do it.

820
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,860
That's right.

821
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,560
It would have been good to meet outside as we had planned.

822
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,220
And, we can't even go to a second round.

823
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,320
What could I do?

824
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,680
She really wanted to do something for us.

825
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,000
I really thought I was dying.

826
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,780
Is your stomach still not feeling well?

827
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,960
My apologies.  My apologies.

828
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:03,360
Put it in his car so that he won’t have to concern himself.

829
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,560
Lee Byung Soo, you have a subtle touch.

830
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,560
Thank you. I will receive it well.

831
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,560
That’s very least I could do.

832
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,700
The ladies should please join us.

833
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,700
Please speak comfortably by yourselves.

834
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,700
We are drinking tea separately.

835
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,520
I think something was given.

836
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,080
A bribe?

837
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,260
I’m certain.

838
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,260
To avoid any concern, he said to place it in the car.

839
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,620
Then it’s really true.

840
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,650
They’re coming out.

841
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,650
Coming out soon.

842
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,250
It's about time for them to come out.

843
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,300
Start recording.

844
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:51,900
Is he gone?

845
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,600
He’s gone.

846
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,000
Oh, my nerves.

847
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,350
Did the recording go well?

848
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,350
Daebak!

849
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:17,300
Your head, your head. Watch your head. Get home safely.

850
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,700
I ate well.

851
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,500
Mi Sook, have a safe drive home.

852
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,150
Have a good night.

853
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,750
Ahh… Jung Hye, tonight…

854
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:38,300
I mean, sister-in-law, your effort was the best.

855
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,700
As long as you don't cook. Don't cook.

856
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,700
Get him home safely!

857
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,450
Omo.  Don't be like that. It's making me more anxious.

858
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,700
Yeobo, get up. We’re here.

859
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,250
Be careful.

860
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,800
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

861
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,000
I'm so nervous.

862
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,800
We’re taking a huge step. Right?

863
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,250
Yes.

864
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,300
I'm ready.

865
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,500
Business draft? Personal checks?

866
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,850
What is it?

867
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:34,000
It says to take two pills a day.

868
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:43,150
Is this what’s called a pointless effort?

869
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,750
That’s how it seems.

870
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,000
Plan B is necessary.

871
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:10,000
The ladies should join us.

872
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,850
Please converse comfortably by yourselves.
We’re drinking tea separately.

873
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:24,900
Truly?  There was nothing there?

874
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:29,850
Really?

875
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:33,500
Really, there was nothing but the medicine.

876
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:37,350
Why did the driver ajusshi behave like that?

877
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,350
I agree.

878
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:41,700
I thought several hundred thousand dollars were exchanging hands.

879
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,400
Still we worked well together today.

880
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,300
Yes, more and more, we are able to fit together well.

881
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000

Unnies, Dongsaengs and Haraboji of Avengers Subbing Club</i>

882
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,150
Yeobo...

883
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:06,250
give me some water.

885
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,250
Did you do some review at home?

886
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:11,050
Review?

887
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:12,150
This son of a...

888
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,100
This bulls**t.

889
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,100
The sauna is too nice.

890
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:20,950
Should I install one in the house? What brand is good? Whose is this?

891
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,400
Enjoy your meal.

892
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,400
More pleasantly. Smiling.

893
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,400
Enjoy your meal.

894
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,950
