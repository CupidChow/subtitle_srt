00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,340
<i>English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and Dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club</i>

2
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,300
Ajusshi?

3
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:03,940
- What does that mean?
- Who is it?

4
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,780
Episode 10
- What does that mean?
- Who is it?

5
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,760
- Who is this?
- Neighborhood ajusshi

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,820
- What is that?
- What?

7
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,820
Yah, it’s the principal!

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,520
Why is he like that?

9
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:22,335
- They have to see this.
- Upload it.

10
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,380
- We have to go.
- Let’s show this. Let’s show this.

11
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:41,820
<i>[Neighborhood leftover ajusshi]</i>

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,660
Those kids who took all the pictures,

13
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,340
they’ll probably spread it everywhere, won’t they?

14
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,000
It’s already been spread everywhere.

15
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,780
Oh!

16
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,700
The children these days are so fast!

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,040
But, you know that guy, he must have thought it was his own living room and slept well.

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,360
This seat is still warm.

19
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,180
Then our plan this time,
we’ve finished it perfectly, haven’t we?

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,720
There is still one person left.

21
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,840
Go safely and return!

22
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,400
Hyung, where are we going this morning?

23
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,480
We have to go wrap things up.

24
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,340
Yes?

25
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,880
Anyone who knows Kim Hee Soo in Classroom 3?

26
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,780
What is it?

27
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,540
What is it?

28
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,420
You know his mother sells fish.

29
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,060
Shall I show you something fun? Huh?

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you doing?
Give it to me.

31
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,340
Yah, yah, yah, yah.

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,220
Aren’t you going to give it to me?! Yah!

33
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,540
I’ll show you something more fun.

34
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,740
<i>Oh, okay, what can’t we talk about between us.</i>

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,160
<i>You know my mother.</i>

36
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
<i>We lied about it.</i>

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,880
<i>This is my uncle’s hospital.</i>

38
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,920
<i>Just until the contract teacher is fired,
she told me to lie here.</i>

39
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,220
A dense person caught in his own trap.
<i>(Note: This is similar to the saying "hoisted by his own petard.")</i>

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,280
What nonsense are you saying?

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,860
Oh.

42
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,820
It means don’t mess around and just lie low.

43
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,060
Anyone interested in the long version,
just ask the main person.

44
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,620
Jung Wook, was that another lie?

45
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,980
Your mother is really amazing.

46
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,820
I feel sorry for the contract teacher.

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,940
Hwang Jung Wook, are you so rich?

48
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,540
Yah, what happens if the story of you being a liar spreads around?

49
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,420
Oh, Hwang Jung Wook.

50
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,620
It looks as if you’ll become an SNS star.

51
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,380
Hey, shhh!

52
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,780
What are you doing?

53
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,300
Are… are you going to upload it?

54
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,400
Why? Are you afr…

55
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,860
What is he doing?

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,400
Why is he kneeling?

57
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,460
The reason that I’m kneeling now

58
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,260
is not an acknowledgement that I did something really wrong.

59
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,400
That is,

60
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,140
I’m not doing this because I’m afraid or anything.

61
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,020
Pl…

62
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,040
Please just don’t upload that anywhere.

63
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,160
Am I you?

64
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,960
You should be saying that to me.

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,020
Sunbae-nim.

66
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,000
Please don’t upload that anywhere.
<i>(Note: using the most formal, most respectful speech)</i>

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,760
That is why, Hoobae-nim,

68
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,880
you would be best served by not doing anything.

69
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,600
You’re really not going to upload that, right?!

70
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,040
Oh.

71
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,300
I think you are misunderstanding something.

72
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,580
So I wanted to clear it up for you.

73
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,080
About the building, there’s no need for you to think anything strange.

74
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,660
Just trust me and leave it to me.

75
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,760
Aren’t you going out today?

76
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,020
It’s just that you seem to be running around these days doing some fun things.

77
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,120
If you have something to say, just say it

78
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,340
rather than talking about this and that.

79
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,100
No, it’s just that I’ve been hearing some funny stories these days.

80
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,080
With Sunbae Baek’s wife

81
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,360
and a fishmonger?

82
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,740
We’re members of the Avengers Club.

83
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,380
Why?

84
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,060
Oh!

85
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,340
Didn’t you show me a strange letter the other day and said something?

86
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,260
I asked if you had been playing around.

87
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,180
Who did what...

88
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,260
I heard everything from Principal Hong Sang Man.

89
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,740
You put glue on his chair,

90
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,600
and you invited the husbands to eat your strange cooking.

91
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,040
Your imagination is really beyond anything.

92
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,600
Don’t you know what has happened to that person now?

93
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,060
You have no discernment when it comes to people,
so what will you do?

94
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,940
That… that… the longer I know her…

95
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,260
Wait.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,440
What is she relying on that she can act that way?

97
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,060
Oh, really.

98
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
E-hee. Hong Sang Man.

99
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,120
Pervert.

100
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,940
Mother-in-law, I’ve co…

101
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,620
How were you able to come here in the morning?

102
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,760
Speaking of which, what happened to you?

103
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,160
When you had said that you were going to sleep here.

104
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,420
I had to wash up.

105
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,140
I went to a public bath.

106
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,280
Mother.

107
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,140
Was this person here all night?

108
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,080
Mother.

109
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,220
Don’t do it.

110
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,620
Unnie, come here.

111
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,920
Yes.

112
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,620
Yes, I will.

113
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,660
Avengers Club,

114
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,140
were you out doing that again?

115
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,640
Yes?

116
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,620
What in the world are you running around doing?

117
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,640
I told you already,
it’s just a parents group.

118
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,180
Embarrassing the principal,

119
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,280
and slapping the backs of the husbands’ heads,

120
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,700
that is a parents group?

121
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,560
Did the principal say that?

122
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,060
He was right after all.

123
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,300
That’s not it.

124
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,900
That person has been going around saying strange things.
That’s why I asked.

125
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,760
The incident happened unexpectedly.

126
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,300
And he didn’t seem like a trustworthy person anyway.

127
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,280
Wouldn’t it be better for you to keep your distance as well?

128
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,320
Whatever it is,

129
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,680
can’t you not do that strange group?

130
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,840
Yes?

131
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,220
Well, there are the things that you did, Sunbae.

132
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,980
So being fired was the right thing.

133
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,580
How would I be able to block that?

134
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,960
Mother-in-law.

135
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,240
Here. Here. This side.

136
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,560
This is the side where the re-development has been confirmed.

137
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,360
Yes, there, there.

138
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,680
Yes, right, there.

139
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,920
Towards that side, we’ll have to pull the schedule as much as possible,

140
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,080
so the construction will be started by the beginning of next year.

141
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,240
Now, Brother-in-law.

142
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,240
The only thing left is for the price of the land to rise.

143
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,660
You’re talking as if this was for me.

144
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,440
It’s for all of us.

145
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,680
What about Jung Hye?
She doesn’t have much to say, does she?

146
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,100
Her? Well, she doesn’t have any interest in things like this.

147
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
And even if I told her, she wouldn’t know what I was talking about.

148
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,820
Even if that person hold onto it,
then the General Manager that I am,

149
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,600
if I grow it well, then she’ll just thank me.

150
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,180
Yes?

151
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,020
My wife is with Byung Hoo?

152
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,200
Sister-in-law, what are you talking about so suddenly?

153
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,880
It’s just as I said.

154
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:05,920
Uh?

155
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,700
What are you doing here, darling?

156
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,680
Secretary Joo is very fast.

157
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,060
What could you have to say to Byung Hoo
that you came all this way?

158
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,660
I’ve already signed these,
so it’s just left for you to sign, Brother-in-law.

159
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,380
What is it?

160
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,540
My shares of Hae Rang Construction stock.

161
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,460
I’m giving them to Brother-in-law.

162
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,820
What are you giving?!

163
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,100
Who said you could?!

164
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,400
I said I could.

165
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,960
Do you want me to tell you exactly?

166
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,140
The price paid by Hae Rang to marry a guy like you,

167
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,280
this is mine!

168
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,140
There is a limit to what a person can do
just because they want to!

169
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,880
Why?

170
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,020
You take whatever of mine that you want.

171
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm saying that I'm going to do what I want with what’s mine.

172
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,220
So is there a problem with that?

173
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,380
Sister-in-law, it’s completed.

174
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,840
After I get it registered, I’ll see you again.

175
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,220
Yes.

176
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,760
What are you doing?!

177
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,560
Do you want to be embarrassed even further
in front of your little brother?

178
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,580
Yah!

179
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,640
Yah!

180
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,500
Yeobo!

181
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,460
Yeobo!

182
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,040
Whoa…
Just a minute.

183
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,760
You’re not really going to give them to him, are you?

184
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:17,980
Why?

185
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,220
You don’t like it?

186
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,420
If you give them to him,

187
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,760
then you, me, and even Soo Gyum,
it’ll be the end of us all.

188
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,380
It will probably be the end of you.

189
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,480
Anticipate it.

190
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,480
I get it. I understand.

191
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,580
I’ll take my hands off.

192
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,580
I will take my hands off your property.

193
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,840
Definitively return all the titles
to how they were before you talk to me.

194
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,860
I understand.

195
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,920
I understand.

196
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,600
I’ll return everything to the way it was,
so you have to do well also.

197
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,900
She gave her HaeRang stocks to Executive Director Lee?

198
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,060
She would be getting back at both Jung Joon
and General Manager Lee in one move.

199
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,320
She’s becoming more and more amusing.

200
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
We’ll talk again.

201
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,460
Yes.

202
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,560
The shares that I have in Geon Ah Group,
I’ll turn them over to you.

203
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,320
In order to protect what Lee Byung Soo
wants to steal away from you,

204
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,740
you’ll give up something even bigger.

205
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,660
No.

206
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,800
Then the calculation isn’t right.

207
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,400
Lee Byung Soo, I’ll oppose him.

208
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,680
Then?

209
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,540
If I make a decision, then I’ll tell you.

210
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,100
Oh, such a relief. I feel refreshed!

211
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,560
You did well. You did well.

212
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,920
Our Jung Hye is amazing.

213
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,660
You seem like the rich wife in a drama.

214
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,080
Today it seems to be even more delicious.

215
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,480
Drink up. Drink up.

216
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,860
Oh right, oppa, we have to buy that.

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,960
Uh, okay.

218
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,700
Let’s work. Work.

219
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,840
Aigoo, let’s work.

220
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,960
Let’s work.

221
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,860
Unnie, you’re putting that on the wrong…

222
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,440
Of all things…

223
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,480
Oh!

224
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,000
Here it is.

225
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,640
Oh.

226
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,260
There is a little flaw in it after all.

227
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,920
Unnie, Unnie, go quickly.

228
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,500
Quickly.

229
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,480
Don’t run around too late.

230
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,020
Oppa, you should call Mom
and come home more frequently.

231
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,700
I understand.

232
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,540
Bye!

233
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,160
Oh?

234
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,480
What are you doing here?

235
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,220
Knife.

236
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,320
Knife?

237
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,860
Exactly where does it need some attention?

238
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,440
Ah.

239
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,140
He...he...here... this side.

240
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
It has a notch.

241
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,840
Ah.

242
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,520
I’ll grind it down for you on the stone.

243
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,320
Will you do that?

244
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,820
Yes.

245
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,640
- Just wait a few minutes.
- Yes.

246
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,580
This looks as if it had been used for a long time.

247
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,460
About 4 years? 5 years?

248
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,840
You’re not just using only this one, are you?

249
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,740
I’ll take a look at your other ones sometime.

250
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,400
Thank you.

251
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,340
Then, I'd better go.

252
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,740
Wait.

253
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,720
It seems as if it’s raining outside.

254

Use this when you go.

262
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,640
Thank you.

263
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,900

267
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,740
Mom.

268
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,840
Oh, Son, you’re here?

269
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
Mom, did you just get back from somewhere?

270
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,180
Where would I be coming back from?
I was at work.

271
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,860
Ahh...

272
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,380
Mom, you seem to be in good spirits today.

273
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,380
Of course.

274
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,260
I have such a lovely son like you,
so of course, mom is always happy.

275
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,480
Hurry and wash up, then rest.

276
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,260
Okay.

277
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,020
Noona.

278
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,960
I’m in the middle of studying.

279
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,920
I think Mom has a boyfriend.

280
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,480
I don’t have time to joke around.

281
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,380
I saw him. In front of the house.

282
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,960
Was he good looking?

283
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,080
Is that what’s important?

284
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,880
Of course.

285
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,340
That’s the most important thing.

286
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,940
Doesn’t Noona care
if Mom meets another man?

287
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,200
Little brother.

288
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,240
A woman is a woman until she dies.

289
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,100
Even Mom?

290
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,100
Mom is mom.

291
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,980
Exactly.

292
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,200
After Dad passed away, for ten years,
Mom lived just as mom.

293
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,860
Until Mom says something,
let’s go ahead and let her keep it a secret.

294
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,020
But is it for real?

295
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,820
Jung Hye did?

296
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,300
In order to protect her inheritance,
she threatened you?

297
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,960
That she’ll hold hands with Executive Director Lee?

298
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,140
I told you that she did.

299
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,400
So?

300
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,160
What about what we were proposing?

301
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,220
It was all upended.

302
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,700
If I don’t revert the title back to her,

303
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,680
it seemed as if she was going to immediately give them to him.

304
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,380
This is why I really can’t do anything with you.

305
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
Can’t you control one wife?

306
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,120
I’m telling you that person has completely changed.

307
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,480
Oh really.

308
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,980
This is no time to be laughing, Brother-in-law.

309
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,000
If the shares of Hae Rang stock
that she has is given to Byung Hoo,

310
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,040
then it totally comes under the control
of that bastard and President Kim Jung Yoon.

311
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,800
Strangely, it seems as if it was after that kid came in,

312
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,600
that she started to change.

313
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,860
Who?

314
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,780
Soo Gyummie?

315
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,760
Oh, this is killing me.

316
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,260
I don’t know where or how to figure this one out.

317
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,120
Anyway, they're a son and a wife,
so I can’t just do something to them.

318
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,860
They’re in the way,
but you still need them.

319
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,440
That’s why it’s intolerable.

320
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,840
Get rid of them.

321
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,880
Yes?

322
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,410
It's about time for Father to come home. Should we scatter?

323
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,900
It's okay. He'll probably be late.

324
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,250
Did anything happen to Father?

325
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,430
He’s probably off drinking somewhere. Today...

326
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,430
I took care of him a little.

327
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,820
By any chance,

328
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,240
did you hit him?

329
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,840
I protected my inheritance.

330
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,930
- Did you know about it?
- I heard you met President Kim Jung Yoon

331
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,700
and asked her to protect my inheritance.

332
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,440
I will protect myself. I don't need the help of that person.

333
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,540
I'm sorry if I hurt...

334
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,390
your feelings.

335
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,950
I'm telling you...

336
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,480
not to be used for my sake.

337
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,790
However, aren't you curious how I took care of Lee Byung Soo?

338
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,620
Ah,

339
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,900
how did you do it?

340
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,660
Have you come home?

341
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,590
I'll go upstairs first. Good night.

342
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,590
Yes, go rest.

343
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,390
Get rid of them?

344
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,360
<i>English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and Dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club</i>

345
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,050
- Who?
- They are some fools.

346
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,050
Really...

347
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,820
Really...

348
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,680
The two of you must have a lot of free time?

349
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,170
We were passing by...

350
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,230
I heard you are close to my wife.

351
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,990
That's why they aren’t right for each other.

352
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,800
Eh..

353
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,420
You know what happened to Principal Hong Sang Man?

354
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,140
I know. He's completely failed.

355
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,110
Then what are you planning to do to us?

356
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,640
You are the leader of Avengers Club, right?

357
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,550
So?

358
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,420
Shall I tell you what we will do?

359
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,440
- Ay,
- Hey.

360
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,940
that’s where it was. Some ice in the cooler.

361
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,720
Over there. Please pour some in over there, over there.

362
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,220
Yes. All.

363
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,940
Don't change the conversation!

364
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,050
Please answer.

365
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,520
Aigoo.

366
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:34,020
Do? What would we do? It's just a friendship gathering,
drinking tea and talking about children.

367
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:40,080
- We know it's not just a gathering, so we are here…
- It's 15,000 won.

368
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,620
5,000 won.

369
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,040
- Yes?
- 5,000 won. Please give it to me quickly.

370
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,870
Ah yes. Here it is. Bye!

371
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:06,380
You seem to have nothing to say. As you see, I'm working.

372
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,030
Please go. Please go, please go. Go.

373
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,900
Don't look back!

374
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,460
<i>Leader gave them a punch this morning.</i>

375
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,570
A widow concept. Completed.

376
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,040
- What's this?
- My reward has been a little late.

377
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,100
- Is this the reward?
- Why? Not enough?

378
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,740
I selected all of my favorite ones.

379
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,440
You should have chosen all of my favorites in order for it to be a reward.

380
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,620
Ah, you're right.

381
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,980
<i>Son, I'm on the way to the Chairman to report to him about the tabloid article. Do you want to come, too?</i>

382
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,380
I’m going ahead.

383
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,860
I came to meet the Chairman.

384
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,190
You didn't make an appointment beforehand.
You can't just stubbornly insist on going in like this.

385
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,500
What appointment is needed between family!

386
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,640
Uh, uh, where are you touching! Where?

387
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,720
Do you know who I am? I am the Chairman's daughter-in-law! The first daughter-in-law!

388
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,590
- Oh really. Move!
- Crazy. Crazy.

389
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,990
Ah!

390
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,420
Oh, Son, why did you come so late?

391
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,100
Let's go see Grandfather. Oh, oh. No. Wait.

392
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:23,280
Oh, jagiya! Dad, dad. Dad, dad.

393
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,530
Jagi...

394
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,080
Jagiyah...ah, ah, ah…

395
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,170
Jagiyah, just wait right there for a second! Ah, ah.

396
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,420
I’m going crazy. Really.

397
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,100
Father.

398
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,100
Father,

399
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,800
I don't know how much you saw,
but this is not a situation that I made.

400
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,460
I was attacked unexpectedly, too. Ah!

401
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,460
Stupid bastard.

402
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,660
Father, I really don't know anything.

403
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,660
Remove her immediately!

404
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,500
I understand, Father. I will. I'll remove her immediately.

405
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,010
If that woman appears before my eyes once more,

406
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,420
you will be removed from this company.

407
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,560
- <i>Your call is not connected...</i>
- Ah, why is she not answering her phone?!

408
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,150
Why are there no normal women around me!

409
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,900
Ah, Ah. Why are you doing this?
Oh really. The stairs, the stairs. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

410
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,940
Release me. Release me. Let me go already! Ah!

411
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,890
I told you if you do it again, you'll be dead.

412
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,980
You took away all my money, so it looks
as if I’m going to die anyway. That's why I came here.

413
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,700
To ask the highest person to save me.

414
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,230
You did?
Okay. Let's go. To die.

415
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,620
I won’t die. Uh? I won't die. Uh? Yah, I will not die!

416
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,010
Die? Why would I die?

417
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,010
Taxi! Taxi!

418
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:04,340
<i>English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and Dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club</i>

419
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,400
Who are you?! Omo! Omo! Call the police!

420
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,930
This. Release it, release, release, release.
Omo, why these? Release it! You won’t release them?

421
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,730
No, no! Why on earth are you doing this? In someone else's house? Who are you?

422
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,940
Don’t touch. Don’t touch.

423
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,700
I told them to do it. Why?!

424
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,860
Why are you doing this, huh?
Do you know how much this is? You’re really crazy!

425
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,870
How can I not go crazy because of you?!
Even if you’re crazy, you should be moderately crazy!

426
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
- Is that all?
- There's a car owned by her.

427
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,590
That, you definitely can’t have. Because I was saving that car, I hardly rode it…

428
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,060
Get rid of it and clean here.

429
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,660
Yes.

430
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,010
No, yeobo! I…

431
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,630
Whatever you have to do, don’t let her
appear in front of my eyes, ok?

432
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,340
- Yes.
- No. Wait. Let go. Let go. No. You can't.

433
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,130
Stop. Lee Byung Soo!
Hey, you evil bastard!

434
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,450
Let me go. Let me go! Let me go!

435
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,570
By 10 o'clock, you'll arrive at Incheon Port.
Take her onboard immediately.

436
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,580
I have to take a ship? No. Wait wait!

437
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,540
No. Wait wait! Okay! Okay!

438
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,980
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Hurry and come back.

439
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,740
Ah, I'll go. Ah I see. I'm going.

440
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Aish..

441
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:31,150
Save me! Oh! Save me! Oh!

442
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,870
What? Ran away?

443
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,580
You can't even deal with that simple thing.
Find her right now!

444
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,750
Aish…

445
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,380
You don't need to worry.
I'm getting rid of that woman.

446
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,200
Aish, that woman even came to the office and made a fuss!

447
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,610
You’ve suffered too.

448
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,610
But what's this?

449
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,190
Ah, this! Yeobo, it's for you.

450
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,820
Why are you doing this?

451
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,380
I myself went to the flower shop and chose them to give to you.

452
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,560
Ah, and this too, I myself chose one which would suit you well.

453
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,990
A scarf.

454
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,500
It's a scarf, right?
I told you I chose it myself.

455
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,840
- By chance, is it Mother's birthday today?
- No.

456
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,870
I did something wrong to you,

457
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,840
and we are people who have to live together
for the rest of our lives.

458
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,880
If there is something to resolve, then let's resolve it.
And let's receive anything we should receive. Hmm?

459
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,950
Oh, also you! I said that you should tell me
everything that you want for your birthday!

460
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,590
- Whatever you want, just tell me!
- Yes.

461
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,240
- I will think about it.
- Yes. Don't feel burdened.

462
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,080
Sh..

463
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:05,650
Yes.

464
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,770
Find one where they can leave within this month.

465
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,770
The faster, the better.

466
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,180
There are three members.
Do you think you're safe?

467
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,140
Avengers Club members are...

468
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,180
Soon, I will take care of them.

469
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,230
- What's that?
- Mother's knit scarf.

470
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,110
Mother will like it.

471
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,860
By the way, please prepare dinner tonight.

472
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,790
- At home? Are guests coming?
- Yes. Camp people.

473
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,500
To commemorate the conference,
we wanted to have dinner together.

474
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,910
Yes. I will.

475
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,690
Conference? Camp?

476
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,040
<i>I call for a meeting of the Avengers Club.</i>

477
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,570
So we're going to start the campaign
for rejecting Candidate Baek Young Pyo?

478
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,970
There is only one week left until the election.

479
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,930
Yes. Today, they will have a conference at home, so I will try to find anything.

480
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:46,050
Yes. Try to listen what they're talking about,
and get any paperwork.

481
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,490
- Surely, you’ll be able to find something, right?
- Shall we go together saying we will help?

482
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,910
Aigoo. No, you can’t. Other than Soo Gyum,
we Avengers Club members have already been found out.

483
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,280
Well, but it's nothing to be disappointed about.

484
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,040
Oh. Aigoo!

485
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,440
Mother! This.

486
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,340
Knit it again. You can just knit it again.

487
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,700
You did well!
Unknit, unknit.

488
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,590
I will hold it for you.
You’re doing so well.

489
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,320
It seems the other party was trying to bring up the election funds issue.

490
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
They were? Aish.

491
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,140
By any chance, if they contact Hae Rang,
and things get complicated...

492
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,860
That's nothing to worry about there.
I'm managing Director Lee personally.

493
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,420
But since one never knows, clean up the papers in the office.

494
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,350
Yes, I understand.

495
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,860
- Please have some fruit.
- Yes.

496
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,780
Yes.

497
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,550
- Thank you.
- Yes.

498
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:59,490
If you want anything more, please tell me.

499
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,530
I'll eat well, Madam.

500
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,030
- Yes.
- I'll eat well. I’ll eat well.

501
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,750
- We're in the middle of discussing something important.
- Yes.

502
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,120
Please talk comfortably.

503
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,180
Have some fruit.

504
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,960
This..

505
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,750
Did everyone leave?

506
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,350
Yes. You've worked hard today.

507
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,860
Yes.

508
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,930
That is... I saw the papers and I
was just about to take a photo with the phone.

509
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,540
At that moment, my husband came in, so I couldn't...

510
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,680
Ah... ah...

511
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,120
Then, how about digging into the
other side who gave them the money?

512
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,900
He was suspicious about us and even visited you, Unnie.
Why would he answer that just because I asked?

513
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,270
Right. Right.

514
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,420
Isn’t there any evidence? Didn't you hear anything yesterday?

515
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,020
I tried to listen, but my husband told me to go away.

516
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,450
He just told them to clean up the papers in the office.

517
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,950
Ah!

518
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,620
That's it!

519
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,310
What?

520
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,310
That?

521
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:51,028
Hello.

522
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:52,572
Omo!

523
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,532
Omo… Madam.

524
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:54,996
Ah, but,

525
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,516
Candidate Baek and everyone had scheduled events,

526
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,876
so they have already left.

527
00:37:57,956 --> 00:37:59,204
No, that’s okay.

528
00:37:59,204 --> 00:38:01,460
I just came by for a second to drop this off.

529
00:38:01,476 --> 00:38:03,468
Omo… Thank you.

530
00:38:03,468 --> 00:38:04,372
Please enjoy it.

531
00:38:04,372 --> 00:38:05,756
- We’ll eat it well.
- Yes.

532
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,052
Yes.

533
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:28,690
The documents you mentioned have already been taken care of.

534
00:38:31,988 --> 00:38:32,492
Yes.

535
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,492
I understand.

536
00:39:20,132 --> 00:39:20,780
Unnie…

537
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,684
It’s in here.

538
00:39:23,684 --> 00:39:26,172
I saw it clearly, that they were all in here.

539
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,724
So, you're saying...

540
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:31,244
- T-that we just have to put all these together then, right?
- Yes.

541
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:33,772
We just have to put them together, right?

542
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,100
Ah, yes. Then…

543
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:36,300
Let’s try it.

544
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,948
This… is for Jung Hye. Here.

545
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:39,692
Ah…

546
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:42,412
So this was not the only one…

547
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:43,428
This here is for Unnie.

548
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,476
Do you think you can do it?

549
00:39:49,316 --> 00:39:51,764
Of course, this much?

550
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:53,324
It can be done in one night.

551
00:39:53,948 --> 00:39:55,060
Then, Unnie, here.

552
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:57,764
Ah!

553
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:05,012
I’ll do it at home and bring it back.

554
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,748
- Jung Hye...
- Jung Hye...

555
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:08,676
Don't you want to do it together?

556
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:11,644
If we do it as a group, it should be faster...

557
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:13,036
Shall we do that?

558
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,556
Such a son, that I couldn’t stop him…

559
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,716
Because of Madam’s interview,

560
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:18,804
the support has been falling.

561
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,124
So, today’s speech

562
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:21,932
must become a definite turning point.

563
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,732
Yes, it must.

564
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:27,532
I hope that there will be...

565
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:30,756
No troubled death like my son’s in this land.

566
00:40:35,412 --> 00:40:36,780
No troubled death...

567
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,084
Like my son’s…

568
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:51,268
Mom, what did you say this is?

569
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:52,868
It’s done.

570
00:40:53,948 --> 00:40:55,236
Mom, how much did you say it was per sheet?

571
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,436
Let's look at how many you do,

572
00:40:57,996 --> 00:40:58,980
and then I’ll calculate it altogether in full.

573
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:01,364
There are nothing but numbers here.

574
00:41:01,948 --> 00:41:03,188
What document is this?

575
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,316
To find that out is why we’re here doing this.

576
00:41:05,492 --> 00:41:05,980
Oh.

577
00:41:06,324 --> 00:41:07,420
Mom said she needs it.

578
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:09,436
Oh, Mom.

579
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:10,956
Is he handsome?

580
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:13,900
Noona,

581
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:15,860
you haven’t even finished one sheet.

582
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:19,380
Hm?

583
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:20,652
Who?

584
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:25,676
Among the male celebrities,

585
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:27,588
who do you think is handsome?

586
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:29,876
Uhm...

587
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:32,116
Hmm...

588
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:35,524
No matter how much I think about it,

589
00:41:35,548 --> 00:41:37,268
I don’t think there is anyone as handsome as Hee Soo.

590
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,964
Oh…

591
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:56,764
Mother-in-Law!

592
00:41:58,204 --> 00:41:59,140
Don’t do it anymore.

593
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,204
This isn’t fun.

594
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:04,908
Mother-in-law…

595
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,780
Have you found anything out?

596
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,068
How about you, Madam?

597
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:25,468
My eyes are so sore.

598
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,188
My shoulder feels as if it’s going to fall out.

599
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,900
Do you think the Unnies found something?

600
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:32,980
If they had, they would have contacted us by now.

601
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:46,404
If I could have done this as a job,

602
00:42:46,604 --> 00:42:48,268
I would have earned a lot of money.

603
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:51,708
Now whenever I even see paper, I’m dizzy.

604
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:54,364
If I could have focused this hard when I’m studying,

605
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:56,452
I would have gotten into Harvard.

606
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:02,908
Mi Sook, but isn’t this something you’re good at?

607
00:43:02,908 --> 00:43:04,316
Arranging, and then putting things together?

608
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:06,868
Ah, I could have finished more,

609
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:07,884
But Mother-in-law

610
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:09,596
messed some of them up.

611
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,660
<i>[…Foreign Acc…Contributions…]</i>

612
00:43:41,676 --> 00:43:42,452
These are

613
00:43:42,676 --> 00:43:44,308
really like my babies.

614
00:43:47,636 --> 00:43:48,748
Would it be okay...

615
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,980
If I just put this one on for the last time?

616
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:56,644
How much is it for all of these?

617
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:57,844
Please wait a moment.

618
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:09,924
Customer…?

619
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:18,012
Lee Byung Soo

620
00:44:19,204 --> 00:44:20,572
I won’t let you get away with this.

621
00:44:26,436 --> 00:44:27,276
Oh...

622
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,620
Both of you came in together just in time.

623
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:29,860
Come have a seat.

624
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:33,708
I have a big announcement.

625
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:34,812
What is it?

626
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:36,092
Let’s talk about it sitting down.

627
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:45,060
Well, here.

628
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:55,796
What is this?

629
00:44:57,124 --> 00:44:58,360
They say that now is the best time to go there.

630
00:44:58,636 --> 00:45:00,324
You have to study management courses anyway.

631
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:01,868
It’s good to begin your studies at a university.

632
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:03,692
What are you doing?

633
00:45:03,884 --> 00:45:04,644
Ah, you.

634
00:45:06,052 --> 00:45:07,540
Pick one that you like.

635
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:08,644
Here.

636
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,100
What are you trying to do?

637
00:45:12,324 --> 00:45:14,068
How could we let a child go over there alone,

638
00:45:14,364 --> 00:45:16,652
when he has a good mother like you to support him?

639
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:19,292
Besides, you are restless living here.

640
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,212
Father!

641
00:45:20,324 --> 00:45:21,436
Ah, no need to hurry things.

642
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:23,628
You can choose a university once you're there.

643
00:45:24,196 --> 00:45:26,092
They’ve all been selected after much consideration.

644
00:45:26,212 --> 00:45:27,508
So take your time looking at them.

645
00:45:28,884 --> 00:45:31,540
How can Father make decisions by yourself
about a matter like this?

646
00:45:32,716 --> 00:45:34,116
Since you have entered this family,

647
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:36,156
this is a stage that you must go through.

648
00:45:37,524 --> 00:45:38,884
I have no thought of doing that.

649
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,676
I won’t go.

650
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:43,500
I haven’t asked for your opinion.

651
00:45:44,644 --> 00:45:45,188
Right now,

652
00:45:45,436 --> 00:45:47,996
you only have to choose which university you want to attend.

653
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:49,004
Stop doing this.

654
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,284
You know you’re being unreasonable, don’t you?

655
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:55,780
Do you think I doing this because I’m bored?

656
00:45:56,508 --> 00:45:57,692
This matter has already been settled.

657
00:45:58,916 --> 00:45:59,964
What are you saying?

658
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,308
I have already gotten permission from Father-in-Law

659
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:04,916
to send the two of you abroad.

660
00:46:05,852 --> 00:46:07,084
Why are you deciding

661
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,252
where I should live?

662
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,148
Since it's already been decided,

663
00:46:10,764 --> 00:46:11,868
go in good spirits.

664
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:25,540
“Father-in-law’s permission,”

665
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:26,484
what does that mean?

666
00:46:26,548 --> 00:46:27,380
Ay.. I...

667
00:46:28,116 --> 00:46:29,548
I wasn’t going to say this.

668
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,540
I am...

669
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,236
making a lot of effort to protect you and Soo Gyum.

670
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:37,188
Protect?

671
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,284
You and him, don't you know

672
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,524
there are strange rumors going around?

673
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:43,396
Those have reached Father-in-law’s ear,

674
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:45,516
and he's very worried

675
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,360
about the impact on the company.

676
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:49,500
He has told me several times

677
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,852
to make sure that it doesn’t affect Geon Ah Group.

678
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:54,700
I will talk to Father about this by myself.

679
00:46:57,324 --> 00:46:59,084
Don't make several people feel tired,

680
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,884
and just do as you’re told.

681
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:03,188
Since there is no one

682
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:05,524
who welcomes you and that kid.

683
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:09,484
You.

684
00:47:10,636 --> 00:47:11,516
I won't let you get away with this.

685
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,892
I've already finished the school transfer procedure in advance,

686
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:52,756
so just know that.

687
00:47:52,876 --> 00:47:54,836
I've definitely told you that I'm not going.

688
00:47:54,908 --> 00:47:57,220
Although his enrollment has already
been arranged, you'd better double check it.

689
00:47:57,396 --> 00:47:58,428
I will get people to help you.

690
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:01,300
Why don’t you moderate your fake helpfulness?

691
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:03,516
Ah... Also,

692
00:48:04,188 --> 00:48:05,236
before you two leave,

693
00:48:05,988 --> 00:48:06,932
get some tutoring in English.

694
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,996
Don't worry.

695
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:37,924
If you don’t want to, then you’re not going.

696
00:48:40,116 --> 00:48:40,796
Same with Madam.

697
00:48:42,148 --> 00:48:43,180
If Madam don't want to,

698
00:48:43,396 --> 00:48:44,020
then it won’t happen.

699
00:48:45,732 --> 00:48:47,700
I’m not going to let those people make decisions for me.

700
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,500
Did you make a decision yet?

701
00:48:56,532 --> 00:48:57,540
I’ve said this before,

702
00:48:58,524 --> 00:48:59,620
that Madam should just think of yourself.

703
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,876
No matter what kind of decision you make,

704
00:49:03,628 --> 00:49:04,428
it's okay with me.

705
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:21,020
Why are you living with Father?

706
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:24,596
Is it a case of the ideal being separate from reality?

707
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:28,884
The only thing I can do

708
00:49:29,268 --> 00:49:30,908
is live as that person’s wife.

709
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:32,004
Who said so?

710
00:49:33,852 --> 00:49:35,036
Who told you to live like this?

711
00:49:35,612 --> 00:49:37,732
Put aside your family, relations, others’ opinions.

712
00:49:38,124 --> 00:49:38,732
How about you?

713
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,756
What do you want to do?

714
00:50:18,428 --> 00:50:20,196
You’re going to have to find a person for me.

715
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:27,740
<i>I have decided.</i>

716
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:29,812
<i>Going forward,</i>

717
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:31,276
<i>I will decide on how I should live.</i>

718
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:32,892
You’ve made a good decision.

719
00:50:51,436 --> 00:50:52,236
This is unusual.

720
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,372
This is the first time that you wanted to see me first.

721
00:50:56,044 --> 00:50:56,604
Grandfather.

722
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,540
My "ankle."

723
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:00,420
I will let you "grab" it.

724
00:51:01,948 --> 00:51:02,388
What?

725
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,100
It looks as if you have a request.

726
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:05,724
Yes.

727
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:08,860
Let me hear it anyway.

728
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:09,652
Please let go

729
00:51:10,396 --> 00:51:11,068
of Madam.

730
00:51:13,324 --> 00:51:14,684
I will let you "grab my ankle."

731
00:51:15,268 --> 00:51:15,652
But instead,

732
00:51:17,356 --> 00:51:18,364
please let Madam go.

733
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:22,676
What is the reason you want to do this?

734
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:24,124
Father is planning on sending

735
00:51:25,524 --> 00:51:26,972
Madam and me out of country by force.

736
00:51:27,636 --> 00:51:28,100
What?!

737
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,452
I don't want Father

738
00:51:30,076 --> 00:51:32,092
to order me and Madam around anymore.

739
00:51:32,668 --> 00:51:33,476
I would like Grandfather

740
00:51:34,444 --> 00:51:35,796
to take care of this situation.

741
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:36,916
You said...

742
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:40,324
That a family member is a person
who becomes someone you need.

743
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,564
Right now,

744
00:51:42,244 --> 00:51:43,228
I need you, Grandfather.

745
00:51:59,996 --> 00:52:01,068
Oh...

746
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:03,596
How did you know I'm not in a good mood?

747
00:52:05,844 --> 00:52:06,996
Just cook some ramen for me then.

748
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,548
If you maintain a good relationship with Senator Choi,

749
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,140
it will help your term of service go smoothly.

750
00:52:13,532 --> 00:52:15,404
And reappointment will also come naturally.

751
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,300
Thanks for your hard work.

752
00:52:22,092 --> 00:52:22,564
Hello. What is it?

753
00:52:23,564 --> 00:52:26,676
Yeobo, Mother-in-law’s illness suddenly relapsed,

754
00:52:27,036 --> 00:52:28,436
so you should also go to the hospital quickly.

755
00:52:31,996 --> 00:52:33,036
This also happened a little while ago.

756
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:35,804
It's not the first time, so why are you overreacting so much?

757
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,964
I have an important schedule to attend to now, so I can’t go.

758
00:52:40,132 --> 00:52:40,452
Hang up.

759
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:52,428
<i>Why do you keep calling me?</i>

760
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:54,756
Mother has just entered the Intensive Care Unit!

761
00:52:54,756 --> 00:52:56,228
Come to the hospital immediately!

762
00:52:57,068 --> 00:52:57,924
<i>Is she in a critical condition?</i>

763
00:52:58,244 --> 00:52:59,636
She's regained her consciousness,

764
00:52:59,636 --> 00:53:00,756
but her breathing is not stable.

765
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,196
<i>Aigoo, Senator Choi!</i>

766
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:27,348
Mother-in-law!

767
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,220
She’s alright, isn’t she?

768
00:53:30,284 --> 00:53:31,788
This is already the third time.

769
00:53:31,804 --> 00:53:34,052
One more time of septic shock could be very dangerous.

770
00:53:36,028 --> 00:53:37,188
Is there any other method?

771
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:39,524
The medicine she's using now is not effective anymore either.

772
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:41,068
And she is elderly.

773
00:53:41,316 --> 00:53:43,436
Trying to prevent her illness from getting worse
is the best method now.

774
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,284
What should I do?

775
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,000
Ma’am, I’m going home quickly for a change of clothes.

776
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Can you please take care of my mother in the meantime?

777
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yes.

778
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,970
They say the crisis has passed, so go ahead,
run home and be back.

779
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,970
Yes. Then.

780
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,270
Do you have something worrying you, too?

781
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,400
Hyung, too?

782
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,740
You go first.

783
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,570
The thing is it’s not certain yet.

784
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,940
I don’t have anything that’s certain either.

785
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,370
I saw my mother getting out of some guy’s car.

786
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:22,540
Not a taxi?

787
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,370
No. It was a really awesome car.

788
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,300
The driver was pretty cool-looking, too.

789
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,340
So did you dislike seeing them together?

790
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:37,240
Since I felt bad that my mom was living only for us,

791
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,140
I thought it would be nice if my mom met someone nice.

792
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,870
But I guess, that wasn’t really true.

793
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:51,000
I worry what I would say if my mom told us
she had really met someone.

794
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,900
I don’t know what to say

795
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,200
so I can’t even ask her about it.

796
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,300
But you know,

797
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:04,040
your mom could just have gotten a ride.

798
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:07,300
Hyung, it’s because you didn’t see the expression
on my mom’s face.

799
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,370
That was the first time I ever saw my mom laughing like that.

800
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,540
So what?

801
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,900
Your mom always laughs.

802
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,970
It’s different.

803
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,100
That’s hard.

804
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,370
What about hyung? What’s worrying you?

805
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,270
Mine is a little bit harder.

806
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,640
Save me! I’ll repay you! One more time!

807
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,640
Han Soo Ji?

808
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:21,740
I'm not in a position to just hang out with you like this
as if we have all the time in the world.

809
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,770
I know.

810
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,240
I know that Lee Byung Soo is forcing you out.

811
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,770
Did you order him to do that?

812
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,770
I have a favor to ask.

813
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:36,300
Do I look like I'm in a position to listen to your requests?

814
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,370
What favor did you want from me?

815
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:49,270
Do an interview.

816
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,570
Interview?

817
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:54,270
An interview about Hae Rang Construction’s Lee Byung Soo’s mistress, Han Soo Ji.

818
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,200
Will you do it or not?

819
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,700
Yes. I'll do it. Let’s do it.

820
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,800
When should I do it?

821
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,040
One more thing.

822
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,770
Come on, why do you have so many conditions?

823
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,900
Don’t appear in front of Soo Gyum ever again.

824
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,900
Uh, okay.

825
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,370
Okay. Okay.

826
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:33,400
Since I have an interview to prepare for,

827
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,840
I need to do my hair so I’m going to leave first.

828
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,870
Right now I’m on my way to see Han Soo Ji.

829
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,040
Yes.

830
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:53,400
If you give her that, she will definitely say that she will do it.

831
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,770
Even now, if you don’t want me to…

832
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:55,970
No.

833
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:59,470
Please make sure you do it for me.

834
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,570
But they are your birth parents.

835
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,940
You know the situation well.

836
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,970
That those people

837
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,400
are worse to me than strangers.

838
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,240
Seo Yeon?

839
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,100
Ahh…

840
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,100
Just…

841
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:40,600
Your grandmother suddenly took a turn for the worse,
so I have to go back to the hospital.

842
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,840
Her condition is stable, so tomorrow you
and I will visit your grandmother together.

843
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,270
Okay.

844
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:14,100
<i>Lastly from here, regarding the death of my son,
that I wasn’t honest about the situation.</i>

845
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,600
<i>I would like to get forgiveness from everyone in the country.</i>

846
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,100
<i>My son</i>

847
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:25,170
<i>insisted that the school system here in Korea
wouldn’t allow him to realize his dreams,</i>

848
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,170
<i>and chose to go abroad for school.</i>

849
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,200
<i>That I wasn’t able to stop my son from that decision </i>

850
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,740
<i>was because</i>

851
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:38,000
<i>I acknowledged that this country’s education system had issues.</i>

852
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,240
That’s all lies.

853
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,440
<i>So that in this land of ours,</i>

854
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:50,540
<i>that more miserable deaths like my son’s won’t occur again,</i>

855
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,270
<i>I am in this position despite being embarrassed.</i>

856
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:56,270
<i>For over 20 years having served as a professor,</i>

857
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:59,200
<i>now as the Superintendent of Schools for Seoul,</i>

858
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,300
<i>I want to finally realize the long developed plans.</i>

859
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:18,200
You said Oppa wanted to go abroad.

860
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,800
Seo Yeon, go to your room.

861
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:29,070
He failed science, so you told him you were ashamed
and he had to go abroad.

862
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,540
Oppa said so much that he didn’t want to go!

863
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,570
He said he was afraid, but you forced him to go!

864
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:35,200
Yah, Baek Seo Yeon!

865
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,740
What do you think you know that you can speak
so rudely to me like this?!

866
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,900
Why?!

867
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,540
You’re going to hit me, too?!

868
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,670
I wish I were dead, too!

869
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:44,570
Brat.

870
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,570
How dare you raise your hand to her?

871
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,170
You.

872
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,240
You,

873
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,100
you’re finished!

874
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:08,170
<i>English Subtitles by Avengers Subbing Club</i>
https://avengerssubbingclub.wordpress.com/

875
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,440
Here it is.

876
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:14,900
Knife.

877
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,340
I will take my hands off your property.

878
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,500
We’re members of the Avengers Club. Why?

879
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,000
Slapping the backs of the husbands' heads, that is a parents group?

880
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,200
You’re the leader of the Avengers Club, right?

881
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,300
- The first daughter-in-law!
- Crazy. Crazy.

882
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:46,700
Ahhh!

883
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,970
This is yours.

884
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:57,740
- Do an interview.
- Okay.

885
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,670
Don’t appear in front of Soo Gyum ever again.

886
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,500
