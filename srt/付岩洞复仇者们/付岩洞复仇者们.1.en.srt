The siblings both gave off such a fishy smell…

182
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,140
Your senses are just so…

183
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,120
However, your fishy smelling noona,

184
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,360
she looks as if she would give guys a lot of attention.

185
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,920
Since your mom doesn’t have a husband, it’s probably…

186
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,780
Yah!

187
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,960
- Let go!
- Are you crazy?!

188
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,540
- Hey!!
- Let go!

189
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,180
Really.

190
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,320
Awesome with your meal, the nation’s fish, mackerel!

191
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,040
That will be $7.

192
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,740
It was delicious, so I came back.

193
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,580
Thank you.

194
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,280
- Enjoy and come again..
- Yes, I will.

195
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,860
Yes. Yes, I’m Hee Soo’s mom.

196
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,280
What?

197
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,440
- Where are you going?
-  What’s the matter?

198
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Did something happen?

199
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,760
Taxi! Taxi!

200
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,300
Taxi! Taxi!

201
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,840
Are you okay?

202
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,380
Forget it. Ta…!

203
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,820
It’s a red light.

204
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,520
It’s a green…!

205
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,140
I’m sorry. I was in such a rush.

206
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,200
At least, a hospital…

207
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,960
Forget it. If your car is fine, then just go!

208
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,860
Don’t change your story later,

209
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,940
let’s first go to the hospital.

210
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,600
Ah! Okay, let’s go.

211
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,700
Hurry! Hurry, hurry!

212
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,520
Yes?

213
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,300
Sevit High School.

214
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,980
Look here, do you think you’re in a taxi right now?

215
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,720
I’m sorry. It’s just that I’m in such a rush right now.

216
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,460
You didn’t hit me with your car at all.

217
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,620
I tripped on my own leg.

218
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,000
And at a red light at that.

219
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,220
It was my fault,

220
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,800
so if there is nothing wrong with your car,
let’s pretend it never happened.

221
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,160
I’m sorry for giving you a fright.

222
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,500
My child got into some trouble at school,
so I’m feeling very panicked….

223
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,960
Oh, oh, oh, here.
Right turn! Right turn.

224
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,840
Aigoo. Thank you. Thank you.

225
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,820
Buam Market Hong Do Fish.

226
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,720
Come by sometime, and I’ll properly pay you back.

227
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,940
Thank you.

228
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,300
Ajumma!

229
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hong Do Fish!

230
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,520
Yes?! What is it?!

231
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,540
Ah! Ah! Ah!
You’ve saved me several times today!

232
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,720
Thank you.

233
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,040
Make sure to come by.
I’ll give you some cutlassfish.

234
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,180
No thanks.

235
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,720
<i>The kid has suddenly come.</i>

236
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,060
<i>We should act properly, like adults.</i>

237
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,560
We?

238
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,440
He seems to have hurt his elbow when he fell,

239
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,110
but I don’t think there is anything else wrong.

240
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,080
Hee Soo, you should apologize.

241
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,720
Don’t scold him too much.

242
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,210
- Oh!
- Mother.

243
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,120
Hurry up and go back inside.

244
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,100
I’m sorry.

245
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,460
I had not wanted to disappoint you, Mom.

246
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,620
Kim Hee Soo!

247
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,140
Children are supposed to worry
their parents sometimes.

248
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,240
Even though you’re going through puberty,
you’ve been far too boring till now.

249
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,320
Jung Wook, he’s that jerk from middle school, isn’t he?

250
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,760
I’m going to take care of everything,
so you don’t worry about a thing.

251
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,140
Understand?

252
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,220
Mom, let’s not say a word of this to noona.

253
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,600
As it is, she must be having a hard time
after failing the recruitment exam.

254
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,720
Of course.

255
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,840
If your sister knew, then that jerk’s remaining elbow will be broken, too.

256
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,460
That’s right.

257
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,820
Mom, you left your store empty, didn’t you?

258
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,180
You should go.

259
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,960
Okay.

260
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,740
Buy something delicious to eat.

261
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,500
It’s okay, I still have my spending money.

262
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,480
Mom’s leaving.

263
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,500
Mom!

264
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,040
Why?

265
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,620
Your pants are ripped.

266
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,340
It’s fine. It’s barely noticeable anyway.

267
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,680
But it is noticeable.

268
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,500
Go home and change first!

269
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,440
I understand!

270
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:11,980
Oh.

271
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,280
Madam, your flowers are even prettier today.

272
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,460
Please enjoy your flower arranging.

273
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,740
Yes. Thank you.

274
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:21,880
Oh.

275
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,960
I heard that Professor Baek
is going to run for the Office of Education.

276
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,080
Madam will probably become busy now as well.

277
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,880
I had wanted him to work at the school,

278
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
but since he had other intentions,
all I can do is go along.

279
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,320
Wow.

280
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,120
That is so great.

281
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,420
My Professor Kang just has no ambition.

282
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,440
Forget about the Office of Education,

283
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,060
he doesn’t even want to be
the department head at his school.

284
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,840
What is it with husbands?

285
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,960
That’s what I say.

286
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,140
Isn’t your son a senior in high school this year?

287
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,060
Ah.

288
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,760
Yes.

289
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,120
It’s already become like that.

290
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,920
Our child, he wanted to go abroad
to study so much that we sent him,

291
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,540
but he’s always whining that
he wants to come back to Korea.

292
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:03,940
Ah!

293
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,020
Seo Jin has adjusted well, hasn’t he?

294
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,480
He’s always been good at taking care of himself.

295
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,740
Ay.

296
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,760
What is there to worry about in your family?

297
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,900
That’s right.

298
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,160
A successful husband,

299
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,500
a son who does well in his studies,

300
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,060
and even a pretty daughter.

301
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,320
Omo!

302
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,540
Were you pricked?

303
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,460
No.

304
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,240
It’s fine.

305
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,760
I’ll leave first since I have an appointment.

306
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,580
See you next time.

307
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,340
Yes.

308
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,260
Bye.

309
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,560
Oh.

310
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,760
I envy her.

311
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,120
I envy her so much.

312
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,280
It’s nice, right?!

313
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,160
Oh, yeobo.

314
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,960
It’s only now that the whole family has gathered together. Hm?

315
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,060
Make your greeting.

316
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,800
Hello.

317
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,320
I’m Kim Soo Gyum.

318
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,320
No, no.

319
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,680
You’re Lee Soo Gyum now.

320
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,440
Ah!

321
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,260
That’s right.

322
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,840
I’m Lee Soo Gyum.

323
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,960
Let’s eat together and talk a little.

324
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,820
I’m tired.

325
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,860
You swim very well.

326
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,720
Oh, yes.

327
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,540
It’s because I was in the sea every day as I was growing up.

328
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,560
You like to play sports, don't you?

329
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,360
Except for spending money,
I like everything.

330
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,700
You kid!

331
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,740
Oh, sorry.

332
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,100
I was in a hurry to get it done.

333
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,560
So I didn’t even have time
to tell you ahead of time.

334
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,780
You did well.

335
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,260
They were all going
to be thrown away anyway.

336
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,740
Let’s go.

337
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,140
<i>My beloved son~</i>

338
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,500
<i>Congrats! Congrats!</i>

339
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,220
<i>Let’s do well together in the future!</i>

340
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,000
You just can’t find a comparable place.

341
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,780
Don’t worry. I’ll do well.

342
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,420
Oh!

343
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,640
Did you sleep well?

344
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,300
You’re up early.

345
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,880
A new coffee shop opened up in front of the house.

346
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,980
I don’t drink lattes.

347
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,320
Wow, there is definitely a reason why
you have a youthful face.

348
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,200
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies, Dongsaengs and Haraboji of Avengers Subbing Club"

349
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:20,760
Oh!

350
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,840
If you leave food on your plate,
you’ll be punished.

351
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,760
She won’t understand.

352
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,220
Ajumma!

353
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
Yes, sir.

354
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,740
Breakfast is ready.

355
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,420
Sit down.

356
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,820
Sunbae.

357
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,060
Oh, Professor Park,
it’s been a long time.

358
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,460
Yes, it really has been a long time.

359
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,840
Hello.

360
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,160
Professor Baek!

361
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,000
Aigoo, Director Lee.

362
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,760
Thank you for coming by.

363
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,520
Congratulations.

364
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:50,840
Yes.

365
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,480
I’ll come greet you again.
See you inside.

366
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,620
Ay, General Manager Lee.

367
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,500
Congratulations.

368
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,780
I’m very grateful that
such a busy person came.

369
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,340
Of course, I had to come.

370
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,740
My father also told me
to make sure to give you his greetings.

371
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,380
Thank you so much.

372
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,260
Ah!

373
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,380
I heard that the Chairman went overseas for some treatment.

374
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,360
How is he doing?

375
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,320
Well, he’s going to be fine.

376
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,560
He’ll have to come back soon.

377
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,720
That’s a relief.

378
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,260
Hello.

379
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,360
I’m happy to meet you.

380
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,840
Congratulations.

381
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,680
Thank you.

382
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,140
First time for us to meet, Madam.

383
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,180
I’m Hae Rang Construction’s Lee Byung Soo.

384
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,780
Oh, yes, I’m happy to meet you.

385
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,340
I’ve heard a lot about you.

386
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,880
I’ve heard often that
Madam’s support is amazing.

387
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,040
Please teach this person as well.

388
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,100
No, not at all.

389
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,240
The two of you look very good together.

390
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,240
Aigoo, am I a little late?

391
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,940
- Sunbae, thank you for coming.
- You've come.

392
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,520
Ay, yes.

393
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,220
Our Professor Baek.

394
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,560
Your face is just glowing.

395
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,500
That vulgar energy is just
dripping off you. Just dripping.

396
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,060
Sunbae, I’ll host you to an evening soon.

397
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,500
Sounds good. Sounds good. Hm?

398
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Our General Manager Lee is always so nice no matter when I see him.

399
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,620
Sunbae.

400
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,240
You’re meeting my wife
for the first time, aren’t you?

401
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,600
Oh yes.

402
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,700
Ah, he’s the principal at Seo Yeon’s school.

403
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,380
And, he was the sunbae to
Byung Soo and me in high school.

404
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,500
Ah, he was.

405
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,620
Thank you for making the time to come.

406
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,720
Pleased to meet you.

407
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,060
I’m Hong Sang Man.

408
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,900
Yah, I didn’t know that

409
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,820
our Professor Baek liked such beautiful women.

410
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Sunbae, my wife is here as well.

411
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,200
Ah, ah, ah!

412
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,240
Is this the first time since graduation?

413
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,920
Jung Hye.

414
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,280
Pleased to see you again.

415
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,200
You haven’t changed at all. Hm?

416
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,080
We meet like this again. Hm?

417
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,300
Are you guys having a battle
to see whose wife is more beautiful?

418
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,540
It’s a good thing that I came alone.

419
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,080
Don’t say anything else now.

420
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,880
Yeobo, just a minute.

421
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,620
There’s something on you.

422
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,620
There’s something there?

423
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,320
Is it from the restaurant earlier?

424
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,000
Why is this person being like this?

425
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,400
I’m sorry.

426
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,360
It’s late.

427
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,360
You need to go.

428
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,600
Korea and the education system

429
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,060
have both fallen into a vicious cycle of damaging each other.

430
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,180
Education has given rise to an academic elitism.

431
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
our society then intensifies that outlook,

432
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,900
which then makes for even more academic elitism.

433
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,220
In order to break this vicious cycle,

434
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,740
our education system requires
a fundamental paradigm change.

435
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,520
We need to create

436
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,800
an entirely new educational system.

437
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,680
In this book,

438
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,120
are all my dreams for the Korean educational system.

439
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,240
Having spent 20 years thus far in the education field,

440
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,760
now I would like to carry out
my convictions as its overseer.

441
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,020
So, I would like to take this opportunity

442
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,100
to announce my candidacy
for the Seoul Superintendent of Schools.

443
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,760
- Yes, please smile.
- Of course, of course.

444
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,660
Yes, thank you.

445
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,160
Shall we talk a little business?

446
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,420
- Sure.
-Yes, let's.

447
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,120
Please have something to eat.

448
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,700
Your husband hit you, didn’t he?

449
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,980
So, I’m right.

450
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,080
I don’t know what you are saying…?

451
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,340
Would you like to get revenge with me?

452
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,780
Excuse me?

453
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,140
Since I would also like
to get revenge on my husband.

454
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,040
I’m sorry.

455
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,300
I think you’re mistaken about something.

456
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,520
Take some time and then let’s meet again.

457
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,200
No.

458
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,840
I have no intention of doing that.

459
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,220
Shall I make the matter public then?

460
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,640
The domestic abuse case of Baek Young Pyo,

461
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,020
a candidate for the Seoul Superintendent of Schools.

462
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,440
Look here…

463
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,740
I can’t give you too much time.

464
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,940
I’ll be in touch.

465
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,040
Why in the world are you being like this?

466
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,940
If you don’t come,

467
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,860
I’ll immediately report it.

468
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,200
Welcome home.

469
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:40,820
Okay.

470
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,820
Sleep well.

471
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,360
It’s so hostile,
how can anyone live here?

472
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,660
Ow!

473
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,500
Yah!

474
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,860
You can see what’s happened to my son,
can’t you?

475
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,660
I’m really sorry.

476
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,380
I really don’t know how to apologize.

477
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,640
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.

478
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,980
I mean,

479
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,620
no matter how hard your life is

480
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,320
you should still raise your children properly, shouldn’t you?

481
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,880
Is he some kind of thug?

482
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,900
What in the world,
how can there be such violence at school?

483
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,420
So frightening.

484
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,440
I can understand

485
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,280
how startled and upset

486
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,980
Jung Wook’s mother must be.

487
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,700
You can understand?

488
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,720
Hah!

489
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,220
I don’t need any understanding from you.

490
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,280
Because his body has always been weak
since he was a child,

491
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,240
even as his mother,
I have never yelled at him.

492
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,460
Carefully, carefully,
as if he were a glass bowl,

493
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,180
that is how I raised my son.

494
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,920
How dare someone break my precious son’s bones?

495
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,900
Do you think that I’ll just stand still for this? Huh?

496
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,840
Before any of that,

497
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,700
why are you here by yourself
without your thug kid?

498
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,680
Kids like those need to be arrested immediately

499
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,600
so that they can rot in jail for the rest of their…

500
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,400
You’re really…

501
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,020
R-really what?

502
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,240
What?

503
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,440
I am sorry.

504
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,000
Student Jung Wook.

505
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,160
It’s all my fault.

506
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,060
It’s my fault

507
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,020
for not having taught him properly
as his mother.

508
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,280
For the sake of the child’s future,

509
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,240
just once,

510
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,400
just this one time,
can’t you be lenient with him?

511
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,640
Please, I’m begging you like this.

512
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,680
Ohhhhh…!

513
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,000
Oh.

514
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,760
I’m sorry.

515
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,400
It’s because my arm is so uncomfortable.

516
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,140
Stop, that’s enough.

517
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,140
So, lift up your head.

518
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,220
I...

519
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,860
have absolutely no thoughts of doing that.

520
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,400
None.

521
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,200
Never.

522
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,380
What?

523
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,040
Lenient?

524
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,820
You must be joking.

525
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,500
<i>[Buam-dong Coffee Social Club]</i>

526
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,300
I mean,

527
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,460
if you raised your son so poorly,
then you should take responsibility.

528
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,380
As the saying goes,
like mother, like child.

529
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,980
As if it wasn’t enough that he broke the arm of someone’s precious son,

530
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,540
you’re asking for leniency?!
What leniency?!

531
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,680
The reason

532
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,860
I came today…

533
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,940
You’re here early.

534
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:44,940
Son.

535
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:45,940
Let’s go.

536
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,180
We have to go file charges at the police station.

537
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,320
Jung Wook’s mother!

538
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,900
Jung Wook’s mother,
please show leniency to my son this once!

539
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,080
Jung Wook’s mother!

540
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,220
What are you doing?

541
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,240
Let go!

542
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,420
- Please, I’m begging you.
- What in the world. Really.

543
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,980
When there are people watching, so embarrassingly…

544
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,620
Will you not get your head on straight
unless I call the police here?

545
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,860
Joo Gil Yeon-sshi?

546
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:07,740
Oh!

547
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
Omo, Madam!

548
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,660
Omo, hello.

549
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,500
Jung Wook’s mother, please!

550
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,780
How is it that I see Madam here?

551
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,420
- We’re both mothers, so a settlement…
- Let go.

552
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,480
- Settlement!
- No! Are you really crazy?!

553
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,620
I’m begging you like this.

554
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,820
Please agree to a settlement!

555
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,780
Please!

556
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,700
Let go of me!
Let go! Let go!!

557
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,180
Oh, Madam, I didn’t mean…

558
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,800
I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.

559
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,320
Settlement…

560
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:35,980
Do it!

561
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,180
I said I’ll do it.

562
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,820
You will agree to a settlement?

563
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,740
Yes.

564
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,620
So, get away from me.

565
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,680
If you follow me, then I won’t do it.

566
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,520
What’s so entertaining?
Hurry and come along.

567
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,140
Oh, it’s so funny!

568
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,420
Are you okay?

569
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:07,800
Oh.

570
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,320
Thank you.

571
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,780
You must have been startled.

572
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,420
I’m so sorry.

573
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:18,480
Oh.

574
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,420
Ohh…

575
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,520
That’s right, isn’t it?

576
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,940
Ehy.

577
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,440
Still, now that

578
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,680
she’s agreed to a settlement,
I’m better off.

579
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:44,860
Oh, right, right!

580
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,320
How do you know that woman?

581
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,200
I noticed earlier that after she saw you,
her attitude completely changed.

582
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,940
She’s a tenant in my building.

583
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,920
Ahh…

584
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,580
After you were insulted like that,
are you okay?

585
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,780
Oh, this much, well…

586
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,460
when you run a business,
you have to deal with things like that all the time.

587
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,800
In those situations,

588
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,780
lowering yourself completely is the best policy.

589
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,440
Still, was there really a need
to kneel down though?

590
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,040
Oh.

591
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,120
Well, just because you kneel down once,
doesn’t mean that your knees get completely worn away.

592
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,300
Do you also have no self-respect?

593
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,060
Self-respect…

594
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,620
I do have it.

595
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,060
Kneeling.

596
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,180
So what if I have to kneel
a hundred times?

597
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,380
If something like this was going
to hurt my self-respect,

598
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,620
I wouldn’t even have been able
to live until now.

599
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,780
My self-respect

600
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,680
is protecting what is precious to me.

601
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,220
Ow!

602
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,240
Oh, truthfully,

603
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,120
I wanted to tie that kid and the woman next to him as a set

604
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,040
and totally beat down…

605
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,040
Would you like to get revenge?

606
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,520
What?

607
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,180
That’s why the two of us were meeting up.

608
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,440
No…

609
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,440
You should join us.

610
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,480
What…?

611
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,160
Revenge.

612
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,280
We work together

613
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,800
to get revenge on those
who have wronged each of us.

614
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,660
If I call it a labor exchange for revenge,

615
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,060
then you may understand it more quickly.

616
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,100
Revenge?

617
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,040
Labor exchange?

618
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,160
Please stop joking, Jung Hye.

619
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,320
Buam-dong Avengers Social Club.

620
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,020
What do you think?

621
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,600
I’m not sure what that means.

622
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,040
Do you think it will end here?

623
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,620
Your son will probably continue to be harassed at school.

624
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,200
And, you seem to be rather poor,

625
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,780
what will you do if they ask for a huge sum
as compensation for the settlement?

626
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:36,960
What?!

627
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,420
You are also being rude.

628
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,720
I’ll pay the compensation for the settlement,

629
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,400
since I have a lot of money.

630
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,720
So, join our club,

631
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,700
and get revenge…

632
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,660
Look here.

633
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,400
Since your stomach is full and you have nothing else to do,

634
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,380
you seem to want to flaunt your wealth.

635
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,020
Do you want to give me about $10 million?

636
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,960
Such a weird person…

637
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,480
Oh, what rotten luck.

638
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,180
What? I look poor?

639
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,940
And, what is that about a club?

640
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,400
She looks normal enough,

641
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,960
but, she’s really weird.

642
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,720
How can you speak like that?

643
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,460
Like what?

644
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,400
How can you say that she looks poor?

645
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,000
That’s how she really looked.

646
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,920
Still, how can you say that
to a person’s face?

647
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,920
And, on top of that,
the sudden talk of revenge?

648
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,200
I can’t do that?

649
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,620
Three is better than two.

650
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,760
And, what is the Buam-dong Avengers Social Club?

651
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,480
I just made it up right now.
It sounds good, doesn’t it?

652
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,840
No, I…

653
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,020
So, what I mean to say is…

654
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,560
Are you going to
continue to live that way?

655
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,400
What way?

656
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,120
Are you going to
continue living while being hit?

657
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,580
I saw it all.

658
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,180
If I report this to the media…

659
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,560
Then I’m also going
to tell your husband

660
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,360
that you said you wanted
to get revenge on him.

661
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,460
Oh!

662
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,800
You were here!

663
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,280
Ay.

664
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,540
If I had known that, I would have asked you
to help the child with his clothes.

665
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,700
You have a killer fashion sense after all.

666
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,300
Aish.

667
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,820
Omo, Madam!

668
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,520
You must be out shopping
with the General Manager.

669
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,920
Hello.

670
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:07,480
Omo.

671
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,060
This must be General Manager’s nephew.

672
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,780
He looks a lot like you.

673
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,340
He’s my son.

674
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,440
General Manager,
then please continue with your shopping.

675
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,200
See you next time.

676
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,800
Yes.

677
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,860
Ahh…

678
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,320
Aigoo.

679
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,480
Well, then I’ll go right over, President.

680
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:38,860
Yes.

681
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,700
We can have a drink and take our time discussing it.

682
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,100
Yes.

683
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,260
He already knew that.

684
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,060
Yes, see you in a little bit.

685
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:46,400
Yes.

686
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,420
Soo Gyum,
get a ride home with your mother.

687
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,180
While eating dinner together,
you two can have a chat as well.

688
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,040
What are you doing?
Hurry and get in.

689
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:00,900
Where are you going?

690
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,020
Yeobo!

691
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,880
Oh, really.

692
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,040
Why is she acting like that?

693
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,800
- Here, here. Give it to me.
- No way. I’m a man.

694
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,260
Oh really.

695
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,300
But, mom, just to celebrate a settlement, we bought way too much.

696
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,430
This isn’t that much.

697
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,430
Don’t you know I have a king’s hand?
(T/N king’s hand = very generous)

698
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,530
And, your sister is coming home for once in a long while, too.

699
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,060
It’s time for her to arrive.

700
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,160
Are you okay?

701
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,330
Oh. I’m fine.

702
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:31,560
Yah! Just let me catch you… you really… Yah! Aish…

703
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:33,930
Hee Kyung

704
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:34,660
Noona

705
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,630
Mom

706
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,060
What’s going on?

707
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,860
Some crazy assholes on a motorcycle came right at me.

708
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,900
What?!

709
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,260
I quickly avoided it.

710
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,260
So, I only fell a little.

711
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,860
What about elsewhere? Are you hurt anywhere else?

712
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,300
Oh, I’m fine. You know how athletic I am.

713
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,100
I just allowed myself to fall forward like this.

714
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,060
But, this got damaged.

715
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,460
Oh, what a shame!

716
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,930
Noona, did you see the faces of the kids on the motorcycle?

717
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,900
No, it happened too quickly.

718
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,060
Though I did hear their laughter, making me feel bad.

719
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,660
Those bastards! Just let me get my hands on them!

720
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,800
What is all this going on, and now even you?

721
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:12,660
What? Who else?

722
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,900
Why?

723
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,160
Nothing. Let’s just quickly go.

01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,530
This time, make sure that you’re completely resolved before you come.

904
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,600
On the decision that you will definitely get revenge.

905
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:01,430
I’ll do that.

906
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,230
No.

907
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,400
I’ve already done it.

908
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,060
The decision.

909
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,760
Good.

910
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:17,760
We’ll discuss the details when we meet in person.

911
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,000
One thing that need to be for certain.

912
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,400
Of course.

913
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,600
There won’t be any way that I’ll quit.

914
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,300
Okay.

915
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,800
Let’s do it properly then.

916
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,600
Revenge.

918
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,800
Then,

919
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,560
shall we get started?

921
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,400
Do you have some issue with the world?

922
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,730
It’s because you really feel like my unnie.

923
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,260
Let’s go, little sister.

924
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,260
What rotten luck.

925
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,400
Go ahead and sue.

926
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,500
Go ahead and sue.

927
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:22,830
Go ahead and sue!

Go. Okay.

Sook, cancel the coffee!

935
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,800
Because, madam, like me…

936
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,600
it seems as if you want revenge.
