2
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,340
Mister, this...

3
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,070
Yes.

4
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,070
EPISODE 2

5
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,450
One, two, three.

6
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,300
Okay. Let's properly do the revenge.

7
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,270
I'm back from school.

8
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,580
Ah... This... fell on the yard.
If you don't need it, will I throw it away?

9
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,130
The doll was broken.

10
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,720
Wow, she treats me like an invisible man.

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
[Buam-Dong Coffee Social Club]

12
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,940
Then...

13
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,140
shall we try starting?

14
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,260
Revenge? Right now? Immediately?

15
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,340
Self-introductions.

16
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,740
Since the Buam-Dong Revenge Social Club is having its first meeting,

17
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,710
the members should introduce themselves first.

18
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,700
Having said that, that Revenge Social name… that is really a mouthful.

19
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,210
Shortening it, Avengers Club.

20
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,080
Avengers Club?

21
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,910
Oh, that sounds okay.
It sounds a lot better.

22
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,310
Then starting with me.
I’m Kim Jung Hye. I'm 36.

23
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,680
I’m Lee Mi Sook.
I’m 42 years old.

24
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,360
My name is Hong Do Hee.

25
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,280
Sorry. I’m sorry.

26
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,940
I run a stall at the Buam Market.
Hong Do Fish.

27
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,700
So everyone calls me Hong Do, Hong Do,
but having to say my own name

28
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,540
for the first time in a long time,
it feels very awkward.

29
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,450
I feel that way, too.

30
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,050
And your age?

31
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:11,620
Different to how it may look, I seem to be the oldest.
I’m 45 in my prime.

32
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,300
However, you both look like
the world’s most refined.

33
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,580
to whom and what revenge are you saying that you are going to do?

34
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,590
You look as if you have never ever had to deal with an unfair situation.

35
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,870
Husbands.

36
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,340
Ah… Cheating. Violence.

37
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,700
How did you know?

38
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,600
Ay… of course, you can just tell.

39
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,250
Evil jerks. So who is “cheating” and
who is “violent”? Hm?

40
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,250
“Cheating”?

41
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,340
What in the world. You look as if
you would fly away if someone blows

42
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,980
on you too hard.
Where is there to hit you anyway?

43
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,540
However, the two of you,
when and how did you meet?

44
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,100
We met a few days ago
through our husbands.

45
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,450
What?! A few days ago?!
So, the two of you

46
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,450
don’t really know each other
that well either?

47
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,330
Excu… excuse me.
Your voice, please.

48
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,270
If we all have the same objective,
isn’t that enough?

49
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,270
It’s not as if it’s a family gathering
or anything.

50
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,380
That is true, I guess.

51
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,940
However, why you made such an offer to me,
I’m curious about that.

52
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,150
Rather than two,
isn’t three better?

53
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,900
Huh?

54
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,740
Since it looked as if you would want to get revenge on that woman.

55
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,890
Is that all?

56
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,410
Is something else necessary?

57
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,790
Well, that… that is…
it isn’t like that.

58
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,380
I guess if you say that this is fate,
then we have to look at it as fated.

59
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,970
You said the settlement amount
was 20 million won.

60
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,190
There is no way. She was just throwing out numbers to be mean. She’s evil really.

61
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,340
What is this?

62
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,730
The settlement money. Use this to at least settle that matter first…

63
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,620
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just one minute. What did you say?

64
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,450
Why are you being like this?

65
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,130
What do you mean “why”? You’re pushing such a large sum of money to a stranger…

66
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,320
It’s not a large sum of money to me.

67
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,280
And it’s not to a stranger. Now, we are all Avengers Club members

68
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,980
and we agreed to seek revenge together.

69
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,620
Okay, then.

70
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,220
Let’s be frank.

71
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:34,860
I did come here because I was furious,
but I don’t think I can trust the two of you yet.

72
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,070
To a person that you’ve met for the first time,

73
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,070
you say let’s get revenge together
and shove such a large sum of money.

74
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,360
Whether you’re not trying to scam me or
something is something I keep wondering.

75
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,940
I’m not a scam artist.

76
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,600
I… I am not.

77
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,390
Yes, you look that way.

78
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,470
What in the world is the problem?
You need money immediately after all.

79
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,570
Since I have it, I’m just saying
that I’ll give it to you is all.

80
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,250
Look here. Starting the other day,
you keep treating me like a beggar…

81
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,750
My husband has brought the child that he had
with another woman into our house.

82
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,920
Wh… what?

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,360
Come in!

84
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,180
Ah. Soo Gyum?

85
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,820
Nice to meet you.
I'm Lee Soo Gyum.

86
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

87
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,900
You resembled your father.
You're very tall.

88
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,820
I'm a high school senior of your fathers.

89
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,440
Ah. I've heard it from Father.

90
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,860
Soo Gyum, you just moved.
It must feel awkward in everything.

91
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,980
So Yeon, please teach him well.

92
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,550
Soo Gyum, think of her like a sister.
Be comfortable to her.

93
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,740
Because of the relationship
with your fathers,

94
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,600
I called you to introduce to each other.

95
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,300
Thank you.

96
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,300
You guys look good.

97
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,750
Hey. By the way...

98
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,180
Are you by chance...

99
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,260
This isn’t revenge.
This is a matter for a divorce.

100
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,740
That isn’t possible. That...

101
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,040
Why isn’t it possible?

102
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,150
It was a marriage to connect two families.

103
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,280
How great a family do you belong to
that you can’t even get a divorce.

104
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,910
HaeRan Construction.
And my family is GeoNa.

105
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,050
G..g…R…really that Geo…GeoNa?

106
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,380
There really is such a thing as
a chaebol daughter.

107
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,560
Oh, so at least when you suffer
something like that

108
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,340
from the husband you had trusted,
then you probably want to kill him.

109
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,410
Yes. However…

110
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,930
Why would you kill a person?

111
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,530
Huh?

112
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,380
Then, you will go to jail.

113
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,690
Yes, that’s right.

114
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,060
So why would you do something like that?

115
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,330
That’s right! I also don’t want
that kind of a revenge.

116
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,310
So something that doesn’t run foul of the law, so, that is… just a little bit,

117
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,980
without anyone knowing. Doing the same kinds of things that the bad guys do,

118
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,750
I don’t want to do that kind of revenge.

119
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,460
I agree.

120
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,810
I thought you said that this gathering
was to take revenge?

121
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,800
That’s right.

122
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,890
Then what revenge, and how are you
saying that you want to do it?

123
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,250
From now on, we have to
think about it.

124
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,860
<i>What is this? These people have no clue. Maybe I’m just getting involved with the wrong people…</i>

125
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,290
<i>Maybe I shouldn’t have said that I would do it. Maybe, even just now, I should quit…</i>

126
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,580
<i>These people, is it really okay to trust them?</i>

127
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,210
Yah! If you’re finished, then you should have just stayed away longer.

128
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,680
Why did you come back so early?

129
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,370
Because I wanted to see you.

130
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,760
Oh, you!

131
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,580
Oh, wait a minute.
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

132
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,730
Hey, you!

133
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,410
You’re the one who rolled down the stairs,
aren’t you?

134
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,160
Yes?

135
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,930
Yesterday. Didn’t you roll down the stairs?
It was you, right?

136
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,060
Yes, that’s right.

137
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,150
Are you okay now?

138
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,590
Yes. However, who are…?

139
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,810
That’s a relief.

140
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,250
- He’s the senior who called 119.
- Huh?

141
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,670
Sunbaenim!

142
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,860
Thank you.

143
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,400
If you’re grateful, then you can just
buy me some bread later.

144
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,200
Ow. Ow. Fishy smells!

145
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,960
Ow. Ow. Fishy smells!

146
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,410
Let’s go together!
I said let’s go together.

147
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,020
- Then walk faster.
- No.

148
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,600
- Oppa!
- What are you doing here.

149
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,210
Before the rain starts, I have to go to work.
So for today, just till here.

150
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,790
I also…

151
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,950
But this is the start.

152
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,440
- As for the bill, then I’ll…
- I’ll do it.

153
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,920
Just a minute. Wait. Wait.

154
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Today, let’s all pay individually for ourselves.

155
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
And for next time, we can start
a group fund or something.

156
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,820
Aigoo, you're babbling over nonsense.

157
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,820
Ah I don't know, just hang up!

158
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,220
One Americano is out.

159
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,150
What is it?

160
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,780
- Yeh?
- I'm already boiling with anger.

161
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,700
Do I look like drinking this hot thing?

162
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,670
Well, you ordered it.

163
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,720
What are you talking about?
I ordered Americano Ice!

164
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,570
No you didn't. You ordered...
- Hey!

165
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,050
Since a while ago, you made me wait and
went away for your own business.

166
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,390
Now, what are you saying?

167
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,220
What kind of store this is!

168
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,930
That was... I got an urgent call of nature.

169
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,630
- I am sorry.
-You said you're urgent?

170
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,860
How dare you don't know when customers come.

171
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,900
This jerk, you never pee?

172
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,900
So I put it on here and went.

173
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,370
So are you saying you did well?

174
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,210
You just put this piece on?

175
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,080
You're just a part-timer and you're
arguing with a customer?

176
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,090
I will report it to your boss and cut you out!

177
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,060
You wait.

178
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,060
You shove it down.

179
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,060
<i>Ah really.</i>

180
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,090
That bastard.

181
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,060
Don't stop me.

182
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,060
Are you okay?

183
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,060
Where is she?
Shall we call her?

184
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,010
Hey. Turn off the phone.
Turn it off.

185
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,540
What are you doing here?

186
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,760
Oh, I’m sorry.

187
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,620
<i>What’s this? What’s this?</i>

188
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,870
<i>Ouch! Ouch!</i>

189
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,260
Revenge? Whatever.

190
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,420
When you are such scaredy-cats,
what kind of revenge can we do?

191
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Well, she ran away with us.

192
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,420
Eh? What did you say?

193
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,980
That’s right.
Will we be able to do well?

194
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,100
Why?

195
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,960
It’s just that, with just an inconsequential opponent as that, we couldn’t do it properly.

196
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,160
We properly got back at him.

197
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,110
Oh, for the first one, it wasn’t
completely satisfying.

198
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,110
We’ll just leave that one as it is.

199
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,110
 It’s the ones going forward that’s important…

200
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,160
- Oh, right there in front. Please stop the car there.
- Okay.

201
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,290
It’s going forward that’s important…

202
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,060
It's fresh.

203
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,740
Distinguished figure.
Two silver hairtail from Jeju, $30.

204
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,250
Ajumma, your goods are always fresh.
I trust you and buy.

205
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,250
- Thank you. Have it deliciously and come again.
- Yes.

206
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,980
Thanks to the beauties sitting there,
it's selling well.

207
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,870
What were we talking about?

208
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,000
How about going to trial?
Wouldn't it be better?

209
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,420
Because it wasn't all my Hee Soo's fault?

210
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,710
I already thought about it.

211
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,380
By any chance, if the trial goes wrong,
what should I do?

212
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,020
Agreement is the best way indeed.

213
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,350
Since he is a minor, even if he loses,

214
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,320
won't it be just monetary penalty?

215
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,640
Even so, but the record is left anyway.

216
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,620
It may still harm his future.

217
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,140
You're right.

218
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,220
It's difficult.

219
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,390
Ah.

220
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,380
Lawyer Yim?

221
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,690
I have a favor to ask.

222
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,850
That sounds good.

223
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,500
Yes. Then I will call you again.

224
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,200
I called a lawyer.

225
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,160
That's great!

226
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,020
Oh, oh! Thank you!

227
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,750
Definitely you're in another level.

228
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,590
By the way, this...

229
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,550
Yes.

230
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,730
One more cup of this.

231
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,230
That's your third cup.

232
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,820
Why is it so delicious?

233
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,510
Aigoo, our Madam is charmed
by the taste of instant coffee.

234
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,530
I will buy.
How much is it?

235
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,890
Four cups please.
You two have one more cup.

236
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,820
Sook!

237
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,810
Give us one more cup of coffee.

238
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,430
- Unnie, just a moment. After I take group customers.
- Okay.

239
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,400
It's 50 cents.

240
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,760
Eh?

241
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,770
She is in another level.

242
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,430
Hello.

243
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,430
Okay.

244
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,530
We should have a family dinner before I leave.

245
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,820
I see.

246
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,000
I should go now.

247
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,080
Me too. It's time to prepare dinner.

248
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,550
Wait, wait a moment!

249
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,100
Don't give it to the guys you hate.

250
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,980
What's this?

251
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,020
It's not from Jeju.
It's hairtail from Mokpo.

252
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,820
But it tastes no less good.

253
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,500
Don't ask me to give you everyday
because it's so delicious.

254
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,550
How much is it?

255
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,170
$500.

256
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,850
Ahh! No! Aigoo...

257
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,850
Go! Go!

258
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,970
- I'll eat well.
- Yes.

259
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,760
Sook, cancel the coffee!

260
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,470
Excuse me, are you getting off?

261
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,380
I'm sorry.

262
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,230
What the hell?

263
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,460
Ah sorry.

264
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,420
Are you a pervert or what?

265
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,460
Hey, that was too harsh.

266
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,420
Why do you touch someone else's stuff?

267
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,620
No, it's not like that. Whenever I see you,
you're putting it into your ears.

268
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,000
So I was curious what songs
Seoul kids listen to.

269
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,650
We've met only few times.

270
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,180
Didn't you hear what the principal said?

271
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,060
He told us to be sociable to each other well.

272
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,220
I don't like to.

273
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,500
It may burst on your ears.

274
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,970
Are you dissatisfied with the world?

275
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,820
Why are you following me?

276
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,460
I'm on my way home.

277
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,900
So irritating.

278
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,580
Help yourself.

279
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,560
Ah yes.

280
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,300
Ah, that's Mother's seat.
Sit down here.

281
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,040
Ah!

282
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,770
I'm sorry.

283
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,980
Sorry!

284
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,710
Wow it's like a luxurious restaurant.

285
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,650
Eat a lot!

286
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,780
You too.

287
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,850
I'll eat well!

288
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,060
Ah, right.
When do you leave tomorrow?

289
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,450
At dawn.

290
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,400
I won't be able to see you before I leave.

291
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,330
I envy you going to a trip abroad.

292
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,310
I've never been on a plane, even once.

293
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,460
I'm not going to play, you punk.

294
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,600
Then father, are you managing
the foreign part of the business, too?

295
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,160
Yes. Your grandfather is sick.

296
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,830
Anyway, I will manage all.
I should keep checking it ahead.

297
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,780
He didn't announce who will inherit yet.

298
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,930
It's just a formal procedure.

299
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,240
Well, I should be responsible as an owner
and raise my specialty.

300
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,500
Madam, when did you buy this fresh hairtail?

301
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,460
Hairtail?

302
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,590
You've worked hard.

303
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,140
Yes, please eat it deliciously.

304
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,450
I love hairtail very much.

305
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,030
I'll eat it well.

306
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,900
It's so delicious.

307
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,010
While I’m away, you two try to get closer.

308
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,820
Yes, understood.

309
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,940
Then let's meet right there, Mr. Lawyer.

310
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,100
Yes.

311
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,990
Oh, geez, this woman.
She has no sense of timekeeping either.

312
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,460
Hee Soo’s mother?

313
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,040
Oh, here you are.

314
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,810
I seem to be a little late. Sorry.

315
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,710
What’s wrong? You look a little shocked.

316
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,710
W..what? No one is shocked.

317
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,260
So... when are you going to deposit it?

318
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
It’s better to finish this as soon as possible.

319
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,590
First, I want to re-determine the settlement amount.

320
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,590
$20,000 is too much.

321
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,490
After completely breaking the arm of
another’s beloved son,

322
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,840
is that something that you can say?

323
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,760
If one is a person, one should have a conscience
and a sense of shame.

324
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,940
How dare you try to negotiate?

325
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,940
I can’t reduce it by even one cent.

326
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,560
<i>I knew you would do this,
so I started with a high number.</i>

327
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
At first, you said $10,000.

328
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,740
That is already high, but do you think that
$20,000 makes any sense?

329
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,140
What? When did I?

330
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,890
You can’t even understand a person’s words correctly
and what are you trying to pull?

331
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,890
Look here. Perpetrators’ mother.

332
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,360
You don’t seem to understand the
situation here very well,

333
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
so shall we just go to the police student?

334
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,360
That Jung Wook student hurt his arm,
I feel badly about that.

335
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,290
And, having decided to settle, it’s only right
that I give you the settlement money.

336
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,760
However, we have to calculate it appropriately.

337
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:35,190
Right now. What is this attitude?
What could it be?

338
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,810
$10,000 is not reasonable.

339
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,740
She seems to be using her child
to make some money.

340
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,010
To a person like that, you have to take
a forceful line.

341
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,010
Even if you were sued,

342
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,840
you have the right to ask for a reconsideration
of a reasonable amount.

343
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,140
Really?

344
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,290
There is no way that the other side
doesn’t know that.

345
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,860
Using the threat of suing you, she’s calculatingly
trying to get a lot more settlement money from you.

346
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,440
Have you seen the broken arm?

347
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,340
You haven’t seen it, have you?

348
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,840
That could be a lie also, so ask her to show you
the diagnosis first. The diagnosis.

349
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,240
Oh, I didn’t think about that. Diagnosis.

350
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Diagnosis. Okay.
Please show me the diagnosis.

351
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,660
Make her look fashionable.

352
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,910
How much more?
This is already pretty fashionable.

353
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:25,060
The settlement money is the bill for the treatment,
school attendance, and consolation money.

354
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,890
No. It’s losses from missing school.

355
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:33,010
Losses from missing school.

356
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:38,890
The settlement money consists of the treatment bill,
losses from missing schools, and consolation.

357
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,940
You know that, right?

358
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Even if you doubled the number,
it wouldn’t be $10,000.

359
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,610
How much was the bill for the treatment?
And, will you show me the diagnosis?

360
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,090
<i>What is this?</i>

361
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,610
<i>Why is this witch suddenly being like this?</i>

362
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,090
Why do I have to show you a diagnosis?

363
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,290
It seems as if because of the money, you’ve become
unreasonable and trying to run roughshod,

364
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,260
but if you’re going to be like this, then settlement money
or whatever, there is a way to just make it as if it never happened.

365
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,890
Understand the situation that you’re in properly, perpetrator!

366
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,760
Sue me. Go ahead and sue me.

367
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,160
More strongly.

368
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,590
Go ahead and sue me.
More comfortably.

369
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,010
Go ahead and sue me.

370
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,510
More forcefully.

371
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,790
Go ahead and sue me!

372
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,240
I’ve finished understanding the situation.
Go ahead and do it.

373
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,440
What?

374
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,460
Suing.
Go ahead and do it.

375
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,560
Listen here.

376
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,810
It was your son’s unprovoked violent attack.

377
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,840
My son didn’t do anything.

378
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,090
Go ahead and allege that at court.

379
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,160
Allege? This is a fact! Fact!

380
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,560
That is for a judge to determine.

381
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,940
Yah!

382
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,640
The fact that your side by using defamatory remarks
actually caused the accident,

383
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,690
the fact you threatened me trying to get the unbelievable amount of $20,000
as settlement money, I’m going to reveal all of it in court.

384
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,160
And I’m going to countersue for mental distress.

385
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,510
Then either you’ll be punished,
or at least the settlement money will be reduced, don’t you think?

386
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,660
So either lower the settlement amount or sue me

387
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,310
and try getting into a dogfight with me!

388
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,290
<i>This fishy person. What is she
relying on to act this way?</i>

389
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,890
Give in. Please.
Please give in.

390
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,260
Because it was so pitiful that you are suffering
to sell fish in order to make a living,

391
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
I was thinking of lowering the settlement amount,

392
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,390
but your audacity is just piercing the sky!

393
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,440
It’s an act of rudeness,
disdaining any benefits!

394
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,440
If that is your wish, then I’ll do that.

395
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Go to trial!
Let’s go to trial then!

396
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,960
<i>Oh no, this isn’t what I wanted.</i>

397
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,490
Omo. Hello.
We meet again.

398
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,410
Omo. Madam. Hello.

399
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,960
Omo! Do Hee Unnie!

400
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,660
How is it that we meet again here?

401
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,040
Oh, yeah, Jung Hye.
It’s good to see you.

402
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,240
This fishy pers…  I mean… How is it…
Do you and this person know each other?

403
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,960
Yes, of course, we know each oth…
no, she’s a very close sister.

404
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,010
Ah.

405
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,190
Vice President Hwang is also doing well, isn’t he?

406
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,860
No. No, I mean yes, yes, yes.
He’s dong very well. Yes, yes, yes.

407
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,490
Thanks to the Managing Director,
we’re also doing very well.

408
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,490
Thank you so much for asking after him.

409
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:36,040
Oh, by the way, you said that you had been having
some difficulty these days, didn’t you?

410
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,060
Huh? Oh. Yes.
That’s right.

411
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,060
Tell me later what the problem is.

412
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,060
I’ll do everything I can to help you.

413
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,390
Between us, there isn’t anything we can’t talk about.
Isn’t that right?

414
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,160
That’s right. I’ll do that.
Jung Hye.

415
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,710
Oh, how do the two of you know each other…?

416
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,340
Oh, that is…

417
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,340
That is… our children… friends.

418
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,160
They’re school friends. So we’ve just been having a
parents of students meeting right now.

419
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,310
That’s right, isn’t it, Hee Soo’s mother?

420
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:09,310
After you’re done talking, come and see me
before you go, sister. Okay?

421
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,240
Then...

422
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,990
<i>We were too obvious. Has she caught on
that we had planned this?</i>

423
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,910
<i>What is this? How can this person…
with the Madam…</i>

424
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,760
Oh. You’ve dribbled a little.

425
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,340
That’s fine.

426
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,840
Then, shall we finish our talk?

427
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,990
If you insist on suing like that…

428
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,710
When did I…?!

429
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,060
You can’t just misunderstand a person’s intentions like that.

430
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,360
Accept a drink!
Accept a drink.

431
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,060
Oh, that woman’s face…
it was really a shame that only I saw it.

432
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,060
I also saw it.

433
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,390
Now, you just need to have the lawyer
submit the settlement, right?

434
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,960
Yes. Then it’s really over. Over.
Over. Over. Over.

435
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,190
However, the settlement amount…

436
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,890
Oh that amount. I’m also a woman who has
at least $5,000.

437
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,890
Here. Cheers!

438
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,110
Cheers!

439
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,010
Oh, however, Vice President Hwang?
Who is that?

440
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,360
That woman’s husband.
The Managing Director is my husband.

441
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,140
Ahh. So in that case, the wives are
in a pecking order of their own also.

442
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,890
Oh wow, this is really a couple who are
identical in power.

443
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,890
Then, in that case,
shall we properly celebrate?

444
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,970
However, this place is…

445
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,970
Where shall we go? To a place that’s really nice.

446
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,380
Selton? Charriot?  (Expensive hotels)

447
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,380
- What are those?
- Hotels.

448
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,610
- I’ll make reservations.
- Oh wait! Wait a moment.

449
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,720
I know a totally fantastic place.

450
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,500
Oh, what in the world!

451
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:44,990
Oh… careful, careful. Aigoo. Our Madam.
What is so fascinating now?

452
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,840
<i>-Don’t. No.
-I told you it was her.</i>

453
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,210
Hee Soo’s mother. Is today a special day?

454
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,100
What kind of a day is it that you’re dressed up so much?

455
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,340
It’s a good day.
I went to someplace nice.

456
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,880
Who is that?

457
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
She’s an important person who has come.

458
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,220
<i>Leave quickly. Go!</i>

459
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,540
Ay, venomous women. How did they even
notice we were here.

460
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,640
Here. Please come in.

461
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,200
Jung Hye, let’s go in.

462
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,140
Hurry and come on in.
Here. Here.

463
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,100
Jung Hye.

464
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,940
<i>She’s fascinated with something.
Fascinated.</i>

465
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,400
What do you think?

466
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,400
It’s more fun than a hotel room, isn’t it?

467
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,320
Today, I’ll serve our noble ladies a feast
to stuff yourselves. Come on in.

468
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,440
Oh, that’s spicy.

469
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
That. That.

470
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,640
Oh, okay.

471
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,460
Why?
Does it look strange?

472
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,460
It’s pretty.

473
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:01,520
Since Madam is wearing it, even a pair of cheap
$5 trousers totally look stylish.

474
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,660
Does it?

475
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,300
Here. Let’s start a party now!

476
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,300
Oh, in the refrigerator, there is some alcohol.
Please get it.

477
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,220
Okay.

478
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,560
<i>Madam! What are you doing?</i>

479
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,560
<i>Please give us some alcohol here.
Some alcohol!</i>

480
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,400
Let’s eat today and die!

481
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,120
No. Let’s take revenge!

482
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,820
Accept this.

483
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,560
Avengers Club, fighting!

484
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,820
Fighting!

485
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,800
Oh right. I have to mix in the soju.
Yah, let’s mix in the soju.

486
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Have you ever had this? So-maek? So-maek?
**(So-mek is soju and maekju, which is the Korean word for beer.)

487
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,880
No, I haven’t.

488
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,460
You haven’t?
What in the world?

489
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,090
You've worked hard.

490
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,470
- Hello Sunbae!
- Ah, you startled me.

491
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,700
- The stairs?
- Yes, right.

492
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,680
What's up?

493
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,520
To buy you bread.

494
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,700
Hey I was just joking.

495
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,720
No. I really want to buy bread for you.

496
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,140
- But how did you know my class?
- At the cafeteria.

497
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,800
I saw your name tag.

498
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,420
Wow, you have a good memory.

499
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,460
Good.

500
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,530
I like red bean bread.

501
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,530
Seoul red bean bread.

502
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,690
- Me, I like pizza bread.
- Really?

503
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,470
Yes.

504
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,630
One pizza bread, one red bean bread.

505
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,940
Thank you.

506
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,800
- Eat it deliciously.
- Yes.

507
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,630
Aigoo.. Hey, now the fishy smell is doing the bread-shuttle?

508
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,460
Hey, you punk just shut up and go.

509
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,700
He's a senior...

510
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,420
So what? what?

511
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,810
Anyway go.

512
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,020
What are those guys?

513
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,080
Nothing. Don't pay attention.

514
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,070
Please eat it.

515
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,460
- I will eat well.
- Yes.

516
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,750
It's my first Seoul red bean bread.

517
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,490
I transferred.

518
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,280
Ah, that's why!

519
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
For me, speaking with a Seoul accent is harder
than speaking in English.

520
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,060
You look cool, speaking in dialect.

521
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,300
- I'll teach you?
- Eh?

522
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,320
Do you want me to teach you how to
speak in dialect?

523
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,680
Ah, Hahaha!

524
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,660
You moved to Seoul?

525
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,020
Well. Something like that.

526
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,050
Where do you live?
I live in Buam 1 Dong.

527
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,990
I live in Buam 3 Dong.

528
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,520
That's the rich's area.

529
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,780
But I'm not rich.

530
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,170
- Sunbae, you're…
- What sunbae?

531
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,570
Just call me hyung.

532
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,750
Yes.

533
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,700
Hyung, what else do you like besides bread?

534
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,130
I like…

535
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,090
Seafood ramen which my grandma used to cook…

536
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,440
I grabbed a hairtail in each hand
and turned them around like nunchucks.

537
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,450
'Hey do you want to be beaten by the silver hairtail today?'

538
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,760
Then I ran to them, but they just ran away,
never turning around.

539
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,120
Unnie.

540
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,570
Can I call you unnie?

541
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,710
I'm not an oppa, right?

542
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,920
Why do you ask such a thing?

543
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,410
Then, I will, too.

544
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,890
Unnie.

545
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,900
Hong Do Unnie.

546
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,420
Mi Sook Unnie.

547
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,610
Why are you like this?
Like you've never called unnie before.

548
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,240
It's my first time.

549
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,310
Jung Hye, you have sisters, right?

550
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,670
I do.

551
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,830
I do have, but...

552
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,300
Unnie, you're a brave person.

553
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,400
Ayooo.

554
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,820
Why, why wouldn't I be scared inside?

555
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,960
When that woman said she would sue...

556
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,810
How much was I scared deep inside.

557
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,380
It's good that it's settled down well, but...

558
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,480
My feeling is...

559
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,890
She was so harsh to me.

560
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,640
But completely changed her attitude
when it came to Jung Hye.

561
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,740
There are too many people like that.

562
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,190
Right.

563
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,460
I thought...

564
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,860
If I live my own life without doing any shameful thing,

565
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,990
I would never have to beg others for anything.
That’s been my belief.

566
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,400
But in the end, it’s a matter of money.

567
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,140
You did it because of your child.

568
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,280
Anyone can be a parent.

569
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,420
But not all people can be good parents.

570
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,850
Anyone...

571
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,680
Unnie, you're a good mother.

572
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,080
Eh that’s…

573
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,580
Am I?

574
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,190
Hey, by the way, how are you with that kid?

575
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,760
Who?

576
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,800
Ah... that kid?

577
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,640
I don't know.

578
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,790
It must be hard, but it must be hard for the little kid, too.

579
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,660
He isn't a little kid.

580
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,740
Nine... teen... years old

581
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,680
Nineteen? Nineteen?
Not nine, but 19?

582
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,420
High school!

583
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,740
- Yep, high school senior.
- Oh, my word.

584
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:16,620
Your kids must have been so surprised.
A big guy suddenly came.

585
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,840
No. She has no kids.

586
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,140
It's sunset already.

587
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,810
I will go ahead.

588
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,620
You will?

589
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,800
Ayooo. Aigoo, Aigoo.

590
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,550
I’ll send her home after she wakes up.

591
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,500
Lay down here for a while,
I'll come back soon.

592
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,080
So Jung Hye had a backstory like that.

593
00:42:52,920 --> 00:43:00,040
However, if we’re going to do revenge or whatever,
then we should know something about each other.

594
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,020
Yes, we should.

595
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,760
That is kind of like that.

596
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,800
However, for me to drink alcohol like this and laugh
so loudly, it’s been a really long time.

597
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,000
However, regarding another couple’s relationship,
saying this is a bit like that...

598
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,340
but you’re really not going to get a divorce?

599
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,700
Yes.

600
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
You’re getting injured.

601
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,060
He doesn’t do it frequently.

602
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,680
Occasionally, just really only occasionally,
when he’s had a lot to drink.

603
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,780
When he’s not like that,
he’s usually a good person.

604
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,700
Aigoo, you frustrating person.

605
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:53,140
It’s not that if only you take that thing out, he’s a good person.
It’s because of that one thing that he’s a bad person.

606
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,020
Being drunk and raising his hands,
he definitely won’t be able to fix it.

607
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,640
What makes you so happy that you smile?

608
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,270
Because you seem to really be like a sister to me.

609
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,680
Let’s go, little sister!

610
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,050
Water, water.

611
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:52,730
Ouch!

612
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,000
Ouch!

613
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,620
Oh, I’m hungry.

614
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,740
If you eat the ramen I make for you,
you’ll go into shock over it. It's here.

615
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,020
Oooh.

616
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,980
- Soy bean sprouts!
- Soy bean sprouts?

617
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,276
It’s okay if it doesn’t have any.

618
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:59,880
A seafood broth without soy bean sprouts is just wrong.

619
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,052
Hyung, you go in first.

620
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:03,530
It’s right in front of my house there, so I’ll be right back.

621
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,540
Yah! I said it wasn’t necessary!

622
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:14,740
For just a minute, I’ll be rude.

623
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,740
Unnie!

624
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,690
Hyung Do Unnie!

625
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,940
Unnie, some toilet paper!

626
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:05,000
My unnie… suffers so much… that her hands seem
like a man’s hands.

627
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,870
Unnie.

628
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,940
Hmm?

629
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,340
We will make sure to get revenge.

630
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,470
All the bad people, let’s kill them all!
Lee Byung Soo -- evil bastard.

631
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,000
Avengers Club fighting!

632
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,670
Mmm. Fighting!

633
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,740
I’ll finish and be out soon.

634
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,940
What are you doing that
you’re not going in yet?

635
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,340
Uh… Ah, I have something that I have to do right now,
so I’ll eat it next time. Sorry.

636
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,340
Hyung!

637
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,840
Who are you?

638
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,790
- Who are you?
- You, who are you?

639
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:40,890
Are you a thief? This house… has no money.

640
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:45,940
They’re poor. They’re so poor…

641
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,690
- I’m not a thief.
- I’m the son of this household.

642
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,690
Mom!

643
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,090
Did my mother go somewhere?

644
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:04,440
- Hm? Mom? Ahhhh.
- You’re Hee Soo?

645
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,890
- Yes, I’m Hee Soo.
- You’re mom’s friend, aren’t you?

646
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:13,740
I am her little sister. I’m her little sister.

647
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,540
And Hong Do Hee Unnie is my sister.

648
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:22,740
Yes. Hello. However, what about my mom?

649
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,390
I don’t know.

650
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:28,640
She said she was coming right back.

651
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,290
So I was so thirsty that I drank some water.

652
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:38,990
However, this is too bitter.

653
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:43,940
Sister…

654
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:51,990
Come sit here for a moment.

655
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:04,990
You must be so happy.

656
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,240
What?

657
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
Hong Do Hee Unnie is your mother.

658
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,840
You must be so happy. So happy.

659
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,940
Yes, I’m happy.

660
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:19,040
I’ll clean up the empty bottles.

661
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:26,340
Yah! Give her to me. Give her to me.
I’ll give you money. Okay?

662
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,890
What?

663
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,440
My purse.

664
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:37,590
I have a LOT of money.
How much?

665
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:41,390
How much is enough for Hong Do Hee Unnie?

666
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,540
I only have $2,000.
Card! Card!

667
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,790
Ouch. Ouch.
That hurts. That hurts!

668
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,390
Sell her!

669
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:54,490
I’m not selling her.
I’m not selling her.

670
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:57,590
You’re bad. You’re so bad!

671
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:01,940
If I sold mom, than I would be
a really bad guy.

672
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:09,290
No. You’re not bad.
You’re nice.

673
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:15,190
The bad ones are other bastards.

674
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:18,790
You don’t know that, do you?

675
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,790
Know what?

676
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:23,440
The bad guys, we…

677
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,540
We and Hong Do Hee Unnie are going to punish them.

678
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,390
Yes?

679
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,290
We’re going to take revenge…

680
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,290
What does that mean?

681
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,640
No, no. Ajumma you can’t do that here.
To the bathroom.

682
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,140
The bathroom. Bathroom. Bathroom.

683
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,580
Let me go. I want to look for Hong Do Unnie.

684
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,000
I can’t let you go. It will be dangerous
if you come outside with this condition.

685
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,100
What are you doing?

686
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,460
Mom.

687
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,460
Unnie...

688
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,600
Who is this ajumma? She is so weird.

689
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:19,600
You are the one who is even weirder.
Unnie, where have you gone?

690
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,540
Her drunken state is so cute.

691
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,800
She isn’t cute at all.

692
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,170
Why? Why?

693
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,840
Honey.

694
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,740
You're here?

695
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,410
Honey.

696
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,480
- I thought you would be late. Why didn't you call me?
 - Eh, it's nothing.

697
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,120
I cleaned the bathroom after a long time.
I feel refreshed.

698
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:02,900
Yes. Thank you.

699
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,720
- I'll make dinner quickly.
- You don't have to.

700
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,490
Did you drink?

701
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,960
Y-yes. A li-little.

702
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,680
Did you drink?

703
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,300
Y-yes. A li-little.

704
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,010
This fish is good.

705
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,440
Yes. It's delicious.

706
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,060
You drank so you have no appetite.

707
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,340
N-no.

708
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,530
[Dohee Unnie: Misook, are you home?
 I think I should let Jung Hye sleep here.]

709
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:11,980
Who is it?

710
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,760
An unnie I know.

711
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,000
You have that kind of person?

712
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,210
A mother from Seo Yeon’s school.

713
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,220
Don't needlessly get close with weird people.

714
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:27,020
It's the beginning of election season.
Be careful of your behavior.

715
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,560
Of course, yes.

716
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,180
Jung Hye. Are you okay with
not going home?

717
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:49,480
I'm ok.

718
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,960
There’s nobody at home.

719
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,580
Lee Byung Soo went on a business trip.

720
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,420
Lee Byung Soo?

721
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,470
Husband.

722
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,580
Ah... there's one.

723
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,050
That kid is there. That kid.

724
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,140
Hmmm, what was his name?

725
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,400
Anyway, there’s that kid.

726
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,380
Who is uselessly handsome.

727
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,520
I don't want to go home.

728
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,300
- Jung Hye, by the way…
- Ah, I don't know. I won't go.

729
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:27,220
I'll be here. Don't tell me to go.

730
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,940
Yes, okay.

731
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:33,140
I'm not telling you to go,
but wash up first before sleeping, huh?

732
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,450
If you don't, it will be harder tomorrow morning.

733
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,050
I don't want to. It’s bothersome.

734
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,870
Yes. You look so...

735
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:43,480
Then, I will go, clean up, and come back.
Get on the bed and sleep.

736
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,660
Okay? Understand?

737
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,140
Up on the bed.

738
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,280
Yes.

739
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,450
I've segregated the garbage.

740
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,380
Aigoo. Thank you, my son.

741
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,350
- Mom.
- Um?

742
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,300
Today, I met the hyung who called 119 for me.

743
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,170
He said he called immediately when he saw me fall.

744
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,830
Aigoo, oh my, thank goodness!

745
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:25,100
So thankful.

746
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,620
- We should pay him back.
- Yes.

747
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,430
So we came home together.

748
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,030
He’s a sunbae in his senior year.
He’s tall and handsome.

749
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,870
His name is... Lee Soo Gyum.

750
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,810
Lee Soo Gyum?

751
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,550
Then where is he?

752
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,440
- He was gone when I returned.
- Soo Gyum.

753
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,470
- It would be nice if I could see his face.
- His name was Lee Soo Gyum.

754
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,140
Lee Soo Gyum was his name.

755
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,840
Aish!

756
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:16,440
Hello.

757
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,050
- Are you doing well?
- Yes, Father.

758
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:20,540
Did you arrive already?

759
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,640
Yes. Don’t you feel uncomfortable staying with her?

760
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,900
No. Not at all. I'm alright.

761
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:26,980
That's a relief.

762
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,240
- Hey, but what's that sound?
- Ah.

763
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,770
I felt hot, so I came out for a walk.

764
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,440
There are too many cars here.

765
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,510
Ahhh, alright.

766
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,390
Then, take care!

767
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,410
Yes, I will.

768
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,400
Good morning!

769
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,240
Are you feeling okay?

770
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,240
I brought you some honey water..

771
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,160
Who are you?

772
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,760
I’m the son of this house. I’m not a thief.

773
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,060
Thank you. Where is Hong Do Unnie?

774
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:59,880
She has to go early to buy fish and she asked me
to give you honey water and prepare breakfast for you.

775
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,300
She asked you to call her once you woke up.

776
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:04,860
Okay.

777
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,590
Would you like to eat some hangover soup ramen?

778
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,850
Ramen?

779
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,360
I cook a really delicious one.

780
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,290
I put soy bean sprouts and a lot of seafood,
so it’s really refreshing.

781
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,510
Everyone seems to like it.

782
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,670
When mother’s friends drink here at the house,

783
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,820
my responsibility is to make hangover soup ramen.

784
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:26,910
I’ll wash and come out.

785
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:27,420
Yes.

786
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:35,890
Why are you laughing?

787
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:40,850
Uhh…well, it’s just that now you’ve awoken from the alcohol,
you seem like a completely different person.

788
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,620
I’ve left out a new toothbrush and a towel.

789
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,540
Oh, you startled me!

790
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,050
Oh, you can’t!

791
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:45,560
When it’s slightly undercooked, you have to leave the top on and
let it sit for 30 seconds so that the noodles will be chewier.

792
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:52,220
However, a lot of steam will be coming out.
Taking it off…

793
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:52,940
No.

794
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,940
Okay. Here.

795
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:06,490
<i>Hong Do Hee Unnie must be so happy.</i>

796
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,820
Here, it’s done.

797
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,760
Now, you just have to eat it.

798
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:32,960
How is it?

799
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,050
It’s delicious.

800
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:38,560
It is, isn’t it?!

801
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,420
I told you that I’m confident in my ramen-making.

802
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,250
Aren’t you eating?

803
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,710
Oh, I ate rice earlier.

804
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:55,360
Please eat comfortably.
I’ll go to my room.

805
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,160
If the portion is not enough, just let me know.
I’ll give you some cold rice.

806
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,160
Cold rice?! Why?

807
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,000
You don’t like me?

808
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,020
Huh?

809
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:29,600
Hand.

810
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:30,960
Yes.

811
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,800
Spending money.

812
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,850
Oh, you don’t have to do this.

813
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:39,020
The ramen was delicious.
Let’s see each other again next time.

814
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,380
Go safely.

815
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,710
Go Safely.

816
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,940
What?
What is this?

817
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,340
Ai, this is driving me crazy! Really!

818
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,630
Totally, he is a rich person.

819
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,790
Son!

820
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:32,440
If you appear so suddenly, what am I supposed to do?

821
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:35,980
Oh, my son. Your face looks so much better.

822
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,370
It must be okay living here.

823
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:42,010
- Oh, you’ve almost completely become a Seoul person.
- Coming here, isn’t that a little wrong of you?

824
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:48,780
No. I mean, it’s the house that my son is living in…
’m curious about what it’s like.

825
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,660
If you want to get something out of it,
it would be better if you stayed quiet.

826
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,710
Oh, you shrewd one!

827
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:55,430
Ah!

828
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,280
Thanks to someone, you’re living the good life.

829
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,580
The wife here doesn’t harass you?

830
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:07,290
Well. Hardly.

831
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:09,590
Is it really magnificent? How is it?

832
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,680
- At least, let’s go over there.
- Why? Why? Why?

833
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,300
- Yah, however… the house is really..
- Oh, come on already.

834
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,300
How far are we going?

835
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:37,960
- Ow. Ow.
- You..

836
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,680
<i>You…</i>
- Ow. Ow.
- You..

837
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,110
<i>You…</i>

838
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,220
<i>Why?</i>

839
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:48,560
Ajumma!

840
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,450
Ajumma!

841
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,980
Have you arrived?

842
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,980
Ajumma’s husband hurt himself,
so she’s going to be late today.

843
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:10,710
She said she wasn’t able to contact Madam,
so I told her that I would tell you on her behalf.

844
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:12,270
Would you like to have lunch together?

845
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:15,200
I can actually cook pretty well.

846
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,250
If that’s uncomfortable for you,
then you don’t have to.

847
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,650
I’ll try not to come downstairs.

848
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:24,650
Please rest now.

849
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,180
Ramen.

850
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,800
I want to eat ramen.

851
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:04,470
You must like ramen.

852
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:06,140
It’s the first time.

853
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,070
Huh?

854
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:10,270
This morning was the first time I ate ramen.
And now is the second time.

855
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:16,310
Oh. You’re the first person I’ve met who has said
it’s the first time she had ramen.

856
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:22,110
Oh, of course that can happen.

857
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:25,290
However, the first ramen must have appealed to your palate.

858
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:26,820
Yes, it was delicious.

859
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:28,820
And this one?

860
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:29,670
It’s delicious.

861
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,140
More than the first one?

862
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,220
No.

863
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,420
You dislike me, don’t you?

864
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:44,740
Of course, you must.

865
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,090
I’m the child of your husband
with another woman after all.

866
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,740
If you didn’t dislike me, it would be abnormal.

867
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,960
I don’t like that you’ve come into this house.

868
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,000
However, that doesn’t mean that I dislike you.

869
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,710
Why is that?

870
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:02,140
Since you have done nothing wrong.

871
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:05,140
And I don’t know what kind of person you are even.

872
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:10,980
Hey, still, if it were me, I think
I would have just hated the sight of you.

873
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,940
To Madam, isn’t my entire existence a problem for you?

874
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,960
This is an issue for adults.
One that doesn’t involve you.

875
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,160
No. This is also my issue.

876
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,650
Do you not want to make a deal with me?

877
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,250
A deal?

878
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:37,450
Yes. I want to make a deal with Madam.

879
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,380
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

880
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,710
Do you know why I’ve come into this house?

881
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:44,780
Revenge.

882
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,380
I want to take revenge.

883
01:09:55,380 --> 01:10:00,380
