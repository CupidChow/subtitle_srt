"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club"

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Episode 7

3
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,140
Y-yeobo, you’re awake?

4
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,090
Yes, I came to get the medicine that Director Lee gave me.

5
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,290
Yes. As it is, we had totally forgotten about this earlier, so…

6
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,290
Let’s go in. Yes.

7
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,890
What is that?

8
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,740
You… have a foolish side to you.

9
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,140
These days, I keep having moments of forgetfulness.

10
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,140
Are you going through menopause?

11
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,240
Why is this like this?

12
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,240
It was already there.

13
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,890
Let’s go in now.

14
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,240
Was it?

15
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,990
So, everything we did last night was pointless, wasn’t it?

16
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,040
We even recorded everything, but there was nothing to get.

17
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,040
Just a lot of supporting that wasn’t any fun.

18
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,840
I think that illegal methods definitely don’t suit us at all.

19
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,490
Trying to get revenge nicely on bad guys just may be a Mission Impossible.

20
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,490
What’s this?

21
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,690
-Did he hit you again?
-Ay… ay…

22
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,140
When? Yesterday?

23
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,940
Ay… it’s just that he grabbed my wrist…

24
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,490
Aish. Do you still want to make excuses for that person?

25
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,390
Now, we can’t tolerate it any longer.

26
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,470
Rather than a big revenge, I think this is more urgent.

27
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,400
Aooo. Aooo. My insides are going to burst. I should have seriously just broken his wrist before.

28
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,000
Ay, that isn’t a method for our Avengers Club…

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,240
Yah! If that person takes the health tonic and becomes stronger, and he hits you again…

30
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,440
That’s it. That’s it. That… Come here. Come here.

31
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,140
Oh! Oh, they’re totally crazy.

32
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,740
Oh. That’s right. Totally.

33
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,740
Usually, I’m satisfied with even little things,

34
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:30,140
and I spend time comfortably with family and acquaintances.

35
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,640
However, occasionally, there are times when a face that even I don’t recognize comes out.

36
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,740
No one is trustworthy…

37
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,940
and it feels as if everyone in the world is looking down on me, so that I get overcome with anger!

38
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,900
Then! I just can’t control it by myself.

39
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,500
Of course, it’s hard on you, but it must also be very hard on your family.

40
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,870
How do you, her guardians, see it?

41
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,570
She just runs into cars, and throws water at strangers.

42
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,800
Ah! And she curses very well.

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,570
The thing is that when alcohol is involved, things get a lot worse.

44
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,970
She just throws things…

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,770
and, she even hits people.

46
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,540
That’s right.

47
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,900
It’s this h-hand, that’s the problem.

48
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,740
And, I can’t even break off this wrist!

49
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,070
Passages and blockages. The blockages must be made passages.

50
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,370
If the blockages are cleared, then the pain will go away.

51
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,300
If it’s blocked, however, so that it can’t go through, then the problem will appear.

52
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,500
To put it simply, it’s an anger disease. Eh?

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,740
If it’s blocked, it has to be pierced and cleared out.

54
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
I’ll make up medicine for 15 days, so take it and see what happens.

55
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,970
However, if it’s taken by someone whose body won’t accept it,

56
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,970
will there be any issues?

57
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,870
That is, could taking this cause any health problems with the body or anything?

58
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,970
Don’t worry about health.

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,970
Then, since you’re making it anyway, could you put something in it so that alcohol doesn’t seem desirable?

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
It’s all in here.

61
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,670
Since it contains medicine to purify the body, alcohol and meat will become unappealing for the time being.

62
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,040
This is the specialty of my practice.

63
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,270
So, when the health tonic that we ordered today arrives…

64
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,070
Change it with the ones that Lee Byung Soo had given him.

65
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,100
That’s right. That’s right.

66
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Morning and night, make sure to feed them to him diligently.

67
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,540
You’re good at that kind of thing.

68
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,000
The effect will be definite, won’t it?

69
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,370
I don’t know how effective that medicine will be, but we need to try it.

70
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,670
We can’t just beat him in the same way.

71
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,270
And, we can’t make it so that he can’t use his hand at all!

72
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,440
If it’s a method like this, then I think I can do this any time.

73
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,740
Okay. Okay. Let’s try to make him into a person.

74
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,670
Before Seo Jin left, he really wasn’t like that.

75
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,070
Eh-hey, I told you that you can’t fix a person, but…

76
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,070
Okay. Let’s at least try it once.

77
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,240
Since Mi Sook says that she’ll keep him until the end.

78
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,900
Morning and night, diligently.

79
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,500
Morning and night, diligently.

80
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,800
We have to keep doing the campaign support project as well.

81
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
So that they don’t become suspicious.

82
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,970
<i>The rebirth project, is it going well?</i>

83
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,370
<i>Then the medicine that you swapped out, you eat it.</i>

84
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,870
Yeobo, the health tonic that Director Lee had given you.

85
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,170
Oh yes, there’s that, isn’t there?

86
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,640
I had forgotten also,

87
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,170
but now I’ll make sure you get them morning and night without fail.

88
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,400
Now, you finally seem like yourself. Mmm. Mmm.

89
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,900
Water

90
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,170
I slept well, but my body is just settling down.

91
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,600
Already?

92
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,640
Yes?

93
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,970
No.

94
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,070
No. I mean that there is no way it could have an effect already.

95
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,270
If you eat the health tonic diligently, then your condition will improve.

96
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,900
If you’re going to campaign, you should eat well and be strong.

97
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,300
What’s wrong?

98
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,000
Does it not taste good?

99
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,570
No.

100
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,700
Don’t you have any marinated fern?

101
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,270
Thank you. Thank you.

102
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,700
I had run out of money and run out of courage as well.

103
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Definitely, there is no one like Baek Seo.

104
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
You. Cold one.

105
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,870
Sunbae, hello.

106
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,870
Why do you break into the queue?

107
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,570
I’m saying that you should drink a cold one and settle your insides.

108
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,970
And, stop worrying your mother.

109
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,000
What business is it of yours?

110
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,700
You should get rid of that hand.

111
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,740
Can’t you see Baek Seo’s expression?

112
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,740
Do you dislike it?

113
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,540
She says that she doesn’t dislike it.

114
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,840
As for you, it’s best that you don’t open your mouth.

115
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,600
Yah. He attacked you by the fact.

116
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Ay.

117
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,440
Don’t. Don’t.

118
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,540
What? Daebak!

119
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,240
Did sunbae just pay for your drink then go?

120
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,840
Isn’t he interested in you perhaps?

121
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,170
What is this now?

122
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,900
Are you dating? With that country jerk?

123
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,000
What? What? Aish. I’m always the last…

124
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,570
Huh?

125
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,340
What’s going on? At this hour?

126
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,700
There is some place we have to go together.

127
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,170
With me?

128
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,270
A couples gathering.

129
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,470
<i>Plan B is necessary.</i>

130
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,600
Ahhh.

131
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,870
What is this? You said it’s a couples gathering.

132
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,100
They’re coming now.

133
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,100
-Oh.
-Yes.

134
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,500
Oh, sunbae!

135
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Director Lee, how are you here?

136
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,970
This is the yoga studio that I attend with your wife.

137
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,770
They say that couple yoga is so great.

138
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,970
Mr. Candidate, you’re so busy campaigning that I thought you might be tired.

139
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,970
So, I reserved this session for us.

140
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,640
Oh, yes. Anyway, thank you for thinking of me.

141
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,900
Please sit.

142
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,540
Put both feet together, and raise your right leg.

143
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,770
Put the flat of your foot against your thigh and resting it there lightly,

144
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,370
put both hands together in front of you.

145
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,470
Now, both hands should be released first,

146
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,340
and now release your leg slowly as well.

147
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,070
We will breathe deeply now.

148
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,970
The two couples should now put their backs together and sit.

149
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,900
Please make sure your backs are completely touching.

150
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:31,170
And, then slowly, slowly turn your bodies to the left and put your hand on top of your partner’s knee.

151
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,400
Then with the right hand, grab your knee.

152
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,140
Then the men will lie back as they are.

153
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,100
Enough

154
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,470
Enough

155
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,000
Ow. Do it gently, gently.

156
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,300
Class will finish here now. You’ve worked hard. Namaste.

157
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,370
Namaste. Thank you. Thank you.

158
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,300
Ow.

159
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,900
Ow. It was okay.

160
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,840
Did you find it worth doing?

161
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,600
Wait. Today, there is still a highlight left.

162
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,670
There is a teacher who is really famous for her meditation.

163
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,770
Someone else is coming?

164
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,700
They say that even the highest levels of politicians relax their minds with this person.

165
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,200
They say that just by looking at one’s aura, she is able to completely understand a person.

166
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,040
-What is this?
-What’s this? Why have the lights been turned off?

167
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,740
Hello.

168
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,140
We will start the meditation.

169
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,500
Close your eyes.

170
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,040
Do not look behind you.

171
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeobo, do as she says.

172
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,100
Close your eyes.

173
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,940
Today we will become the selves inside us who had been scarred.

174
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,070
Follow me.

175
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,870
It is not my fault.

176
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,140
It is not my fault.

177
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,170
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

178
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,300
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

179
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,270
Ow!
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

180
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:35,870
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

181
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,270
Say it loudly. Once again. The inferior and lacking me is not me.

182
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,000
The inferior and lacking me is not me.

183
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,740
Well done.

184
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,370
The blaming and angry me is not me.

185
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,140
The blaming and angry me is not me.

186
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,240
The hitting me is also not me.

187
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,600
Do not look behind you.

188
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,840
Yeobo.

189
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,040
The angry person should follow along.

190
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,100
The hitting me is not me.

191
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,200
The hitting me

192
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,440
is not... me.

193
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,170
Good.

194
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,570
Now, I am not the me that I used to know.

195
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,640
I am reborn.

196
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,100
Healing time.

197
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:45,200
We will now have time to face our inner selves.

198
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,740
I’m going out.

199
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,140
Do not look behind you.

200
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,040
Shee

201
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,440
Yeobo

202
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,290
Is it finished?

203
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,490
She’s gone.

204
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,890
Yeobo, you liked it, didn’t you?

205
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,940
Yes. It was a bit scary though.

206
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,240
I am not me.

207
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,040
She’s really a famous person?

208
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,440
Of course.

209
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,040
<i>…has started.</i>

210
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:45,390
<i>Because they’re caring for their young, the dads lose almost half of their body weight.</i>

211
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:50,890
<i>Even from bitter colds of 50 degrees below zero, they are protecting their eggs.</i>

212
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,490
<i>They put the eggs on the tops of their feet,</i>

213
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,340
<i>and while it’s heavy for them to even walk,</i>

214
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:04,340
<i>if it’s cold on the outer edges, then they take turns going to the inner part where it’s warmer.</i>

215
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,190
Yeobo. What are you doing instead of sleeping?

216
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,990
Oh. Oh.

217
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,290
Are you crying?

218
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,790
Wildlife and us, were we always this sad?

219
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,440
<i>He cried! Our plan must be having an effect.</i>

220
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,390
<i>Candidate Baek Young Pyo Rebirth Project must continue.</i>

221
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,740
The Support Project is also continuing.

222
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,990
Oh. Oh, are we being too much?

223
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,590
I said that I would try.

224
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,090
Thank you.

225
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,440
As it was, I was feeling weak and tired.

226
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,140
Why don’t you take one upstairs?

227
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,740
He said that he wants to think of you as his mother and do his best as a family.

228
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,240
Go ahead and take care of him.

229
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,440
You can just take care of him then.

230
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,740
These days, they say the parents’ ability is determined by the outcome of the child.

231
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,450
Just think of it as helping me out, and please take care of him.

232
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,600
Do you want to drink this?

233
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,980
Is there a secret plan that I don’t know about?

234
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,340
It’s part of the Support Plan.

235
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,690
Ahh.

236
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,400
Thank you, mother!

237
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,220
I think I have finally figured out what you are good at.

238
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,050
Being a good wife and wise mother. It’s two jobs.

239
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,820
I don’t expect a good husband.

240
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,450
I’ll expect at least a good dad.

241
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:22,180
Will those two be able to become close?

242
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,200
Are you taking the medicine that mother is giving you and studying well?

243
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,380
Yes, father.

244
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,110
Thank you, mother.

245
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,310
It sounds good to hear you say mother.

246
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,606
What would be good for a student studying for his exams…

247
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:46,040
I’ll look into it some.

248
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,470
Mother and son. It looks good.

249
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,090
<i>Praise often.</i>

250
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,560
Your style today is good.

251
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,450
It’s the school uniform that I wear every day.

252
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,580
<i>Properly select and provide snacks.</i>

253
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,540
What are you doing?

254
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,870
Mmm. Since you’re studying, so that you can eat some fruit before you continue studying.

255
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,490
Give it to me. Give it to me.

256
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,540
Was the apple originally this small?

257
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,580
Oh, give it to me.

258
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,580
Is there really anything you can’t do?

259
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,180
<i>I speak 'I am' sentence.</i>

260
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,360
Because you do everything so well, I really like it.

261
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,090
Aren’t you trying too hard?

262
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,450
When it’s just the two of us, you should just act comfortably.

263
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,560
Because you are considerate of me, I am very happy.

264
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,380
I am comfortable even now.

265
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,200
It’s because I am very uncomfortable.

266
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,180
They say the skin has a lot of nutrients.

267
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,140
I’ll eat it well.

268
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,820
Aigoo. Ai, today’s dinner, what shall I feed my children?

269
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,000
Unnie is really a good mother.

270
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,820
A “good mother” - that’s our Mi Sook, isn’t she?

271
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,050
Oh, no.

272
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,710
I still don’t know how to become a good mother.

273
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,760
I think unnie must have been born a good mother from the start.

274
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,250
If I had been born as a mother,

275
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,710
do you think I would confidently be able to do it well?

276
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,380
I thought that if one just had some children and raised them, that made one a mother.

277
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,270
Since I never lived as a daughter, is that why it’s so hard to be a mother?

278
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,380
I sometimes get thoughts like those.

279
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,540
Ehy.

280
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,960
It’s not as if there is a formula to being a mother. That’s enough of that.

281
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,400
It’s just that if you follow your fate, then you become a mother

282
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,620
and live as a mother.

283
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,740
I…

284
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,740
Jung Hye is already a good mother.

285
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,180
The name “mother”,

286
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,470
I do want to hear it and I did want to call someone that.

287
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,360
But, from the time I was born, I don’t think that was mine to be.

288
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,450
Living as one family is still difficult, isn’t it?

289
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,380
And, the word “mother” still sounds strange.

290
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,780
There needs to be time spent between parents and children.

291
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:07,160

292
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,440
Tada!

293
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,260
Ohhhhhh

294
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,900
It’s good.

295
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,520
Heol~

296
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,240
You should have cut it up before you put it in.

297
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,220
I should?

298
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,560
I read that putting in some green onion makes it more delicious.

299
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,840
Try it!

300
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,740
I'll eat well.

301
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,960
How is it?

302
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,660
It's delicious.

303
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,040
Is it?

304
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,700
Mmmm

305
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,720
Less delicious than Hee Soo's...

306
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
but better than yours.

307
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,620
Eh?

308
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,260
I'll eat well.

309
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,020
Mmm

310
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,760
Cooking ramyun is quite easy.

311
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,960
<i>What should we eat next time?</i>

312
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,140
Are you really cutting it up to eat?

313
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,900
Son!

314
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,460
Take some breaks.

315
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,600
Shall we play a game together, it’s been awhile.

316
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,360
I have many things to study.

317
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,320
Yes.

318
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,080
Tail them.

319
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,500
Yes.

320
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,080
Yes, father!

321
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,280
The site in the Philippines has been dealt with well.

322
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,420
A few years ago,

323
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,580
you also said it had been dealt with well.

324
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,840
I learned a lot from that case, father.

325
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,260
If you learned a lot,

326
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,160
then isn’t it about time to show some results?

327
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,140
I understand fully.

328
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,240
Let’s do it properly.

329
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,360
Did you find out anything?

330
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,920
It seems like a parents' meeting.

331
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,000
What’s with this woman?

332
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,820
I will find out more.

333
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,780
She is strange in many ways.

334
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,340
I can't step back like this.

335
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,000
Ah hot!

336
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,080
Ah, it’s been a long time since I was at school.

337
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,920
Ah

338
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,100
Son...

339
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,040
Wow

340
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,640
That car is hella expensive.

341
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,640
Wow, that ajumma is totally pretty.

342
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,660
Is she a celebrity?

343
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,440
Yah!

344
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,180
Why would a celebrity meet with such a country kid?

345
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,720
She can't be his mom.

346
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,480
Your style today is good, too.

347
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,160
Could it be something like that?

348
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,120
What? What?

349
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,200
You know that Sunbae is quite good looking.

350
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,600
So he takes money from ajummas and...

351
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,640
does reckless things?

352
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,660
Daebak!

353
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,540
Wonjo Gyoje!

Hey Hey Baek Seo!
Did you see it?

355
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,540
The country punk is having a Wonjo Gyoje?

356
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,400
What?

357
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,300
Wonjo Gyoje!

358
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,600
Not too long ago, I saw some ajumma take that punk away in her very luxurious car.

359
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,820
If they get into a luxury car, are they all in wonjo gyoje?

360
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,140
Yah

361
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,000
Are you taking that punk’s side?

362
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,140
Hey, Baek Seo!

363
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,460
You are not dating that country kid, right?

364
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,200
Yah

365
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,940
Why she is not answering?

366
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,140
Why are you laughing?

367
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,280
I was surprised that you actually came to the school.

368
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,660
I just did it,
as a treat for a brain.

369
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,980
I thought you came as a mother.

370
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,140
Mmm

371
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,140
I can't do it.

372
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,780
Let's go back to the original!

373
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,300
Yes!

374
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,120
Madam.

375
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,880
You’re saying this is in front of the school?

376
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,300
Yes.

377
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,120
It seems she went to pick him up.

378
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,920
That's all?

379
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,020
Yes

380
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,580
Keep watching them!

381
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,420
Baek Seo, why?

382
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,420
Nothing. We'll be late for school.
Let's hurry.

383
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,540
By the way, that senior, he’s definitely using his looks to get what he wants.

384
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,480
You, stay away from him!

385
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,520
Ah, why do you care?

386
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,240
Ay, why are you holding that, Student Soo Gyum?

387
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,240
Aigoo

388
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,640
I'm late. I'm late.

389
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,220
Where's Jung Hye?

390
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,700
She went to the rest room.

391
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,600
What's that?

392
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,380
Mi Sook Ajumma's while hair.
It's the third.

393
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,820
Aigoo

394
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,160
Why are you holding it?

395
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,780
Unnie is the one who needs to be taking the health tonic.

396
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,140
As it is, I’m already taking it.

397
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,240
- It’s what gives me energy.
- That’s right. That’s right.

398
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,200
You need to eat it and become more energetic.

399
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,740
Will you exercise with me?

400
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,400
Kick boxing? Fencing?

401
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,000
You will, Madam?

402
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,580
Shall we all do it together?

403
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,870
No, no!

404
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,120
By the way, this time, our operation is something proper, right?

405
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,400
If we keep on like this,
I think this will be the real revenge.

406
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,400
No one will get hurt, a peaceful revenge.

407
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,600
Aigoo aigoo, you're so gentle.

408
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,800
Give me your phone!

409
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,060
Keep it in your mind whenever I call.

410
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,240
[Never forgive]

411
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,920
Oh?

412
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,920
I like it.

413
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,020
I will too.

414
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,280
I will store it.

415
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,620
N.E.V.E.R F.O.R.G.I.V.E

416
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,640
Mom came and took her son away already.

417
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,940
With his aunts, there were three people who came.

418
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,580
One

419
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,600
Two

420
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,320
Three

421
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,200
What's that? That combination?

422
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,060
Going home?

423
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,080
Yes.

424
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,400
I have an appointment with President Kim Jung Yun.

425
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,660
Ok

426
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,220
Keep trying to do well with that.

427
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,180
By the way,

428
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,420
sister-in-law has an unexpected side to her.

429
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,900
What?

430
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,940
Apparently, she said that being born was not that child’s fault.

431
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,780
Why don’t you mind your own business?

432
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,840
Those two seem to be getting along well.

433
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,620
That probably wasn’t an easy thing to do.

434
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,340
Yes

435
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,340
Fortunately

436
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,500
However,

437
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,820
she should be more careful.

438
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,360
What?

439
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,220
Well...

440
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,000
People talk about others easily.

441
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,240
President Kim Jung Yun is worried too.

442
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,280
Sister-in-law is so young and the child is all grown up.

443
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,900
If people who like to talk put about baseless rumors anyway,

444
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,300
then that could be problematic for the company as well.

445
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,340
Ha ha ha what...

446
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,600
Your imagination is too much.

447
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,860
OK.
Work hard!

448
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,160
- It looks good.
- Everyone, let's drink.

449
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,200
The smoke hurts, right?

450
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,640
Aigoo

451
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,380
Our Mr. Candidate is too out of energy these days.

452
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,020
Ok

453
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,620
Have some meat

454
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,300
and get some energy.

455
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,400
Energy!

456
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,760
Here!

457
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,180
Does it...

458
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,840
keep hurting your eyes?

459
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,900
Do you know?

460
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,560
That the food we're eating is...

461
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,180
ourselves.

462
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,440
I feel like I'm chewing my karma.

463
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,640
Ah, Mr. Candidate,

464
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,400
you're not drinking these days.

465
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,620
You're too boring.

466
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,940
Chook~

467
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,840
One shot!

468
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,160
Yes.

469
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,020
Let's have a drink.

470
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,380
You've worked hard!

471
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,570
- You’ve arrived?
- Yes.

472
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,190
Oh Baek Seo Yeon.

473
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,740
You see your dad, and you don’t even greet me?

474
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
Aigoo.

475
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,760
Oh, go on in.

476
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Uh. Alcohol.

477
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,006
Yeobo. Put away the alcohol.

478
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:29,540
Even if I just smell it, I feel nauseous and I can’t breathe.

479
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,520
- Get rid of all these. Get rid of all the alcohol.
- Yes.

480
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,590
Seo Yeon!

481
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,910
Come help your mom!

482
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,910
Seo Yeon, come out!

483
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,590
Seo Yeon!

484
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,750
Seo Yeon! Seo Yeon!

485
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,910
It’s alright now. Dad is changing, too.

486
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,420
Seo Yeon.

487
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,780
Who did you meet today?

488
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,290
- My friends.
-  Friends?

489
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,480
- Lee Soo Gyum is your friend?
- He is a son of my friend.

490
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,230
- But why him?
- I saw.

491
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,270
- What?
- I saw you two were in the cafe.

492
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,170
Why do you meet your friend's son
separately in the cafe?

493
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,170
Why do you keep lying to me?

494
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,170
I'm not lying.

495
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,480
- My friends were there too.
- Do you know what my friends say about him?

496
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,540
It's rumored he is in Wonjo Gyoje
(paid relationship with minors).

497
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,120
Ah..

498
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,306
Soo Gyum is not that kind of kid.

499
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:48,140
What does mom know about him that you’re taking his side?

500
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,480
Why do I have to hear him nagging me about treating mom well or not.

501
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,630
Ai.

502
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,100
- That is, Seo Yeon.
- The one changing is you, mom.

503
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,030
So strangely.

504
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,270
Empathy. Ability to feel another’s emotions.

505
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,430
Empathy. Ability to feel another’s emotions.

506
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,710
Empathy. Ability to feel another’s emotions.

507
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,720
<i>Student Soo Gyum</i>

508
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,020
<i>Seo Yeon seems sensitive these days...</i>

509
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,980
<i>She is misunderstanding you and feeling uncomfortable about you.</i>

510
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,630
<i>How about keeping a distance for a while?</i>

511
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,460
She should have told me.

512
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,160
Mi Sook ajumma texted me that...

513
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,920
Have you come?

514
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,780
- Uh. Yes.
-  Mother, father.

515
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,180
Good night.

516
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,360
Hyung!

517
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,190
Hyung!

518
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,540
Hyung! Hyung!

519
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,330
<i>The 270 bus is arriving imminently.</i>

520
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,840
Hey!

521
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,140
What's this?

522
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,130
Why are you avoiding me?

523
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,740
You said you're uncomfortable, didn't you?

524
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,240
If you don’t like me, you should just say that you don’t like me.

525
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,990
Did you hear that from my mom as well?

526
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,006
Yes. She worries a lot.

527
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,640
Who are you to be meeting my mom?

528
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,340
MFS. Don't you know MFS?
I am your Mother's Friend's Son.

529
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,880
Let’s say it’s not so with my mom.

530
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,420
But, is it true with the other ajummas?

531
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,310
What? What is?
What are you talking about?

532
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,340
Don’t you know what the kids
are saying about you?

533
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,860
- Um... Cool?
- Ah... what the hell.

534
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,040
There are rumors that you are having a wonjo gyoje with ajummas.

535
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,210
What?

536
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,940
Who? Me?

537
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,380
Wonjo Gyoje?

538
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,780
You’re not?

539
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,673
Can't you see by looking at me?

540
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,420
I can't.

541
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,840
Wah, I’ve come to Seoul, and have to hear all sorts of weird things!

542
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,990
Hey, my family is rich!

543
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,420
I don’t have any reason to do such a thing!

544
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,420
Ah, I see the way it is.

545
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:27,420
Hey.

546
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,880
By any chance, did you tell your mom that?

547
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,680
That your mom

548
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,640
and I have that kind of relation…

549
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,706
Wah, you’re really too much.

550
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,773
I can’t believe you. I can’t.

551
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,606
- You know what kind of person your mom is...
- Ha you're so talkative.

552
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,206
If you’re not doing it, that’s fine!

553
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,640
Ah what else?

554
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,806
You really hate your mom?

555
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,730
You don’t really.

556
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,980
You’re not the only one having a hard time.

557
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,870
My life is somewhat complicated, too.

558
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,806
You don’t know how lucky you are
to have such a mom, do you?

559
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:28,690
Don't pretend you know everything.
Because you're annoying.

560
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,830
If I'm annoying, you're rude.

561
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,906
I don’t know what’s happened between you,
but don’t make your mom’s heart hurt too much.

562
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,720
You don’t really feel that way in your heart.

563
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,540
Yah! If you think that just because you’re crying,

564
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,273
that I’ll hug you or something, that’s a big miscalculation.

565
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,370
What’s he talking about.

566
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,820
This will rip your eardrums out.

567
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,150
[Han Soo Ji]

568
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,510
Yah.

569
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,390
I told you to take my call.

570
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,580
What's this?

571
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,240
Aw.

572
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,820
I really..

573
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,840
Ay!

574
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,260
What are you trying to do now?

575
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,120
Well. I am wondering to whom
I should give what I have now.

576
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,100
- So I want some advice.
- Stop playing, meet me first.

577
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,620
Oh, it’s only now that you seem to be to my taste.

578
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,840
I prefer someone who chases after me.

579
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:50,370
Rather than someone that I have to contact first.

580
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,540
Hello, brother-in-law.

581
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,540
Hello, Soo Gyum's mother.

582
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,600
Brother-in-law?

583
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,740
Genetics is so amazing.

584
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,773
My Soo Gyum looked after you...

585
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,073
I think our Soo Gyum resembles you a little.

586
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,100
Soo Gyum does not seem to resemble you at all.

587
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,860
They say that the first child naturally resembles the father the most in order to be acknowledged.

588
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,380
You are so brave in many ways.

589
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,020
From giving a birth to a baby by yourself to this.

590
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,530
A parent is someone who can do anything for their child.

591
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,990
You also have raised kids so you know well, don't you?

592
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,390
Oh. You said that you only have three daughters, didn’t you?

593
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,150
Different than daughters,

594
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:42,560
more is expected from sons,
so I feel more responsibility as a mother.

595
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,850
<i>Please guide my Soo Gyum well.
Please treat him as your son.</i>

596
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,540
<i>I don't know.</i>

597
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,370
<i>What's your reason to see me?</i>

598
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:55,440
Wouldn’t it be the same reason that you came out so willingly?

599
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,690
Hello. Hey Hey!

600
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,230
Aish.

601
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,370
What the hell are those two planning!

602
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,170
Wonjo Gyoje!

603
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:38,940
Yes, father-in-law.

604
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,660
With that child?

605
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,500
Child,

606
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,173
how long has it been since you
became a member of my family?

607
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,206
It has been 10 years.

608
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,440
Our Hae Rang was releasing new technology...

609
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,073
and the company was growing a lot at the time.

610
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,173
Chairman Kim (Jung Hye's father) needed Hae Rang, and I needed you.

611
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,600
You are someone that I am always grateful for.

612
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,740
I hope that it will continue that way in the future.

613
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,873
She must be more comfortable for you than your father.

614
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,206
- Yes?
- Since it looks as if you are closer to your stepmother.

615
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,370
Child.

616
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,206
- Yes.
- The role of the father also depends on you.

617
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:41,606
Usually in father-son relationship, when the son’s head grows, then it becomes awkward anyway.

618
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:46,073
However, meeting him when he’s all grown up, it probably isn’t easy for Byung Soo either.

619
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,040
You have to make an effort to even develop some affection.

620
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,040
Yes, grandfather. I will try to do well...

621
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,940
And, help them both well from in between them.

622
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,940
Yes, I understand.

623
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:58,100
Also,

624
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,050
the two of you getting along well,

625
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,510
of course, it is gratifying for me,

626
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,490
but the world isn’t like that.

627
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,906
If you two don’t get along,

628
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,473
they’ll say it’s because you’re a stepmother.

629
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,190
And, even if your relationship is too good,

630
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,573
then strange rumors will start as well.

631
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,106
Grandfather! What does that mean?

632
00:49:19,106 --> 00:49:21,100
Already,

633
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,760
there are rumors that I’ve heard.

634
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,410
- That’s why I’m saying that. Be careful.
- Yes.

635
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,810
I will be cautious.

636
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,390
Just because of me,
you even had to listen to that.

637
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,270
It’s not because of you,

638
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,240
but because of strange people.

639
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:52,740
Oh, those bastards!
Do they really have nothing else to do?

640
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,510
You understand that we can’t become close,

641
00:49:59,020 --> 00:49:59,800
don’t you?

642
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,090
As per our agreement,

643
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:04,510
let’s not become close.

644
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,240
I also don’t want to do campaign support activities anymore.

645
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,780
<i>President Kim Jung Yoon Reveals Building
a ‘Traditional Hanok Hotel’ in Seoul Center.</i>

646
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,690
The two of you,
how many years apart are you in age?

647
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,220
It must be embarrassing to be even called mom.

648
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,260
How do you live together in the same house
when it’s so uncomfortable?

649
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,840
Sister-in-law is so young,
and the child is all grown up…

650
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,740
If people who like to talk
put about baseless rumors anyway,

651
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,273
then, that could be problematic for the company as well.

652
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,680
You’re coming in together again.

653
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,340
I’ve returned.

654
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,240
Where are you coming back from?

655
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:13,340
I just asked you a question!

656
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,110
- Well, grandfather...
- Now, did I,

657
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,650
ask you?

658
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,790
Yah!

659
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:22,880
Just now,

660
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,080
what's that attitude?

661
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,800
Why are you being like this?

662
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,510
Are you drunk?

663
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,170
You kept ignoring my words, but,

664
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,370
you’re willing to speak up for this bastard?

665
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,190
What?

666
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,260
Whatever.

667
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,973
Just tell me what you were doing
before you came home.

668
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,340
Father-in-law called us.

669
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,640
The two of you together?

670
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,373
Yes.

671
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,706
Why?

672
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,640
He warned us

673
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,873
to be careful.

674
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,573
What are you saying?

675
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,540
If a stepmother and a child are too close,

676
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,073
then, strange rumors will start.

677
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:05,140
You even made father say those kinds of things.

678
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,740
You’re behaving so well.

679
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,470
So well.

680
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,460
Anyway, you...

681
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,410
You have no middle ground.

682
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,350
Even playing a mother role should be done moderately.

683
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,210
Your sister,

684
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,130
and that bastard Byung Hun,

685
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,180
all those assholes who just want to cut me down!

686
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,200
There’s a legion of them!

687
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,040
Don't you know that?!

688
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,420
Do you know what those assholes are saying right now?

689
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,020
Huh?

690
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,806
The stepmother and illegitimate child
who aren’t even that far apart in age are...

691
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:31,170
Aigoo...

692
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:37,230
Why the hell do I have to listen to such bullshit?

693
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:37,980
Huh?

694
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,220
Why did you two have to go around outside together?

695
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,650
You shouldn’t say those things.

696
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,220
The rumors are not from me!

697
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,340
Father, I think you’ve had too much to drink.

698
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,873
Go to your room.

699
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,320
Ah, really, you two...

700
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,940
put me in such a foul mood.

701
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,840
Since I walked around just smiling and laughing all the time,

702
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,010
did you two

703
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,890
decide to gang up

704
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,620
to cause me grief?

705
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,320
Father!

706
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,110
Please go inside your room.

707
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,610
Where are you going?!

708
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,440
Please stop now.

709
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:22,740
What?

710
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,090
I asked you to stop.

711
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:26,730
You.

712
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,840
What makes you believe,

713
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,780
that you can be so disrespectful?

714
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,706
Because, Father...

715
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,380
You need me.

716
00:53:36,873 --> 00:53:49,006
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club"

717
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,120
Ah, I’m sorry, honey.

718
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,100
My work ran late.

719
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,340
Are you sure I have to go to there?

720
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,273
Is there a reason why I should buy from that store?

721
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:03,873
Okay, yes, yes, I understand.

722
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,140
Okay, if the quality is so good,
I guess I should go there.

723
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,540
Ah, but that store,

724
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,206
where is it exactly?

725
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,500
Fourteen…

726
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,940
Thirteen…

727
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,270
Ah!

728
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,670
Ah, Fifteen.

729
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,770
Fish...

730
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,540
- Ah!
- Ah, you startled me!

731
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,430
You’re the principal.

732
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,120
Oh, you must be one of the school parents?

733
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,530
- That’s right, that’s right.
- Ah...

734
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,450
I can’t believe the principal is here.

735
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,490
Instead of your wife you’re doing the shopping.

736
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,370
How nice that you’re helping her.

737
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,820
I heard that the quality is good here…

738
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,710
This is such an honor.

739
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,690
What does your wife like?

740
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,660
I’ll select some very fresh ones for you.

741
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,180
- Sure, yes, whatever you choose.
- Ah, wait here.

742
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:44,320
Follow me.

743
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,160
Only the best for you.

744
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,780
Too bad my two kids aren’t here to say hello.

745
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:54,780
This is my care (devotion) for you.

746
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,840
Aigoo, aigoo. You didn’t have to do all this.

747
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,400
Thank you so much.

748
00:54:59,120 --> 00:54:59,530
Then...

749
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,490
It’s $25.

750
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,280
Huh? But I thought,

751
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,300
you said it was your care.

752
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,150
I meant, it was my care to select
the best quality seafood for you.

753
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:10,820
Oh, sure...

754
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:11,820
Surely…

755
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,260
Surely you weren’t thinking…?

756
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,730
What kind of era is it now?

757
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,590
Kim Young Ran is watching.
<i>(Kim Young Ran's law: Public officer should not receive any gift)</i>

758
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,860
We seem to be in on the same joke.

759
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,280
Here you go.

760
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,700
It’s $25.

761
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,320
Huh?

762
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,100
$25.

763
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,460
Ah, yes, of course.

764
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,730
Okay, then.

765
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:38,830
How did I get stuck with such a jerk? Aish.

766
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:42,950
Come out, come out.

767
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,780
Come out, come out.

768
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:45,290
Come out, come out.

769
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,660
Oh, aigoo, it’s cold.

770
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:55,250
Is he gone?

771
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:56,440
Yeah, he’s gone.

772
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,410
He didn’t recognize you, unnie, did he?

773
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,080
No.

774
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,830
Not at all.

775
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,890
This… doesn’t seem very good either.

776
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,920
You should still be careful.

777
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,590
That bug-like jerk.

778
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,170
Still, I was very nervous.

779
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,960
It’s just that…

780
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,573
when I saw his sleazy self, my feelings of dislike came rushing up.

781
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:14,960
Principal Hong…

782
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,120
Hee Soo’s mother...

783
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,390
How could you ask such an
inappropriate question of the principal?

784
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,100
It’s because I had heard some stories, that’s why!

785
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,320
By any chance...

786
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,660
You don't think the person who took the photo,

787
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,340
was Hong Sang Man, don’t you?

788
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,410
Omo.

789
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,140
It could be him.

790
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:34,906
Then...

791
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:35,880
Then, so what?

792
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,246
What? Even if he took the photo,

793
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:40,106
what’s he going to do about it?

794
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,540
It’s not as if we’ve committed some big sin.
Isn’t that so?

795
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,670
Avengers Social Club! Fighting!
That’s what I mean.

796
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,020
Shhh…

797
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,250
Unnie…

798
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,220
Oh, I... I feel off.

799
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,860
Unnie, can you watch my store for me?

800
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:54,880
Where are you going now?

801
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,150
Just watch the store for a bit.

802
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:56,870
I’ll be right back.

803
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,100
Avengers Social Club?

804
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,760
Avengers?

805
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:09,373
B.J.?

806
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,820
Just know that this isn't the end,

807
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,660
you bug-like son of a bitch.

808
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,020
BJ?

809
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:19,950
What is it?

810
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,010
Can’t we go to our usual place?

811
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:25,940
Well, we could.

812
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,300
Ah, this place is okay.

813
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:27,660
Huh?

814
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,560
We can have some beer,

815
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,540
and make a plan.

816
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:31,420
Mi Sook, what do you think?

817
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:32,570
Yes, that sounds good.

818
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:36,840
Ah, wait.

819
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,460
So, should we call Soo Gyu-

820
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:41,270
What are we going to do?

821
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:42,750
Do what?

822
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,500
Let’s call Soo Gyum and have him come here.

823
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,490
No, that’s not what I meant.

824
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,540
What’s wrong?

825
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:50,840
H-he’s watching us.

826
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,900
Watching what?

827
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,090
No, he already saw us!

828
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,410
Who are you saying saw what?

829
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,150
Hong Sang Man!

830
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,570
Ah, don’t turn around and look.

831
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,200
He followed us.

832
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,490
What to do? What to do?
What are we going to do?

833
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,240
 L-let’s go. Go. Go.

834
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,030
- Go?
- Go!

835
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,870
Go. Go. Go.

836
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:18,950
Ah, Jung Hye.

837
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,090
Over here. It’s over here.

838
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,210
It's over here, Mi Sook, Jung Hye. Over here.

839
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:24,530
Ah, over here.

840
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,340
Is he still following?

841
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:56,406
I-I don’t know.

842
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,440
Don’t turn around. Don't.

843
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,006
How long are we going to walk?

844
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,506
On the count of three...

845
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,106
Run.

846
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:09,960
- One.
- One

847
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,110
- Two.
- Two.

848
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:11,980
Three.

849
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,020
Wait!

850
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,640
Why do we have to be the ones to run away?

851
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:16,980
Huh?

852
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,710
1, 2, 3.

853
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,060
Hello, Principal Hong.

854
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,380
Hello as well.

855
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,300
So, we meet here.

856
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,140
Now, where is the house I’m looking for?

857
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:36,310
Aren't the autumn leaves nice?

858
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,900
Well then, see you again.
You can go back to whatever you were doing.

859
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:39,706
I’ll be…

860
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:40,340
Yes.

861
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,406
My apologies for being late.

862
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:00,800
- Oh...
- Oh...

863
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:02,190
- You’re here.
- You're here?

864
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,840
Did something happen?

865
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,110
That jerk...

866
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,530
He saw us.

867
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:09,300
Secretary Joo?

868
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:10,580
What?

869
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:11,930
Who's that?

870
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:13,330
There’s someone else?

871
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,220
My father had Secretary Joo follow us.

872
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,190
What?!

873
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,600
Then who were you being chased by?

874
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:25,530
- Hong Sang Man.
- Hong Sang Man.

875
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,620
What?!

876
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:32,770
Then...

877
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,030
At least your husband’s project is going well?

878
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,310
To be honest, it’s…

879
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,210
<i>The next news.</i>

880
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,330
<i>It’s been revealed to be a shocking thing.</i>

881
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:46,640
<i>We have a report about a woman in her 40s</i>

882
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,920
<i>who attempted to harm her husband's health</i>

883
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,100
<i>by swapping the medicine</i>

884
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,820
<i>that he consumed every day.</i>

885
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:58,270
<i>The wife, Ms. Kim, gave her husband of 20 years </i>

886
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:02,870
<i>such doctored medicine because he was abusing her.</i>

887
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,610
Here's your medicine.

888
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,430
<i>And the reason she gave him doctored medicine</i>

889
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,220
<i>was because she couldn't bear</i>
- Is something wrong?

890
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,900
Why don’t you have it instead?

891
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,450
<i>the violence from her husband anymore</i>
- Huh?

892
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:15,840
Because it’s so good for the body,
you should have some as well.

893
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,870
Should I get you one, too?

894
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,406
No, that’s okay.

895
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,240
Since I started taking the pills,
my body hasn't been the same.

896
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:36,973
I don’t think it’s for me.

897
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:38,830
I-is that so?

898
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:38,940
Just throw it out.
I-is that so?

899
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,840
Just throw it out.

900
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:41,706
Or you can have the rest.

901
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:53,973
So...

902
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,673
Hong Sang Man followed us.

903
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,840
Your husband is suspicious.

904
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:02,673
Unnie, that means your husband could be as well.

905
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,940
Perhaps, our Avengers Social Club

906
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:10,470
should suspend activities for a little while?

907
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:11,973
What have we done wrong?

908
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,250
Why should we be afraid?

909
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,840
It’s not as if we completely didn’t do anything.

910
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,173
That is true.

911
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:24,806
If we compare it to what those bastards did, it’s nothing at all.

912
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,006
For the time being, it would be better if we took it easy.

913
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:29,306
Nothing will come of it.

914
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,373
Avengers Social Club!

915
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,073
Fighting!

916
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:27,506
Madam

917
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,440
The mail came.

918
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:54,580
<i>Avengers Social Club, I know what you did!!!</i>

919
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,690
Avengers Social Club, I know what you did.

920
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:23,740
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club"

921
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,880
<i>Who could it be? </i>

922
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,380
<i>He says that he knows what we’ve been doing.</i>

923
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,400
<i>However...</i>

924
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,650
Why are we here like this?

925
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,180
<i>The police came by today,</i>

926
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,970
<i>and it caused such a ruckus!</i>

927
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:54,240
<i>Yes?</i>

928
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,240
Our mother couldn’t restrain herself and got angry again?

929
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:57,090
Let's suspend it.

930
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,500
<i>They want to catch just me?</i>

931
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,890
<i>There is no evidence.</i>

932
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:00,660
<i>We have to find it. </i>

933
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,300
<i>Evidence.</i>

934
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,590
<i>You know that if we don’t have anything definite,
then it all comes to nothing, don’t you?</i>

935
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,290
<i>Is the whole family made up of gangsters?! </i>

936
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,740
<i>How dare you kick another’s precious son!</i>

937
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,140
<i>Unnie seems to be very angry.</i>

938
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,780
<i>You just want me to allow it to happen?! </i>

939
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,820
This person, I’ll just…!
