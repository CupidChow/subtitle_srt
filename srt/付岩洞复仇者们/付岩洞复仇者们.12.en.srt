"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies, Dongsaengs and Haraboji of Avengers Subbing Club"

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,160
Final episode

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,760
Why?

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,800
Did you want to try getting divorced?

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,880
Such a shame.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,740
I should have been the one to say that first.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,800
I’ll say it again for you.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,140
Lee Byung Soo.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,600
I won’t live with you any longer.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,260
Let’s divorce.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,640
Really.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,820
You don’t know your place.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,360
Divorce?

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,800
Get your head on straight.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,840
If you end it with me, you are nothing.

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,960
What remains of you without me?

17
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,760
I would be left.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,760
What is that?!

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,420
I…

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,140
am Kim Jung Hye.

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,200
Yes.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,100
Jung Hye!

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,840
We found the evidence.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,540
Yes?

25
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,680
Go safely, Lee Byung Soo.

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,380
What? Go?

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,420
Where would I go?

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,360
Yes, brother-in-law?

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,800
Yes?

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,020
Father-in-law is telling me to come.

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,100
He’ll probably have a lot to say about you.

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
Hono-lu-lu. What is that?

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
It’s in Hawaii.

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,680
Ah!

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,100
Oh, so Jung Hye wants to send her there?

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
I’ll go catch her.

37
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,100
Let’s go together.

38
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,100
- L-let’s go together!
- Still…

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,560
Soo Gyum, going by yourself…!

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,460
Don’t worry!

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,020
Oh.

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,060
Oh.

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,260
Oh.

44
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,540
Will Soo Gyum be okay?

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,820
Isn’t he just going to get hurt again?

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Her son is going to those lengths,
she’ll probably come to her right mind.

47
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,600
She will, won’t she?
She’s still a mom after all.

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,860
Do you think Jung Hye has left already?

49
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,940
Sister-in-law.

50
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,600
Was there really a need to bring everyone together like this?

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,740
I will take care of that woman appropriately.

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,260
Are you really just not able to sort out those around you?

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,360
If you allow an interview like that to be published,

54
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,300
then what does that do to Geon Ah’s position?

55
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,760
Noona.

56
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,720
It’s not right just to blame Son-in-law Lee.

57
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,320
It’s Jung Hye who first started this.

58
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,300
That’s what I mean.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,920
See.

60
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,820
Because of you,

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,340
everyone is gathered here
and being greatly concerned.

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,880
So, if you just leave quietly…

63
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,960
Father.

64
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,740
I…

65
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,880
will divorce.

66
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,500
What? You…

67
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,260
This person.

68
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
He was never my husband for even a second.

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,280
Why are you being like this?

70
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,180
He was brought in just to be a son-in-law to Geon Ah.

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,160
But now he’s not even able to fulfill that role properly.

72
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,040
That is true.

73
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,320
Just recently, General Manager Lee was also the one

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,620
who ruined the Chinese business.

75
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,600
Because of one person, you General Manager Lee,

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,340
the damage to us has been large.

77
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,300
Father.

78
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,180
Please think about it a little.

79
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,340
Simply covering this matter up

80
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,200
doesn’t seem to be the optimal thing to do.

81
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,340
Why are you being like this, sister-in-law?

82
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,600
Brother-in-law.

83
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,180
Father, that Chinese business…

84
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,360
The one who included General Manager Lee in that business

85
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,140
was you.

86
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,500
Geon Ah.

87
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,720
Hae Rang.

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,000
I have no interest in the dealings of either side.

89
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,000
I will...

90
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,860
throw everything away,
and I will live as Kim Jung Hye.

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,180
Yeobo.

92
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,600
Speak separately with me…

93
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,900
You.

94
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,220
I said that I wouldn’t leave you alone, didn’t I?

95
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,360
Thank you for cooperating with me.

96
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,680
Since a deal is a deal.

97
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,300
As for the promised stock shares,

98
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,780
I’ll give them to you after the divorce papers have been registered.

99
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,520
I was surprised.

100
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,140
Did you think I wouldn’t be able to do it?

101
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,520
You seem to have become useful.

102
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,740
Han Soo Ji, you’ve really made it,
even getting to fly on an airplane.

103
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,100
Oh well, I’d better…

104
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,720
Omo!

105
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,020
Omo, son.

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,920
You didn’t have to come see me off like this.

107
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,900
It’s time for me to board the plane.

108
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,740
So, I’ll get going.

109
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,940
Ow!

110
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:44,740
Ow!

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,200
Ow! Why are you being like this?
I said I was late!

112
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,160
Let go. Let go. Let go. !
I have to go catch my plane!

113
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,760
Ow.

114
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,880
How much did you get?

115
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,480
Wh-wh-wh-wh-what?

116
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,960
How much did you get from father
in order to tell those lies?

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,940
Oh, that’s…

118
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,820
It hurts.

119
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,640
He threatened me, so I had no choice.

120
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,180
Meet the reporter again and tell her.

121
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,940
That you received money from father
and lied during the interview.

122
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,820
N-no!

123
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,480
If I do, I’ll d-die.

124
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,740
Why in the world…?!

125
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,180
Oh, you scared me.

126
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,880
Why do you have to live this way?!

127
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,620
The plane is going to take off.

128
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,560
Sorry.

129
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,280
Oh, please!

130
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,480
Can’t you live without doing completely humiliating things?

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,720
Mom!

132
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,480
This will be my first and last request.

133
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,640
At least once, please.

134
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,400
Can’t you just be a mom?

135
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:53,200
[A special gift from the ASC family.]

136
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,233
There’s been no word from Soo Gyum.

137
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,000
If he had found her,
he would have let us know immediately.

138
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
He must not have been able to catch her.

139
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,640
Oh.

140
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,200
He must be so upset that
he can’t even bring himself to contact us.

141
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,333
That young child is having to undergo so many things.

142
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,000
That’s true.

143
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,900
He’s so young, this isn’t good for him.

144
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,633
Now, we really have to finish this.

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,200
So that we all won’t get hurt.

146
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,820
Yes, yes.

147
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,240
Mi Sook, did you finish writing it?

148
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Yes, I’ve finished writing it.

149
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,820
Read it out loud, Unnie.

150
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,680
Hello, reporters.

151
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,860
I am the wife of Baek Young Pyo,
a candidate for the Superintendent of Schools.

152
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
Lee Mi Sook.

153
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
Just a moment.

154
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,100
Oh.

155
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,460
It’s that person.

156
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,120
What is he trying to pull now?

157
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,060
Try answering it,
and see what he has to say.

158
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,480
Yes.

159
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,600
Yes?

160
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,800
He says that he’s here.

161
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,720
- At our house?!
- At this house?!

162
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,820
You said you had something to say.

163
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,460
Do you remember?

164
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,620
It was the winter of 1997.

165
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,820
I bought you beef for dinner.

166
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,240
And on the way to delivering you to your small room,

167
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,540
I proposed to you.

168
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,160
That I would become your first family.

169
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,140
Why are you talking about that now?

170
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,100
We were really good together then.

171
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,020
Because we started with difficulties in a studio,

172
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,900
we had to be frugal with our expenses.

173
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,633
And we had Seo Jin and Seo Yeon.

174
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,500
We were really happy back then, weren’t we?

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,166
Until you started to change, we were.

176
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,133
I was wrong.

177
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,020
You can stop now,
you’ve done enough.

178
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,740
Come back now.

179
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,733
The election is the day after tomorrow.

180
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,633
Go away.

181
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,580
Mi Sook.

182
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,400
If you were going to quit,
then I would think about it.

183
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,160
Are you telling me to withdraw from the election?

184
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,040
Yes.

185
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,700
You know I can’t do that.
Stop being unreasonable.

186
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,300
Tomorrow, there is going to be a press conference.

187
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,540
What’s going to happen?

188
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,220
Your unfitness for the position, I’m going to reveal it all.

189
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,720
I’m going to reveal it all.

190
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,020
Are you seriously crazy?

191
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,066
What is it that you gain from doing this?

192
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,580
Why are you causing a disturbance
in front of someone else’s house?

193
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,700
Shall I call the police?

194
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,140
Oh yeah, the Avengers Club.

195
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,500
Do you think it will happen as you want it to?

196
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,900
We’ll have to wait and see.

197
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,320
Tomorrow.

198
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,540
Go away.

199
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,740
Ah…

200
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,933
[A special gift from the ASC family.]

201
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,460
She definitely went?

202
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,560
And you checked the passenger list as well?

203
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,460
Okay.

204
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,780
What is it that the ajummas say that
they’re going to do?

205
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,380
They said that they’re going to hold a press conference.

206
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,260
What?

207
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,520
What are they going to say?

208
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
They say that I am not qualified
to be a Superintendent of Education.

209
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,560
What?

210
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
What did you do?

211
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,700
When a couple argues,

212
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,400
things like that can happen, can’t it?

213
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,140
Surely not…

214
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,160
did you hit her?

215
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,600
Occasionally.

216
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,740
Sunbae!

217
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,580
This is driving me crazy. Aish.

218
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,500
Ay.

219
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,000
Right now, the wife is saying that she wants
to divorce me and causing trouble for me, too.

220
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,133
And why is that?

221
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,466
I didn’t know that she would react like this.

222
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,133
Those are not words that could have come out of that woman’s head.

223
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,740
If I’m divorced by Geon Ah,

224
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,320
I might get kicked off my family registry as well.

225
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,200
Then you have to do
whatever you can to hold onto her.

226
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,500
I have to hold on to her!

227
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,000
After we block tomorrow’s press conference.

228
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,600
I don’t know what’s going to happen.

229
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,400
When my situation is like this.

230
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,240
At least, Sunbae has to be elected

231
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,200
in order for me to be able to say anything to my father.

232
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,160
If we just finish like this,
then we all die.

233
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,560
Don’t you think that there might be a way?

234
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,440
We have to stop them!

235
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,560
How?

236
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,900
Why don’t you withdraw?

237
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,880
The luggage has all been taken care of.

238
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,200
Yes.

239
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,020
Thanks for your work.

240
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,280
Oh, yeobo!

241
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,180
I...

242
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,960
told them to return everything to their original place.

243
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,640
Ay.

244
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,160
I...

245
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,040
didn’t know that you really didn’t want to go as much as that.

246
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,860
If you don’t want to, then you aren’t going!

247
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,620
I was only thinking of you two when I proposed it.

248
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,900
I seem...

249
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,000
to have gone overboard.

250
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,700
Also, do you think that
I would want to stay home by myself?

251
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,640
You know, without you, I can’t do anything.

252
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,840
Oh, Soo Gyum!

253
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,700
I’m home.

254
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,700
I’ve unpacked all your things.

255
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,780
Let’s pretend it never happened.

256
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,080
Go rest.

257
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,980
Kim Jung Hye’s husband Lee Byung Soo.

258
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,260
Without you, what would be left of me?

259
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,800
Isn’t that right?

260
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,200
Stop doing that.

261
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,220
It looks bad.

262
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,660
When a person is trying this hard, then you should accept what should be accepted,

263
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,680
and forgive what should be forgiven.

264
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,240
Whatever you do now,
nothing will change now.

265
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,040
Without me, what’s left of you,
try living with that.

266
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,340
Oh, really.
This feels so dirty, I can’t do it.

267
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,940
How do I get her to change her mind?

268
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,600
I’m sorry.

269
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,760
I thought that she would listen at least once to my request.

270
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,133
Don’t worry too much about it.

271
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,500
I’ll resolve my issues myself.

272
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,566
If she had even just said that the interview was a lie,

273
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,633
then Madam wouldn’t have to go through all this so unfairly.

274
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,633
I met the people from Geon Ah,
and I said everything I wanted to say.

275
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,800
That you’re going to separate from Father?

276
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,500
Yes.

277
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,966
Did they permit it?

278
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,466
I don’t need anything like their permission any more.

279
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,300
It’s funny.

280
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,120
That we live in the same house
and are calling each other on the phone.

281
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,780
I agree.

282
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,266
Anyway, it seems as if
everything will end tomorrow.

283
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
I’m looking forward to it.

284
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:30,620
Unnie.

285
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,860
Are you ready?

286
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,720
I rented the cafe,
and I contacted all the reporters.

287
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,180
That’s great.

288
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,740
All the press releases are ready, too.

289
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,300
I… I’m shaking a little.

290
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:40,960
Fighting!

291
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,100
Fighting!

292
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,780
Fighting!

293
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,260
Just a moment!

294
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,500
Turn on the TV.

295
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,780
Why? Why? What is it?

296
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,440
Why?

297
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,040
Where is it?

298
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,640
I, Baek Young Pyo,

299
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,560
am withdrawing today as a candidate
for the Superintendent of Schools for Seoul.

300
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,100
I am a bad father,

301
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,060
who was not able

302
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,780
to tell the world about the death of my son two years ago.

303
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,880
Also, a few days ago,

304
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,820
my mother who had been suffering from a long term illness passed away.

305
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,680
And, my wife, due to the shock of that

306
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,360
is currently being treated with powerful psychiatric drugs.

307
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,740
She holds on to the belief that

308
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,560
it was my fault that my son
and my mother passed away.

309
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,600
With a wife like this,

310
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,940
I have decided that I can’t serve properly
as a Superintendent of Education,

311
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,300
and had no choice but to withdraw as a candidate.

312
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,820
Before I can take responsibility for the education of this country,

313
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,380
I have to first take care of my family.

314
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,080
I think that’s the right thing to do.

315
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,140
During this time, for warmly accepting and encouraging me despite my many flaws,

316
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,500
I apologize to everyone and sincerely offer my gratitude.

317
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,120
I, Baek Young Pyo,
am withdrawing today as a candidate,

318
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,080
but from a less visible place,

319
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,140
I will continue to work hard
for the education of this country.

320
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,340
What is that person saying?

321
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,820
He’s trying to get one up on us.

322
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,100
I didn’t think he would go that far…

323
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,760
We should move quickly.

324
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,500
When he’s made an announcement like that,

325
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,360
will people believe Mi Sook’s words?

326
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,880
Maybe not about the violence,
but we have other evidence.

327
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,340
We need to at least reveal that.

328
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,480
Let’s go.

329
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,880
You did well, sunbae.

330
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,900
The reaction is very positive right now.

331
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,580
Oh, I saw that, too.

332
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,800
It looks as if there will be opposition
to your withdrawal from the election as well.

333
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,566
Now, no matter what those women say,

334
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,880
no one will believe them.

335
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,800
I think it can naturally even overturn the withdrawal.

336
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,866
As long as it’s not illegal.

337
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,620
Since my name is already on the ballots.

338
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,320
Yes.

339
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,160
Since there is a strong favorable sentiment,

340
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,540
you’ll probably win the election anyway.

341
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,420
Let’s just be cautious for today.

342
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,060
Yes.

343
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,260
<i>[Banner: Candidate Baek Young Pyo - Hae Rang Construction’s Lee Byung Soo Corruption Exposure - Press Conference]</i>

344
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,180
Candidate Baek Young Pyo

345
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,420
for reasons of Madam’s health
has already withdrawn from the election.

346
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,560
So, what is the point of the press conference?

347
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,060
Madam’s credibility is currently under question.

348
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,300
Do you have any evidence?

349
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,680
What is the reason

350
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,620
for calling a press conference to reveal family issues?

351
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,540
We will start.

352
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,620
The two of us today

353
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,780
are here after having suppressed ourselves for a long time.

354
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,320
My husband, Baek Young Pyo,

355
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,640
a candidate for the Superintendent of Schools for Seoul and…

356
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,640
My husband, Hae Rang Constructions’s
General Manager Lee Byung Soo,

357
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,580
we are exposing their corrupt connection.

358
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,280
This is

359
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,240
a record of the illegal contributions that
Lee Byung Soo gave to Candidate Baek Young Pyo

360
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,540
from a secret slush fund.

361
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,800
That is not all.

362
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,880
My son was forced to go overseas
though he did not want to.

363
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,500
The reason that child’s death was kept hidden

364
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,300
was because of my husband’s desire
to protect his reputation and his ambition.

365
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,550
Being ashamed of a son who had failed at science

366
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,820
and having sent him abroad,

367
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,160
my husband hid the child’s death

368
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,420
in order to protect his own reputation.

369
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,540
And as soon as the death was revealed,

370
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,220
he used another lie for his own purposes.

371
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:11,940
Also…

372
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,080
Also…

373
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,840
We are accusing Candidate Baek Young Pyo

374
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,380
of domestic violence.

375
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
I accuse him, too.

376
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,740
Me, too.

377
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,000
After having sent off our son that way,

378
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,160
my husband was abusive

379
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,740
and violent towards me.

380
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,100
Today, I...

381
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,780
am revealing Candidate Baek Young Pyo’s

382
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,460
habitual frequent domestic violence.

383
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,560
Do you have evidence that
you have suffered violence?

384
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,920
That Madam is suffering from the effects of powerful psychiatric drugs as revealed by Candidate Baek,

385
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,880
and the medications that you are currently on are being checked.

386
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,040
If you suffered violence, there should be a hospital record. Do you have one?

387
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,900
Because of the shock of losing my son,

388
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,300
I did go for psychiatric counseling a number of times.

389
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,380
But that I am on powerful psychiatric drugs
as my husband said

390
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,740
is not the truth.

391
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,340
What about evidence that you suffered violence?

392
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,420
The evidence

393
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,940
is right here.

394
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,180
Mom’s words are all true.

395
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,160
Are you acknowledging that your father

396
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,560
was violent towards your mother?

397
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,280
Since I saw it all.

398
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,280
Seo Yeon.

399
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,440
You did well, mom.

400
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,100
Just a moment.

401
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,800
I have…

402
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,920
an exclusive

403
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,060
to show you.

404
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,100
I...

405
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,480
was threatened by Hae Rang Construction’s
General Manager Lee Byung Soo.

406
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,480
So, I gave a false interview.

407
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,500
The statement that Kim Jung Hye

408
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,640
had threatened me

409
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,040
and prevented me from meeting my child

410
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,000
was all a lie.

411
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,000
For giving a false interview,

412
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,460
I sincerely offer my apologies.

413
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,840
Lee Byung Soo just kept telling me to do it.

414
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,480
Anyway,

415
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,860
Jung Hye, I’m sorry.

416
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,920
And…

417
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,360
Son.

418
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,600
I’m sorry.

419
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,840
That video, please give it to me.

420
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,780
Me, too.

421
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,940
Please give it to me, too.

422
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,020
- Me, too.
- Please, I’m asking as well.

423
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,220
Please look this way.

424
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,100
Please give us your cooperation.

425
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,150
- He’s coming out. He’s coming out.
- He’s come out! He’s come out!

426
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,370
Is everything that your wife
revealed at the press conference true?

427
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,140
Do you admit to the bribery
and the accusations of your violence?

428
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,650
What's the reason Hae Rang
offered you the illegal campaign money?

429
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,840
As I already mentioned,

430
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,720
my wife's mental condition isn't stable after my mother's death.

431
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,600
Your daughter also testified.
How do you explain that?

432
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,730
Everything from the press conference is not the truth,
and the truth will be revealed by the investigation.

433
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,890
Please say more..

434
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:57,050
Don't lie! You're a hypocrite! Get lost fraudster!

435
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:05,200
- Don't lie!
- Please say more..

436
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,490
Please say more..

437
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,970
Hey!

438
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,940
Hey! Please say more..

439
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,560
<i>Lee Byung Soo kept telling me to do so.</i>

440
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,560
- <i>Jung Hye-ssi, I'm sorry.
- This woman!</i>

441
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,560
- Aigoo.
- <i>And, son.</i>

442
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,730
<i>I am sorry.</i>

443
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,640
No!!

444
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,930
No! No! No!

445
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,540
No! No!

446
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,500
The candidate is not here.

447
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,320
Reporter Lee, how many times have I told you that's not true?

448
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,570
I’ve told you that the decision to withdraw from the election
has nothing to do with the usage of political money!

449
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,270
The reporters are so stubborn,
so the articles can’t be blocked from being released.

450
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,800
- Yeah.
- I will call you again after a while. Yeah.

451
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,390
What’s this?!

452
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,400
You can't just come in here.

453
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,080
What is this?

454
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,620
What is this right now?

455
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,930
What are you doing?!

456
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,160
Baek Young Pyo-ssi!

457
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,390
You are arrested without a warrant
on violation of election law charges.

458
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:12,730
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies, Dongsaengs and Haraboji of Avengers Subbing Club"

459
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,860
Yeobo

460
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,240
Move.

461
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,380
What are you doing?

462
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,020
Yeobo, please save me this once.

463
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,900
If you leave me then I will have nothing left.
You know that as well.

464
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,710
Why? You have Hae Rang and the Chairman.

465
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,600
You also have Director Kim Jung Joon by your side.
You have many with you.

466
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,960
Even if all of them are combined,
they're still not worth as much as you!

467
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,600
- Without you, I’ll die!
- Then die.

468
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,220
You and I have lived together for 10 years. How can you do this to me?

469
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,990
Please, help me this one time, Jung Hye.

470
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,620
Yeah, I have been holding back for 10 years.

471
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,420
I’ll be good to you, yeobo.

472
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,670
In the future, for the next 10 years, 20 years, until I die,

473
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,200
I’ll be loyal to Kim Jung Hye. Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty!

474
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,240
That doesn’t look good.
Would you please move?

475
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,600
Yeobo!

476
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,970
Ah, you know that this house is mine as well, right?

477
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,490
I would like it if you would empty
your room out as soon as possible.

478
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,360
Jung Hye! Yeobo!!

479
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,870
What are you people doing?

480
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:46,570
Lee Byung Soo-ssi, you are arrested without a
warrant on violation of election law and bribery charges.

481
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,820
No. I'm not.

482
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,680
Yeobo, please save me. Soo Gyum, why are you just watching?

483
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,870
Soo Gyum! Yeobo!

484
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,570
It has finally finished.

485
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,750
It has.

486
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,180
Son! Did you receive my present well?

487
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,550
You left without even looking back,
why did you change your mind?

488
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,300
Ay, well, you were at least once…

489
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,633
Oh, I just did. Why?

490
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,710
Okay. Do you like it there?

491
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,810
Yes. It’s a total paradise. Daebak! Huh?

492
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,040
Son, study well. You can’t live like your mom, okay?

493
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,070
Don’t worry about me. Just please live your life right.

494
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,730
I understand. Ok! Ok! Bye!

495
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,080
- Bye!
- I got it.

496
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,420
Dad must not be able to come home.

497
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,220
Oh, Seo Yeon.

498
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,360
Mom will, with your dad…

499
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,700
Do you as you mean to, mom.

500
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,400
Now, there is nothing to hide and nothing to lie about.

501
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:32,733
Don’t restrain yourself any more, and do as you want, live as you want.

502
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,700
For me, that’s enough.

503
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,030
Seo Yeon.

504
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,840
Mom is going to become stronger.

505
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,240
For you and for me.

506
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,030
♫ I won’t grab you.

507
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,400
♫ Don't hide.

508
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,740
♫ Tell me.

509
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,110
♫ I will listen to you.

510
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,080
♫ Trust me.

511
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,750
♫ People from the past knew

512
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,520
♫ that such a miracle

513
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,070
♫ can became reality.

514
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,530
♫ Sometimes

515
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,450
Seo Jin.

516
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,640
♫ though it seems far away.

517
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,560
- Hello.
- Yes, welcome…

518
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,760
Do you want some squid?

519
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,370
As I was passing by, it reminded me
that I wanted to check your other knives, too.

520
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,260
- No.
- Yes?

521
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,160
It's alright. They are all usable.

522
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,450
And what carpenter sharpens knives?

523
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,200
But that time, you yourself came and asked me to sharpen...

524
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,470
Welcome!

525
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,260
What can I get you, mother?

526
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,433
The mackerels are good and the hairtails are good, too.

527
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,430
Bye.

528
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,740
Go safely!

529
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,700
Take your time looking.

530
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,840
Oh, why are we going there?

531
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,940
I just want to see if he’s good looking.

532
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,510
I said he’s good looking.

533
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,210
That’s why… I have to determine it for myself.

534
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,190
A man has to be seen by noona in order to know.

535
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,700
Noona, you were always only rejected.

536
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,760
You…just “hwak”. Just follow me quickly.

537
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,120
Are you sure this is the right place?

538
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,730
Yes. I saw the business card in mom’s room.
Wood Story.

539
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,880
When did you see that?

540
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,490
Who…?

541
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,080
Oh.

542
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,860
Hello.

543
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,160
Hello.

544
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,440
So, the first time you met,
you saved our mom from some hooligans?

545
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,990
Why?

546
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,170
- Well, that is… Because they looked dangerous.
- You pass the "chivalrous spirit test".

547
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:44,010
Our mother, raising the two of us alone,
has had a hard life.

548
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,370
Don’t go overboard.

549
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,380
What do you like about our mother?

550
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,930
I think there may be some misunderstanding…

551
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,400
Ahh, it’s still a “some”.
(T/N: A “some” is a flirtation.)

552
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,130
Anyway, don’t hurt our mother.

553
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,310
Even though she seems strong,
you have no idea how sensitive she is.

554
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,400
You’ve passed the first round,
and we’ll leave now.

555
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,560
Already? I still have things left to say.

556
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,050
Actually, I’ve seen the two of you.

557
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,190
You were giving her a ride on a rainy night.

558
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,700
Even though mom says that you aren’t anything to each other,

559
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,620
it didn’t seem that way to me.

560
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,440
He said it was a “some”. Hurry up, let’s go.
Let’s go.

561
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,980
Goodbye.

562
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,320
Goodbye.

563
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,940
It’s okay. They’re all usable.

564
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,300
And, why would a carpenter sharpen a knife anyway?

565
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,250
Noona, don’t you have any saved money?

566
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,760
Of course, I don’t. I was fired within a month…

567
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,120
No. I was the one who quit.

568
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,560
- If mom is going to get married…
- Don’t go overboard.

569
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,960
It didn’t seem as if mom has even received a love confession yet.

570
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,850
Anyway, living together in one house will be a little much.

571
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,730
Well, if mom really should get married, then that will be true.

572
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,640
When mom goes into the wedding hall, she’ll hold my hand…

573
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,720
Little brother, when mom actually starts dating, we can talk then.

574
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,210
Hurry up and come on.

575
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,820
Oh, it was fun, but it’s finishing.

576
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,366
Yes. Yes.

577
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,100
That’s right. That’s right.

578
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,930
Oh, it feels so good.

579
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,680
Where did the two of you go together?

580
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,570
Just… a little…

581
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,200
Oh, yah, Hee Kyung, try to find a backscratcher. Oh, it’s so itchy.

582
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,240
Oh, my arm.

583
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,930
Oh, oh, that feels good.

584
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,720
- Here?
- Oh, that felt so good.

585
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,880
I agree. I whole-heartedly agree.

586
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,500
To what?

587
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,390
Me, too. If mom is happy, then that’s enough.

588
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,630
What are you talking about?

589
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,320
We met that ajusshi.

590
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,490
Who?

591
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,220
The man mom is having a “some” with.

592
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,710
The wood man.

593
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,690
Why would the two of you meet that person?
You’re crazy. Crazy. Crazy.

594
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,840
- Wasn’t mom and that ajusshi having a “some”?
- What are you…?

595
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,170
Aigoo. I don’t know. I don’t even know his name,
and I don’t know how old he is. I don’t know anything.

596
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,240
- What is this?
- Then it was just mom by yourself?

597
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,140
By myself? What did I do by myself?

598
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,840
Oh, okay.

599
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,880
That's right. Mom…

600
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,780
Mom felt some flutterings.

601
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,270
What kind of man would shield mom
with an umbrella and drive me in his car?

602
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,260
Saying that a woman by herself was dangerous
and things like that, it make one feel flutters.

603
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,270
Mom really was having a one-sided crush.

604
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,200
Go for it, mom. He looked like a good person.

605
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,840
Just go for it, and do everything mom wants to do.

606
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,900
That ajusshi looked nice, so if mom did that, I think he would accept it.

607
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,870
Ay, that isn’t that attractive.
Mom, don’t be too much like that. Huh?

608
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,150
- No!
- That isn’t right.

609
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,710
Yah! Mom should stop drinking kimchee broth. Ay.
(note: drinking kimchee broth = hold unrealistic hopes)

610
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,860
He’s good looking, isn’t he?

611
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,630
Yes. A little?

612
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,270
Child, do you absolutely have to do it that way?

613
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,370
My decision won't change.

614
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,040
Soo Gyum asked me to abandon you, too.

615
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,050
This is my choice and my decision.

616
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,570
So, please leave that child alone.

617
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,810
Isn’t he a child who is of no concern to you now?

618
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,200
I like my grandson.

619
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,280
If you want to keep Soo Gyum by your side as your grandson,

620
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,020
please let him live as he wants,
according to his own will.

621
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,720
If you separate from Byung Soo,
you and that child are strangers.

622
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,420
For 10 years,

623
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:08,680
I've never asked any favor of you, father-in-law.

624
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,080
This is my first and the last favor that I ask of you.

625
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,760
So what did I tell you? Huh?

626
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,480
I told you that you guys wouldn't be safe either, didn’t I?

627
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:35,690
That's why I kept saying that we needed to stick together,
but you kicked me out in one morning.

628
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,370
Aigoo, really.

629
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,560
I didn’t know the Avengers Club would go as far as this.

630
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,920
I still can't believe this situation.

631
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,770
That’s why we have to harmonize our statements well.

632
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,800
They haven’t confirmed any compensation payments yet. Hm?

633
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,160
That’s right! Because, that was promised to you if you were elected.

634
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,466
But it's true that I received your money and used it.
If somehow just the details…

635
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:04,200
Yes!

636
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,940
Everything is being recorded.

637
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,020
You didn't know? C.C.

638
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,830
So, you two held hands and went to court together?

639
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:35,440
If they had agreed to settlements, it would have been simple. But it’s going all the way to lawsuits instead.

640
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,850
- It will take a long time, right?
-  What of it?

641
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,300
Compared to the time that unnie and I have endured, this is nothing.

642
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,920
My little sisters are cool!

643
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

644
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,130
What's this? You’re trying to feed me taffy?
(T/N feed someone taffy = annoy them)

645
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,520
It's so that you can do well on your exam.
(T/N taffy for exam-takers = so they can “stick”, i.e. pass the exam)

646
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,080
I’ve already failed.

647
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,150
Do you have no confidence?

648
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,940
You reap what you sow.

649
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,140
This year, I didn’t have the right circumstances for studying.

650
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,730
Did you meet your father?

651
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,690
How about you?

652
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,760
I'm not ready to do that yet.

653
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,860
Me, either.

654
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,760
Later on, shall we go together?

655
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,760
Uh, the bus is coming.

656
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,000
If you go like this, we'll be late.
Why are you being like this?

657
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,160
Um? What?

658
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,490
You’re trembling right now.

659
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,440
Oh, it’s because you’re about to take the exam.

660
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,800
Then, why is Madam…

661
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,690
I don't know. I'm trembling to death.

662
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,280
There is no need to be like that.

663
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,440
You reap what you sow. I’ve already cleared my mind.

664
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
Yes.

665
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Don't get nervous.

666
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,430
If you don't know the answer, just pick one.

667
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,910
Yes, pick number 3.

668
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,530
Yes. Number 3. Number 3 is good.

669
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,840
It’s now time to clean things up, Chairman.

670
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,800
Is it that easy of a job? We've been together for 10 years.

671
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,990
You watched the press conference.

672
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,760
Our Geon Ah has no reason to keep the risk called Hae Rang Construction.

673
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:16,270
In both business and human relationships,
while there are good times, there will be bad times, too.

674
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,760
When the Chairman speaks in that way…

675
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,680
Then let's do it like this.

676
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,580
Why don’t you get rid of General Manager Lee, just the one person, Chairman?

677
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,400
I didn’t know if you would really give them to me.

678
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,560
Since, a deal is

679
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,740
a deal.

680
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,520
What is your plan for the future?

681
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,640
I’m going to take my time to think about it.

682
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,660
Will there be anything that you can do by yourself?

683
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,920
Now, I have nothing to fear

684
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,320
and there’s nothing that I can’t do.

685
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,700
I’m not sure whether you have no fear
or if you are getting braver.

686
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,300
I’m different from you.

687
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,860
To you, Geon Ah may be your everything,

688
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,060
but to me,

689
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,540
now I am my everything.

690
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,180
Well then...

691
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:36,940
Ah.

692
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,440
This.

693
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,640
What is it?

694
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,280
You like it.

695
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,060
A cake.

696
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,120
Un-nie.

697
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,580
But,

698
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,380
what should we do now?

699
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,940
It feels as if suddenly
there is nothing to do.

700
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,680
That’s right.

701
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,660
I woke up this morning,
and thought one side of chest felt empty.

702
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,180
Could there be someone
who needs our help in getting revenge?

703
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,300
There are assholes everywhere.

704
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,240
What if we take up the task
of helping those victims?

705
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,200
Haha..

706
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,680
Oh.

707
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,720
I remember our first meeting at this place.

708
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,860
To be honest,

709
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,200
at that time I thought both of you were strange people.

710
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,800
Jung Hye was the strangest one.

711
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,700
I was?

712
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,440
You should join us.

713
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,240
What?

714
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,040
Revenge.

715
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,000
We work together

716
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,500
to get revenge on those who have wronged each of us.

717
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,420
If I call it a labor exchange for revenge,

718
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,100
then you may understand it more quickly.

719
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,760
Revenge?

720
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,780
Labor exchange?

721
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,980
Stop joking, Jung Hye.

722
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,960
Buam Dong Avengers Social Club.

723
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,980
What do you think?

724
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,860
I really thought both of you were swindlers back then.

725
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,660
I did come here because I was furious,

726
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,520
but

727
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,780
I don't think
I can trust the two of you yet.

728
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,040
To a person you've met for the first time,

729
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,920
you say let's get revenge together

730
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,320
and shove a large sum of money.

731
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,400
I keep wondering

732
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,320
whether you're not trying to scam me or something.

733
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,780
I'm not a scam artist.

734
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,140
I.... I am not.

735
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,120
Yes, you look that way.

736
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,720
Aigoo.

737
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,100
Anyway,

738
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,140
I was wondering if
our Soo Gyum did well on his exam.

739
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,366
I completely failed it.

740
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,500
But Soo Gyum, you are naturally good with your studying.

741
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,490
No matter how good I am,
I had spent so much time on Avengers Club matters.

742
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,666
I couldn’t concentrate on my studies.

743
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,666
It’s okay. It’s okay.

744
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,760
You might have ruined the entrance exam, but you didn’t ruin your life.

745
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,100
Look at Hee Kyung.

746
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,640
Even if she isn’t smart,

747
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,800
but she found exactly what she wants to do…

748
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,100
And now she is at Noryangjin.
<i>(T/N - where students study hard for exams to achieve their dreams)</i>

749
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,220
That’s right.

750
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,080
The important thing is to find your dream.

751
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,600
You should try to find what you want to do as well.

752
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,080
For now,

753
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,466
I too think that I will have to cut ties with the world.

754
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,080
Soo Gyum.

755
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,940
Did you want to go into the mountains or something?

756
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,333
I don’t have the confidence to quit the Avengers Club activities.

757
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,720
If I want to pass the test the next time,
I’ll have to go into a study dorm.

758
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,500
Our revenges are all finished, so why?

759
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:45,940
But,

760
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,600
you’re still going to keep the Avengers Club, right?

761
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,960
Of course.

762
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,000
Our Avengers Club does have a fatal charisma.

763
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,440
“Demonic Avengers Club”

764
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,500
Actually,

765
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,320
I’m going to leave, too.

766
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,680
Where to?

767
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,420
Just going to
wherever my footsteps lead me.

768
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,700
That’s awesome.

769
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,440
I want to wander around

770
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,220
while thinking about
what I want to do and what I like.

771
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,880
Unnies, what are you going to do?

772
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,360
What do you mean, what will I do?

773
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,220
I’ll live as I normally live.

774
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,720
I want to have fun living with Seo Yeon,

775
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,666
doing everything that we weren’t able to do before.

776
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:31,780
Then,

777
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,800
is this really the end of our Avengers Club?

778
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,160
It’s just a suspension of activity.

779
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,320
Avengers Club!

780
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:41,920
Fighting!!

781
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,120
Can you really go alone for a holiday abroad?

782
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,440
Why?

783
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,640
It’s just that Madam going abroad by yourself is a little…

784
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,860
I’m even divorcing Lee Byung Soo,

785
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,500
so what is there that I can’t do?

786
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,420
That is true.

787
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:05,960
Tissues, please.

788
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,180
What’s wrong?

789
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,500
Doesn’t this remind you of anything?

790
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,500
“My unnie has suffered so much,”

791
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,466
“that her hands feel like a man’s hands.”

792
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,833
“Hng.”

793
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:37,980
My unnie...

794
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,540
suffers so much...

795
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,980
that her hands seem like a man's hands.

796
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,840
Unnie.

797
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,140
Hmmm?

798
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,980
We have to make sure to get revenge.

799
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,360
All the bad people,
let's kill them all!

800
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,360
Lee Byung Soo- evil bastard.

801
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,000
Avengers Club fighting!

802
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:13,860
Good night.

803
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,260
However...

804
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,860
once you divorce my father,

805
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,720
we will really become strangers.

806
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,080
It doesn’t matter.

807
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:25,880
Since

808
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,940
we will be “strangers”

809
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,840
who are better than family.

810
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:48,800
Oh.

811
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,340
Why you?

812
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,940
I have to leave, too.

813
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,920
To a cram school dormitory?

814
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,620
Already?

815
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,160
Yes.

816
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,060
The results haven’t come out yet.

817
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,020
I've predicted the scores.

818
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,520
I need to start study as soon as possible.

819
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:01,560
Okay.

820
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,780
While I leave for my travels,

821
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,140
you study hard.

822
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,420
Wow…. aren’t you being too cruel?

823
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,340
Let's go.

824
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:15,500
Hyung!

825
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,120
Why did you come?

826
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,900
Sadly, you don't even say a word before you go?

827
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,080
If mom hadn’t told me, really…

828
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,340
I might not even have been able
to see your face before you leave.

829
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,580
How embarrassing.
There is nothing to brag about a re-test.

830
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,060
Hyung.

831
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,660
Was your problem solved?

832
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,300
Yes.

833
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,980
It was solved.

834
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:40,520
You?

835
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,120
Me, too.

836
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,040
I have adjusted my thinking.

837
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,160
Oh.

838
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,260
He really wasn’t a taxi driver?

839
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,720
Hyung.

840
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,000
You just don’t know.

841
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,220
My mom is naturally very popular.

842
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,700
I know, I know.

843
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,300
Hong Do Ajumma has super charisma.

844
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,220
That ajusshi…

845
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,440
looked like a good person.

846
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,780
That's good.

847
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,380
Now, I’m the only one left who has to do well.

848
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,660
Hyung.

849
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,960
Can I go visit you occasionally?

850
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,820
Of course.

851
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,140
When you come,
come with both hands loaded down.

852
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,920
You know, right?

853
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:15,680
Oh, right.

854
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,240
I’ll eat it well!

855
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,300
When will I eat all of these?

856
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:36,840
I’ll eat them well.

857
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:38,880
Yeah, but...

858
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,760
If I eat all these,
won’t I become bread then?

859
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,580
How did you....?

860
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,580
Were you surprised?

861
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:03,560
Yes.

862
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,320
Today is Seo Jin's Memorial Day.

863
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,080
Ah.

864
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,580
I came to see you
before I go to see oppa.

865
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,560
Oh.

866
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,340
You’re doing well, right?

867
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,340
Yes.

868
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,940
Dad...

869
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,520
is healthy, right?

870
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,480
Of course.

871
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,740
Is Mother doing well?

872
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:33,480
Yes.

873
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,480
Ah.

874
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,280
I brought this to give you, but...

875
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,340
I can’t give it to you.

876
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,020
Are you okay?

877
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:16,980
Yes.

878
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,420
Oppa must be happy to see you come.

879
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,240
I came here by myself a few times.

880
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,740
Did you?

881
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,980
<i>[Yoon So Hae
1944.3.1 ~ 2017.11.6
Mother! Rest In Peace.
We love you.]</i>

882
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,000
<i>[Baek Seo Jin.
1998.6.3~ 2015.9.22
I love you, my son!
I will be at your side now and forever.]</i>

883
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,500
Oppa, hello.

884
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:08,940
Mother.

885
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,060
We have come.

886
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,500
I told you to change it a while ago.

887
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,120
Oh.

888
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,280
It is really nice.

889
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,360
But how do I use this?

890
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,460
I’ll have to stay up all night studying it.

891
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,960
Oh, right.

892
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:38,800
Mom.

893
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,800
I have to go to the library.

894
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:40,380
What?

895
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,740
I’ll be back later.

896
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,480
You. Yah…

897
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,320
Yah!

898
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,480
Mom, sorry.

899
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,940
Mom is…

900
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:49,700
Okay, bye!

901
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:51,640
Oh.

902
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,220
Aigoo.

903
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:54,540
Let’s go.

904
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:58,520
Oh.

905
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:13,840
Oh yes...

906
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,520
My children went over there and were rude…

907
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,740
No.

908
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:18,960
It was fun.

909
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,320
I didn’t tell them to do that.

910
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,000
Really.

911
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,800
I didn’t tell them to do that.

912
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:28,860
Yes.

913
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,000
I know.

914
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:31,820
However,

915
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,020
I don’t think we even know each other's name yet.

916
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,160
I am

917
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,840
Park Seung Woo.

918
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,380
I am

919
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,560
Hong Do Hee.

920
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:45,760
But,

921
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:46,540
I am

922
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,560
older than you, aren’t I?

923
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,780
Yes… well.

924
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:51,600
Probably.

925
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,020
You can just comfortably call me Noona.

926
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,080
What do you think of Do Hee Noona?

927
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:57,560
Ah...

928
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,060
That...

929
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,300
isn’t that good.

930
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,820
I’ll think about it.

931
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:05,340
Or

932
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,660
It's fine to call me Do Hee-sshi.

933
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,900
<i>1 year later</i>

934
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,600
Unnie.

935
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,260
I'm back!

936
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,680
Of course!

937
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,200
Of course, we should all gather.

938
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,320
Yes.

939
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,320
How much?

940
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,180
$10.

941
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,360
- Here you go.
- Mom! - Mom!

942
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:34,900
- Bye.
- Mom!

943
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,420
Mom! Mom!

944
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,280
Mom! Mom!

945
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:36,900
Mom.

946
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:38,800
What? What?

947
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,160
What happened now?

948
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,600
Mom, noona…

949
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,860
What about noona now?

950
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,500
I passed!

951
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,360
Good job! Good job!

952
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,160
Seo Yeon.

953
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,960
This is the place
where mom grew up.

954
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,260
This is the first time
I’m coming here.

955
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,420
Because I can come here with my Seo Yeon,

956
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,940
I'm so happy.

957
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,200
Living here, wasn’t it hard?

958
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,060
There were times like that.

959
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,800
But mom is fine now.

960
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,660
Because I’m with you.

961
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:22,540
Let's go.

962
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,340
Okay.

963
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:31,466
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies, Dongsaengs and Haraboji of Avengers Subbing Club"

964
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
“You pooped on my head,”

965
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,020
said the mole to the rabbit.

966
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,100
“No, I didn’t. Why would I?”

967
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,100
answered the rabbit.

968
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,850
“My poop looks like this.”

969
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:45,970
As he said that,

970
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:51,000
out fell the rabbit’s poop like 15 small black peas.

971
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:55,270
The mole said, “Aigoo.” And then the mole apologized.

972
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,050
“Next. You pooped on my head…”

973
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,250
There’s plenty of electric saws, but it’s always the hand saw.

974
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,210
Hey, now you’re even better at this than me.

975
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,180
How long do I have to just saw things?

976
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,180
Your foundation has to be solid.

977
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,930
Aish. I should have made a tile instead.

978
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,080
Would you like to have some tea?

979
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,440
No, I can’t. I can’t.
I have an engagement today.

980
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,100
I have to finish quickly and go.

981
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,440
Who are you meeting?

982
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,980
Friends who have a lot of money, are good looking and young.

983
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,980
They’re not men, are they?

984
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,450
There is a man as well.

985
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:44,410
Then I’m going to have go with you.

986
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,330
Aigoo.

987
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,740
This popularity of mine. Really.

988
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,120
Let’s go together for real.

989
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,820
I… Can’t we change it to a tile?

990
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,300
My arm feels like it’ll fall out. Huh?

991
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,060
Dad!

992
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:58,910
Son.

993
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:00,780
You’ve suffered a lot.

994
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,780
Dad.

995
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,220
Did you come to watch?

996
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,300
Tofu, you’re supposed eat some so you won’t go in again.

997
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,480
You bought the most expensive one, right?

998
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,360
Your studies are going well?

999
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,280
Since I lost a year trying to get revenge on someone,

1000
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,080
I should study diligently now.

1001
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,520
Is having to retake your test my fault, too?

1002
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,020
Then whose fault would it be?

1003
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,780
That’s right it’s my fault, you kid.

1004
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,780
This is a violent crime!

1005
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,530
A violent crime!

1006
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,410
Oh,

1007
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,410
I can’t go back in again.

1008
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,480
However,

1009
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,140
are you still in touch with that person?

1010
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:29,970
Oh!

1011
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,080
Omo!

1012
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,080
Jung Hye!

1013
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,220
Is this really our Jung Hye?!

1014
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:43,200
Jung Hye, did something happen?

1015
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,420
Whoa, madam.

1016
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,530
Doesn’t this suit me?

1017
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:52,480
So why did you want to meet here?

1018
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,560
I put one in my building.

1019
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,420
Put what?

1020
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,580
So, you’re saying that you ultimately made this?

1021
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,080
I couldn’t put one in my home.

1022
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,550
Of all my buildings, just this one floor was empty.

1023
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,590
This really is Jung Hye’s sauna.

1024
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,540
This is our Avengers Club exclusive sauna.

1025
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,760
Aahhh.

1026
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,340
If I get tired while I’m studying, I can just rest here.

1027
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,510
Aigoo.

1028
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,810
Son!

1029
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,450
My son!

1030
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,570
I gave her a job.

1031
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,150
We met coincidentally in Hawaii.

1032
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,380
Destiny.

1033
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,740
She had lost all her money at the casino

1034
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,370
and she had no money to even return…

1035
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,850
Since I’ve started working here, the customers are endless.

1036
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,440
You said that you got a job, and it was here?

1037
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,020
Son, I have something to give you.

1038
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,480
Follow me. Just a moment, a moment.

1039
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:49,900
<i>I’m coming.</i>

1040
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,500
<i>Hurry, hurry.</i>

1041
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:57,300
<i>Ah, you did a major thing. Good job. You did well.</i>

1042
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:00,460
Here, here.

1043
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,460
Sit here.

1044
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:05,240
Do you know how much your mother earned today?

1045
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,560
Why? Did you make some money?

1046
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,090
Look at this.

1047
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,240
This is all tips.

1048
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,990
Today, your mother, in the Frozen room, I sang to the kids;

1049
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:18,360
I yelled with them; my popularity was no joke.

1050
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,340
That’s right,

1051
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,310
see how great it is to work and earn money.

1052
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,540
You should have been living this way sooner.

1053
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,690
I got it. Spend it sparingly.

1054
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,230
Oh, there’s no need.

1055
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,900
What?

1056
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,170
Study hard.

1057
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:32,980
You can’t take the test a third time.

1058
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,980
Unfair.
You’re being unfair.

1059
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,820
Am I?

1060
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:39,020
Anyway, mom is going to have to go back to work.

1061
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:39,880
Elsa Unnie!

1062
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,610
Yes, I’m coming! You know, right? Bye!

1063
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:59,650
How long has it been?

1064
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,000
That’s right.

1065
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,660
Being here makes me think we should take more revenge.

1066
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,970
This time I think we are capable of doing anything.

1067
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,180
I do, too.

1068
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,520
Wait a moment.

1069
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,200
It’s been a while since we’ve been together.

1070
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,650
We should take a photo.

1071
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,860
Sounds good! I like it! Yes, let’s!

1072
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,150
Wait, let’s use my phone.

1073
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:16,280
Use this.

1074
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,700
I’m taking the photo.
I, 2, 3.

1075
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:28,180
Oh!

1076
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:31,650
Let’s take a look.

1077
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,750
It’s hard to tell where we are.

1078
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,820
Let’s ask someone to take the photo.

1079
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,790
Excuse me.  Do you mind taking a photo?

1080
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,690
Let’s say Avengers together.

1081
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,330
Avengers!

1082
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,330
<i>[Live focus can be used.]</i>

1083
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,700
Thank you.

1084
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,760
Thank you so much.

1085
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,760
Let’s look.

1086
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,230
I think he took the photo from too far away.

1087
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,170
It looks as if our faces can’t be seen that well, doesn’t it?

1088
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,830
Our faces look too small.

1089
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:10,340
Let me just adjust the photo.

1090
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:13,520
Wow.

1091
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,140
Wow.

1092
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:15,760
My phone had this functionality?

1093
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,050
Wow. It came out well.

1094
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,160
I need to study more.

1095
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,280
It’s because he spends time like that, that he has to retake his tests.

1096

Ohhh!

01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:35,850

1099
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,010
Unnie, send me the photo.

1100
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:39,950
Me, too, unnie.

1101
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,250
I’ll upload it onto the group room.

1102
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,000
<i>Let’s go!</i>

1103
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,800
<i>I told you to hurry up!</i>

1104
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,800
<i>I’m coming.</i>

1105
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,380
<i>Oh, that was nothing. Go ahead and keep talking.</i>

1107
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,570
Mom!

1108
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,770
Cheers!

1109
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:55,920
Fighting!

<i>Try hitting me, try hitting me.</i>

1111
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,070
A little more forcefully.

1112
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:09,960
Go ahead and sue me!

1113
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,960
How much is enough for Hong Do Unnie?

1114
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:12,930
How is it?

1115
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:13,850
It’s delicious.

1116
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,050
Assholes! I’m going to kill you all.

1117
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:22,720
Son of a…

1118
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,970
Oh, that’s not working here either.

1119
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:41,960
Geon Ah Group’s youngest daughter’s rival.

1120
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,500
How much is it?

1121
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:44,750
Definitely!

1122
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,720
There is something that I’ve been curious about.

1123
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,380
Where do you buy things like that?

1124
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:49,560
Cheers!

1125
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:50,520
Wow.

1126
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,480
Shall I tell you what we are going to do?

1127
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,180
Go.

1128
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:11,580
How is it?

1129
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:14,940
It’s delicious.

1130
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:21,950
Please enjoy the food.

1131
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:23,950
Be more sincere. Smile when you say it.

1132
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,950
Please enjoy the food.

1133
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:29,890
Oh?

1134
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,890
What are you doing here?

1135
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,980
Because of you,

1136
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,740
do I have to deal with that kind of woman?

1137
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:39,780
Remove her immediately.

1138
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,000
Ahhh…  It’s an NLA.

01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Neighborhood leftover ajusshi.

01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,200
Did you touch what’s mine?

1141
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,100
You have to have pride, Kim Jung Hye!

1142
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,480
What?

1143
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,810
B! J!

1144
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,270
Welcome.

1145
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:08,770
Are you the famous Avengers Club?

1146
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:09,620
Hmm?

1147
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,700
Someone stole our hard work and didn't credit us.
