Episode 11

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,720
Oppa is the one who wanted to go overseas to study?

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,720
Seo Yeon, go inside.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,100
Since he had failed science, dad was ashamed of him.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,740
So, you told him that he might as well go overseas to study.

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,520
Oppa said so much that he didn’t want to!

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,820
That he was afraid!
But, you forced him to go!

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,720
Yah, Baek Seo Yeon!

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,960
What do you think you know that
you rudely talk back to your father like this?!

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,480
Why?

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,460
Are you going to hit me, too?!

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,820
I wish I were dead as well!

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,660
You brat!

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,660
How dare you raise your hand to her?

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,120
You…

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,900
You…

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,480
are finished!

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,440
Pack your things, Seo Yeon.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,840
Ay!

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,240
What are you doing?!

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The reason that I endured you until now…

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,740
that since you were the father of our children…

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,380
that even if it’s a small thing,
at least you didn’t raise a hand to Seo Yeon.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,080
You saw her also.
That girl, she said wanted to die as well!

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,560
How must Seo Yeon have felt!

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,400
Because of protecting your reputation,
we couldn’t even send Seo Jin off properly.

28
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,400
And now, using even a dead child,
can you call yourself a dad?

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,140
How many times do I have to say this?!
I’m not doing this just for my own good!

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,980
For you and for Seo Yeon, for our family…!

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,820
You...

32
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,020
not even one time, have you ever done something for us.

33
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,780
Where are you going?

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,880
Stop right there!

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,660
I’ve returned.

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,200
You’re late today.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
I was playing over at Hee Soo’s before I came.

38
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,660
That person.

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,380
She happily accepted it, didn’t she?

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,360
It’s good that it happened anyway.

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,620
After she does the interview,
she’s going to leave immediately.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,520
Now I really will be able to live without seeing her.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,940
Before she leaves, perhaps just once…

44
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,220
I’m sick and tired of it.

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,660
Madam hasn’t changed your mind either, have you?

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,960
After that person’s interview goes out,

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,740
not even Geon Ah will be able to stop it.

48
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,360
Yes.

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,140
If that happens,

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,820
then not even Grandfather will be able to hold onto Madam.

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,680
I don’t want to.

52
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,620
I will not eat them.

53
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,040
Then, I guess I’ll have to eat them all.

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,820
I will eat them.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,980
Thank you.

56
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,700
Child.

57
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,900
You are pretty.

58
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
You are nice.

59
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,440
My pretty baby.

60
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Grandmother.

61
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,540
Even to Seo Yeon?!

62
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,280
Yah…

63
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,660
That person. It’s really the end for him.

64
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,020
The end! There is just no way to improve him.

65
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,660
Son of a…!
Just kill him!

66
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,080
Oh!

67
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,600
That’s why… I hit him.

68
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,700
Y-y...

69
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,040
You hit that person?

70
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,960
Yes.

71
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,360
What that person did to Seo Yeon,
I returned the same to him.

72
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,640
You should have returned everything
that you had received from him till now as well!

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,740
I said let’s kill him!

74
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,280
Please calm down a little!

75
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,800
So, is Seo Yeon okay?

76
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,140
She was very shocked, but

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,920
she’s doing fine with grandmother now.

78
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,600
I should have hit him as well.

79
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,740
You? Why?

80
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,500
Father is trying to get rid of Madam and me from this land.

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,180
What?

82
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,840
But, how?

83
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,940
He says he’s sending us overseas.

84
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,900
He told this child to pick a school,

85
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,380
and he told me to pick a house.

86
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,580
Ah!

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
Ah, those persons.

88
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,080
The two of them, even came by my store,
but they were both acting so stupidly…

89
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,900
So, what are you going to do?

90
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,400
I’ve asked everyone I can for help, but...

91
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,060
I am still feeling troubled.

92
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,200
Mi Sook, what about you?

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,440
For me, for the time being, I can just stay with mother-in-law at the hospital.

94
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,440
However, the situation for the two of you is more urgent.

95
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,440
You don’t even know when he’ll put you on the plane.

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,480
No!

97
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,380
Before that happens,
shouldn’t we just send him off first?

98
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,860
Send who off?

99
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Lee Byung Soo, of course!

100
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,280
That’s right!

101
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,140
Why should we go?

102
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,160
Yes…

103
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,700
We should send him off, that human being.

104
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,500
I like it.

105
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,320
But, how?

106
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,520
The person who can send Lee Byung Soo off,

107
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,760
there is just one person who can do that.

108
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,020
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

109
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,040
Grandfather.

110
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,780
Ah, the Chairman?

111
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,920
The Chairman will make Jung Hye’s husband back off?

112
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,960
- That’s exactly it!
- That’s exactly it!

113
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,540
Then, this time as well, Jung Hye...

114
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,740
you’ll have to come up with a fantastic idea, won’t you?

115
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,400
This time, it’s going to be even cooler.

116
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,920
Fighting!

117
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,580
<i>[Haerang Construction, Public Announcements]</i>

118
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,020
<i>[Haerang Construction 52nd Regular Board Meeting]</i>

119
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,020
What is it?

120
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,140
Do you have something to say to me?

121
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,560
You just have to sign.

122
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,680
Just as you’ve always done.

123
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,260
Thank you.

124
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,740
This is the first time I’ve seen her, too.

125
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,860
They say that she doesn’t know how to do anything.

126
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,340
Oh.

127
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,680
Isn’t that the elder daughter-in-law?

128
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,940
She never gets involved in company business.

129
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,060
That is true.

130
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,800
Really.

131
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,220
Why are you here?

132
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,100
From now on, I’ve decided to take on
all my responsibilities as a shareholder.

133
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,860
It looks good (<i>to have her here</i>), Father.

134
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,866
Hyung, you must feel supported.

135
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,340
Oh.

136
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,940
I asked her to come.

137
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,960
She should have some interest in the business now after all.

138
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,460
You took my proxy yesterday.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let’s get started.

140
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,340
The business meeting for the proposed 2018 project
of the Shanghai Shopping Center in China

141
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,160
is arranged for tomorrow.

142
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
Is that for certain?

143
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,420
I thought that Hosan Construction had the inside line on that project.

144
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,380
The proposal that we submitted with Geon Ah Group

145
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,880
is certainly looking attractive to the buyers on that side.

146
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,660
Because that side had been working with Geon Ah for a long time already,

147
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,780
Geon Ah was the one who brought us in.

148
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,360
I think that I should take charge…

149
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,080
I have!

150
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,000
…already prepared everything.

151
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Then, I will take part also.

152
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,320
Yes.

153
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,280
I will make sure it goes off without a hitch.

154
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,820
However,

155
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,380
where is the location of the meeting?

156
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,280
We appreciate you taking interest in the company.

157
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,320
Going forward, I’ll take a greater interest.

158
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,840
Since this is the first time that
I’ve seen this side of you in 10 years,

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,180
I was a little surprised.

160
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,840
Did you have something that concerned you?

161
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,700
As father-in-law also knows,
this person is much lacking.

162
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,700
From now on,
I didn’t think that I should just stay still.

163
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,400
Hey!

164
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,660
This person, so embarrassing!

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,500
Father, I will take care of everything.

166
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,120
Just take care of yourself.

167
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,500
Those buyers, they’re reputed to be unbelievably proper and inflexible.

168
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Are you sure you’ll be okay?

169
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,600
I know.
That they abhor any time-wasting.

170
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,760
I’ve checked everything already.

171
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,000
Can I really trust you this time?

172
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,600
Yes.

173
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,800
Because they said that their schedule was tight,
and they wanted to meet in the morning,

174
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,440
I also will spend the night at the hotel,
so that I can be there first thing in the morning.

175
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,220
This time, I’m really certain.

176
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,800
Please believe me, Father.

177
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,980
This is your final chance.

178
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,060
Why did you really come?

179
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,360
I had something to talk about with brother-in-law and…

180
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:19,900
Why?

181
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,340
Were you going to give him your shares?

182
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,360
We’ll see.

183
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,180
Really, that person…

184
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,620
Aigoo!

185
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,780
So,

186
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,700
you’re saying that your husband meeting that Chinese person

187
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,500
is a very important thing, right?

188
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,820
If that is messed up,

189
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,380
then the Chairman to Jung Hye’s husband…

190
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,400
Will completely kick him out.

191
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,940
Game over.

192
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,040
Then we’ll have to do everything we can,
so that he doesn’t meet them.

193
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,200
Let’s get to work.

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How do we mess it up?

195
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,820
Since he said that he’s sleeping at the hotel tonight…

196
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,820
We have to upend it tonight!

197
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,300
Ah!

198
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,160
How about this?

199
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,540
Sister-in-law has left the house?

200
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,500
Why?

201
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Someone was hit.

202
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,840
You hit her?

203
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,180
I was hit. I was.

204
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,560
Oh…

205
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,840
Oh…

206
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,400
Oh, what did you do that sister-in-law would use violence…

207
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,480
Oh, I can’t believe that…

208
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,540
Sister-in-law looks like such a refined person.

209
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,440
That was the first time I knew of it as well, that she had that side to her.

210
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,600
She’ll return soon.

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,180
Keep up your strength, Sunbae.

212
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,700
The reception to the interview was good.

213
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,020
So, if you keep going this way to the election, totally smooth…

214
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,060
How are you doing?

215
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,380
Apparently, the child’s birth mother came to the office
and raised a ruckus and everything?

216
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,400
Oh… trying to take care of that,
I had a really hard time.

217
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,080
The Chairman must have been really angry.

218
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,220
This time, I’m going to get him to release all of his anger at me in one shot.

219
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,900
Tomorrow, there is going to be a major meeting with a buyer.

220
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,320
Oh, at least we have to do well.

221
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,720
How could things get so bad for Sang Man…

222
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,320
I don’t know how he’s doing these days.

223
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,880
He said he was going to try to form an organization or something.

224
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,780
That Avengers Club or whatever,

225
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,140
doesn’t it seem as if we shouldn’t just ridicule it?

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,320
Oh, that’s because Hong Sunbae did some wrong things.

227
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,920
What could ajummas really do,
even if they try?

228
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,280
I’m just going to have this, then I’ll get up.

229
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,280
Since I have to prepare for the meeting tomorrow morning.

230
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:50,500
[A special gift from the ASC family.]

231
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,380
Good. Good. Good.

232
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,880
Oh!

233
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,940
Well done, Secretary Joo.

234
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,600
Oh!

235
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,820
It’s good.

236
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,380
You’re good looking!

237
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,580
Hello.

238
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,580
Hello.

You are an amazing person.

243
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,640
Oh.

244
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,020
Oh, I’m so sleepy.

245
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,460
Ah, alarm.

246
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,740
All finished.

247
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,340
Okay.

248
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,440
Shh!

249
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,780
Yah, this. In here.

250
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,300
What is this?

251
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,760
The final item.

252
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,580
What about that thing?

253
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,660
In the bag.

254
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,800
Okay.

255
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,900
- Done?
- Done.

256
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,040
- Done?
- Done.

257
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,840
Done?

258
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,940
Everything done.

259
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,360
Gown? Gown? Gown?

260
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,280
Pack everything else.

261
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,260
Ah!

262
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,520
Cold!

263
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,340
Cold!

264
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,120
Cold!

265
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,020
Oh.

266
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,300
I’m so…

267
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,100
Hong Do Unnie?

268
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,100
Where did Hong Do Unnie go?

269
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,940
Gown!

270
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,100
Unnie, why are you there?

271
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
Just a second!

272
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,820
Oh.

273
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,440
Oh.

274
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,440
Oh.

275
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,180
Oh.

276
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,960
What is it?

277
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,000
What did you say?

278
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,020
What are you talking about?
It’s not even 7 am yet.

279
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,480
What?!

280
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,680
What time?!

281
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,920
Huh?

282
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,060
Why isn’t this working?

283
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,460
What?

284
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,640
What is it? This?

285
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,620
Aish!

286
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,000
This is a big problem. Big problem! Big problem!

287
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,160
How did this happen? I can’t be late!

288
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,920
Huh?

289
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,680
My clothes?

290
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Where did my clothes go?

291
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,300
My clothes…

Sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry.

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,040
Father, I’m really sorry. What the situation is…

Honey! How could you leave without me?

Oh! Omo, father-in-law, we meet like this. I’m so happy to see you.

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,720
- No. Father. No, no…
- What is this smell?

- Do something! Quickly!
- Oh, wait! Mr. Chow! Mr. Chow! Mr. Chow!

Oh, just stay like that. Stay like that.

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,880
Oh, what are you doing?!

343
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,110
- Jah, you have to do it like this in order for it to be relaxing.
- Ah!

00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,160
Ah! Ah!

345
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,000
Ah! What you are you doing?

346
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,580
- What are you doing? Ah!
- Don’t scream.

347
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,640
- You’ll dislocate your chin.
- There is something else that you will have to do.

348
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,830
- What is this?! It was you? Ow! Ow!
- Do you want to do it or not?

349
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,530
- Stop this!
- Answer me first.

350
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,200
You have to let me up so that I can speak. Ow!

351
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,680
Ow!

352
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Ow!

353
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,040
Aw..

354
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,040
Aw.. it hurts so much.

355
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,950
Who is this? Who is this woman?

356
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,700
I’m Jung Hye’s sister. What of it?

357
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,133
So, will you do it or not?

358
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,520
So. So, I don’t know what it is, but you’ll have to give me more money for it.

359
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,440
Ah... No...

Hurry up and pay me.

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
- Let’s do the calculation after you’ve done the interview.
- Ay!

364
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,340
Try acting properly for once.

365
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,000
But, what in the world is this picture?

366
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
There are a lot of eyes watching, so why don’t you leave?

367
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,320
Oh, I’m so scared.

368
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,760
Here, the room service is not that great. Please tell them for me?

369
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,280
I’ll see you later. Bye!

370
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,250
Then shall we go and debrief?

371
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,710
Shall we go?

372
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,710
Let’s go. Let’s go.

373
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,580
You trusted such a big business deal to General Manager Lee.

374
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,120
Chairman, you must still have had
some expectations left of General Manager Lee.

375
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,300
Well, it was some business that General Manager Lee
had been in charge of from the beginning.

376
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,000
When doing business, things can happen
that one didn’t intend to happen.

377
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,433
I had thought that the Chairman
was someone who got things done.

378
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,980
However, I seem to have seen you wrong.

379
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,560
What does that mean?

380
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,500
Just because a grandson appeared, you’re giving
General Manager Lee chances beyond reason right now.

381
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,200
In today’s world,

382
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,880
a son, a son…

383
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,670
Isn’t everyone like that?

384
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,133
Even accomplished President Kim 

385
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,233
would probably find it difficult to become the successor to the Geon Ah Group.

386
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,280
That company whose meeting was messed up is also an important partner of ours,

387
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,320
if you take care of business like this,
it makes us who introduced them to you also look bad.

388
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,320
That was unfortunate.

389
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,060
- To Chairman Kim, I will separately…
- I..

390
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,060
have already told my father.

391
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,520
That our relationship
with Hae Rang has to be reconsidered.

392
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,800
I will directly see him and speak with him.

393
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,160
With this, we can definitely send him off, right?

394
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,000
Since grandfather saw, it’s finished.

395
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,490
You saw the chairman’s face.

396
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,520
The mission this time was completely to my taste.

397
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,970
Avengers Club!

398
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,960
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

399
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,020
I’m home!

400
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,700
Hee Soo!

401
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,860
Hello.

402
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,910
Here!

403
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,490
All of these?

404
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,390
Shall I help you?

405
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,140
Don’t do it.

406
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,370
I’ll help you.

407
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,010
Yes.

408
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,133
Ramen needs green onions.

409
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,100
Should I put another one in?

410
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,000
What?

411
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,370
Why?

412
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,360
Come stay here. You can’t just continue to stay at the hospital.

413
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,133
Hee Soo and Hee Kyung will be uncomfortable, too.

414
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,760
No. Hee Kyung said she was going to go to Noryangjin soon.
(T/N - Noryangjin is an area of Seoul famous for studying)

415
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,633
Since there will be an empty room, bring Seo Yeon and come stay here.

416
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,366
I’ll talk it over with Seo Yeon.

417
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,500
Mi Sook, think about it carefully.

418
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,520
When you first came to the Avengers Club, 

419
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,933
you said that you were enduring it for Seo Yeon’s sake.

420
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,133
But, look. 

421
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:23,130
Seo Yeon is getting hurt, too.

422
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,920
So, I’m very sorry to Seo Yeon.

423
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,490
The way you feel, now Seo Yeon will understand it as well.

424
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,370
If there is anything that unnie can help you with,
just tell me whatever and whenever. Okay?

425
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,710
Please eat the ramen!

426
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,650
Let's go eat ramen.

427
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,430
Let’s eat.

428
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,820
Let’s eat. Let’s eat. Let’s eat.

429
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
I will eat well.

430
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,240
What’s so special about this? All ramen are pretty.

431
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,440
It is delicious anyway.

432
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,800
Oh, Jung Hye, you’re going to burn yourself.
You’ll burn. Burn. Oh!

433
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,966
He can make more… oh, your hair… oh. 

434
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,860
Put some more water on the stove. Oh.

435
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,640
- Wow, that’s a total sweet potato, sweet potato.
- Yes. (T/N - sweet potato is a euphemism for something very frustrating)

436
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,550
What is that?

437
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,000
What a sweet potato is…

438
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,890
Here are some sweet potatoes! Here.

439
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,400
It’s about time for the cider to come out.
(T/N - cider is a euphemism for something refreshing or cleansing)

440
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,370
Hee Soo, there some cider in the refrigerator.

441
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,320
Why do you keep laughing?

442
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,300
Cider tastes best after one has eaten a sweet potato.

443
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,910
I’ll get you some cider.

444
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,380
What is he saying?

445
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,040
He must have had a bite go down the wrong way.

446
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,210
Oh, this has been really fun these days.

447
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,400
Definitely, there has to be a proper slap.

448
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,620
Sister-in-law? Isn’t she coming home today either?

449
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,750
Just drink.

450
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,400
B.J. I should really do something about them.
I can't stand it any more.

451
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,520
BJ? What now?

452
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,460
Do you know what I suffered today?

453
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,490
You suffered, too?

454
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,200
Father and the clients were all waiting,

455
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,960
but in the morning as I was trying to leave,

456
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,320
the clothes were all gone,
all the telephone lines were disconnected.

457
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,920
The only clothes that were there, the smell was….

458
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,840
Ow..

459
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,400
What the hell happened? Did you get any evidence?

460
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,320
The hotel clerks say that the CCTV is not allowed to be viewed.

461
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,270
However, there was no need to see them.

462
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,190
They left signs that they were “BJ” everywhere.

463
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,510
Now they have nothing to be afraid of,

464
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,380
and their skills are evolving.

465
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,080
Why on earth are they doing this to us?

466
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,540
When did things go so wrong?

467
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,980
Anyway, because of them,

468
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,850
I'm about to be kicked completely OUT by father.

469
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,680
He told me to never even step near the company.

470
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,880
Aw, I'm really going crazy.

471
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,790
I'm going crazy, too.

472
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,360
Mom, shall we meet directly at the market tomorrow?

473
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,220
Yes. I will be there buying groceries,
so come there quickly after school.

474
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,970
After mom and I prepare everything,

475
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,970
let's call noona just when the ceremony begins.

476
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:43,120
Yes. She is almost living in the library these days.

477
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,280
- Mom,
- What?

478
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,110
are you not meeting your friend these days?

479
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,980
My friends just left a little while ago.

480
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,720
No, that time when you were in front of the house...

481
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:52,960
Um?

482
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,170
No.

483
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,640
Good night.

484
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,800
Hey!

485
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,520
Get out.

486
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,830
Was it fun?

487
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,080
Yes. It was really worth watching.

488
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,470
Wow, now you just have nothing to be cautious about, do you?

489
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,040
If you're drunk, just go to bed quietly.

490
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,120
- How dare you come here making a fuss?
- You..

491
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,730
Did you take your property back to do these kinds of things?

492
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,560
BJ!  Do you think I will just leave you alone?

493
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,950
- And, if you don't?
- Uh?

494
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,980
You guys disturbed three people already!

495
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,040
I don't know what you're talking about,
but first bring some evidence.

496
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,180
I, who was victimized,… We are the evidence!

497
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,800
Stop doing silly things and just pack your bags!

498
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,000
Sh.. You son of b...

499
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,810
Oh no! I can't.

500
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,880
It's an examinee's room, why don't you knock?

501
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,520
Whatever. Just unlock this quickly.

502
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,880
How would I know father’s pattern?

503
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,580
If you don't know, then who would know?

504
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,550
I feel unfairly treated.

505
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,590
Oww. OK. Just do something.

506
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,210
It will be └  or ┐ .

507
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,350
It was ┐.

508
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,160
Oww..

509
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:34,240
You.. really..

510
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,280
You… that… I know all about you doing
weird things hanging out with the ajummas!

511
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,310
Stop it while I'm still telling you nicely, ok?

512
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,800
What are you talking about?

513
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,620
I need to study. Please get out.

514
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,160
Aigoo, this!

515
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,690
I clearly warned you.

516
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,740
What is it?

517
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,230
What? She’s at the hotel?

518
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,230
Yes. But the reservation was made in madam’s name.

519
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,340
What? Right now...

520
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,970
Just leave it as it is for now.

521
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,030
These people...

522
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,520
Lee Byung Soo is trying to send
that child and me abroad.

523
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,640
So?

524
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,960
I heard father has given his permission.

525
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,200
Does father pay any attention to you wherever you are?

526
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,570
It’s just that General Manager Lee pushed for it,

527
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,670
and Jung Joon also joined in asking for it,

528
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,380
so that’s why he did it.

529
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,890
I will not leave.

530
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,920
Is there anything you can do as you want to?

531
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,030
I will make it happen as I want it to.

532
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,540
Anyway the decision will be made by General Manager Lee.

533
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,130
He always did after all?

534
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,170
I'm going to throw away Lee Byung Soo.

535
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,560
Will that be accepted by the two families?

536
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,440
That's why I suggested a deal to you.

537
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,820
Are you asking me to stand on your side?

538
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,300
The stock shares that I have

539
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,330
isn't that what you need the most?

540
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,740
Oh! We meet again here.

541
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,620
- Ah. We meet again.
- Yes, we are.

542
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,280
He is my son.

543
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,410
Ah, is he? He is good looking.

544
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,790
Are you going home?

545
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,830
Ah, yes.

546
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,320
Your packages look heavy,
I will drive you to your home.

547
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,760
I brought my car.

548
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,650
We're ok.

549
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,990
Then...

550
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,520
Ah, does your knife work well?

551
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,140
Ah, yes, yes.

552
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,230
That's good.

553
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,440
You're the first person who ever came to me to sharpen a knife.

554
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,560
- I will see you again.
- Yes.

555
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,440
Let's go.

556
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,430
I told you to come after you finish your studies,
why did you come so early?

557
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,680
I myself should cook the greens father liked.

558
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,160
- Uh, aigoo. Where is my head?
- Why?

559
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,030
Did you not get something?

560
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,720
I didn't buy the bracken.

561
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,720
That..

562
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,120
is what father likes the most.

563
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,800
Why is he being like that?

564
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,720
Your father did indeed love bracken a lot.

565
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,740
Come to think of it, these days,

566
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:09,560
he would start to say something then stop,
start to say something then stop.

567
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,960
- Mom, by any chance...
- What?

568
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,170
- Son.
- Yes?

569
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,390
Hee Soo.

570
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,660
It's not like that.

571
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,760
That ajusshi a while ago, did you think he was my boyfriend?

572
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,400
I also saw him drive you home before.

573
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,930
Ah, at that time, I just…

574
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,500
I just went to him to sharpen a knife, and it was raining…

575
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,330
Anyway, it's not like what you're thinking.

576
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,060
He is just a carpenter, a carpenter.

577
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,210
For me, it’s because mom didn’t tell me anything,

578
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:09,230
that was what made me sad.
For me, it’s because mom didn’t tell me anything,

579
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,460
that was what made me sad.

580
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,820
And, I can't yet imagine a man who isn't my dad standing beside you.

581
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,380
Aigoo. Aigoo, my son.

582
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,120
If I did have a boyfriend, I would first ask you to check him out.

583
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,770
Let's quickly get things ready.

584
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,500
Noona will ruin it all.

585
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,000
Yes yes.

586
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,290
You have to help in order to make things properly.

587
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,280
Yes, Seo Yeon. I'm packing the luggage at home right now so that I can go.

588
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,080
Yes. I’ll go now.

589
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,400
Yeobo.

590
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,180
Let go.

591
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,280
I did wrong, so stop doing this
and come back home with Seo Yeon.

592
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,490
The elections are going to be soon.
And, tomorrow, we have a couple meeting.

593
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,160
Stop it.

594
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,760
What?

595
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,440
The election, stop it.

596
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,980
You are not qualified.

597
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,110
You made our Seo Jin like that.

598
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,380
And not only me, but also you did it to Seo Yeon.

599
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,270
And you're making it harder on mother now.

600
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,170
If I become the Superintendent of Education,
everything will be fine,

601
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,500
but you can't even endure it just a few more days?!

602
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,800
I have no more reason to endure it any longer.

603
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,200
Hey!

604
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,920
At that time, I did something that I was apologetic for,

605
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,490
so I was going to treat you once.

606
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,620
However, sister-in-law called me first even. I feel happy.

607
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,700
I heard you met my father?

608
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,630
To ask him to send Jung Hye
and the child abroad?

609
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,860
Ah, sister-in-law, you also saw the rumor tabloid, right?

610
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,950
Aigoo. It was so hard to block that.

611
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,440
I don’t know how father-in-law knew about it,
but he was also very concerned.

612
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,640
General Manager Lee was the one who told him,
weren’t you?

613
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,250
Maybe because the kid was born and raised in the countryside,

614
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,440
he just wasn’t able to become accustomed to things.

615
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,730
So if he can broaden his horizons at a foreign university,

616
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,910
it would be good for him.

617
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,640
Then, sending just the child should be enough.

618
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:31,550
Aiooo. Definitely, the mother should take care of him.

619
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,930
Anyway, she has nothing to do here.

620
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,520
You're working hard, General Manager Lee.

621
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,490
If you get rid of the two of them,
do you think anything will be changed?

622
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,800
What are you talking about?
It's for the sake of those two people.

623
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,760
I will discuss it again with my father.

624
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,490
There’s no need to rush, right?

625
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,320
Sister-in-law seemed to be a little strange.

626
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,180
I thought she would be the happiest one
if my wife were gone.

627
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,600
Haha...

628
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,040
Of course I have to continue to do it.

629
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,220
Anyway, Father-in-law doesn't care about my wife at all.

630
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,020
Are you going somewhere?

631
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,680
I am asking you.

632
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,640
When did you start to have such interest in me?

633
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,500
Depart.

634
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,680
Tsk.

635
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,240
Today's concept is

636
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,780
sorrowful mistress style.

637
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,200
It should be photogenic, don’t you think?

638
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,340
The interview material…

639
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,720
you have memorized it, haven’t you?

640
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,360
Ow, how many times do have I said it?

641
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,960
19 years old Han Soo Ji first met 20 years old Lee Byung Soo

642
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,520
And the two of them were together for one night.

643
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,560
In the situation of finding out that I was pregnant,
I was dumped by the asshole.

644
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,060
And I gave birth to the child by myself.

645
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,840
Then I myself dumped the child.

646
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,580
Ah... ah..

647
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,340
Ah...

648
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,460
The most important thing is what comes after that.

649
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,380
I was going to say that...

650
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,440
Impatient, impatient.

651
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
You are too impatient.

652
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,820
Lee Byung Soo wouldn't recognize
the existence of the child for all of these 18 years.

653
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,520
Then in order to become the successor,

654
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,280
he brought the child home.

655
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,020
But now he thinks the child is annoying,

656
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,320
so he is dumping the child again.

657
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,320
That’s right, isn’t it?

658
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,160
Any questions regarding Soo Gyum, don't answer them.

659
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,100
Ah... I know it.

660
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,440
How many times do I have to say it?

661
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,120
Now, let’s go.

662
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,080
Are you getting used to living there?

663
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,120
Better than staying at home.

664
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,680
There’s no need to look at me like that.

665
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,740
What did I do?

666
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,720
Since I like it a lot better now.

667
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,460
You had asked before me
whether I really hate my mom, right?

668
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,460
I did.

669
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,060
That the reason mom was enduring everything was because of me.

670
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,080
That was what I hated.

671
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,080
If it was truly for me,

672
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,360
then that wasn’t it.

673
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,080
Yes.

674
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,680
I think I get what you mean.

675
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,960
Hae Rang Construction General Manager Lee Byung Soo

676
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,780
I first met him when I was 19 years old.

677
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,260
It was love at first sight.

678
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,880
So, we became passionate lovers.

679
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,620
And, I became pregnant.

680
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,540
But once he found out about my pregnancy,

681
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,200
that person suddenly started to change.

682
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,280
I told you not to come.

683
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,780
How can I take it easy?

684
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,320
Who knows what useless thing
she is going to do?

685
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,560
The article will be released tomorrow morning.

686
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,040
And, Han Soo Ji will leave before that.

687
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,040
That's great.

688
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,680
After the article is published,

689
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,600
Father will be busy taking care of his mess.

690
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,740
And, Madam can carry on with your plan.

691
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,020
I have agreed to make a deal with
President Kim Jung Yoon.

692
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,340
A deal?

693
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,480
Like the one she made with me?

694
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,900
For the price of giving her my shares,

695
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,680
she agreed to stand my side to help me.

696
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,300
You didn’t have to do that.

697
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,900
Grandfather.

698
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,140
My "ankle".

699
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,920
I'll let you " grab" it.

700
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:33,880
What?

701
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,460
It looks as if you have a request.

702
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,700
Please let go of Madam.

703
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,420
I will let you “grab my ankle”.

704
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,100
But instead,

705
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,680
please let Madam go.

706
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,800
You don't have to do this.

707
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,500
This is also my revenge.

708
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,580
You must definitely leave this home.

709
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,680
For revenge?

710
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,440
For yourself.

711
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,620
Get out, and live a free life.

712
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,080

Come on in, Seo Yeon. We welcome you.

896
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,360
I’m really sorry about coming so late at night, unnie.

897
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,880
Welcome to Hong Do house!

898
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,820
Me, too!

899
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,280
Come in, come in.

900
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,080
Oh, Seo Yeon, you remember me, your teacher?

901
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,220
Actually, I’m no longer a teacher.

902
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,780
Just call me unnie.

903
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,660
Come sleep in my room with me.

904
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,600
Please make yourself at home.

905
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,600
Ok, ok…

906
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,660
Come on in.

907
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,460
Thank you, unnie.

908
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,600
For what?

909
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,520
Make yourself comfortable.

910
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,660
Just give me $300. $300.

911
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,540
Why?

912
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,200
Are you unable to fall asleep?

913
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,660
Just because.

914
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,760
Earlier I wasn’t able to thank you properly.

915
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,680
You helped my noona beat the false charges.

916
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,680
Oh, that.

917
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,400
Soo Gyum sunbae told me to do that.

918
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,220
Regardless, thank you.

919
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,040
I’m sorry.

920
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,320
Huh?

921
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:30,460
That time you got hurt, I saw it happen.

922
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,720
Aaahhhh!

923
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,480
I heard from Soo Gyum hyung,

924
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,400
that if it hadn’t been him then you would have helped.

925
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:41,780
Sunbae really talks a lot.

926
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,740
It can get cold here so make sure to tuck in your blankets when you sleep.

927
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:55,980
Sleep well.

928
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,480
Are you sure it really will be okay?

929
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,980
I think this is the only way to get him to stop.

930
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,620
I’m worried that the situation might get harder for you.

931
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,820
After you reveal all the hurt that you had.

932
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,800
Once you’ve revealed all of your scars,

933
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,200
anyone and everyone

934
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,360
will be running around saying whatever they want about you.

935
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,820
I have Seo Yeon

936
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:31,460
and the Avengers Club.

937
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:35,960
That’s true,

938
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,160
you have us.

939
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:44,000
Sleep well.

940
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,220
Unnie, too.

941
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,380
Mi Sook’s plan is going well?

942
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,800
Yes, everything has been definitely set.

943
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:08,160
However, Jung Hye, the article…

944
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,280
I think my father has interfered with it.

945
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,380
We think he stopped the article somehow.

946
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,540
If he blocked it then we should unblock it.

947
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,280
Should we do the interview again?

948
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,480
The contact has been severed.

949
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,760
Hold on a moment.

950
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:22,980
The interview has been posted.

951
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,720
What?

952
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,760
<i>That child was my entire life.</i>

953
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:38,640
<i>At the early age of 20, I gave birth to him by myself, and raised my son with difficulty.</i>

954
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,975
<i>It wasn’t enough that he was taken from me in one morning,</i>

955
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:44,775
<i>I was even threatened and told to leave the country.</i>

956
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,280
That crazy…

957
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,350
<i>I am up against the elder daughter-in-law of the Haerang Construction</i>

958
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:59,750
<i>who everyone knows is the youngest daughter of the Geon Ah Group.</i>

959
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:03,370
<i>I was so scared.</i>

960
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:09,950
<i>Because I’m such a powerless and weak mother,</i>

961
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:12,920
<i>my son, I’m sorry.</i>

962
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:19,050
Lee Byung Soo, I’m not going to let you get away with this.

963
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,700
Okay, that witch…

964
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,900
let’s go grab that woman.

965
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,400
Let’s go together.

966
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:27,220
Let’s go. I think I know where she is.

967
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:29,220
I’m going to leave first.

968
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,050
Yes, this is she.

969
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,120
My mother’s hospital?

970
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,850
<i>Is everything Han Soo Ji said all true?</i>

971
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:47,000
<i>Is it true you threatened her financially?</i>

972
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,070
<i>Is this something that Geon Ah Group and Haerang Construction already knew also?</i>

973
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:50,370
<i>Did Geon Ah tell you to do it?</i>

974
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,400
<i>- Please say a word.
- Is it true?</i>

975
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,850
<i>What do you say to the allegations? Do you acknowledge it? Please say something.</i>

976
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:01,550
While changing the sheets on the bed, I found this.

977
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,270
Yes, thank you.

978
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:07,970
What is it?

979
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:17,650
What is this?

980
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,370
Th-th-thiis is that? Right?

981
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,920
Yes. I think it is.

982
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,550
Wow. This is daebak.

983
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,900
Outside, there seemed to be quite a commotion.

984
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,970
You, how far do you want to take this?

985
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,050
You??

986
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:03,050
Where did you hide that woman?

987
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,520
I packed up the larger items.

988
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,800
Who said we were going?

989
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,800
What’s your reason for doing this?

990
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,800
I already told you.

991
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,750
Soo Gyum will go and get a good education, and you will be able to live freely.

992
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:18,800
This is good for everyone.

993
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,970
Do you think you’ll get your way?

994
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,820
Right now, father-in-law and my father are both in an uproar.

995
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,750
To get rid of you immediately.

996
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:31,870
So, get a grasp of the situation, and prepare yourself quickly.

997
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,900
Ow!

998
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:38,070
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

999
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:40,720
The person you are makes me sick.

1000
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,150
What about me? You think I like this?

1001
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:44,220
I regret all the time I spent enduring you!

1002
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,600
Do you think you were the only one who had to endure it?!

1003
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,570
In order to try to live with you, I had to put in so much effort!

1004
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:49,520
Effort?

1005
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,970
Are you a human being even capable of that?

1006
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,020
What makes you think you can act this way?

1007
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,820
Back then you told me that I was nothing, didn’t you?

1008
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,920
Then what about you?

1009
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,620
Illegitimate daughter of Geon Ah Group,

1010
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,300
daughter-in-law of Haerang Group,

1011
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,620
wife of Lee Byung Soo!

1012
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:08,150
Of those things, what do you think you were able to get on your own merits?

1013
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:10,670
That’s why I’ve decided to live differently this time.

1014
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:15,750
Why?

1015
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:19,020
You want to try a divorce?

1016
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:21,020
What a shame.

1017
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:24,070
That should have come out of my mouth first.

1018
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:25,820
Let me say it again then.

1019
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,820
Lee Byung Soo,

1020
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,820
I won’t live with you any longer.

1021
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,820
Let’s divorce.

1022
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:37,520
You don’t know your place.

1023
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,950
Divorce?

1024
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:41,220
Listen carefully.

1025
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,920
If you end it with me, you are nothing.

1026
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,350
What remains of you without me?

1027
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,520
It would leave me.

1028
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,570
And what are you?

1029
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:51,970
I…

1030
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,600
am Kim Jung Hye.

1031
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:15,550
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and Dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club"

1032
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,750
Preview

1033
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,200
If it ends this way, we’re all dead.

1034
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,100
Is there no way?

1035
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,150
We need to stop them.

1036
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:30,800
How?

1037
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,800
My wife, because of that shock,

1038
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,500
right now is being treated with powerful psychiatric drugs.

1039
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,520
Now there is no longer anything to hide or lie about.

1040
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,950
We can live the way we want.

1041
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:43,070
Now, no matter what those women say, no one will believe them.

1042
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:46,020
I will now show you an exclusive.

1043
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,420
Avengers Club.  Do you think that it will happen as you want it to?

1044
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,500
Now, there is nothing to be afraid of and nothing that I won’t be able to do.

1045
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,750
Let’s talk separately.

1046
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:53,800
You,

1047
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,620
I told you I wouldn’t leave you alone.
