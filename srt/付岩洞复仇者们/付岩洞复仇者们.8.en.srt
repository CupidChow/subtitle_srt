EPISODE 8

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,880
Who could it be?

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,960
He says that he knows what we’ve done.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,840
In that case…

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,320
Husband?

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,320
There has been something that worried me a bit.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,700
Yeobo, what are you doing?

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,520
Oh.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
I’ll throw it away.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,800
Oh, it’s nothing.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,080
You mean, you just left that in the house?

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,820
Because it wasn’t the day to take the recycling out yet.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,460
Ohhh

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,840
However,

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,540
would a gentleman who has been a professor take the time to cut and glue this together?

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,800
I don’t think that he would do something like this…

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,640
If it was Lee Byung Soo, then you would think it possible, wouldn’t you?

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,240
Did your husband somehow catch a hint as well?

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,360
Ah...

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,320
You know that meditation teacher that time?

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,840
Couldn’t we see her one more time?

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,500
No, we can’t.

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,700
Her schedule is completely filled until next year.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
Oh. Really?

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,460
Then, I guess there is nothing we can do.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
However, that busy gentleman,

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,740
is he the kind of human being who might do this…

30
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,860
Ah!

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,880
Hong Sang Man?!

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,620
That’s right, there is that person.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,300
Now that I think of it, he did chase us as well.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
However…

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,080
why are we being like this?

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,960
It’s just that an open space is dangerous.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,580
This is my house.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,020
Tell them to come.
Tell them all to come.

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,880
Oh.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,520
Oh. However, shouldn’t we really be careful?

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,040
That is true.

42
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,500
That’s why…

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,180
We shouldn’t have gone to Mi Sook’s house.

44
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,160
And, we even somehow met your husband there.

45
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,700
Let’s suspend things then!

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,380
For the time being,
we just pretend to do things.

47
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,340
Oh.

48
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,680
So, then to Soo Gyum…

49
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,840
I’ll let him know.

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,400
Then, our dinner meeting today?

51
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,140
Suspend.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,800
Suspend.

53
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,120
Suspend.

54
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,960
They say that they don’t offer any such classes.

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,800
What about the instructor woman?

56
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,240
They say that there is no such person either.

57
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,960
So, what is she up to?

58
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,400
I can’t give you information on another patient.

59
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,380
However,

60
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,580
you can tell me about the medicine and the effects, can’t you?

61
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,060
It’s a special medicine for people who have a lot of anger.

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,100
The medicine makes a person not want alcohol or meat, and so it makes a person very relaxed.

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,520
and is a specialty of our practice.

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,480
Oh.

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,460
Oh. What is it? Why?

66
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,020
Why would I have come?

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,080
To a fish shop, I came to buy fish.

68
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,420
Oh.
What would you like?

69
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,360
Anything.
Just give me some.

70
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,960
What does your wife like?

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,960
Seeing you at the last parents meeting, it seems

72
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,100
as if you know Jung Hye and Candidate Baek’s wife.

73
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,820
I don’t just know them.

74
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
I’m very close to them.

75
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,260
Then, do you perhaps have meetings?

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,140
Of course we do.

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,180
Mutual aid meetings.
That thing that all the ajummas do.

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,020
Principal!

79
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,300
The expensive fish… way over there on the street,

80
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,420
Soon Hee’s Fish, they have a lot of them.

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,080
Go there from now on.

82
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,700
I’ll do that.

83
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,040
$10

84
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,560
I do think it’s him after all.

85
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,380
<i>Hong Sang Man just came by.</i>

86
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,440
<i>If he deliberately went to find you and ask such things, then that’s daebak.</i>

87
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,580
<i>Shall we cancel the suspension?</i>

88
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,040
<i>If it’s Pervert Hong, then we have to get him back immediately.</i>

89
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,820
<i>Still, since we’re not completely sure yet.</i>

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,460
<i>For the time being, I think it would be better for us to be careful.</i>

91
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,380
Your wives, hasn’t there been anything in particular these days?

92
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,780
Yes?

93
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,220
A person who only stays at home,
what particular thing could there be?

94
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,820
A person who doesn’t even do any housework,
what particular thing could there be?

95
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,780
Aren’t you being too trusting of your wives?

96
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,480
It’s not that I’m thinking strangely about your wives that I’m saying this.

97
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,600
If you have something to say,
please say it comfortably.

98
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,800
That is, have you felt a bit in danger or…

99
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,800
perhaps your stomachs were suddenly hurting?

100
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,440
Yes?

101
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
What are you trying to say?

102
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,960
It’s a special medicine for people with a lot of anger.

103
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,940
Morning and night, I will make sure to bring it to you.

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,920
The medicine makes one not want alcohol or meat, and so makes one very relaxed, and is a speciality of ours.

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Anyway, don’t you think that something is a bit different?

106
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,620
Well, these days, she seems to be going out a lot.

107
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,660
So, I have given her some warning.

108
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,240
That’s right!

109
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Even as parents of students,
she has to be careful of who she associates with.

110
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,960
What about you?

111
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,800
That person?
Well, I don’t know what she does anyway.

112
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,720
Does your wife do any mutual aid meetings?

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,080
She’s a bored person, so she must do some things.

114
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,600
I mean the wives doing mutual aid meetings,
how would we keep track of that anyway?

115
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,600
When ajummas do something, it can be scary. Hm?

116
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,580
Anyway, don’t trust them too much,
even if they’re family.

117
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,700
Be careful!

118
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,520
Don’t worry.
I have some ideas as well.

119
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,080
Sunbae should also be careful.

120
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,880
Yes.

121
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,900
Here.

122
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,240
Do you want a drink as well?

123
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,600
Don’t you have any meat appetizers?

124
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,800
Since I haven’t eaten meat in so long,
I keep wanting to eat meat.

125
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, should I at least defrost something from the freezer?

126
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,940
What did you do with the health tonic that Director Lee gave me?

127
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,080
Well, you said that you weren’t going to take them any more.

128
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,800
No.

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,860
Not that medicine.

130
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,220
Do I have anger disease?

131
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,320
Y-yes?
Who did…?

132
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,680
Why didn’t you talk to me?

133
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,380
I thought you were feeding me some poison or something.

134
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,000
How could you think that?

135
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,660
If you were the old you,
then I wouldn’t have thoughts like these.

136
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,020
You go out constantly.

137
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,000
You bring strange people home.

138
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,700
It’s the wife of Director Lee who is campaigning for you, so being close to her is helpful to you…

139
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,200
You only do what I tell you to do.

140
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,860
Don’t go doing your own thing!

141
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,020
Do you understand?!

142
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,140
Yes.

143
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,120
<i>That letter.
I don’t think it’s from my husband.</i>

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,560
That time

145
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,040
when we went to couples yoga,

146
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,340
they say that they don’t have any such meditation class.

147
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,100
Yoga?

148
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,020
When did you do that?

149
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,420
Of course.

150
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,440
Since I rented the place so that I could have that instructor come teach us.

151
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,100
By the way,

152
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,580
I have something that I wanted to show you.

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,420
It’s something that was in our mailbox this morning.

154
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,460
What is this?

155
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,580
What have you been doing that such a thing was sent to the house?

156
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,860
Who would… such a thing…?

157
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,320
I don’t know.

158
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,580
Maybe someone is playing a prank.
I was wondering if you had any clue of what it could be.

159
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,600
Who around me would do something like this?

160
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,640
Oh? I? What?

161
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,120
Letter?

162
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,200
Have you ever seen me write something like that?

163
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,420
Wh-wh-wh-what…club?

164
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,120
Why would I…

165
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,500
Hello? Hello!

166
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,680
Yah! Lee Byung Soo!

167
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,480
Oh really. So unbelievable.

168
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,920
Oh!

169
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,140
I have to have some money in order to go to a club.

170
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,820
Ah.

171
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,780
Even though only half of their blood is the same,
they do resemble each other.

172
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,820
Ok.

173
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,800
Take action!

174
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,920
Take off your pants.

175
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,040
- How can I take my pants off?
- Call 119. 1-1-9.

176
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,140
- Just know that this is not the end of it.
- To be continued

00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,040
Anticipate this, B.J.

180
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,540
Bok Ja Club*.
<i>(Avengers Club)</i>

181
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,180
Today, the fish is really good.

182
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,540
Omega-3. Natural Botox.
Try eating some!

183
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,040
Excuse us!

184
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,360
Yes?

185
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,380
You’re the owner here, aren’t you?

186
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,580
Yes, I am.

187
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,020
At a fish store, if you make sushi, don’t you know that’s illegal? [T/N make sushi=slice raw fish. Making sushi requires a restaurant license, not just a fish store]

188
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,380
What are you…?
I’ve never done anything like that.

189
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,860
There is a person who said that they ate this,
and got food poisoning even.

190
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,800
What are you saying?
I said I’ve never done that.

191
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,200
Ah, that will be revealed by the investigation.

192
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,860
And, at least, the investigation has been started,
so you have to cooperate with us.

193
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,860
Ay, who-who is it? Who said that?
Let me meet him!

194
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,860
We cannot reveal who reported it.

195
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,800
Please cooperate with the investigation.

196
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,500
Take samples.

197
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,480
What? Wait. Wait a moment. What are you doing?

198
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,880
Ay. Ay.
How is this happening?

199
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,420
If you take everything,
how do I run my business?

200
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,320
Until the investigation is complete,
you are not able to sell here.

201
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:01,980
What?

202
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,660
Oh my son!

203
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
You’ve been busy studying, haven’t you?

204
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,320
Oh, your school is just too nice.

205
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,620
I had to come here and meet your homeroom teach…

206
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,460
Didn’t we agree to live without seeing each other?

207
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,340
Ay, not…

208
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,500
Son!

209
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,900
See that. See that. Another one came to meet him.

210
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,720
How many ajummas is he meeting anyway?

211
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,480
Oh, stop doing things like this!

212
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,840
What are you doing?

213
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,440
Stop being concerned with other people’s business.

214
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,720
Yah,

215
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,800
but that ajumma seems like the real one.

216
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,040
However, the other ajumma seemed to have a lot more money.

217
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,580
It’s probably his mom’s friend.

218
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,900
What’s this? Are you now just totally taking that sunbae’s side?

219
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,960
Aish. Yah!

220
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,880
I’m going to keep an eye on it.

221
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,640
Yah, yah, where are you going?!

222
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,580
Ah, go in already and stop being petulant.

223
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,180
Mom had to have a bigger picture.

224
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,580
Do you want to hear mom’s plans?

225
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,900
Mom is going to meet… Yah, Yah!

226
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,760
How can he…?
Son! Son! Where?!

227
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,360
Let’s see each other again soon!

228
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,800
Who are you?

229
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,780
Stop!

230
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,240
Why?

231
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,340
Hand it over.

232
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,380
What?

233
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,780
You took a picture of me!

234
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,480
Omo.

235
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
Omo!
Children are so scary.

236
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,220
I mean, you just stare at me and you just…

237
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,760
I’m not that kind of person!

238
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,560
What do you mean you’re not? Here. There is a picture of me! What do you mean you’re not?!

239
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,360
Oh, give that to me!
Why are you taking someone else’s things?

240
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,900
You. You’re taking secret photos of me,
and I’m going to report you to the police.

241
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,720
Stay right there! Don’t move!

242
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,140
Ahhh

243
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,300
What are you doing?

244
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,860
I thought I was leaving with empty hands, but you’ve done one big thing, cutie.

245
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,480
Yes?

246
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,740
She’s a crazy ajumma.

247
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,680
Ahh, that country boy. What is he?

248
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,160
Suspension of business?

249
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,660
I’ve been running a fish business for 10 years and I’ve never made sushi.

250
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
Today was the first time I even knew that was illegal.

251
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,800
It’s kind of strange.

252
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,700
That as soon as we received the threatening letter,
that this happens.

253
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,560
Wait a second!

254
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,020
That as soon as we received the threatening letter,
that this happens.

255
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,860
Wait a second!

256
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,220
I think there was something to that.

257
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,800
You said that yesterday,
Hong Sang Man had come by.

258
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,720
Yes.
Yesterday, he bought some fish…

259
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,080
That is…

260
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,820
That person!

261
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,300
Oh, Unnie.

262
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,280
You mean just sit back and let it happen?

263
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,040
We don’t have any proof.

264
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,940
We have to find it.
The evidence.

265
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,240
I’m sure it’s Hong Sang Man.
That’s why with the police even.

266
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,800
Bribery?

267
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,660
That’s right.

268
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,580
But,

269
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,140
just to catch me?

270
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,780
Would he have involved public officers?

271
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,720
Yes.

272
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,260
Let her go after 2 or 3 days.

273
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,880
That woman has to get a scare.

274
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,200
When I think of what I had to suffer… ehy.

275
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,180
This is what’s so good about a person from one’s hometown.

276
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,960
I will host you lavishly sometime, Captain Kim.

277
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,800
Yes.

278
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,120
Oh, Hee Soo.
And, Hee Kyung has come as well.

279
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,920
Hello

280
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,940
We came so that we could go home together with mom.

281
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,700
Did mom go home already?

282
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
Don’t even talk about it!

283
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,140
Today, the police came and there was such a ruckus raised.

284
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,740
Yes?

285
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,940
Because our mother was not able to be patient and just let her temper fly?

286
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,780
Aigoo. It’s nothing like that.
Aigoo.

287
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,520
Wow!

288
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,540
Hong Do Fish Store’s best fish have all gathered here.

289
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,900
Today, mom had a great day, so I was in such a good mood that I decided to make a feast for once.

290
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,800
Mom!

291
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,900
Eat. It’s delicious.

292
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,900
Wow. I’m the daughter of a fish store, but...

293
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,740
today is the first time that I’ve eaten enough fish properly.

294
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,520
Was mom that stingy?

295
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,860
You mean you didn’t know that?

296
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,920
To be honest, until today, I didn’t know that there was so much body on a hairtail.

297
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,340
I thought that it only had a head and a tail.

298
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,320
That’s right!

299
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,860
I told you that there was that time that I opened a steamed pollack dish and was totally amazed.

300
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,960
Underneath the soybean sprouts, there were just severals heads of the pollack.

301
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,000
You were too much, mom!

302
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,020
Aigoo.

303
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,920
It’s because we lived so cheaply that
we were able to do well and live with full stomachs.

304
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,960
You can live somewhat blandly* now.
<i>( “salty” in Korean is a metaphor for “thrifty” HK is punning, telling her Mum she doesn’t have to be so cheap anymore”)</i>

305
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,900
Here.

306
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,100
Mom eat some, too.

307
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,080
Okay. Okay.

308
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,740
Now, we also should eat the whole fish from now on.

309
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,060
I have to go to the restroom.

310
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,060
Noona

311
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,880
Mom’s trouble…

312
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,360
Pretend you don’t know!

313
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,080
It seems as if mom doesn’t want to talk about it.

314
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,240
Still, if it’s suspension of business.

315
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,420
Until the results come out,
let’s just wait and see.

316
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,920
There is going to be a family interview.
Get ready for it.

317
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,720
If it’s family…

318
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,960
Seo Yeon will have to do it, too.

319
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,800
Go buy her some clothes.
Something that will make her look like a girl.

320
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,920
Wouldn’t it be okay if you did it by yourself?

321
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,800
Do I not have a wife or a child?

322
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,600
It’s a family interview.

323
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,800
Still, including Seo Yeon…

324
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,940
It’s just once.
She can’t cooperate even that much?

325
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,180
I understand.
I’ll try to speak with her.

326
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,260
I won’t do it.

327
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,160
Dad said it would be good if we all did it together.

328
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,360
Mom doesn’t like it either.

329
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,100
If you don’t like something,
why can’t you say that you don’t like it?

330
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,820
Following dad, you lie and force yourself to smile, do you really want to things like that?

331
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,780
No.

332
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,460
Mom dislikes it, too.

333
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,520
Then, don’t do it!

334
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,140
I understand.
I’ll try talking to your dad.

335
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,100
Just because mom alone is trying so hard,
is anything changing?

336
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,660
Even back then, you weren’t able to stop dad.

337
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,420
Even though Oppa said so much that he didn’t want to go.

338
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,280
What happened? Did it turn out okay?

339
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,180
Of course.

340
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,800
I’m Hong Do Fish’s Hong Do Hee.

341
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,540
It wasn’t unnie’s fault, was it?

342
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,540
Of course not.
Since, I’ve never done such a thing.

343
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,140
They said that there isn’t anything wrong with my fish.

344
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,380
Okay! Okay, okay!

345
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,300
I’m selling at even cheaper than half price.

346
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,560
$7 mackerel, I’ll sell it to you for $3.

347
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,140
Welcome. Yes, yes, that fish is really good.
I’ll give you 30 minutes. 30 minutes.

348
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Hey, they say that someone ate this store’s fish and got food poisoning.

349
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,860
Let’s go! Let’s go!

350
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,740
Omo. Omo. I almost made a big mistake.

351
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,760
Yes. For 30 minutes only,
I’m having a big sale. $7 fish for $3…

352
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,400
The police even came and suspended her business.

353
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,040
It’s so scary, could anyone eat that store’s fish again?

354
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,500
Yes. Yes, I just came from the police station after being investigated.

355
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,360
They say that our store’s fish have no problems at all!

356
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,800
It’s fish that can be eaten without fear!

357
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,980
Come and see!
I’ll give it to you for $3. $3. Yes?

358
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,500
Sale! Sale! $3. $7 fish, I’ll give it to you for $3.

359
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,780
Mother, come and look!

360
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,420
How much is everything here?

361
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,580
Ah, Jung Hye.

362
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,340
The fish today is really good.

363
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,220
Do you want to buy some?

364
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,260
- Yes.
- Give me all of it!

365
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,780
You can’t have all of it,

366
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,220
but enough for your respective families.

367
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,660
Unnie is treating.

368
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
I’ve thought of a good method.

369
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,840
Ehy…

370
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,140
What kind of fish is without fishiness and so fresh?!

371
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,960
I heard that the fish here is so delicious!

372
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,440
Because we’re long time regular customers,
we know it well!

373
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,540
Because more than anyone else, this store has a conscience, so we trust her and eat them!

374
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,740
Do you think that will do?

375
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,460
<i>Plan B is necessary.</i>

376
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,440
Do you have any mackerel?

377
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,280
- Yes, I have mackerel. There. There.
- Give me just two beltfish, please!

378
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,280
Two beltfish!

379
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,760
I would like some Korean anchovy.

380
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,060
- Wait just a moment, please!
- Do you not have any anchovies?

381
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,840
Of course, I have anchovies.
Why wouldn’t I? Just wait a little, please.

382
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,720
Yes, Hong Do Hee.

383
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,980
You didn’t live a bad life.

384
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,550
The money for promoting that this shop's fish is good is included.

385
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,950
- If Hong Do unnie knew what we're doing...
- We will be scolded.

386
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,730
- So..
- We should not get caught.

387
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,580
Next person.

388
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,490
Here it is.

389
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,980
Cheers!

390
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,080
Aigoo.

391
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,020
Eat as much as you want.

392
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,800
I've sold out all today, so this unnie will treat.

393
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,080
Yes. You treat because you can just sell out tomorrow, too.

394
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,320
Yes yes. Sold out today and sell out tomorrow.

395
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,580
Aigoo there's no rule that I should die. 
(= feel relieved to find a way to survive)

396
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,380
- Here are the chicken feet you ordered.
- Yes.

397
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,840
- Please enjoy your food.
- Yes.

398
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,720
Ah..

399
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,010
Ah!

400
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,010
It seems like magic. Woa.

401
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,660
- We need an emergency measure.
- Ah, yes,

402
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,660
Jung Hye, this.

403
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,540
Are you alright?

404
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,110
Don't do too much.

405
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,340
It seems our madam likes to eat fish these days.

406
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,420
- One is for you, Ajumma.
- Ah..

407
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,250
Oh, this expensive thing... Thank you.

408
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,200
- Is it going well?
- Yes.

409
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,466
Hong Do unnie doesn’t know at all.

410
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,440
But don’t do too much. If business is much better than before…

411
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,320
Don't worry. How about you?

412
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,320
Please wait a while.
I'm watching closely.

413
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,910
You know if there’s no evidence, it’s all a waste?

414
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,910
If only it were that easy of a job!

415
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,680
Still, I should do it.

416
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,060
Honey.

417
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,820
Honey..

418
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,580
If I’m in this state,

419
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,090
I've lived quite well, haven't I?

420
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,080
Uhm.

421
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,500
Hong Do-ya, don't cry.

422
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,620
Oppa is here.

423
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,560
Follow...

424
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,070
your.

425
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Hong Do-ya,

426
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,390
don't cry.

427
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,760
- This is good too.
- Give me 1 kilo of short arm octopus.

428
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,430
Ah yes. One kilo of short arm octopus.
Come on, autumn short arm octopus.

429
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,290
This is great. If you eat this, you don’t need to take a separate vitamin pill.

430
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,750
One kilogram?

431
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,250
But you came a while ago too?

432
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,810
No, I didn't.
This is my first time.

433
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,850
A salesperson has quick eyes.

434
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,850
My eyes are so accurate…

435
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,960
You came yesterday, too.
You bought one kilo of ark shell.

436
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,440
- I said I didn't.
- $9

437
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,860
The ch-change!

438
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,050
Here it is.

439
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,360
What are you doing here?

440
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,900
Uh unnie...

441
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,620
Ah, get ready.

442
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,440
You did well.

443
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,510
Come on, straighten your arms and hit it upward.

444
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,160
Straighten your arms.

445
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,130
This way, like this.

446
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,950
You hit it like this.

447
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,080
Teach, I’m sorry.

448
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,560
- Don't play around.
- Yes.

449
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,130
Aish.

450
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,480
Attention! Attention!

451
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,560
Double fishy!

452
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,240
Your brother-sister affection is so tear jerking.

453
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,810
Hey Hwang Jung Wook!

454
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,280
I bet you won’t hit me. Why?

455
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,280
You can't cause trouble carelessly.

456
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,410
And you don't have money to
pay settlement money again.

457
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,220
I have nothing to be afraid of.
You have many things to beware of.

458
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,420
- So different, right?
- Right.

459
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,420
I restrain myself because we’re different.

460
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,010
Anyway after graduation,
you and I have no business to see each other again.

461
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,600
Ah, that’s right. It will be different.

462
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,530
You and I will be swimming in different waters.

463
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,410
Aww, fishy smelling family. The original fishy smelling mother…

464
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,490
- I said to never touch my family, didn’t I?
- Aigoo this tear jerking family affection.

465
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,910
Until when will you stop these childish acts?

466
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,690
Until you kneel and beg?

467
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,160
Thinking about it,

468
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,020
I realized I didn’t get any apology from you.

469
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,730
You had your mom kneel down instead, you cowardly bastard.

470
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,760
Hey what did I say?
This is why family instruction is important.

471
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,166
When the child did wrong, why would the parent beg instead?

472
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,740
If the child did wrong, the child should kneel and beg.

473
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,880
Who are you saying knelt?

474
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,120
Hey.

475
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,450
I have a very precious lecture video.

476
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,620
Watch and study, okay?

477
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,600
- This is quite good for a life lecture.
- <i>Please forgive once.</i>

478
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,480
<i>Let me go. What the hell are you doing.</i>

479
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,560
Her knees just automatically kneeled down.

480
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,110
- You bastard!
- Stop it!

481
00:32:22,534 --> 00:32:28,034
"English Subtitles by the lovely Ajusshis, Ajummas, Oppas, Unnies and dongsaengs of Avengers Subbing Club"

482
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,033
Gee how can I live without a sister.

483
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,550
Where is the sister right now?

484
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,610
Teacher, do you want to watch it too?

485
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,980
Hey!

486
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,980
Aww.

487
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,980
Aww.

488
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,980
Aww.

489
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,980
Aww.

490
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,080
Mi Sook, even you too!

491
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,430
Unnie..

492
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,430
It’s because I insisted we do it.

493
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,130
- What were you guys making me?
- But I didn't spend that much...

494
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,190
Jung Hye,

495
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,410
it’s not a matter of money. You…

496
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,450
<i>Hong Do-ya, don't cry</i>

497
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,340
Hello?

498
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,280
Thank you, it's enough for today.
I'll call you.

499
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,490
Unnie. Unnie.

500
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,850
- Shall we wait for her till she came out?
- She said it's enough.

501
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,850
Let's do what she said.

502
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,420
Unnie seems to be very angry, doesn’t she?

503
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,080
See what happened. I said we should not do it.

504
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,840
We did it together. That’s…

505
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,430
Yes, that's right.

506
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,130
It's not the first time,

507
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,690
the victim's parent will respond strongly.

508
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,180
As you know, she is not an ordinary person.

509
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,180
I do know.

510
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,180
Mom, sister didn’t do that.

511
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,900
- He put on a show by himself.
- Stay quiet.

512
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,370
It's my fault to cause this trouble with students.

513
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,310
We trust you, Teacher Kim, but…

514
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,010
seeing the CCTV, it seems there is cause for misunderstanding.

515
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,360
If that person wants you to be punished as a violent teacher,

516
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,360
we don't have any way to stop...

517
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,090
Yes, Mr. Principal.

518
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,540
Yes yes, I see.

519
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,170
The victim’s mother is in the principal’s office now.

520
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,100
This isn't the first time.

521
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,290
Last time, her situation was so miserable,
I agreed on a settlement.

522
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,970
This time, the boy alone wasn’t enough, his sister joined in.

523
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,040
How can a teacher act like this?

524
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:41,130
Calm down please. Teacher Kim's mother is coming here.

525
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,980
Ah, she must have come. Yes, come in.

526
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,970
Uh, why are you here?

527
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,970
I am Teacher Kim Hee Kyung’s mother.

528
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,180
Ah! really...

529
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,840
Look at this.

530
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,900
Casting down your eyes and lying down on your face would not be enough,

531
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,510
but how dare you look at me so directly?

532
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,750
Your face is so thick.

533
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,960
- Are you a gangster family?
- I've watched the CCTV.

534
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,690
Since you’ve watched, now you know.

535
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,410
Our son is in the hospital. His trauma is so, so great!

536
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,750
This time there will be no settlement.
So if you say anything like asking for a favor,

537
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,340
-  I will sue...
- I don't intend to.

538
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,700
I..

539
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,620
Whatever anyone says, I trust my children.

540
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,160
If you want to follow the legal procedure, please do so.

541
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,350
I’ll prepare a countersuit as well.

542
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,350
This time,

543
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,880
please provide the diagnosis beforehand.

544
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,800
You do know how scary a false accusation is, don’t you?

545
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:10,410
But isn’t it true that the sister and brother
as a team harassed a single student?

546
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,800
That's what I'm saying, Mr. Principal.

547
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,870
A teacher who is supposed to guide students properly,
how can that teacher kick a precious student?

548
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,133
I will want compensation for my son’s mental health damage as well.

549
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,190
So, be prepared.

550
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,290
It seems you don’t have anything more to say, I’ll see you at court.

551
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,130
Oh.

552
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,080
What is it? This attitude?

553
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:40,970
Oh.

554
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,060
-  I will..
- Ah ah..

555
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,260
Today, you don't do it, mom. Come on, come on.

556
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,250
Today, you just eat, mom.

557
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,710
Anyway, it seems I raised my children really well.

558
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,480
Ha! I feel mortified. I should have punished him properly.

559
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,120
Still…

560
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,420
even if I were in the same situation again,
I would still stop Hee Soo again.

561
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,560
You restrained yourself well.
You did well, you did well.

562
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,730
Don't worry. I will give him a punch.

563
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,130
I will give him the real punch.

564
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,670
- You will?
- Success is the best revenge.

565
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,050
I will become much more successful than him…

566
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,690
Whose brother are you? You're great.

567
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,360
Of course. Look who gave birth to him.

568
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,360
- Here, here, here.
- It’s hot.

569
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,060
<i>[Shall we cancel the suspension? If it’s Pervert Hong,
we should repay him right away.]</i>

570
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,630
<i>[Unnie, are you alright?]</i>

571
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,680
She said she would call, so...

572
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,980
Aigoo, everyone must be sleeping.

573
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,680
The liquor tastes bitter, too.

574
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,470
Here I see you again.

575
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,740
Oh.

576
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,740
Ah.

577
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,790
Ah, it’s good.

578
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,200
How come you are outside at this time of night?

579
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,560
- Because I can't sleep.
- It’s dangerous, so why are you out by yourself?

580
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,340
If it’s dangerous, then why is a man out by himself?

581
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,310
Do you know this? An octopus has three hearts.

582
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,680
Does it?

583
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,890
I've lived thinking I have three hearts too.

584
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,740
One turned off when my husband died.

585
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,000
Another one turned off when the money lenders wanted their debt repaid.

586
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,720
The last one,

587
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,010
I'm keeping it well because of my children.

588
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,940
Why am I saying these things?
I must be drunk after just one drink.

589
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,320
It’s okay if you become more drunk.

590
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,190
I’m sorry for leaving a man alone when it’s dangerous.

591
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,630
Hmm.

592
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,560
Hello.

593
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,370
Ah, did I put too much stress on that?

594
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,240
Then..

595
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,220
This.  Uh?

596
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,490
Aish.

597
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,780
Really.. it's too weak.

598
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,510
Oh, I have no clothes.

599
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,040
This one? Like this?

600
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,810
Ah really...

601
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,520
- Finally, I’ve met someone I can communicate well with.
- Get to the point.

602
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,160
Your impatient personality is similar to hers.

603
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,000
Here it is.

604
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,940
Won't it generate rumors?

605
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,010
Geon Ah Group’s youngest daughter and an illegitimate child.

606
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,810
So, I already wrote something up.

607
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,230
I may not look it, but I have some talent with writing.

608
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,950
Do you think it isn't being reported because they don't know?

609
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,280
Oh, that’s not working here either.

610
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
Then how about this?

611
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,180
Geon Ah Group’s youngest daughter’s rival.

612
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:26,620
A sudden interview with a mistress hidden for 20 years.

613
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,360
How much is it?

614
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,370
Definitely!
I knew we could communicate.

615
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,390
Aigoo… Sister-in-law.

616
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,460
Since you came over here,
why didn’t you see me before you go?

617
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,890
Thanks to you, I’ve already wasted my time.

618
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,450
That’s why I've come personally

619
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,150
to apologize to you.

620
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,290
From now on,

621
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,050
forget the past unpleasantness

622
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,060
Sister-in-law and I

623
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,200
can grow a prosperous relationship...

624
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,360
So, are you happy talking to Byung Hoo?

625
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,990
Is there a business that doesn't need more funds?

626
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,740
Exactly, exactly.

627
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,330
Didn’t you say you only need 10 minutes?

628
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,370
Ah, yes.

629
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,250
Actually, it’s like this.

630
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,030
As sister-in-law knows, the situation on my side has changed.

631
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,030
So?

632
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,700
Just because one 19-year-old child has come to you

633
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,680
doesn’t mean that the Chairman has decided on you after all.

634
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,910
Yes, that’s right.

635
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,040
Nothing has been decided yet.

636
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,990
There isn't any reason for sister-in-law to be treating me like this.

637
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,520
If we happen to get along well, it shouldn't lead to a loss for you.

638
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,210
I’ll think about it.

639
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,240
We should see each other often, sis-in-law.

640
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,360
However

641
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,440
Inheritance, Love. You all are talking about either the father

642
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,510
or the son.

643
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,930
Isn't this somewhat old-fashioned?

644
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,510
Can’t you make it on your own?

645
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,250
I prefer independent people.

646
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:29,900
I don’t know if I can go forward trusting in Hae Rang Construction or not.

647
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,840
It’s so scary, how can I even come to school anymore?

648
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,410
Yah, don’t look. Do you want to get hit?

649
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,720
<i>Violent Teacher, go away</i>

650
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,640
Hee Soo, you seen this?

651
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:34,400
What?

652
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,280
This has been spread around a lot.

653
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,520
Hwang Jung Wook uploaded this everywhere.

654
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:44,830
Yah, Hee Soo!

655
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,730
Kim Hee Soo!

656
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:57,840
She’s coming out.

657
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,400
- Quickly!
- She’s coming out, she's coming out.

658
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:01,430
Teacher Kim Hee Kyung!

659
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,960
You've heard the news of the complaint
by the victim’s parents, haven't you?

660
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,070
Is it true that you have a black belt in Taekwondo?

661
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,850
Did you know the video of the incident is going viral?

662
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:09,840
Do you plan to countersue?

663
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:10,966
Teach!

664
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,690
Please make sure of the actual facts before you write your articles.

665
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,170
That student has lied before.

666
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,500
About having a broken arm.
He even wore a cast to fool everyone.

667
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:28,720
Let’s go.

668
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,320
Teacher, please say something.

669
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,430
How can you just leave?

670
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,270
Teacher!

671
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:34,680
Wait.

672
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,530
What?

673
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:36,740
Noona!

674
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,730
Are you okay?

675
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,400
Hee Soo…

676
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:47,810
Let’s go.

677
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,120
Madam is really a beautiful woman.

678
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,520
I’m very lucky.

679
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,850
Where will the interview be held?

680
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,660
Aigoo… Really…

681
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,760
You should have told me ahead of time.

682
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,550
If I did, would you have come?

683
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:41,530
Cancel it.

684
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,890
How long are you just going to avoid it?

685
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,280
You do it by yourself, then.

686
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,060
You go first.

687
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,660
My wife is a little bit nervous.

688
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,080
If I didn’t bring Seo Yeon, you said you'd cooperate with me.

689
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,970
Don’t you know what this place meant to me?

690
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:00,400
I know.

691
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,240
That's why I brought you here.

692
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,830
You should try to overcome it.

693
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:08,480
Aigoo, Director!

694
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,120
-Aigoo
- Aigoo, hello.

695
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,250
It’s been a long time since we’ve seen each other.

696
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,160
- Aigoo, hello, hello.
- You're in good health?

697
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,640
Aigoo, thank you. Thank you.

698
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,350
Aigoo. Kids, say your greetings.

699
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,290
- Hello!
- Hi! Hi!

700
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:20,200
Thank you.

701
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,720
I should have come more often before this.

702
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,500
No, that’s okay. That’s okay.

703
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,100
- Aigoo, you have come here personally.
- Aigoo...

704
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,140
They say that you’ve been supporting this orphanage for many years.

705
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,690
Is there any particular reason why?

706
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,690
Actually

707
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,230
my wife spent her childhood years here.

708
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:41,710
Ah, I see.

709
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,640
Besides, today

710
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,510
isn’t about me going public about funding this place.

711
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,250
Rather, I want to take this interview

712
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,170
as an opportunity

713
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,290
to say thank you to my wife.

714
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,810
You’ve always said that
your wife is your role model in life.

715
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,590
Yes, that’s right.

716
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,040
My wife spent her childhood in this orphanage, and left at 19 years old

717
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,360
to enter society.

718
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,850
Afterwards,

719
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,840
she educated herself and she worked.
She lived a very difficult life.

720
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,610
Seeing how strong of a person she is

721
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,330
has always

722
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,320
amazed me.

723
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:18,570
It seems that your education philosophy is also influenced by your wife.

724
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,420
Ah, yes, of course.

725
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,430
Especially

726
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,060
when I see students who study hard in difficult circumstances.

727
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,410
It reminds me of the struggles my wife went through.

728
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:26,900
That's why...

729
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,300
So that any child won't be lacking,

730
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,790
at least in education,

731
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,560
that's the society that I want to build.

732
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,080
Because of her.

733
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,030
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

734
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:06,560
I heard your son is studying abroad?

735
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,920
Yes.

736
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,340
Is he a high school student?

737
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,720
Yes, according to our country's system,
he's in his senior year of high school.

738
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,010
Many might ask if the person who
sent his son to study abroad is qualified

739
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,660
to become our Superintendent of Education.

740
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,680
Yes, of course they could think like that.

741
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,180
However

742
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,900
I don't think that my position

743
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:27,600
should stop my son from being able to fulfill his dreams.

744
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,160
Ah, yes.

745
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:45,400
You.

746
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,880
You’re a bad and stupid kid.

747
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,270
Repeat after me.

748
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,690
You.

749
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,070
You’re a bad and stupid kid.

750
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:55,920
That’s why

751
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,080
you were thrown away.

752
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,940
That's why

753
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,840
you were thrown away.

754
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:31,700
Omona...

755
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,420
The violent teacher’s mother is here.

756
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,880
Make an appointment if you want to say something.

757
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,450
Don’t disturb my business.

758
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,110
Look here!

759
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,820
Yes, take a good look!

760
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,490
Your daughter’s face is all over the internet,

761
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:51,800
so quickly go look it up!

762
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,070
Aigoo...

763
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,600
She can't understand. She can't understand. Anyway.

765
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,110
You did this?

766
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,770
Your daughter did it.

767
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,490
Isn’t this evidence? Evidence!

768
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:16,960
Now, this isn’t simply a matter of her getting fired.

769
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,050
I heard she’s just a contract employee.

770
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,210
She may never be able to become a teacher

771
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,570
even if she places first in the exam.

772
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,650
My son

773
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,440
My son is going to be haunted forever.

774
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,140
Forever!

775
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,610
He said that when he closes his eyes,

776
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,140
he sees a foot come and go.

777
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,140
And it’s the foot of your "great" daughter.

778
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,680
Why does only my son have to go through this pain? Why?!

779
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,340
Neighbors, I’m right, aren’t I?

780
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,260
Please say something. Really.

781
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,070
Ah, really...

Such an interesting woman.

791
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,610

I’m sorry.

796
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,230
Even if it's the same background,
you should act appropriately and modestly.

797
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,080
You said since we were of the same background,

798
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,500
I should be more understanding.

799
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,270
You better know where the line is.

800
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,130
Know that we stopped this article for you.

801
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,566
Did you want to use this kind of method
to prove your very existence?

Even if you cannot be helpful to the family,

803
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,670
at the very least, you shouldn’t be a burden.

804
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,960
You’ve never thought of me as a family member.

805

Since you’ve been playing a mother lately,

Shall I clear it up for you?

809
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,720
I have never forgotten.

810
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,960
I was born and raised as an illegitimate child.

811
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,620
And I’m currently paying my debt through an arranged marriage.

812
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:10,700

813
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,960
I know that very well.

814
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,950
Yes. It seems you haven’t totally forgotten your place.

815
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,360

depending on how it is handled,
it can further produce differing results.

861
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,700
You agreed as well!

862
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,600
But then the child died, so then it’s all my fault?!

863
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,230

01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,660
If you can say that he wasn’t actually hit…

879
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,860
And if I did that, then what?

880
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,260
Were you going to get on your knees and beg again?

881
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,330
Well, I guess if it’s for your children,

882
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:59,000
then being able to beg on your knees until they’re completely worn away is your specialty.

883
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,900
Your pride also goes completely away. That’s really great.

884
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,430
Make sure your kids watch and learn.

885
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,260
Thank you…

886
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,900
for making me come to my senses.

887
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:26,200
What?

888
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,760
I was about to get on my knees and beg.

889
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:31,660
Huh?

890
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:36,330
If it was for my kids’ sake,

891
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,730
pride or heart or whatever,

892
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,630
I was willing to live without any of that,

893
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,600
but my thinking was wrong.

894
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,500
My getting on my knees and begging

895
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:55,000
is the same as my children getting on their knees and begging.

896
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,530
Because of you I know that now.

897
01:04:58,730 --> 01:04:59,830
So what?

898
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,830
What are you going to do about it?

899
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,830
Getting on my knees is easy.

900
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:07,300
I’m no longer going to take the easy way.

901
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,500
As hard as it is,

902
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,900
for you, for me,

903
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,800
let’s go the very hard way.

904
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,900
What are you saying?

905
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,000
Go where?

906
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Well!

907
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,660
Seo Jin.

908
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,700
Your mother is really sorry.

909
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,800
Your mother is really sorry.

910
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,900
<i>[Do Hee: I’m sorry, but tonight I won’t be able to come out.]</i>

911
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,130
<i>[Mi Sook: Me, too..  I’m sorry.]</i>

912
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,860
<i>[Soo Gyum: Something came up unexpectedly.]</i>

913
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:50,900
Aigoo, aigoo.

914
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,930
I’ll take you home with me.

915
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:20,000
