<i>English Subtitles by Avengers Subbing Club</i>

2
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,780
With me.

3
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,420
Don’t you want to make a deal?

4
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,720
A deal?

5
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,780
Yes. I want to make a deal with Madam.

6
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,020
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

7
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,860
Do you know why I’ve come into this house?

8
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,260
Revenge.

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,860
I want to get revenge.

10
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,100
Why are you saying such things to me?

11
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,160
I thought Madam, like me, probably would
want to get revenge.

12
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,540
So?

13
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,260
If Madam will be on my side,
I’ll leave this house after a year.

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,580
As a condition for leaving this house,
you want me to be on your side?

15
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,740
So, just until next year, be patient with you.

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,180
Would it be right if I understand it that way?

17
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,760
Yes.

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:51,860
Can you leave right now?
Yes.

19
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,100
Can you leave right now?

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,300
What you say isn’t enough to make a deal.

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,600
If you’re thinking of leaving, then before then
before it gets any later, now is the best time.

22
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,580
Even better would have been for you to
not come in here at all.

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,300
If I weren’t born, it would have been even better.

24
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,020
I don’t know about other things,
but what I’m sure about...

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,760
is that you and I do not have the kind of relationship
where we can talk about this.

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,240
I’m not saying that I’ll simply leave this house
or anything like that.

27
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,740
I’m going to cut all ties with my birth parents.

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,520
They have me as they please and don’t ever
even look in on me.

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,600
And now deciding to turn my life upside down

30
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,780
makes me feel really terrible!

31
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,940
Until I graduate, I’m going to pretend to be a good son.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,940
When I come of legal age, I’m going to slap
the back of their heads and run away.

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,920
The bad feelings I have about my birth parents,
Madam must have them also.

34
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,040
If I leave...

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,820
Then Madam will also be happy.

36
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,220
It’s not that simple an issue.
It’s a matter for adults.

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,760
Are you telling me to stay still
until I become an adult?

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,500
I don’t think I can do that.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,040
Father!

40
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,740
Son!

41
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,940
Yah, the two of you have done your homework well.

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,060
You look very close.

43
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,500
Here!

44
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,300
What is this?

45
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,760
Start by listening to this.

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,340
And if you need a tutor, I’ll find one.

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,240
This is a tablet, isn’t it? This?

48
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,780
You know how I feel, right?

49
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,680
Of course, I know.

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,880
And I’ve prepared this for you.

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,900
Necklace?

52
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,520
Your throat is a work of art after all.

53
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,200
But they’re earrings.

54
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,760
Oh, right. Earrings.

55
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,860
It’s right that it’s a necklace.

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,340
Using a person, father.

57
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,000
This kid.

58
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,820
I don’t think he’s an ordinary kid.

59
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,620
Seems so. He seemed so bashful.

60
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,520
So he wants to take revenge together?

61
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,080
I oppose to that.

62
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,620
That child. He’s already been hurt by
his birth parents.

63
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,160
If he wasn’t completely turned upside down any further
by adult things, it would be better.

64
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,340
Whether that child’s words might be truth or lies.

65
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,540
It could be something that helps him though.

66
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,460
Mi Sook’s words have some value.

67
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,040
Taking a child and inserting him into these kinds of matters
is a little bit like that.

68
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,060
Hiding out true intentions and pretending to help him
is also just using the child.

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,380
For me, that child is unfortunate and pitiable.

70
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,440
Of course, your position must be difficult as well.

71
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,780
What is his personality like?

72
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,740
Let’s see...

73
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
How should I put it?

74
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,940
Don’t push me from the back.

75
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,360
If I also roll and fall down the staircase,
then what will you do?

76
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,980
Who pushed whom anyway?
He just fell down by himself.

77
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,120
You saw that, but you just left,
didn’t you?

78
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,680
Yah, if no one had discovered it and something bad
had happened to him,

79
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,100
then someone would have been charged
for committing death.

80
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,520
Do you know that?

81
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,700
Become a case? Whatever.

82
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,600
He by himself got caught in the trash can and fell,
so why would the law be interested?

83
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,220
Also, rather than being charged for causing death,

84
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,180
it would probably be a charge for committing murder.

85
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,960
I know that, too!

86
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,760
Aigoo. Since the smell of trash is mixing with the
fishy smells of fish...

87
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,660
Yah. Yah. Vomit. Vomit.

88
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,900
It’s really coming out. Oh. Yah.

89
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,260
Hey, fish cafe!

90
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,680
Yah, in order to pay the settlement money,
your mother must have had to work hard.

91
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,320
If the settlement money is $5,000,
then how many fish do you have to sell?

92
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,000
Wow, did you receive $5,000?
Then you have to buy a round, jerk!

93
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,560
What are you saying?

94
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,860
Look at him ignoring us.
Look at him.

95
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,920
Hey, why don’t you hit me once as well?

96
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,960
Yah, yah, yah. He...

97
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,820
Doesn’t have a dad, mom sells fish at the market,
so he wasn’t able to receive proper family training...

98
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,560
Yah, Hwang Jung Wook!

99
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,620
Yah, yah. You’re going to hit me?
You’re going to hit me? Hit me? Aigoo.

100
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
I’ll throw it away for you.

101
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,720
Aigoo. Why don’ t you try hitting my ear
this time?

102
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,180
Yah! Aish!

103
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,720
Yah! Aish!

104
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,060
You bastard!

105
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,500
It’s the third floor.

106
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,180
You bastard.
Just wait right there.

107
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,940
Thank you.

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
Crazy.

109
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,180
Where do I have to put these away?

110
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,220
I can’t tell what kind of kid he is.

111
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,600
Where is he?

112
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Yah.
Haven’t you seen a jerk with a pail?

113
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,020
Whoever the bastard is,
I’ll chase him to hell.

114
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,660
For this much, you should be thankful.

115
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,860
Rather than being the culprit,
you were the accomplice.

116
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,080
It was just because it would have been bothersome
to have gotten involved.

117
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,960
So would you get lost, too?

118
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,000
Anyway, I think not getting entangled with him
would be a good thing.

119
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,920
I just wonder whether we would just be betrayed
at some point as well.

120
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,900
Anyway, he’s a child.
One who needs his parents.

121
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,100
I think I know now.

122
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,160
To be honest, the kid is a kid.
However...

123
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,700
Jung Hye, I’m more worried about you.

124
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,440
The money you gave to Hee Soo,
if you don’t take it back...

125
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,300
Then we can’t take even a step forward together.

126
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,080
If a person is caught up by money,

127
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,800
Then becoming a monster takes only a second.

128
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,720
Yes, hurry and take it.

129
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,520
Take it. Here.

130
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,240
In the future, I can’t even give Hee Soo
any spending money?

131
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,660
Just enough to buy ramen.

132
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,920
$500?

133
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,660
We three...

134
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,980
Going forward, we’ll be okay,
won’t we?

135
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,180
Yah, Lee Soo Gyum! Why aren’t you staying for the
late study session?

136
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,200
I’m studying until my nose bleeds at home.

137
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,860
That nosebleed, I can wash it off for you.

138
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,300
Jeez.

139
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,000
Why are you here again?

140
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,960
The water shower just a while ago, that was you,
wasn’t it, Hyung?

141
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,280
Is that right?

142
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,960
Would you like to eat some bread?

143
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,960
Do you think that I just eat bread every day?

144
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,900
Then something else?

145
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,800
Why don’t you just compete a round
with your brother?

146
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,100
Depending on the score, that will decide
who is the older brother.

147
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,920
Aigoo, older brother!

148
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,240
Hey, is your mother in a club or something?

149
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,040
A club?

150
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,560
She won’t even go to a health club because
she doesn’t want to spend the money.

151
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,580
Oh, is that right?

152
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,420
By the way, what did you say you put in
that ramen you were going to make?

153
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,300
Yes?

154
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,860
That time, didn’t you say that you would
make me ramen, didn’t you?

155
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,260
Enjoy your drink.

156
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,880
Hong Do, change a thousand won for me?

157
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,620
Who are they?

158
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,340
Why are you so curious about everything?

159
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,500
Don’t use it as an excuse to talk.

160
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,160
Go already.

161
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,540
Unnie!

162
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,700
Oh, put it on the tab.

163
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,840
Oh! Fine!

164
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,980
Bye.

165
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,900
I’ve decided.

166
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,420
Revenge. I’m not going to do it with him.

167
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,020
And, it could be dangerous for our Avengers Club as well.

168
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,460
Mom!

169
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,900
Hee Soo!

170
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,800
I thought you said you were going to go straight home.
Did you forget your key?

171
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,100
That’s not it. Mom, this is that senior that
I mentioned to you.

172
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,500
Hello.
My name is Lee Soo Gyum.

173
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,440
That time. Me. Staircase. 119.

174
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,620
Oh! Oh, my word!
Aigoo. Aigoo Just a second.

175
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,160
I’ve heard so much about you from Hee Soo.
Student Soo Gyum, thank you.

176
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,560
Oh. I smell fishy so I had better not.

177
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
That’s okay!

178
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,320
However, looking at it now,
Hee Soo has taken after you a lot.

179
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,500
That’s right, isn’t it?
It’s a relief that he took after me.

180
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,080
Sit, sit, sit.

181
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,020
No, that’s fine.

182
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,660
That’s okay. Sit, sit, sit.

183
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,280
Ajumma. Hello.

184
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,420
Yes, hello.

185
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,700
That ajumma is also mom’s friend.

186
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,260
Ah. Hello.

187
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,880
Yes. You must be Hee Soo.

188
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes.

189
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,460
Ajumma’s friend.

190
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,880
The three of you look very good together.

191
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,280
That’s right, don’t we?

192
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,260
We look like the Three Beautiful Maidens of Fate,
don’t we?

193
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,140
Can you give me some ingredients to make ramen?

194
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,600
Okay. Fine.

195
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,700
I’m going to go.

196
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,640
What? You’re going already?

197
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,580
I also...

198
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,600
Goodbye.

199
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,680
Spending money.

200
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
Thank you.

201
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
Goodbye.

202
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,720
I’ve returned!

203
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,460
Oh, Student Soo Gyum, you’ve come.
Have dinner!

204
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,280
Hasn’t Madam had her dinner yet?

205
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,180
She says that she doesn’t want any.
I think she’s feeling very sensitive right now.

206
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,500
Sit.

207
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,480
I will also skip dinner today.
I’m not very hungry.

208
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,820
It’s very hard, isn’t it?

209
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,980
Thanks to you, ajumma, it’s okay.

210
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,040
Go ahead and go home now.
I’ll let them know.

211
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,440
Thank you. Thank you.

212
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,680
I wondered whether we were just going
to be betrayed somehow anyway.

213
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,500
I’ve brought the evening meal I prepared.

214
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,400
What is a family? Isn’t it eating meals together?

215
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,140
Do you think that we’re a family?

216
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,780
It’s seafood ramen. I’ve tried making it with the ingredients
that Hee Soo’s mom gave us.

217
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,160
My request, have you thought about it some?

218
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,820
I’m not making any deals with you.

219
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,120
Then let’s not make any deals.
Let’s just become closer.

220
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,360
Let’s become closer, us.

221
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,340
Fine. Let’s make a deal.

222
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,660
I’ll go ahead and wait until next year,
so you just have to not do that thing.

223
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,940
Becoming closer.

224
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,400
Mom!

225
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,700
Hee Soo!

226
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,900
Oh! Hee Kyung!

227
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,400
Noona, did you leave your home?

228
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,520
I’ve come home, kid.

229
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,540
What is going on?

230
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,680
I’m having too hard a time.

231
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,820
Dinner?

232
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,640
I’ve eaten.

233
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,240
Mother!

234
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,180
Little brother!

235
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,860
I...

236
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,240
have finally gotten a job!

237
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,920
A job?

238
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,600
A job?

239
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,360
I’m going to start my life as a high school
physical education teacher!

240
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,600
Of course, only as a contract employee.

241
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,220
However, I’ll just attend for a while and see if
this is the job that fits me well, and see how it goes.

242
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,360
Surely not my school?

243
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,300
That’s my alma mater as well.

244
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,620
Oh, that’s well done.
Oh, my daughter!

245
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,360
Mom.

246
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,540
My daughter!
You did well, my daughter!

247
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,000
I’m going to buy everything for you.
Buy everything.

248
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,380
She had said she wanted to study longer
for the exams...

249
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,840

What on earth are you?

253
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,770
Don't you understand the deal condition?

254
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,300
We won't get closer. We never pretend to be close.
We can't never be close.

255
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,190
It's nothing like that...

256
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,740
Don't dare to come into my room.
Don't dare to touch my belongings.

257
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,530
You don't allow family do this?

258
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,680
Get out.

259
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,100

262

Endure, endure then endure.

264
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,040
Even if it's disgusting, dirty, shameful,
I should endure and endure.

Yes.

273
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,980
Principal, this is the temporary P.E. teacher
working from today.

274
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,280
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Hee Kyung.

275
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,390
Nice to meet you.

276
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:00,420
Aigoo, our teacher Kim looks more like a dance teacher
than a P.E. teacher.

277
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,540
I majored Taekwondo.

278
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,900
Ahh.. Taekwondo?

279
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,900
Aigoo..

280
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,090
that's why it's so solid. Um?

281
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,840
Please treat me right.

282
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,190
If you're doing hard, you can be a real teacher.

283
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,590
Our foundation is flexible in that side.

284
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,060
Teacher Kim graduated from our school, Mr. Principal.

285
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,500
Ah did you?

286
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,140
Then I should take more care of you. Um?

Right. The mood wasn't like this when I came at first.

It's nothing to endure.

- Right...

Perhaps it’s because he takes after me,

351
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,660
but he is doing well in his studies and I think
he’s able to get along with people.

352
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,460
A piece of luck is a lucky piece, huh?

353
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,100
Professor Baek, what happened with the obstacles
at the school?

354
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,270
Before I declared my candidacy,
I worked it out, of course.

355
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,540
If there is something I can do to help,

356
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,020
just let me know any time.

357
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,340
In that case, how do you feel about
doing an event

358
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,820
where you meet directly with the parents
of the students?

359
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,670
Good idea.

360
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,670
I had better talk you up with..

361
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,310
- ..the “nellies”.
- The “nellies”?

362
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,310
Oh. You don’t know “nellies”?

363
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,240
Neighborhood ladies who only help me.

364
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,980
Hong Sang Man was my teacher in high school.
We called him Pervert Hong.

365
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,730
Oh, my goodness.

366
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,740
Aigoo, bastard.

367
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,540
How should I deal with him?

368
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,120
How about reporting him?

369
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,140
I thought about it, too.

370
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,350
But hearing what Hee Kyung's story...

371
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,670
There's no legal way to deal with.

372
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,820
And there is no evidence.
If he pretended not to know, it becomes nothing.

373
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,220
Ooooooh!!!

374
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,630
Aigoo!

375
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,620
How about this?

376
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,260
Since he is easily seduced...

377
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,730
We trap him then collect the evidence?

378
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,090
He'll recognize Mi Sook Unnie’s and my faces, so we can’t.

379
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,060
The only one possible is...

380
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,190
Me?

381
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,860
Neighborhood lady?

382
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,980
Do you think I can seduce him?

383
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:56,010
I think we should follow the standard procedure so it won't
happen anymore in the future.

384
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,360
Report to the Ministry of Education...

385
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,000
and request the investigation.

386
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,870
We can also gather the parents, and then...
- Ah, w-wait, wait a minute.

387
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,290
Before we can succeed,
that person will die of old age.

388
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,990
Should we just cut *it* off?

389
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,540
Tools? Does just anyone use them?

390
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,540
A method which leaves wounds are not allowed.

391
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,620
That’s right. It’s not our method.

392
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,380
How should I erase this trash?

393
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,600
Oooh!! I’m so furious!

394
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,340
He said that he’s our husbands’ senior,
right?

395
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,420
Really? That’s how you’re all connected?

396
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,820
Then, should we look into it more?

397
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,790
Let’s think of a plan separately,
and meet again later.

398
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,220
Unnie, I know that you must feel
the world is unfair,

399
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,950
but let’s look for the right solution together.

400
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,360
I won’t let him go.

401
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,930
Thank you. Thank you.

402
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,340
<i>English Subtitles by Avengers Subbing Club</i>

403
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:35,240
The sweets that grandmother likes and even the
makgeolli (alcohol) that grandfather likes.

404
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,040
I brought a lot of things this time.

405
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,140
I’m doing well.

406
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,190
You don’t have to worry about me.

407
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,840
What are you doing?

408
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,990
You’re trespassing. Please leave.

409
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,690
We’re doing work that we received permission to do,

410
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,690
so stop worrying about it, and go your own way.

411
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,690
Permission? Whose permission?

412
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,090
What do you mean whose?
This land’s owner, of course.

413
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,790
I’m the owner.

414
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,190
-What?
-There. Here she comes.

415
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,190
Son!

416
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:09,390
It’s too hot. Too hot.
I think my heart is going to burst.

417
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,890
Son. My son! What brings you here?
Did my son come here?

418
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,040
-Omo, is the land okay?
-Yes.

419
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,740
Who are these people?

420
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,740
Oh, really. Aish.

421
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,890
Why are you here?

422
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,940
Surely, you haven’t left the Buam-dong house?

423
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,090
Who are those people!

424
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,040
Shhh...

425
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,240
It’s just...

426
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,040
It’s just that Byung Soo has some interest in it.

427
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,390
So, I told him to take a look around it.

428
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,190
With whose permission?!

429
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,540
I said to not touch the house or the mountain, didn’t I?

430
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:53,490
No matter how much you say that you’re going to inherit,
if I contest it in court,

431
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,840
I’m their actual daughter
and you’re just a minor.

432
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:06,790
Oh you, in the future we’re going to have so much,
so why do you care about some country land like this?

433
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,890
Do you know what day today is?

434
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,590
What day is it?

435
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,290
Is it your birthday?

436
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,040
I thought that I had you on a cold day.

437
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,490
- Come this way. This way.
- Yes.

438
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,890
- Careful.
- Yes.

439
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,740
I said leave immediately!

440
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,140
Omo! Son! Omo! My son!

441
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,690
This won’t do.

442
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,690
Yah! You bastard!

443
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,690
- I can do the dishes. You should take a break.
- Yes, okay.

444
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,200
- Is Seo Yeon doing well in school?
- Of course.

445
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,600
Her father might be elected to the Board of Education,
so it wouldn’t do if the child is a mess.

446
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,360
Ah, Seo Yeon's principal is going to have
a parents’ meeting.

447
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,180
- Principal Hong Sang Man?
- Yes.

448
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,850
Whoa, your memory is good...

449
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,230
- When you announced your candidacy, we met him then.
- Ahh... that's right.

450
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,670
Since that gentleman has said that
he’ll help campaign for me,

451
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,930
I think you should go to the meeting and
greet the other parents.

452
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,530
Meeting in person is important.
You know what I mean, right?

453
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,570
I understand.
And what about you?

454
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,180
I have an important meeting with the officials.

455
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,130
<i>Idea Meeting</i>

456
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,310
These days, you seem to get a lot of calls.

457
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,270
It's from other school moms.

458
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,040
Right, it's important to be on good terms
with them.

459
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,310
Ah, yes.

460
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:12,250
I’m thinking that we can embarrass him
in front of the parents.

461
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,150
I know it’s a good opportunity to embarrass him
in front of many people,

462
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,550
but I think it will be too burdensome for us.

463
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,330
You’re right.

464
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,770
But I don’t feel right about you guys
always helping me.

465
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,050
I want to help you with your problems, too.

466
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,420
Help me...

467
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,190
She keeps getting into trouble
wherever she goes.

468
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,370
Are you okay?

469
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,670
He left the house.

470
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,940
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

471
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,780
Let me give you my apologies.

472
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,540
My sincere apologies.
Really, sorry.

473
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,600
I'm truly very, very sorry.

474
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,520
This... So this wasn't a fight.

475
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,500
While they were working, it happened...
- Look here...

476
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,580
Since a report of the incident was made,
first the information has to be taken.
- No...

477
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,510
Did you get ID card?
Your ID number?

478
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,300
You can give your guardian's number instead.

479
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,740
I’m his guardian.

480
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,570
He doesn't seem to know you.

481
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,660
Well...this kid, he's not in his right mind.

482
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,400
You.

483
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,220
Do you want to upset your dad?

484
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,150
Imagine how worried your dad is about you,
waiting for you.

485
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,450
For such well you know,

486
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,480
Did you make Grandma wait for 18 years?

487
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,520
Do whatever you want!

488
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,300
Excuse me, you're right,
he beat up these guys up.

489
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,590
I just have to give a victim’s statement, right?

490
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,510
Over here?

491
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,970
It doesn't have to be a guardian.

492
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,770
In situations like this, there must be someone
you can call?

493
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,160
I could've gone alone.

494
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,970
You can’t. You don’t know what will happen.
Based on what you said,

495
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,840
It doesn’t seem like an easy problem.
So we can't let you go alone.

496
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,820
Do you know what's this thing
at the police substation?

497
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,020
I hope it’s nothing big.

498
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,490
But...

499
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,340
It looks like we are going somewhere far.

500
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,820
We can go back by dinner time right?

501
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,250
How about 8 PM?

502
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,300
10 PM?

503
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,750
12 AM?

504
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,390
Ah, It feels nice.

505
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,130
Avengers Club...

506
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,390
Fighting!

507
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,380
Omo, look.  It's falling.

508
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,580
Aigoo...

509
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,320
You trust me, right?

510
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,440
Aigoo...

511
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,770
Oh, Mister. Mister... ohh!

512
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,670
Oh. Anyone, stop! Omona!

513
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,400
- Ah, why?
- Why?

514
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,580
Smelly...

515
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,980
Then do you prefer to ride an open car
in this kind of situation?

516
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,620
Well, yes...

517
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,140
Well, okay.... the view is nice, the air is great...

518
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,200
Ah, I want to go plaaaaaaay!

519
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,350
Soo Gyum, why are you here?

520
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,000
Mother, please come and sign here.

521
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,470
Me?

522
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,490
Next time, tell me where you're going.

523
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,210
Or else get into a fight closer to home.

524
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,390
I don’t know if it’s okay to just sit here
like this!

525
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,930
Ah, there's nothing to do anyway.

526
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:14,490
I just picked some random things from the garden
and made soup.

527
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,700
Oh, this is a proper feast!

528
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,540
Oh, let’s see.

529
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,260
Hmm! Oh, it’s delicious!
Oh, what in the world!

530
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:36,890
It’s delicious.

531
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,740
You must have some recipe secrets.

532
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,520
Oh, I really like squash leaf wraps.

533
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,700
Oh, there isn’t any meat though.

534
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,690
Still, this is so good.

535
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,700
I ate well (Thank you).

536
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,740
This is the first time I’ve eaten a meal
prepared for me by someone else.

537
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,390
Is there anything that you’re lacking?

538
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,260
You’re good-looking, your personality is good,
you have a tender hea...

539
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,660
You don’t have to call home?

540
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,300
Oh!

541
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:20,730
I’m at the hospital.

542
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,700
I think I’m going to be late...
- Oh, it's mom.

543
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,820
So make sure you eat the dishes in the refrigerator.
- I'm out with friends.

544
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,920
You’re not going to call?
- Go ahead and sleep first.

545
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,920
He won’t notice that I haven’t gone home yet.

546
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,370
I might not be able to get home tonight.

547
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,370
Right.
- Yes.

548
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,650
- I’ll clean up and bring some dessert.
- No! No!

549
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,790
- Let’s do it together. Together.
- No, that’s not necessary.

550
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,180
Oh, let’s do it together.

551
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:41,800
Careful, careful.

552
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,990
<i>- Aigoo, I’ll do it. Ai.
- Ai, ai. it’s okay. </i>

553
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:56,590
<i> Unnie, just go rest.
-Aigoo, aigoo, let me do it. Aigoo. What are you doing?
Go rest. Aigoo. No.</i>

554
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,720
Omona, look at how nicely he’s cut up the apples.

555
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,140
I’ll eat it well.

556
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,120
Oh, I have to say what needs to be said.

557
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,150
Our Soo Gyum...

558
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,700
I’m not saying this just because he saved
my Hee Soo...

559
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,550
But just by looking at him...

560
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,940
One can tell that he was raised by his grandparents well.

561
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,640
Don't you think so?

562
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,640
Ah, yes.

563
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,840
If I you think I’m okay.

564
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,220
Please include me.

565
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,340
Include where?

566
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,570
Avengers Club.

567
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,130
It looks like a fun club.

568
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,060
Please let me join.

569
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,550
W-w-what are you talking about?

570
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,040
The three members who are sitting here

571
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:01,540
and the objects of the revenge

572
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,500
Hwang Jung Wook

573
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,340
and Madam’s husband...

574
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,020
...my real father.

575
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,160
Did you have me investigated?

576
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,300
Would I have done that?

577
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,260
I coincidentally overheard it.

578
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,360
I’ve decided.

579
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,750
I won’t seek revenge together with him.

580
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,920
And, it could be dangerous for
our Avengers Club.

581
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,510
Mom!

582
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,540
Oh, Hee Soo!

583
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,240
If you’re going to get revenge on my father,

584
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,670
I think I’ll be of help.

585
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:31,190
No, you can’t.

586
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,060
Why?
It would be beneficial for both of us.

587
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:36,340
Soo Gyum, this is a matter for adults.

588
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,940
That’s right, you can’t. This...

589
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,820
It’s something that has to be done
in secret anyway.

590
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,690
and we agreed that we wouldn’t add any more
members, and also...

591
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,180
I can also work secretly!

592
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,780
- And, increasing it just by one member...
- Only women are allowed in.

593
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:51,770
- Oh,yes.
- Oh, yes, that's right.

594
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:57,560
Why are you laughing?

595
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,370
It’s nothing.

596
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,140
Ah, it was a condition that I didn’t even think of.

597
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,660
Truthfully.

598
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,020
I made a deal with my real mom.

599
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,780
If I go and live in Father’s house,

600
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,740
she’ll leave this house and land alone.

601
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,580
However, that deal was broken.

602
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:23,820
I can’t wait until next year.

603
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,060
I wanted to become a useless child
to my real parents

604
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,900
but that won’t be enough.

605
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,500
I'm going to make him regret

606
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,820
taking me in.

607
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,640
So that I can protect this place, please help me.

608
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,840
Let’s to it together... revenge.

609
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,090
You make sure to protect this house.

610
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,580
We’ll do the revenge instead.

611
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,600
He's not coming?

612
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,940
I'll go and get him.

613
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,780
Until I get revenge, I'll stay in Seoul.

614
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,290
I won't come back here.

615
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,860
Excuse me.

616
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,980
Hello. Do you remember me?

617
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:46,950
Yes, we do.

618
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,520
Then what happened to the kid?

619
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,340
Was he?

620
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,750
Taken away?

621
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,240
His mom came for him.

622
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,740
And so did his aunts.
The three of them came together.

623
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,410
But I'm his mom.

624
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:01,740
What are you talking about?

625
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,650
- I don't think this is his mom.
- I agree.

626
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,420
I'm his mom.

627
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,440
I don't think so.

628
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,490
But I'm his mother!

629
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,980
No way, could it be that woman?

630
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,960
Do you think we can do this ourselves?

631
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,780
We already bought it.

632
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:50,520
Jung Hye, can we do this?

633
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,300
It's an academic event.

634
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,740
We have to.

635
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:57,220
It's our Avengers Club's mission.

636
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,640
Right, right. Us, together.

637
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:01,420
Avenger's Club.

638
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:02,600
Fighting!

639
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,690
So why did they decide to hold this event today?

640
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,960
Who knows.

641
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,220
They don’t expect even 10% participation.

642
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,670
If they’re going to do it, then they should do it properly.

643
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,670
Teacher Kim Hee Kyoung.

644
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,650
Yes.

645
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,070
Today your outfit is a bit...

646
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:05,180
I’ll be running together with the kids
so I thought this will be more comfortable.

647
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,600
Still today, we will have important guests...

648
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:14,270
Hmm, that’s good, I have something
I’d like you to do.

649
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,380
Okay.

650
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,470
Once you are done with the task I give you
let’s go eat.

651
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:23,760
The doengjang soup like the last time was quite
delicious, wasn’t it?

652
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,600
Ow! Mom!

653
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,690
What are you doing out here?

654
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,690
What would I be doing?

655
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,470
I’m doing one of the things that
my job requires me to do.

656
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,870
Stop immediately.
Just quit it all!

657
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,650
Oh, it’s okay, mom.

658
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,050
That bastard told you to do it,
didn’t he?

659
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:35,200
That petty bastard.
Today, you’re going to die and I’m going to die.

660
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,420
Oh, mom! Mom! Mom!

661
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,020
I want to keep working here.

662
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,980
Whatever you say, is it harder than
it is for mom?

663
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,980
I also want to be of help to mom.

664
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,940
Mom raised you wrong.

665
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:58,850
A child is not supposed to worry
about her parents.

666
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:01,740
She’s just supposed to look at the path
that she has to go.

667
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,090
Eh... you should have at least worn a hat.

668
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,360
Done.

669
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,890
- We're done right?
- Done.

670
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,670
Hurry! Hurry!

671
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,980
Aigoo... Miss Jung Hye.

672
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:29,450
No, that’s not it. Should I be calling you
Soo Gyum’s Mother now?

673
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,420
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

674
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:36,340
Whenever I see you...
you are really always the same.

675
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:40,020
Whatever. Now, I’ve aged a lot.

676
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,560
If we keep doing this, we might knock our
wisdom teeth together.

677
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,160
Aigoo. Isn’t it Professor Baek’s wife?

678
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:07,940
You came early.

679
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,470
Today, please take care of me well.

680
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,020
Ah, yes.

681
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:24,220
On your hand, this dust is...
it’s really not coming off.

682
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,670
I told you to clean this place well.

683
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,200
I did do that.

684
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,940
Since there is still some time left, why don’t we go to
the principal’s office, and have a cup of tea.

685
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,450
Ah, yes.

686
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,760
Let’s go.

687
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:16,220
Hello, hello. Oh, Min Wo's mom! Finally, you are here.
Come out more often.

688
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,220
Hello.

689
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,070
Oh, hello.

690
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:23,910
- Hello. Let’s see each other often.
-Yes.

691
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,220
Hello. Hello.

692
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,710
The seat is taken.

693
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:38,110
I know the seat is there that’s why I sat in it.

694
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,780
There is someone sitting there.
<i>**(The seat has an owner.)</i>

695
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,270
Owner my foot...
If I sat down then it’s mine.

696
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:47,090
They will come later and you will
have to move back.

697
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,940
Don’t you know who I am?

698
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:54,270
This was originally my seat, student parents' representative,
the person closest to the principal.

699
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:55,740
Don’t you know?

700
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,740
Jong Wook's mom.

701
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,180
Oh yes, Mr. principal.

702
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,270
I’m sorry but could you move another seat.

703
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,140
I.. I..

704
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:12,220
We are not that close to be sitting next to each other.

705
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:23,560
She must not even have any pride.

706
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,820
She’s even pretending to be Chairman Hong’s family.

707
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,250
- Really?
- Yes.

708
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,310
That is why...

709
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:45,000
what I want to say is

710
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,470
our principal who is always willing to work with us

711
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:53,220
students’ parents is really always to be respected.

712
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,160
For those fine words, thank you.

713
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,270
The reason that I have gathered everyone at this event...

714
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,780
Do you have something you want to say?

715
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:13,890
Not too long ago, there was news that a principal who
compromised a student was sent to jail, wasn’t there?

716
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,420
Whether our school is safe...

717
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,180
Kim Hee Soo’s mother!

718
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:20,250
How could you ask such an inappropriate question
of our principal?

719
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,450
It’s because I had heard some stories,
that’s why!

720
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,180
Principal.

721
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,400
Now, now, now.

722
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,760
What is the point of getting worked up about something

723
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,690
that happened at another school, parents?

724
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:21,310
Anyway, in the upcoming elections,

725
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:24,800
that one of our student’s parents
is going to be a candidate,

726
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,670
did you know that?

727
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:31,470
Today, at this event, the candidate’s wife...

728
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:35,420
Ah, yes. She has stood up.

729
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,850
The two persons...

730
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:38,820
I...

731
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:42,200
have something to say.

732
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,510
Yes, please do so.
That would be good.

733
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,760
In this place,

734
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,200
To Principal Hong Sang Man,

735
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,620
there is something that I have to say to him.

736
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,310
To me? What?

737
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:10,470
Just a moment. Sorry.
Just a moment.

738
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,270
Are you okay?

739
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:26,490
Oh, this looks like glue.

740
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,490
Please help!

741
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:34,420
<i>- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?</i>

742
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,580
Oh, principal!

743
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,510
Principal, perhaps you should just take off
your trousers?

744
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:46,580
Hey! Take my pants off?

745
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,540
I have to quickly...

746
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:57,270
Let’s go. Let’s go.

747
01:05:57,270 --> 01:06:00,620
9-1-1.
Call 119!

748
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,070
What do we do?

749
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:08,650
Oh, principal! What to do?!
Oh, principal!

750
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:17,020
One. Two. Three.

751
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:49,270
<i>Just know that this isn’t the end,
you bug-like son of a dog.</i>

752
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:53,070
<i>Just think if your family suffered
the same things.</i>

753
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:58,200
<i>Your memorable past is not forgotten.
Of course, with evidence.</i>

754
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,850
<i>To be continued. BJ
***(stands for Bok Ja Club aka Avengers Club)</i>

755
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:04,250
BJ? What is it?

756
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,020
Okay, now...

757
01:08:56,470 --> 01:09:00,000
shall we really start?
