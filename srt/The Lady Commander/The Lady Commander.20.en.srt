1
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 20=

3
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,580
(Eliminate the Lin Army and announce
they died in battle at Shuozhou.)

4
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,677
This is...

5
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,556
the letter Zhao Ruiyang wanted
Guo Shucheng to pass to Sui Ruohan.

6
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,224
Let me have a look.

7
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,484
It's indeed the paper unique
to the Zhao family.

8
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,199
Guo Shucheng

9
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,702
dared to forge a letter

10
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,245
and keep the real one as leverage,

11
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,405
to benefit from the situation.

12
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,748
I was initially worried

13
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,042
a single Ceasefire Pact

14
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,295
wouldn't bring Zhao Ruiyang down.

15
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,214
Now that we have this letter,

16
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,633
we can definitely
substantiate his crimes.

17
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,511
Yue.

18
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,145
Guo Feng, what are you trying to do?

19
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,775
I've been investigating Zhao Ruiyang.

20
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,935
A single pact is insufficient
to bring him down.

21
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,696
No need to worry about that.

22
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,521
Please leave.

23
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,866
I've traced the military funds
from back then.

24
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,827
- Don't you want to hear about it?
- Don't make me repeat it.

25
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,912
Yu.

26
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,467
Lin Yue'er is slandering me.

27
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,262
She claims she wants
to avenge her father,

28
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,517
but I'm very wronged.

29
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,769
Exactly.

30
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,179
What does this have to do
with Lord Zhengping?

31
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,265
The grain and reinforcements back then

32
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,684
were delayed on the road.

33
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,405
If anyone is to blame,
it should be Sui Ruo'an.

34
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,699
You can't say it like that.

35
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,112
Lin Haotian was killed by Wuqu people.

36
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,833
Lord Zhengping even arranged
for a memorial for him.

37
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,129
This shows Lin Yue'er is ungrateful.

38
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,965
Exactly.

39
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,051
That's right.

40
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,688
Go ahead, what did you find out?

41
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,780
Zhao Ruiyang

42
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,774
and my father embezzled

43
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,618
the court's military funds
three years ago.

44
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,246
Zhao Ruiyang took 70 percent of it

45
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,123
and invested in
the Persian jade business,

46
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,824
gradually monopolizing the jade market

47
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,034
in Bianyang and surrounding states.

48
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,337
They used Lu's Bank to launder money.

49
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,254
We can present this evidence

50
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,639
to the emperor

51
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,184
and comfort the spirits
of Lin Army soldiers.

52
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,773
Actually, you don't have to help me.

53
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,392
If the evidence is presented
to the emperor,

54
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,696
your entire family
will also face execution.

55
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,075
Yue, are you worried about me?

56
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,704
Actually, I'm not just helping you.

57
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,573
Even if I didn't investigate,

58
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,167
someone else would.

59
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,086
My family would be even less
able to escape.

60
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,921
I should atone for our sins.

61
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,506
I understand.

62
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,301
I imprisoned you for a year,

63
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,552
so you resent me.

64
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,849
You should leave.

65
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,852
I've already

66
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,146
repaid you double for what you owe me.

67
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,983
There's nothing more to say between us.

68
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,152
For so many years,

69
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,238
my father had never
looked at me favorably.

70
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,648
He even

71
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,025
disregarded his own son's life

72
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,160
to kill you.

73
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,328
Enough.

74
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,080
Guo Feng,

75
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,333
you and I have deep grudge between us.

76
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,835
Your father

77
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,337
killed my dad

78
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,714
and now I'm your father's killer.

79
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,342
We're even

80
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,469
and have no further ties.

81
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,588
Take your things and leave.

82
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,848
Yue.

83
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,059
Stop!

84
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,851
Zhao Dinghong, what are you doing?

85
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,560
Yue,

86
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,436
you should leave.

87
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,072
What am I doing?

88
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,442
I'm here to discuss terms with you.

89
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,276
It seems we really

90
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,995
underestimated your ambitions.

91
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,289
Your so-called affection and cooperation

92
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,167
are just using my Yue.

93
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,961
I truly love Yue.

94
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,923
My father has guessed

95
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,833
the letter he wrote to Sui Ruo'an

96
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,093
was taken by Yue,

97
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,595
so he sent men to kill
and silence her.

98
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,142
Yue, I'm here to save you.

99
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,310
Save?

100
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,021
You're here to take advantage
of our misfortune.

101
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,275
You really are a good son
of Lord Zhengping.

102
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,486
Yue,

103
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,073
at this point, I must admit

104
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,201
I can't allow you to present
the letter to the emperor.

105
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,746
It'd threaten the entire Zhao family

106
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,290
and my future succession
to the lordship.

107
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,584
Zhao Dinghong,

108
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,587
you've hidden well.

109
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,049
I don't want to bear my father's crimes.

110
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,280
As long as you're willing
to hand over the letter

111
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,846
and cooperate in staging a play,

112
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,849
I'm willing to push
my father off the lordship.

113
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,976
At that time,

114
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,395
you can do whatever you want

115
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,314
with him, the real culprit.

116
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,149
You're truly insane.

117
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,142
So you want the lordship.

118
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,694
Why should I trust you?

119
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,489
This time, I voluntarily took on
the task of capturing you

120
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,200
to mislead my father.

121
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,328
If you don't trust me,

122
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,997
you'll be shot with arrows.

123
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,059
Hurry up.

124
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,941
We meet again.

125
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,861
Stop dawdling. Go inside.

126
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,822
Watch them.

127
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,990
You, come here.

128
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,496
What are you doing?

129
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,711
Let's go.

130
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,050
You're really Lin Yue'er.

131
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,718
I should've killed you back then.

132
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,982
Feng,

133
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,059
when you set up
that scheme to frame me,

134
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,478
didn't you think
you'd end up like this too?

135
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,355
Come, tell your brother

136
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,783
why you were imprisoned here.

137
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,120
Let me guess.

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,699
It's because you offended
Lord Zhengping, right?

139
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,501
Why so much nonsense?

140
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,129
Yue,

141
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,180
put this on.

142
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,007
It's cold and damp here.

143
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,392
This will keep you warmer.

144
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,939
Yue, put this on now.
