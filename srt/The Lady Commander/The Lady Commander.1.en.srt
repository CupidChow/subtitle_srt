00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,300
(Second son of the Guo family, Guo Feng)

4
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,440
Yue.

5
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,560
(Three years ago)
Can you let me out? I need to save my dad.

6
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,840
I beg you.

7
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,600
Yue,

8
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,800
I can give you anything you want,

9
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,560
but leaving here

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,240
is impossible.

11
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,680
Sir, shouldn't you explain things

12
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,680
to Miss Lin?

13
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,520
What if she hates you even more?

14
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,560
She has every right to hate me.

15
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,200
She's only one left in the Lin family.

16
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,280
I can only protect her here.

17
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,360
Understood.

18
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,760
Someone, let me out!

19
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,840
Let me out!

20
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,960
Hurry!

21
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,880
Let me out!

22
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,880
Even if you hate me,

23
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,120
I hope you can stay alive.

24
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,080
You want to kill me?

25
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,520
What more do you want me to do?

26
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,440
Sir, bad news!

27
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,720
Miss Lin is missing.

28
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,160
Yue, wake up!

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,720
Yue!

30
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
(Moon Pavilion)

31
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,160
Honored guests,

32
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,080
dear lords,

33
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,800
you all know

34
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,160
a stunning beauty

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,600
(Owner of Moon Pavilion, Mr. Li)
with exceptional music skill joined us.

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,680
Whoever can name the tune she plays

37
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,760
will have the pleasure
of drinking with her.

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,520
What are you waiting for?

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,200
A round of applause, please!

40
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,200
Sir,

41
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,280
we've discovered someone
intends to inform the Sui family.

42
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Come with me to Moon Pavilion.

43
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
Yue was gone for three years
with no news at all.

44
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Now, a master of the pipa
has appeared at Moon Pavilion

45
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,800
and she can play "Warm Wind Song."

46
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,320
I must go see for myself.

47
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,560
♪A single light glows
deep in the courtyard♪

48
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,210

51
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,600
(the Lin family was annihilated.)

52
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,760
(The debt must be paid in blood.)

54
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,040
Yue,

55
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,440
will you marry me?

56
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,560
I do.

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,440
"Warm Wind Song" isn't
a pipa piece, is it?

58
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,320
Why do you know how to play it?

59
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,720
Sir, you must be joking.

60
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,520
In our Western Regions,

61
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,080
many can play "Warm Wind Song."

62
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,440
I heard that a pipa master from the West
joined Moon Pavilion.

63
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,040
It's a rare sight.

64
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,880
An old friend of mine used to
love playing "Warm Wind Song" too.

65
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,760
Today, I'm fortunate to hear it
played on the pipa

66
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,240
and it sounds very unique.

67
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,080
Sir, you speak of others

68
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,560
while in front of me.

69
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,000
Since your heart is elsewhere,

70
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,680
I won't keep you.

71
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,320
If one day

72
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,880
you change your mind,

73
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,440
seek me with this token.

74
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,120
Yue.

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,320
Who is Yue?

76
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm from the Western Regions.

77
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,880
My name is Tingwu.

78
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,200
How can people look so much alike?

79
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,820
(Eight days later
Guo mansion)

80
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,960
Are you suspecting she is Miss Lin?

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,560
Are you sure you want
to give this to her?

82
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
Miss Lin always sneezes
at the smell of cloves.

83
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,360
Keep her entry into the mansion
a secret.

84
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,280
I'm not certain it's her yet.

85
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,120
Go investigate.

86
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,840
Understood.

87
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Sir.

88
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,400
These used to be your favorite foods.

89
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,840
Why aren't you eating?

90
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,120
Sir, you must be joking.

91
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,600
I'm from the Western Regions.

92
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,560
How could I like
these Central Plains foods?

93
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,560
I can't even take a bite.

94
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
Here, take this scented ointment.

95
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,120
It smells like clove.

96
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,520
I like it very much.

97
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,920
Thank you, sir.

98
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,600
This is our nightwear.

99
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,320
Wear it when you sleep.

100
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,600
Clothes from Central Plains

101
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,880
are the most troublesome.

102
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,040
How do I wear this?

103
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
(No mole...)

104
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,920
Sir,

105
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,400
there aren't any maids in your mansion?

106
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,440
Yes, there are.

107
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,880
There are.

108
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm Cuizhi.

109
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,880
I'm Yanyu.

110
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
(Maid of Guo mansion, Cuizhi, Yanyu)
We're to serve you, miss.

111
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
Hey, you...

112
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,720
You cut off the mole

113
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,200
and changed blood to avoid the allergy.

114
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,880
You practiced martial arts
for three years

115
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
and returned to Bianyang for revenge.

116
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,760
Now, you've finally got your wish.

117
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,280
You were brought into the Guo mansion
by Guo Feng.

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,520
Was it worth it?

119
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,280
My feud with the Guo family
is to the death.

120
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,860
(Master of the Guo family, Guo Shucheng)

121
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,920
Watch out!

122
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,360
Are you alright?

123
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,400
Are you hurt?

124
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
You're hurt.

125
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,440
It's nothing, just a dislocation.

126
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,400
Don't be stubborn, wait for me.

127
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,600
What are you doing?

128
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Sir, what are you thinking?

129
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,880
Just applying medicine for you.

130
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,280
(The evidence is in the mansion.)

131
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,640
(I'll find out the truth
behind my dad's death.)

132
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
Please spare us.

133
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,960
Spare our lives.

134
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,640
- We're very sorry.
- We got confused.

135
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,320
Sir, spare us.

136
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
I'll ask you one more time.

137
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,280
Did the Sui family find out

138
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,640
about what Sir Feng asked you
to investigate?

139
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,160
We were caught
before we could pass on the information.

140
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,320
Spare us!

141
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
It won't happen again.

142
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,120
We were foolish.

143
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,480
We beg your mercy.

144
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
Please spare us.

145
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,680
It seems Sui Ruo'an hasn't noticed
our investigation into the Lin family.

146
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,400
Take care of them.

147
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,560
Yes.

148
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,480
