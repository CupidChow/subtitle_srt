are you really not Lin Yue'er?

5
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,083
Who is this?

6
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,668
This is Sir Feng's fiancée

7
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,670
whom he was engaged to three months ago,

8
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,880
Princess Zhao of Lord Zhengping.

9
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,426
I don't believe you're not Lin Yue'er.

10
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,845
You two, don't follow me.

11
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,398
Do you dare enter?

12
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,817
Someone!

13
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,902
Let me out!

14
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,446
Someone!

15
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,614
Let me out!

16
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,700
Why should I go in?

17
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,784

Feng,

23
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,074
is there any news of my dad?

24
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,581
Don't be afraid.

25
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,875
This place is safe.

26
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,920
I'll protect you.

27
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,840
What do you mean?

28
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,467
Are you going to keep me here?

29
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,219
I need to find my dad!

30
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,019
Is it because of the woman
in the paintings?

31
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,397
No wonder everyone is so surprised

32
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,398
when they see me.

33
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,983
I was also amazed

34
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,401
when I saw it.

35
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,570
How could there be

36
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,030
two people who look so much alike?

37
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,490
I do envy her.

38
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,659
Everyone misses her so much.

39
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,327
Where did she go?

40
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,455
But since I'm from the West,

41
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,582
I'm not the person you're talking about.

42
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,552
How strange.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,513
Does she

44
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,473
really only look like Yue?

45
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,746
You asked me to bring you
to Moon Pavilion

46
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,540
just to savor crab meat meatballs?

47
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,333
I've never been to Jiangnan

48
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,376
but I long for it,

49
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,919
so I'm fond of Jiangnan cuisine.

50
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,546
What would you like to order, guests?

51
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,132
One crab meat meatballs

52
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,550
and a few Jiangnan dishes.

53
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,721
The tea has gone cold.
Bring a fresh pot.

54
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,141
My apologies for the poor service.
I'll replace it with a hot pot.

55
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,460
(Manchineel sap)

56
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,460
(Lin family's spy, Duan Fei)

57
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:29,954
Miss,

58
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,622
why do you have so many rashes?

59
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,957
I'll go get the doctor.

60
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,044
I was wondering
why the servants got sick.

61
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,796
Turns out it was you, you filthy wretch,

62
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,173
bringing an epidemic upon us.

63
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,220
Madam, you certainly
receive information quickly.

64
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,556
I didn't even know when I had it.

65
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,266
Enough with your nonsense.

66
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,976
Since you got an epidemic,

67
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,019
I can't allow you to stay.

68
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,270
Nanny Kong,

69
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,313
detoxify.

70
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,189
Yes.

71
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:01,986
Stop!

72
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,782
When did you become
so skilled in medicine?

73
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,880
You can diagnose an illness at a glance?

74
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,786
I'l handle matters of my household.

75
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,620
Don't worry about it.

76
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,329
Hao Cheng,

77
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,330
show them out.

78
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,539
What?

79
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,708
Don't you know who's in charge here?

80
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,919
Guo Feng,

81
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,879
so this courtesan

82
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,422
really is your weakness.

83
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,925
Just wait and see.

84
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,593
Let's go.

85
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,595
Madam, don't be angry.

86
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,098
Are you alright?

87
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,558
I'll protect you.

88
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,351
Don't worry.

89
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,616
It must be from contact
with stinging nettle.

90
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,619
Add this medicine
to your bath every day.

91
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,538
In three days, you'll be cured.

92
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,003
It was my negligence

93
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,799
that nearly...

94
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:07,844
Sir.

95
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,183
The maid has confessed.

96
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,309
Madam Sui instructed her

97
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,520
to soak Miss Tingwu's clothes
in stinging nettle

98
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,938
and manchineel sap.

99
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,861
Go tell Zou Xu.

100
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:27,822
Understood.

101
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,784
(The same poison afflicted
my mother back then.)

102
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,911
(Now they're using it
to harm my girl again.)

103
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,415
Who sent you?

104
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,585
Don't kill me! No!

105
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,047
Father,

106
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,341
you don't really think

107
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,886
mother drowned accidentally, do you?

108
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,054
Someone must have plotted against her.

109
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,556
Nanny Kong is missing.

110
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,516
Father, she must have betrayed us.

111
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,146
Look at you now,

112
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,899
distracted, hesitant.

113
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,233
Are you still a man?

114
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,779
Guo Shucheng!

115
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,280
(Elder son of the Sui family, Suo Ruo'an)
Shucheng,

116
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,831
don't you think you owe me
an explanation?

117
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,674
Let me tell you,

118
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,135
even though I couldn't find
any evidence,

119
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,470
I'm certain

120
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,389
someone tampered with the carriage.

121
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,059
That's why my sister fell into the moat.

122
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,438
Even someone as dense as me
can tell something is off.

123
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,068
But you and I have already
investigated this.

124
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,528
No one left any trace behind.

125
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,033
This might have something to do

126
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,536
with what happened three years ago
with Lin Haotian.

127
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,580
There might still be remnants
of the Lin family that survived.

128
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,500
Your son brought back a woman
who looks like Lin Yue'er.

129
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,876
Maybe it's related to her.

130
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,512
They tampered with your carriage.

131
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,015
If Ruowei hadn't gone out today,

132
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,100
the one dead

133
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,852
might've been you.
