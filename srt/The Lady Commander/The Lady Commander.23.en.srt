3
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,711
Feng, let me help you.

4
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,550
I...

5
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,377
I know what happened three years ago.

6
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,513
It was my father who harmed
the Lin family.

7
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,047
I feel guilty about it.

8
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,507
Let me do something to make amends.

9
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,967
I can't bear to see Miss Yue

10
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,644
marry someone she doesn't love.

11
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,886
Feng,

12
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,188
let me help you.

13
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,868
Ziying,

14
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,944
in fact,

15
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,830
I've always thought of you as my sister.

16
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,708
I never imagined

17
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,117
a pure and kind girl like you

18
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,170
would be dragged into this mess.

19
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,548
To be honest,

20
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,885
the reason why I agreed
to our engagement

21
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,264
was that I could
freely enter Lord Zhengping Mansion

22
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,099
to investigate the clues.

23
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,310
I used you,

24
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,561
so

25
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,522
I don't deserve your kindness.

26
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,061
Feng,

27
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,405
I don't blame you.

28
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,658
I know love can't be forced.

29
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,484
Feng,

30
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,120
let me help her, alright?

31
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,135
Tomorrow at a quarter to six
is the time of the wedding.

32
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,553
Lieutenant Bai,

33
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,671
tomorrow, when the guards
are less vigilant,

34
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,475
place plain clothes
in the bridal sedan and sneak out.

35
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,102
Remember, you only have limited time.

36
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,596
Ziying, tomorrow, find Yue

37
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,149
and tell her to change into
plain clothes in the carriage

38
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,433
and disguise as a servant.

39
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,653
Jump off the carriage
when it reaches the north gate.

40
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,770
Alright.

41
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,479
Hao Cheng,

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,491
lead our soldiers
to the north gate to meet Yue.

43
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,108
Prepare a fast horse for her.

44
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,195
Make sure to trap the prince's pursuers
within the north gate.

45
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,330
Understood.

46
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,084
I'll wait for Yue at the second alley.

47
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,035
The two of us

48
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,422
will intercept the Fifth Prince
on his way to the wedding.

49
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,750
I'll give Yue the evidence of the Zhao's
embezzlement of military funds,

50
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,428
their hoarding of grain and monopoly
on the jade market.

51
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,431
She'll personally tell the Fifth Prince

52
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,891
about Lord Zhengping's deeds.

53
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,227
Ziying,

54
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,640
I'll arrange for you
to assume a new identity

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,439
and fake your death to leave Bianyang.

56
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,691
However,

57
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,268
you'll no longer be a princess.

58
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,570
Is that alright?

59
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,862
Of course.

60
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,574
But what about my brother?

61
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,284
If he doesn't persist in his ways,

62
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,328
I'll find a way to save him.

63
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,040
(Lord Zhengping Mansion)

64
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,658
Your Highness, why are you here?

65
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,336
I'm here to help you escape.

66
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,240
(Count to 100, then jump off
the carriage at the east side.)

67
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,970
This is Guo Feng's idea, isn't it?

68
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,848
Feng would never abandon you.

69
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,775
The time has come.

70
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,318
We mustn't delay any longer.

71
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,070
I'll go find my brother now
and stall him.

72
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,080
Wait.

73
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,632
Help me give this letter to Guo Feng.

74
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,309
Aren't you planning to leave here?

75
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,730
I have something more important to do.

76
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,954
Wait,

77
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,414
Your Highness,

78
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,332
why is it you?

79
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,167
Has our...

80
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,045
Has our plan failed?

81
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,716
This is for Feng.

82
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,140
(Guo Feng, this letter comes
with my thoughts.)

83
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,986
(In the end, I can't say these words
to you face-to-face.)

84
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,404
(It's strange.)

85
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,948
(You kept me in your home for a year.)

86
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,200

to kill you.)

87
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,079

time together,)

88
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,149
