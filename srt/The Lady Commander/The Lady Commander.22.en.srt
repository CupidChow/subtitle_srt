1
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 22=

3
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,381
Back then, you took Yue away
from the Guo mansion.

4
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,916
Since she left,

5
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,677
I never stopped looking for her.

6
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,512
You really didn't need to do this.

7
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,139
I've always just wanted to help her.

8
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,183
Help her?

9
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,553
You imprisoned her
in your home back then.

10
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,054
Who'd believe you wanted to help her?

11
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,482
That was because I found
someone was trying to kill her.

12
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,160
I suspected it was related
to General Lin's death.

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,119
If I didn't bring her back
to my home for protection,

14
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,720
those people wouldn't have given up.

15
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,280
I'd have come to Bianyang
to protect her.

16
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,534
What if she had been killed
before she ever met you?

17
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,040
Whether you believe it or not,

18
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,586
I had also been investigating
all these years.

19
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,672
Although Yue handed the letter
and the Pact to Zhao Dinghong,

20
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,591
we have another piece of evidence.

21
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,335
There's nothing standing between us now.

22
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,387
I'll marry you.

23
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,474
Are you crazy?

24
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,175
Is Guo Feng the only one in your heart?

25
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,676
Yes, he's the only one in my heart.

26
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,385
Fine,

27
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,104
then I'll kill him right now.

28
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,555
Zhao Dinghong, how dare you!

29
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,066
- Yue.
- Let him and Yu go.

30
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,560
If you dare kill them,
I won't live alone.

31
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,570
Alright.

32
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,979
Just put the hairpin down first.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,239
Put the hairpin...

34
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,899
Release them.

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,942
Fine, as long as you promise
to marry me,

36
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,786
I'll release them right now.

37
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,330
I'll do it now.

38
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,710
Alright.

39
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,670
Release them

40
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,881
immediately!

41
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,466
I'll do it now.

42
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,568
Where's Yue?

43
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,111
Yue?

44
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,989
The day after tomorrow, she'll marry me.

45
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,951
She's in the mansion,
bathing and burning incense.

46
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,328
What did you say?

47
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,789
I said,

48
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,625
the day after tomorrow,
Yue will marry me.

49
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,577
What, you're not going
to congratulate me?

50
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,505
Yue would never agree to that.

51
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,133
What gives you the right?

52
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,511
What gives me the right?

53
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,546
Because I'll be
the future Lord Zhengping

54
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,007
and I can make her Consort Zhengping.

55
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,227
But Guo Feng, you're nothing.

56
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,470
Your life is in my hands.

57
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,138
Now that I say you can go,

58
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,649
you can.

59
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,985
Don't make me regret it.

60
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,327
You don't understand her at all.

61
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,079
Dear brother,

62
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,331
after I'm exiled,

63
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,335
you'll be the only one left
in the Guo family.

64
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,839
You'd better live well on your own.

65
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,637
At least eat something.

66
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,879
Ziying,

67
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,881
why are you here?

68
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,466
Brother,

69
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,885
he's your father!

70
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,012
You're usurping.

71
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,848
Ziying,

72
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,184
don't speak nonsense.

73
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,479
Father is old and has stepped down,

74
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,764
retiring to the west courtyard
to rest and recover.

75
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,983
I've simply inherited the title.

76
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,945
How did you become like this?

77
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,040
Brother,

78
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,584
you know Feng has always been
in love with her

79
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,462
and I can sense she has feelings
for him too.

80
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,705
Please, let them be together,

81
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,799
OK?

82
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,471
You've been spoiled beyond measure.

83
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,308
I'll break off your engagement
to the Guo family,

84
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,186
but if you ever bring this up again,

85
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,480
I'll place you under house arrest.

86
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,207
Sir,

87
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,302
since you came out of the prison,

88
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,012
you haven't eaten a single bite.

89
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,723
If you continue like this,
how'll you hold up?

90
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,883
Where's Lieutenant Bai?

91
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,227
Lieutenant Bai didn't sleep all night.

92
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,022
He even wanted to storm
the Zhao mansion by himself.

93
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,900
Fortunately, I held him back.

94
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,444
Now he probably couldn't hold out

95
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,779
and went to sleep.

96
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,201
No,

97
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,912
Yue can't marry him.

98
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,581
I must rescue her.
