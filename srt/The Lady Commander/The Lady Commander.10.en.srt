1
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:56,472
You do.

4
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:58,849
You really do.

5
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,190
You really look like her.

6
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,567
You're Lin Yue'er, aren't you?

7
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:13,656
I didn't expect such a trivial matter

8
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:17,118
to trouble General Sui
to interrogate me.

9
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:21,080
You recognize me.

10
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,085
So, tell me,

11
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:29,046
who are you really?

12
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:31,215
I thought you brought me here

13
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:33,217
to question

14
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:35,719
why the jade pendant was found
in my room.

15
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,264
You're really stubborn.

16
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:42,551
If I accidentally beat you

17
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:44,520
to death later,

18
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:47,556
can I tell people outside

19
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:50,192
you committed suicide out of guilt
in your cell?

20
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,781
Since you're going to kill me,

21
00:02:56,107 --> 00:02:57,575
why bother asking so many questions?

22
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:58,742
Fine.

23
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,789
If you won't take the easy way,

24
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:05,833
here's the hard way.

25
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:09,670
Now, talk.

26
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:12,423
Who are you really?

27
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:14,884
You won't say, right?

28
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:17,219
Fine.

29
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:19,513
Stop!

30
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:22,349
Your Highness.

31
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,149
Who gave you permission to beat her?

32
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:32,902
Your Highness,

33
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,862
this woman's appearance...

34
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:37,698
She must be Lin Yue'er.

35
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:40,534
Killing her would benefit
all three of our families.

36
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:43,120
If Lord Zhengping asks...

37
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:59,053
There must be something suspicious.

38
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,838
Jiangyun,

39
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:04,433
did I report the wrong crime?

40
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,217
Miss Xi, you're the victim of the theft.

41
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,686
How could you be wrong?

42
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:10,940
I know how important
that jade pendant is to you.

43
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,308
If someone is deliberately
framing Miss Tingwu,

44
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:15,778
I believe the authorities will find out.

45
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:18,280
Miss Xi.

46
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:19,981
Feng.

47
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:21,784
Do you also find it suspicious?

48
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:25,120
This jade pendant is the only keepsake
my late mother left me.

49
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,206
It's extremely important to me.

50
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:30,000
However, it's not a priceless item

51
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:31,284
and it shouldn't be

52
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:33,420
so significant to others.

53
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:36,915
I originally thought

54
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,833
it was stolen by
some disobedient servant

55
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,126
out of spite,

56
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,596
so I reported it in a moment of panic.

57
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:44,306
Miss Tingwu

58
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:47,351
has no reason to steal it.

59
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:49,687
Could it be

60
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,314
someone framed her?

61
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:04,660
Prince Zhao

62
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:08,080
really ruined my plan.

63
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:10,740
If that woman is truly Lin Yue'er,

64
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:12,751
does he realize how dangerous
she could be?

65
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,211
General,

66
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,339
we'll have to come up
with another excuse.

67
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,762
General, news from Moon Pavilion says

68
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,307
the new leader of the Xuantian Gang
wants to challenge you.

69
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:27,891
Challenge me?

70
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,385
When has the Xuantian Gang

71
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:33,522
ever been beyond my grasp?

72
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,400
Challenge me?

73
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:38,360
They don't know their place.

74
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:40,779
General, you're invincible!

75
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:33,290
Yue,

76
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:35,167
have something to eat.

77
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:46,470
Yue,

78
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,680
I'll get you out of here.

79
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:51,266
Your Highness, why trouble yourself?

80
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:54,228
We're just in a partnership,
nothing more.

81
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,347
Yue, you know I like you.

82
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:58,774
You've always known.

83
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:02,236
Yue,

84
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:05,239
I care about you more than
Guo Feng ever could.

85
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:07,491
Why do you insist on
keeping me at arm's length?

86
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:09,025
I'll protect you.

87
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:10,619
Trust me, alright?

88
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,624
Your Highness, no need to say so much.

89
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:17,960
Even if you're sincere,

90
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,462
Guo Feng is the only one in my heart.

91
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:33,892
Yue, are you trying to provoke me
on purpose?

92
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:36,553
He locked you up for an entire year.

93
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:38,313
You can't possibly still care about him.

94
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,025
You're only staying by his side
for a reason, right?

95
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:46,405
(Am I really just trying
to provoke Zhao Dinghong?)

96
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,450
Zhao Dinghong,

97
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,202
can you pass a message to Yu for me?

98
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,826
Miss, we found this person
at the back gate

99
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,911
trying to flee with her belongings.

100
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:03,163
You stole the jade pendant

101
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:04,631
and framed Miss Tingwu?

102
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:06,633
What grudge do you have against her?

103
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,178
My husband is suffering
from a severe illness

104
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,888
and needs money for treatment.

105
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,756
So, I coveted the valuables

106
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:15,309
and stole the jade pendant.

107
00:08:15,593 --> 00:08:17,177
I was consumed with fear afterward,

108
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:20,722
so I hid it in Miss Tingwu's room.

109
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:21,931
Nonsense.

110
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:24,401
My jade pendant isn't a valuable item.

111
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,283
You need money?

112
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,702
Who promised you money

113
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:35,245
and lured you into doing this?

114
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:38,415
No one promised me anything.

115
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,792
It was a moment of weakness.

116
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,754
Please spare me this once.

117
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:47,466
It seems

118
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,052
we won't get any more answers.

119
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,220
Sir.

120
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:14,484
General.

121
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,486
The rumors about the bandits and you

122
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:17,570
are getting more rampant.

123
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:19,706
Those barbarians?

124
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:22,158
I could

125
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,753
crush them like ants.

126
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:26,880
General, you're invincible.

127
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:29,165
There's no need to bother with bandits.

128
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,167
Once we've taken care
of the current trouble,

129
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,585
I'll take care of them for you.

130
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:33,845
Good.

131
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:38,007
Reward him.

132
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,351
Thank you, general.

133
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:41,761
But, general...

134
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:42,595
But what?

135
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:44,264
All you ever say is "but."

136
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:45,556
You're so annoying.

137
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:46,608
But.

138
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,110
Say it.

139
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:51,354
They say you're a coward
and even made a song about it.

140
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:53,949
Many officials are urging you
to eradicate the bandits.

141
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:55,492
Or they'll file a report against you.

142
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:58,787
Go.

143
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:00,706
Tell the men

144
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,959
I'm going to wipe out the bandits.

145
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,213
Yes, sir!

146
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:19,766
Once I'm gone,

147
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:20,842
go to the prison

148
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:22,644
and have that woman killed.

149
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:25,731
I don't care if she's Tingwu
or Lin Yue'er.

150
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,482
She must die.

151
00:10:29,018 --> 00:10:30,110
Yes, sir.
