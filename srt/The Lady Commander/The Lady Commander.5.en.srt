00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,666
Your Highness.

4
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,327
Have you found anything
at the Guo mansion?

5
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,829
There is a library there,

6
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,539
but I haven't had a chance
to investigate.

7
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,248
I've learned

8
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,760
Miss Tingwu was a songstress
whom Sir Guo Feng bought from Moon Pavilion.

9
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,380
Keep watching.

10
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,382
Report any news to me immediately.

11
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,550
Rest assured, Your Highness.

12
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,394
I'll remember your kindness forever.

13
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,572
Let go!

14
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,275
Prince Zhao,

15
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,326
why are you here?

16
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,861
It's broad daylight.

17
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,663
Acting like this is improper, isn't it?

18
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,415
You were meant to be my wife,

19
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,333
so why bother

20
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,586
with these pointless formalities?

21
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,289
Your words not only insult me

22
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,341
but also show no respect for Sir Feng.

23
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,168
If someone with ill intentions
hears this,

24
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,503
it could cause trouble for both
the Zhao and Guo families.

25
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,097
I'll take my leave now.

26
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,807
Yue,

27
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,727
you may deceive everyone else,
but you can't deceive me.

28
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,229
Are you in the Guo mansion
for a purpose,

29
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,982
or have you truly fallen for Guo Feng

30
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,234
and rekindled your feelings with him?

31
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,696
Instead of struggling against me,

32
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,823
why not tell me your purpose?

33
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,442
I promise I'll help you.

34
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,077
If you truly wanted to help Lin Yue'er,

35
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,955
you should've done so
three years ago, right?

36
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,125
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

37
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,963
(Yue,)

38
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,798
(you'll see.)

39
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,051
(This time,)

40
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,553
(no one can stop me.)

41
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,052
Sui Ruowei had been oppressing
my mother for years,

42
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,595
relying on her brother, Sui Ruo'an.

43
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,388
If I could've protected
my mother back then,

44
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,441
she wouldn't have died from poisoning.

45
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,027
There's progress
in the Lin family matter.

46
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,519
Your suspicions were correct.

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,072
It's related to Sui Ruo'an.

48
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:53,857
A few days ago,

49
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,993
I captured one of Sui Ruo'an's
former subordinates.

50
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,537
What did he say?

51
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,669
Who's there?

52
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,212
Come out!

53
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,673
Sir.

54
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,343
I was wondering where you had gone.

55
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,720
So, you're hiding here to enjoy
the night breeze?

56
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,888
Well then...

57
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,056
Shall I...

58
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,600
Shall I go?

59
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,316
Sir.

60
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,485
You wanted to see me that badly?

61
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,653
Yes.

The moon here

75
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,240
isn't as beautiful as the moon
in the West.

76
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,118
Do you really love the West?

77
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,869
Of course.

78
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,414
People from the West are
straightforward and passionate,

79
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,823
unlike those here,

80
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,000
cunning and deceitful.

81
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,212
Are you telling me this

82
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,090
because you plan to leave me again?

83
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,630
Sir, are you afraid of losing me?

84
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,307
Are you afraid I'll leave you?

85
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,552
You may go.

86
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,243
You returned to my side.

87
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,745
What are you really after?

88
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,955
If you wanted to kill me,

89
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,209
why didn't you do it sooner?
Could it be...

90
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,360
(Moon Pavilion)

91
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,441
So, Tingwu is indeed Lin Yue'er.

92
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,935
Madam Sui's death must be
related to her.

93
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,530
I need to present the evidence
to the master.

00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,928

of bribery?

95
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,558
