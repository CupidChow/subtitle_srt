00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,039
The last assassination attempt on Yue

4
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,291
must've been planned by Guo Shucheng.

5
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,920
Bai Yu, if you can't protect Yue,

6
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,162
why not let me take her away?

7
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,923
I can't protect Yue'er,

8
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,178
but do you think you can
guarantee her safety?

9
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,840
Yue is resilient.

10
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,006
She has her own reasons
for staying in the Guo mansion.

11
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,393
I advise you not to interfere,

12
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,311
or

13
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,098
Yue will hate you even more
than three years ago.

14
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,568
It's not your place to intervene
what's between me and Yue.

15
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,487
I'm her rightful husband.

16
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,990
If she gets hurt again,
I'll take her away.

17
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,575
And you,

18
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,786
if you've grown tired of living,

19
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,080
I can kill you right now.

20
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:40,701
You seem to have forgotten

21
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,703
your engagement to Yue
was annulled long ago.

22
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,839
If you speak disrespectfully again,

23
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,592
my sword

24
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,470
won't care whether you're a prince.

25
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,446
Duan Fei gave me the mold
you used last time.

26
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,064
I've already made a duplicate key
for the library.

27
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:11,773
This way,

28
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,858
you'll have

29
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,076
more freedom to visit.

30
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,369
Thank you, Yu.

31
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,040
Yu,

32
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,201
do you remember I told you last time

33
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,410
I found

34
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,630
many documents related to Zhao Ruiyang
in the library?

35
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,799
They were hidden in a secret compartment
by Guo Shucheng.

36
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,636
The more I think, the stranger it seems.

37
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,095
Do you think

38
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,339
Zhao Ruiyang might be the mastermind

39
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,933
we've been looking for?

40
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,896
Did you see what was written
on the documents?

41
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,347
I couldn't make it out

42
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,932
before I heard noises outside.

43
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,026
I didn't want to be found,
so I had to leave.

44
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,862
It seems we need to investigate

45
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,781
Guo Shucheng and Zhao Ruiyang's
relationship.

46
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,035
Shh.

47
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,204
Miss.

48
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,789
Miss.

49
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,333
Miss.

50
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,752
Miss.

51
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,587
Sir Feng wants to see you.

52
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,048
So late?

53
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,707
What does he want with me?

54
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,717
Huh?

55
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,418
I don't know either.

56
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,388
Sir Feng asked for you.

57
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,223
I'll change my clothes first.

58
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,772
Never mind.

59
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,807
I don't want to keep Sir Feng waiting.

60
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,808
Yes.

61
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,776
Sure.

62
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,320
What's wrong?

63
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,283
Nothing, I'll close the door.

64
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,168
(Was it my imagination?)

65
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,971
Yue.

66
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,779
Refusing to eat again?

67
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,285
I was afraid you'd be bored,

68
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,995
so I brought it to you.

69
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,238
Are you implying

70
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,458
I'm like this caged bird?

71
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,631
Yue.

72
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,137
Good boy.

73
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,172
Say Tingwu.

74
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,599
Tingwu.

75
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,434
Tingwu.

76
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,926
Tingwu.

77
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,853
Tingwu.

78
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,273
Tingwu.

79
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:50,682
Tingwu.

80
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,776
Tingwu.

81
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,194
Tingwu.

82
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,614
I heard Feng got injured
while saving you.

83
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,531
Yes,

84
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,492
I'm grateful for Sir Feng's kindness.

85
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,535
What kindness?

86
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,403
Don't think you're favored.

87
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,581
Feng doesn't truly love you.

88
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,000
The one he loves isn't you.

89
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,207
Sir Feng must be in love with you then.

90
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,217
I...

91
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,336
I'm saying this for your own good.

92
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,513
Don't be ungrateful.

93
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,391
He only loves that face of yours.

94
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,850
If you get hurt,

95
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,602
don't blame me for not warning you.

96
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,407
Feng,

97
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,076
are you really alright with your injury?

98
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,161
I already told you, I'm fine.

99
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,248
Just a few assassins. Don't worry.

100
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,618
Hao Cheng,

101
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,380
can you assign more guards?

102
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,081
If Feng gets hurt again,

103
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,216
I...

104
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,097
Understood, Your Highness.

105
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,937
Feng,

106
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,805
have you ever thought about

107
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,941
what would happen to Tingwu

108
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,485
if Yue came back one day?

109
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,238
She won't come back.

110
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,532
So,

111
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,410
I guess I only have Tingwu left.

112
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:32,209
(Feng, you still have me.)

113
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,590
The grain official back then...

114
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,011
He's dead?

115
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,345
He's been dead for a while.

116
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,422
Is there no clue on his body?

117
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,432
None.

118
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,477
Do you think these assassins

119
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,937
might be related to the Lin Army?

120
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,473
Why do you think that?

121
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,399
Look,

122
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,818
that grain official transported
supplies back then.

123
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,320
Now he's dead.

124
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,605
He was one of Sui Ruo'an's trusted men.

125
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,325
So I think Sui Ruo'an must be
getting anxious.

126
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,577
So you're saying

127
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,413
Sui Ruo'an fears exposure of
the incident from three years ago.

128
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,458
He's determined Tingwu is Yue,

129
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:13,950
so he'll silence her?

130
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,535
Forget about Sui Ruo'an.

131
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,078
Don't you already believe

132
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,048
she's Miss Lin?

133
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,806
Since she arrived at the Guo mansion,

134
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,724
a lot of things have indeed happened.

135
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,977
Do you think

136
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,855
these are just coincidences?

137
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,920
(One day later)

138
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,970
What are you doing here?

139
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,763
Shh.

140
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,487
That was close.

141
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,983
Did you follow him here?

142
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,410
Yes, let me catch him.

143
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,706
Let's see what he's up to first.

144
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,188
Lift your head.

145
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,692
Speak.

146
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,068
Who sent you?

147
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,070
What's your purpose in coming here?

148
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,906
I...

149
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,699
I was just trying to make a living.

150
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,409
If you're trying to make a living,

151
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,995
then what were you doing in the library?

152
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,738
What exactly are you looking for?

153
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,072
Sir, I...

154
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,584
I was blinded by greed for money.

155
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,909
Nonsense.

156
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,921
Come on, tell me,

157
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,215
what valuable things are in the library?

158
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,300
Hao Cheng,

159
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,135
make him talk.

160
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,178
Understood.

161
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,769
Sir,

162
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,771
he had poison hidden in his teeth.

163
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,564
It's a common practice
among assassins.

164
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,066
Assassin?

165
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,819

investigating the Guo mansion?)
