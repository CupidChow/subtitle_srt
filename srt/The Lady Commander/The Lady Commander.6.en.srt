00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,250
Moon Pavilion owner's confession
of bribery?

4
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,879
You even found this?

5
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,039
If you want to expose Yue's secret,

6
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,633
I can't let you live.

7
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,052
Better luck in your next life.

8
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,120
(Lin Haotian's lieutenant, Bai Yu)

9
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,277
You hid for three years

10
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,145
and now you dare to show.

11
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,239
You're not thinking of
taking Yue away, are you?

12
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,190
I advise you to abandon that thought.

13
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,451
Impossible.

14
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,036
As long as I'm alive,

15
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,321
I won't let her stay by Guo Feng's side.

16
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,832
Yue returned this time

17
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,783
to take revenge on the entire Guo family

18
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,502
and the Sui family.

19
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,840
She knows everything?

20
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,961
No wonder she's changed so much.

21
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,013
I'm here this time

22
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,848
to work with you.

23
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,476
Aren't you looking for something?

24
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,400
(Tranquility Yields Transcendence)

25
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,228
Yanyu, I'm tired.

26
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,521
You may go back.

27
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,449
Yes, miss.

28
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,219
Yu.

29
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,521
Your vigilance is admirable.

30
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,023
But what if it wasn't me
at the door today,

31
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,775
but Guo Feng testing you

32
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,276
instead?

33
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,986
Yu, you're right.

34
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,738
According to Duan Fei,

35
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,615
the Sui family is in disarray.

36
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,450
I think the timing is just about right.

37
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,744
Yes.

38
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,281
Guo Feng has eliminated Sui Ruowei.

39
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,960
If we take care of the grain official
who withheld supplies back then,

40
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,161
Sui Ruo'an will definitely take action.

41
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,547
When that happens,

42
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,383
we'll have leverage
against the Sui family.

43
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,177
You've endured so much,

44
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,762
planning all this.

45
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,338
Yu,

46
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,765
it's my duty

47
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,559
for the Lin Army.

48
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,135
The general was kind to me.

49
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,688
He entrusted you to me,

50
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,773
but I haven't taken good care of you.

51
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,849
I'm ashamed to face the general.

52
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,360
Please don't say that.

53
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:30,978
Back then,

54
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,197
if you hadn't rescued me
from the Guo mansion

55
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,564
and taken me to Wuqu

56
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,108
to investigate the truth from before,

57
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,785
there wouldn't be me today.

58
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,538
By the way, Yue.

59
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,322
Zhao Dinghong knows your true identity.

60
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,541
I spoke with him.

61
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,950
He's willing to help.

62
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,544
If he sincerely wants to help me,

63
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,620
then our revenge plan

64
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,256
will indeed be much easier.

65
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,219
In the battle three years ago,

66
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,147
Wuqu had already retreated,

67
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,807
yet Lin Haotian still died in Shuozhou.

68
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,151
The changes in the situation

69
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,572
couldn't have been accomplished
by Sui Ruo'an alone.

70
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,412
Sui Ruo'an

71
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,372
delayed the reinforcements,

72
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,416
yet he got promoted instead.

73
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,671
There must be someone

74
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,830
supporting him.

75
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,049
Go find out.

76
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,508
