3
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,453
Yue, quickly go inside.

4
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,539
Why aren't you resting on the bed?

5
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,666
What if you pull on your wound?

6
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,167
Yue.

7
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,215
What exactly do you want?

8
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,378
Lieutenant Bai, thank you
for taking care of Yue.

9
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,014
She's the daughter of the general.
Of course I'll take care of her.

10
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,474
It's not your place to thank me.

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,851
Yu,

12
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,352
you should leave.

13
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,855
I'll handle things here myself.

14
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,022
No,

15
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,191
I can't let you be in danger again.

16
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,194
Danger?

17
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,363
It's chaotic outside the mansion.

18
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,116
Do you have the confidence
to protect Yue?

19
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,785
Yu, go now.

20
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,945
I'll take care of everything here.

21
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,247
I know what I'm doing.

22
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,286
If you treat Yue the way you did
three years ago,

23
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,630
I'll burn your entire Guo family
to the ground.

24
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,387
Move aside.

25
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,232
Yue,

26
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,651
you still hate me, don't you?

27
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,863
If you hadn't locked me up,

28
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,574
I wouldn't have missed
seeing my dad one last time.

29
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,580
You've returned to the Guo mansion

30
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,665
and pretended to get along with me

31
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,667
just to seek revenge on me?

32
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,253
What else?

33
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,581
Did you think I came back to rekindle
our past relationship?

34
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,883
So the grain official

35
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,676
and Sui Ruo'an's deaths

36
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,637
have something to do with you?

37
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,974
Of course.

38
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,092
Yue,

39
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,469
you could've told me.

40
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,470
I could've helped you.

41
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,397
I've always been able to help you.

42
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,036
Yue,

43
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,167
are you going to hurt me
with this hairpin a second time?

44
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,962
With this jade hairpin?

45
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,729
To be honest,

46
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,608
I did plan to kill Guo Shucheng.

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,443
But now that I've been discovered,

48
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,612
I won't get another chance.

49
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,197
I see.

50
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,534
If you say you want my help,

51
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,610
then help me find

52
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,913
the Ceasefire Pact your father hid.

53
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,082
Help me bring down the mastermind.

54
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,542
Ceasefire Pact?

55
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,752
As long as I find the pact,

56
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,338
I can spare Guo Shucheng.

57
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,341
After all, he's just a pawn
of the mastermind.

58
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,636
What's the matter?

59
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,555
Are you unwilling?

60
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,311
I'm willing to help you.

61
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,652
(Is that really all you want?)

62
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,988
