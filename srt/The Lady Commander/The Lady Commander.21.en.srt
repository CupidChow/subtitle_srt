=Episode 21=

3
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,919
Miss, this is the meal prepared
for you by His Highness.

4
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,138
Please enjoy it.

5
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,172
Come.

6
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,307
Eat.

7
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,643
Why is there only one portion?

8
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,978
That one is yours.

9
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,780
I'm just following orders.

10
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,365
Stop being picky.

11
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,116
What about mine?

12
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,084
Sit still.

13
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,419
Hey.

14
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,722
Yue.

15
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,141
We don't know how many days
we'll be here.

16
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,851
You can't go hungry.

17
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,145
Here, take this.

18
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,658
Oh, such deep affection between you two.

19
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,911
It's truly disgusting.

20
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,750
Feng,

21
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,679
our father must be having
a headache now.

22
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,892
Do you think he'd save you

23
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,478
or me first?

24
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,438
Your father?

25
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,607
He won't have the chance
to have a headache.

26
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,486
What do you mean?

27
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,322
What do you mean?

28
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,731
Guo Feng!

29
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,783
Guo Feng!

30
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,788
Guards!

31
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,706
Guards!

32
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,628
Guards! Let me out!

33
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,213
Guards!

34
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,834
Your Highness, be careful not to fall.

35
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,003
My father sent my brother to arrest

36
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,004
Feng and Miss Yue.

37
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,547
There must be some misunderstanding.

38
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,267
I need to explain to my father.

39
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,227
This time, you did well.

40
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,179
Three years ago, it was my oversight.

41
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,481
I shouldn't have

42
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,935
handed the letter about eradicating
Lin Haotian to Guo Shucheng.

43
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,239
The leverage was in his hand
for so many years,

44
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,408
almost causing a major disaster.

45
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,817
Everyone involved in that matter

46
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,369
is no longer alive

47
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,788
and all the evidence has been destroyed.

48
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,749
Father, you can now rest easy.

49
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,169
Not bad.

50
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,923
It seems you're not
as useless as I thought.

51
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,552
Go, bring Lin Yue'er to me.

52
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,262
I want to interrogate her.

53
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,773
Miss Lin, please.

54
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,695
Yue.

55
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,120
Yu, don't worry.

56
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,290
Zhao Dinghong won't do anything to me.

57
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,802
If I return safely,

58
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,805
I have something to tell you.

59
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,973
Alright,

60
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,767
you'll come back safely.

61
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,143
I'll wait for you.

62
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,301
You're Lin Yue'er?

63
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:30,481
Yes, I'm Lin Yue'er,
daughter of Lin Haotian.

64
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,724
As expected of a general's daughter,

65
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,017
your courage is commendable.

66
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,487
Zhao Ruiyang, stop pretending!

67
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,730
Years ago, out of your selfish desires,

68
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,315
you instructed Sui Ruo'an

69
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,201
to deceive the Lin Army
of reinforcements,

70
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,080
causing all our soldiers
to die unjustly in Shuozhou.

71
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,042
The Lin family will seek revenge
for this debt.

72
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,578
Even if I fall into hell and suffer
eighteen levels of torture,

73
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,089
I'll never let you go!

74
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,174
Nonsense!

75
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,395
What are you doing?

76
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,147
Planning a rebellion?

77
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,982
Guards!

78
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,525
Guards!

79
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,147
Your Highness,

80
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,032
everything is under control.

81
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,409
Father,

82
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,044
take a good look.

83
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,963
Is there anyone left in the mansion

84
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,299
who listens to you?

85
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,186
Since the day I was born,

86
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,430
you've never looked at me properly.

87
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,432
My two brothers,

88
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,277
one died at the hands of the other,

89
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,446
and then the other died in an accident,

90
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,240
but you blamed it all on me.

91
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,869
Just because my mother was
from a humble family,

92
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,330
you belittled her
publicly and privately,

93
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,916
causing her to die of sorrow.

94
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,667
You ungrateful son!

95
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,785
You just covet my power.

96
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,754
Yes!

97
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,842
Do you want the entire mansion
to die with you?

98
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,177
Huh?

99
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,055
You're unworthy of your title.

100
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,349
The sins of three years ago

101
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,518
are yours to bear.

102
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,228
Why waste words with him?

103
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,486
Zhao Dinghong, you promised me.

104
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,272
I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

105
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,942
Zhao Dinghong, you broke your promise!

106
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,609
Zhao Dinghong!

107
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,369
Take her!

108
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,788
Let me go!

109
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,155
Let me go!

110
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,156
Zhao Dinghong,

111
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,834
you broke your promise!

112
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,627
Zhao Dinghong!

113
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:06,053
I hope my father can live
in the west courtyard of the mansion,

114
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,305
no longer concerning himself
with worldly affairs.

115
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,640
Guards!

116
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,641
Yes?

117
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,518
Escort my father
to the west courtyard.

118
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,561
Yes.

119
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,996
Your Highness, what should we do
with these two?

120
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,756
They know too much.

121
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,050
Understood.

122
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,794
Your Highness.

123
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,098
Your Highness, please spare us!

124
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,893
Let go of me!

125
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,145
Yue, I love you.

126
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,264
There's nothing standing between us now.

127
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,265
I'll marry you.

128
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,400
Let go of me!
