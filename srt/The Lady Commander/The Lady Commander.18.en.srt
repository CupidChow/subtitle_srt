2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 18=

3
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,257
My master is diligent in his duties.

4
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,968
Truly hardworking.

5
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,525
Miss.

6
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:25,936
What's wrong?

7
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,938
Sir Feng has soaked his wound.

8
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,366
No matter how I persuade him,
he refuses to apply medicine.

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,993
Please go and check on him.

10
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,036
That is his own business.

11
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,948
Miss Lin,

12
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,168
I know you hate what happened
three years ago.

13
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,661
Sir Feng did it to protect you.

14
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,246
At that time, someone wanted
to harm you.

15
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,549
He hid you in the mansion
to keep you safe.

16
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,092
He truly loves you.

17
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,803
Someone?

18
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Was it Guo Shucheng?

19
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,683
No, we've been investigating that now.

20
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,729
Your hand...

21
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,108
Sir, you could clearly
explain things to her.

22
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,152
Why didn't you clarify?

23
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,529
She can misunderstand me
however she likes.

24
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,241
I just want her to be safe.

25
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,746
I see.

26
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,464
What you said earlier

27
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,424
is true?

28
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,838
He even put a sword to my neck.

29
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,465
I had to pretend to cooperate with him.

30
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,559
I never intended to kill you.

31
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,770
I only resented you

32
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,397
and wanted to create some small trouble.

33
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,579
What are you doing?

34
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,624
Apply the medicine.

35
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,495
Sir.

36
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,372
Sir.

37
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,009
Sir.

38
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:57,629
What happened?

39
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,723
What's going on?

40
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,683
The master has passed away.

41
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,518
What?

42
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,036
How could this happen?

43
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,456
What's happened to you?

44
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,377
Master, what's wrong?

45
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,465
Be gentle.

46
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,716
How is it?

47
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,628
The cause of Master Guo's death

48
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,671
is still unclear.

49
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,807
We'll do our utmost to investigate.

50
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,384
Where has Ji gone?

51
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,604
Why hasn't he returned all night?

52
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,389
With such a big incident at home,

53
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,442
why hasn't he showed up?

54
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,028
No need to search for him.

55
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,646
Yesterday, my brother was arrested
at Moon Pavilion for killing

56
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,948
by the authorities

57
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,700
The evidence is conclusive.

58
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,703
He's probably in prison now.

59
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,330
What...

60
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,625
Miss, what should we do?

61
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,350
Yue.

62
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,033
Yue,

63
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,327
this matter concerns you,

64
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,995
doesn't it?

65
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,042
The master is dead,

66
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,962
yet you're still here flirting with me.

67
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,297
Aren't you afraid of
being branded as unfilial?

68
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,299
(Yue,)

69
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,676
(you came back this time)

70
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,138
(just to deceive and use me?)

71
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,984
Sir,

72
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,153
what should

73
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,363
be done next?

74
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,414
Manage the servants and slaves
in the mansion.

75
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,626
They mustn't speak a word outside,

76
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,171
or they'll be fined a year's allowance.

77
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,297
Yes.

78
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,966
Tell Housekeeper Lou,

79
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,553
the funeral rites mustn't be delayed.

80
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,097
I'll give him a day and a half.

81
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,143
If he is still in this state tomorrow,

82
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,979
I'll send him out of the mansion.

83
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,816
Understood.

84
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,784
Little Fish, eat more.

85
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,995
This is the last time I'm feeding you.

86
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,580
Yue.

87
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,164
Yu.

88
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,243
Let's go.

89
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,211
Miss Lin,

90
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,204
you're leaving

91
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,173
but won't even say goodbye to Sir Feng?

92
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,718
Yue, let's go.

93
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,640
Hao Cheng, my decision is made.

94
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,933
Don't stop me anymore.

95
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,439
I came to the Guo mansion
with my own purpose.

96
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,265
Now that the purpose has been achieved,

97
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,641
there's no need for me to stay.

98
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,527
No need, is it?

99
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,280
Miss Lin,

100
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,408
you're heartless towards Sir Feng,
aren't you?

101
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,736
I have no feelings for him at all,

102
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,496
not even a trace.

103
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,541
Staying here will only make me
more uncomfortable.

104
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,501
So,

105
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,587
please let me leave.

106
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,432
