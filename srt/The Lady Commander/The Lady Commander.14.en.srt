00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 14=

3
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:15,393
(It seems protection,
but it's actually surveillance.)

4
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,020
(Guo Feng.)

5
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,690
Tingwu.

6
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,822
Tingwu.

7
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,818
Shouldn't you be talking
with the master in the study?

8
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,786
Tingwu,

9
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,363
the Guo mansion is no longer safe.
If your identity...

10
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,623
Your Highness, rest assured.

11
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,367
I won't leave
until I find what I'm looking for.

12
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,118
But...

13
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,628
I appreciate your concern,

14
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,213
but I must take my leave.

15
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,769
What?

16
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,564
Zhao Dinghong?

17
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,691
How long did they talk?

18
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,485
Just a little while.

19
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,313
Continue following her.

20
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,948
Act when you get the chance.

21
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,116
Understood.

22
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,039
(Did Zhao Ruiyang)

23
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,374
(no longer trust me?)

24
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,361
Lieutenant Bai, thank you
for your tireless efforts.

25
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,529
Please make sure

26
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,489
to rest well.

27
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,065
I still have military duties

28
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,158
and can't stay long.

29
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,160
General Lin is waiting for me.

30
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,029
Please ensure this is safely
escorted to the capital

31
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,206
and to His Majesty.

32
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,520
(Government Office)

33
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,136
Yah!

34
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,935
(If Wuqu doesn't wage war against
the Central Plains for 30 years,)

35
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,771
(there won't be any profit
from the military funds.)

36
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,182
(Rather than allowing him
to return victorious,)

37
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:31,320
(Ceasefire Pact)
(better to act like it never happened.)

38
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,566
(I don't think Zhao Ruiyang noticed
something suspicious.)

39
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,662
(It's not wise
to confront him directly right now.)

40
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:44,458
(I should first deal with that matter.)

41
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,310
You mean Yue and Zhao Dinghong spoke?

42
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,361
Yes.

43
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,562
Thinking back,

44
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,198
on the Lantern fair, Zhao Dinghong
was with Lieutenant Bai.

45
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,366
Could it be...

46
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,535
The Zhao family...

47
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,039
Inform our men

48
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,457
to be cautious.

49
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,615
Report anything unusual

50
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,533
to me immediately.

51
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,543
Understood.

52
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,965
Feng.

53
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,042
Ziying, you came.

54
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,135
Hmm.

55
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,386
Sit.

56
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,974
What's the matter?

57
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,979
There's something.

58
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,732
My father said he's choosing
an auspicious date for us.

59
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,725
Feng,

60
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,018
when do you think

61
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,478
our wedding date

62
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,197
would be most suitable?

63
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,523
The timing of the wedding

64
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,034
isn't something I can decide.

65
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,293
Actually...

66
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,213
I can accept Miss Tingwu.

67
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,456
I know she looks a lot like Miss Yue.

68
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,124
You've never been able to forget her.

69
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,552
I promise I'll treat her well.

70
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,722
Our marriage was arranged by our elders.

71
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,349
They'll make the decision.

72
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,559
You just need to wait for the wedding.

73
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,936
Everything else

74
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,355
is beyond our control.

75
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,234
(You never mention her,)

76
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,653
(but she's the only one)

77
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,738
(in your heart.)

78
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,278
Why are you bringing me here?

79
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,415
You once promised to marry me here.

80
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,667
I don't remember.

81
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,467
Do you remember now?

82
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,224
How has Yue been

83
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,976
lately?

84
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,511
Has she found the tiger amulet?

85
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,898
Don't rush her. Pushing won't help.

86
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,186
Is Yue really seeking revenge
on Guo Shucheng?

87
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,279
What else

88
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,281
could it be?

89
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,077
Oh, right.

90
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,122
Guo Feng has discovered Yue's identity.

91
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,281
So,

92
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,032
if you can,

93
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,867
don't go to her to cause her
more trouble.

94
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,127
What did you say?

95
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,837
No way.

96
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,038
That jerk Guo Feng,

97
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,132
who knows what he might do?

98
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,176
Yue can't stay at the Guo mansion
any longer.

99
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,511
Your Highness,

100
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,971
are you planning to storm
the Guo mansion

101
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,140
with your troops again?

102
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,911
What's wrong, Sir Ji?

103
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,923
How have I offended you

104
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,425
that you now want to take my life?

105
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,094
Tingwu?

106
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,430
Aren't you Lin Yue'er?

107
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,516
Ever since you entered our family,

108
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,560
my mother and uncle have both died.

109
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,386
If you aren't Lin Yue'er,

110
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,230
why would Feng be
so concerned about you?

111
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,069
I'm tired of hearing you
tell me over and over

112
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,071
how much he loves that woman.

113
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,656
I hate him.

114
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,576
I hate him for treating me
as someone else's substitute.

115
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,370
Well acted.

116
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,832
But who you are doesn't matter to me.

117
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,407
What matters

118
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,709
is that if I kill you,

119
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,128
Feng will be devastated

120
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,922
and lose all interest in competing
for the family inheritance.

121
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,958
Do you have any last words?

122
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,386
I can reluctantly pass them on for you.

123
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,555
What if I say

124
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,058
I'm willing to ally with you?

125
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,982
Go on.

126
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,653
Since we both hate him,

127
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,363
I'm willing to help you

128
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,825
make the master lose all hope in him.

129
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,693
Why should I believe you?

130
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,995
I hate him.

131
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,030
If I can't have his love,

132
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,665
I'll punish him for it.

133
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,461
Since we're an alliance,

134
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,672
what's your plan?

135
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,344
You only need to put on a show
with Changshi.

136
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,679
Poison Guo Feng's soup

137
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,390
and make sure Hao Cheng finds out.

138
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,133
Let Hao Cheng find out?

139
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,810
Of course, he must find out,

140
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,897
because you won't actually
poison the soup.

141
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,599
When Guo Feng hears of this,

142
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,859
to suppress you,

143
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,602
he'll go to the master to report it.

144
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,230
At that point, you just need to
drink the soup in front of the master

145
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:53,035
and Guo Feng will be guilty
of falsely accusing his brother.

146
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,915
Brilliant!

147
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,380
I'll trust you for now.

148
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,175
Brilliant!

149
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,927
Truly brilliant!

150
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,100
(Guo Feng,)

151
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,685
(with your intelligence,)

152
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,812
(you should be able)

153
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,439
(to detect the scheme
without my warning, right?)

154
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,116
Yue, I've found out.

155
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,909
Zhao Ruiyang really is suspicious?

156
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,030
The person who was
transporting military funds to Shuozhou

157
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,658
was demoted to the Lingnan region
two years ago.

158
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,793
As soon as he arrived,

159
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,004
he was killed.

160
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,455
The killer was Zhao Ruiyang's
trusted aide,

161
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,424
Huang Mao.

162
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,292
It seems Zhao Ruiyang embezzled
the military funds.

163
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,346
With no war, there's no need
for military funds.

164
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,338
Right now,

165
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,840
only by finding the Ceasefire Pact

166
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,559
can we bring down the mastermind.

167
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,185
We need to move quickly,

168
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,262
Yu,

169
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,149
the most urgent task is
to keep Zhao Dinghong stable.
