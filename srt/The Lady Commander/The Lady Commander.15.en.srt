=Episode 15=

3
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,568
Yue.

4
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,486
It's you.

5
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,322
(Oh no, he got here first.)

6
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,951
There's nothing here you're looking for.

7
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,694
Guo Shucheng

8
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,705
is much more cunning than we imagined.

9
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,167
If you don't believe me,

10
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,335
search all you want.

11
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,506
Enough. There's no need to be here.
Excuse me.

12
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,508
Yue,

13
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,177
how have you been lately?

14
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,046
No need to worry about me.

15
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,516
Guo Feng already knows
your true identity.

16
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,218
You're well aware the Guo mansion
is a pit of fire.

17
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,021
If you don't leave, it'll be too late.

18
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,431
Let go of me.

19
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,150
I know what you're trying to do.

20
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,027
Why not leave the next steps to me?

21
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,779
Do you really think Guo Feng
would turn against

22
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,406
his own father for you?

23
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,700
You should know how to choose.

24
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:16,737
Let go!

25
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,538
Let her go!

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,508
Prince Zhao,

27
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,844
you love barging into my mansion,
don't you?

28
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,933
Your Highness,

29
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,520
I've told you more than once

30
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,188
I don't know you.

31
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,024
No need for you to chase me
all the way here.

32
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,612
That's no matter.

33
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,156
But that day

34
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,117
under the bridge, you didn't say that,
did you?

35
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,747
It seems you're only imagining things.

36
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,804
You guessed right.

37
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,014
He's known my identity all along.

38
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,562
(It turns out I'm the only one
who's been)

39
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,063
(kept in the dark.)

40
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,807
He figured it out on his own.

41
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,016
It has nothing to do with me.

42
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,027
I only wanted to use him.

43
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,739
What are you doing?

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,911
You just wanted to use him?

45
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,330
Or have you fallen for him?

46
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,499
No wonder

47
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,626
you've been so cold towards me.

48
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,252
I've never had feelings for him.

49
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,555
My revenge remains unfulfilled.
How can I think about that?

50
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,859
Her revenge is unfulfilled

51
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,745
and I'm the son of her enemy.

52
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,947
Perhaps that's why she's cold toward me.

53
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,333
Cold?

54
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,085
I'd say Miss Lin cares about you.

55
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,464
Hmm, just a feeling.

56
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,719
I wonder if she's really lost her desire
to kill my father.

57
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,805
Keep a close watch on her.

58
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,131
Rest assured.

59
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,883
I'll assign more people to monitor her

60
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,935
and ensure her protection.

61
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,428
Don't worry.

62
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,814
The one who understands you is me.

63
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,941
I know what I'm doing.

64
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,519
Sir,

65
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,396
you're truly a genius.

66
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,939
We switched the poisoned soup in time,

67
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,232
turning the tables on Sir Ji

68
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,951
and causing him
to lose the master's trust.

69
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,121
Father has no time to deal with

70
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,624
Guo Ji's little tricks now.

71
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,585
Yanyu.

72
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:11,921
Sir.

73
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,301
Didn't I return this qin to Yue?

74
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,086
Sir,

75
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,138
I don't know either.

76
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,298
Yesterday, Miss Tingwu instructed me

77
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,185
to take care of it and then return it.

78
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,400
Sir,

79
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,986
it seems you misunderstood
Miss Lin, didn't you?

80
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,063
What did I misunderstand?

81
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,108
Miss Lin entered our Guo mansion
under the guise of Tingwu.

82
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,942
What was her purpose?

83
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,069
To deceive others, of course.

84
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,736
Besides,

85
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,072
who would keep their beloved item
with them every day?

86
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,958
Wouldn't that draw
unnecessary attention?

87
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,286
Is that how you see it?

88
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,955
Oh, sir,

89
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,540
aren't you usually

90
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,083
a very clever person?

91
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,584
Why do you become so confused

92
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,679
whenever Miss Lin is involved?

93
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,516
The more important the item,
the less you can keep it close.

94
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,438
The more important the item,
the less you can keep it close...

95
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,814
Sir?

96
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,764
Well...

97
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,443
Hao Cheng, I think I know
where the Ceasefire Pact is.

98
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,370
(Madam Sui's room has been empty
for a long time.)

99
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,824
(Could it be...)

100
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,240
(Ceasefire Pact)

101
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,920
(Ceasefire Pact)

102
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,829
Hao Cheng,

103
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,415
do you think I should
give this box to Yue?

104
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,962
Once this item appears,

105
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,080
who knows how it'll affect Bianyang,

106
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,132
even the imperial court.

107
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,000
It's too dangerous.

108
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,636
I understand your concern.

109
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,921
You're worried Miss Lin

110
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,682
might get herself into trouble.

111
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,342
But she's already entangled in this.

112
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,344
Besides, you've taken her things.

113
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,521
If you don't return them,

114
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,273
won't she resent you?

115
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,569
The deaths of Sui Ruo'an
and the grain official

116
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,363
have already alerted countless people

117
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,574
and disrupted many people's profits.

118
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,701
But

119
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,953
that's not what worries me the most.

120
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,873
Then what worries you?

121
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,084
If I don't give it to her,

122
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,618
she'll blame and resent me.

123
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,296
But if I do give it to her

124
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,131
and she continues investigating,

125
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,926
I fear we might reach a point
of no return.

126
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,013
