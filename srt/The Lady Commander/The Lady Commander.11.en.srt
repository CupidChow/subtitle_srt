=Episode 11=

3
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,203
Die now!

4
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,667
I...

5
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,211
Prince Zhao!

6
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,036
I'm so sorry.

7
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,496
I nearly hurt you.

8
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,798
It's merely a theft charge.

9
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,499
There are still doubts about the case.

10
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,708
The truth hasn't been uncovered.

11
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,302
Are you trying to silence her?

12
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,680
The truth has been uncovered.

13
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,928
I'm Maid Qi.

14
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,605
Who told you to speak?

15
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,900
The real thief has confessed.

16
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,694
Now can we release her?

17
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,240
Yes, sir.

18
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,360
Why are you still there?

19
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,288
Hurry up, go!

20
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,544
Tingwu, are you hurt?

21
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,213
I'm too late.

22
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,808
Let's go.

23
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,983
That old hag Qi...

24
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,785
She really can't handle pressure.

25
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,787
It's my fault.

26
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,248
I've failed my uncle's trust.

27
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,161
From now on, it'll be much harder

28
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,630
to deal with Tingwu.

29
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,998
Sir Ji, no need to get angry.

30
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,343
It seems that old hag Qi knows better

31
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,053
than to implicate you.

32
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,186
I think Feng

33
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,564
must've figured out
I was the mastermind.

34
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,318
I need to keep uncle calm.

35
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,820
My mother's death was suspicious.

36
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,281
If I want to deal with Feng
in the future,

37
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,408
I'll need uncle's support.

38
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,666
Something doesn't feel right.

39
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,668
How much longer
until we reach Xiaxi Village?

40
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,461
Three more miles.

41
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,803
Stay alert.

42
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,919
General Sui, you finally decided
to show your face.

43
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,672
I thought you were scared.

44
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,632
A few lowly bandits

45
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,635
dare to challenge me?

46
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,388
Do you know what an execution
feels like?

47
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,646
The fog is poisonous.

48
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,275
Call for backup.

49
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,651
Yes.

50
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,528
Yah!

51
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,904
Yah!

52
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,237
What did you say?

53
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,372
Say it again.

54
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,541
General Sui

55
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,126
sent word,

56
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,286
he's gone to deal with the bandits.

57
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,547
You should wait for news of his victory.

58
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,165
He also said

59
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,543
the other matter has already been
taken care of,

60
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,679
so you can rest assured.

61
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,672
Someone must've

62
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,642
deliberately provoked him.

63
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,885
I haven't traced

64
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,520
the source of the information yet,

65
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,648
but he's already gone.

66
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,191
How long has he been gone?

67
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,985
About two hours.

68
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,031
That idiot!

69
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,744
Yanyu,

70
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,162
you may leave.

71
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,499
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,098
What's wrong?

73
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,517
I can do it myself.

74
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm just helping you apply medicine.

75
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,939
I didn't expect you to be shy.

76
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,182
Were all those

77
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,151
little tricks you played on me

78
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,945
just an act?

79
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,200
I'm just worried the blood
will scare you.

80
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,958
I'm not scared of blood.

81
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,419
I'd rather be the one

82
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,254
