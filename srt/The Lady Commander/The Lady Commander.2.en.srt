00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,260
=Episode 2=

3
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,581
Miss?

4
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,918
Miss me so soon?

5
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,066
So, you prefer this identity.

6
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,487
Sir,

7
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,573
where did you go?

8
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,866
I searched everywhere for you.

9
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,993
First you saved me

10
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,995
and now you've left me there.

11
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,469
If you came to find me,

12
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,055
why did you turn away?

13
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,560
I was afraid of ruining your mood.

14
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,023
Aren't you scared?

15
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,274
Or do you know something?

16
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,907
I am.

17
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,368
Aren't you here to protect me?

18
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,965
I've been so badly hurt.

19
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,300
Why didn't you come see me?

20
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,593
If I died,

21
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,886
would you be sad?

22
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,304
If you died,

23
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,764
I'd only be happier.

24
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,373
(The Guo family,)

25
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,540
(the Sui family,)

26
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,836
(I'll make sure you both pay.)

27
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,009
Are you certain Guo Feng
brought a concubine home?

28
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,052
Is this true?

29
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,136
Absolutely.

30
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,889
A fellow villager from Moon Pavilion
told me.

31
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,974
Guo Feng never respected me

32
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,059
as the madam of the house
all these years.

33
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,186
He even blames his mother's death on me.

34
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,312
It's ridiculous.

35
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,690
Does he think marrying Princess Zhao

36
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,943
can elevate his mother's memorial tablet
above the Sui family?

37
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,900
(Madam of the Guo family, Sui Ruowei)

38
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,826
Lin Yue'er?

39
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,871
You're that concubine
from the Western Regions.

40
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,498
I'm from the Western Regions.

41
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,624
My name is Tingwu.

42
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,418
Greetings, madam.

43
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,169
What Tingwu?

44
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,088
Aren't you Lin Yue'er?

45
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,339
Stop pretending.

46
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,507
Nanny Kong!

47
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,049
Yes.

48
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:00,675
Slap her!

49
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,682
Is there no order in this household?

50
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,725
Someone!

51
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,184
Madam,

52
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,105
whom do you want to summon?

53
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,359
I lived freely
in the Western Regions.

54
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,736
I didn't know the rules here.

55
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,863
If I've offended you,

56
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,114
punish me as you see fit.

57
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:23,948
Oh,

58
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,327
you've been through the brothels.

59
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,913
You put on airs when men are around.

60
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,165
You even dared come to my house

61
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,291
and bully my people.

62
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,751
Guo Feng,

63
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,337
do you also want to ride above my head?

64
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,006
If you stayed back in your courtyard,

65
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,342
Tingwu wouldn't have offended you.

66
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,440
(Daughter of Lord Zhengping)
She's just arrived and hasn't recovered.

67
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,304
(Zhao Ziying)
As for me,

68
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,555
my father is still alive.

69
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,766
How could I ride above you?

70
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,200
Do you have any sense of propriety?

71
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,815
Feng, you...

72
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,902
Miss Yue?

73
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,779
You've returned?

74
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,072
Her name is Tingwu.

75
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,114
She's from the West.

76
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,701
Tingwu?

77
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,496
They look just the same.

78
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,456
Go tell my brother

79
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,167
I'll investigate this woman's identity.

80
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:16,751
Yes.

81
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,179
So even Miss Tingwu can blush.

82
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,268
With someone like you

83
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,104
so elegant and handsome

84
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,523
who just saved me from danger,

85
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,733
which girl wouldn't blush?

86
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,918
Just now, when dealing with Nanny Kong,

87
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,295
you didn't seem so delicate.

88
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,184
Yue.

89
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,856
Even on the bed, you say
your old lover's name?

While I'm not around,

93
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,198
don't provoke Madam Sui.

94
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,639
Father,

95
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,600
I have something to discuss with you.

96
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,893
May I come in?

97
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,231
Come in.

98
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,456
What is it?

99
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,500
About me taking a concubine,

100
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,918
I suppose you don't know yet.

101
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,213
She's a pipa master
from the Western Regions,

102
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,172
whose name is Tingwu.

103
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,591
But what surprised me is,

104
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,302
Tingwu was attacked by masked men
a few days ago.

105
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,429
Father,

106
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,849
do you think our guards are too weak

107
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,353
or is this an inside job?

108
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,524
You're implying something.

109
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,568
Father, please don't overthink it.

110
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,487
I only wish to ask you

111
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,739
to allow me to add a few more guards
within the mansion.

112
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,368
After all, if something
happens to Tingwu,

113
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,579
there are bound to be people
spreading rumors.

114
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,791
They might say
Princess Zhao couldn't tolerate her,

115
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,585
leading to a reputation of jealousy

116
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,212
and carelessness with lives...

117
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,213
Enough!

118
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,049
I won't disturb you further.

119
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,551
I take my leave.

120
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,854
This jerk is really driving me mad.

121
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,030
Yanyu, I'm so bored.

122
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,200
Shall we go to the library
and get some picture books?

123
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,160
The library is heavily guarded

124
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,245
and locked all year round.

125
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,080
No one is allowed in and out at will.

126
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,708
Only the master
and the two young sirs have the key.

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,460
If you really want
to read picture books,

128
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,004
why not ask Sir Feng?

129
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,187
(The key should be in his clothes.)

130
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,275
Since you're here,

131
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,610
come down and join me.

132
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,545
What are you doing here?

133
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,554
What do you think I'm doing here?

134
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,353
Wait for me outside.

135
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,410
(They look so much alike,)

136
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,413

different personalities.)
