1
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,664
What a satisfying outcome!

4
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,834
Sui Ruo'an,

5
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,336
you've oppressed my Xuantian Gang
for over ten years,

6
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,671
but today, I've finally

7
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,548
gotten my revenge!

8
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:11,013
Brother, that girl's strategy
was indeed brilliant.

9
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,016
Master!

10
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,884
Bad news!

11
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,270
What's so urgent?

12
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,731
General Sui was killed

13
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,933
by the bandits!

14
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,068
What?

15
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,031
Sui Ruo'an's death

16
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,702
can't be a coincidence.

17
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,531
Quickly, prepare my carriage!

18
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,031
Yes.

19
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:38,782
Hurry!

20
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,085
Someone, prepare the carriage!

21
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,894
(Why is he acting so strange today?)

22
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,232
You're done eating?

23
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,442
Just one more bite.

24
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,985
One more.

25
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,839
Sir.

26
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,090
What's going on?

27
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,342
Sui Ruo'an is dead.

28
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,469
(Sui Ruo'an, your life belongs
to the Lin Army now.)

29
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:48,320
(Guo mansion)

30
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,331
Hao Cheng,

31
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,209
instruct everyone to close all doors
and windows

32
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,418
and to remain silent.

33
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,420
If they hear anything, stay calm.

34
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,632
I trust my brother
has no objections to this.

35
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,217
Understood.

36
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,758
What did you just say?

37
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,440
What do you mean Tingwu is actually Yue?

38
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,928
Zou Xu found the owner of Moon Pavilion.

39
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,929
During the interrogation,

40
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,555
he revealed Tingwu had given him money

41
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,817
and claimed to be a pipa master
from the West.

42
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,850
I found Miss Lin

43
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,561
has been close to a man in black,

44
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,990
whom she seems to call Yu.

45
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,702
Yu?

46
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,036
Yu.

47
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,080
Bai Yu?

48
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,332
Lin Haotian's lieutenant.

49
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,840
So, her return

50
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,593
is indeed for revenge.

51
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,976
Lock the doors.

52
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,160
(Lord Zhengping)
What do you make

53
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,409
(Zhao Ruiyang)
of the grain official

54
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,286
and Sui Ruo'an's death?

55
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,500
A pond that's been still for three years

56
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,712
suddenly begins to ripple.

57
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,425
Who is it that's stirring things up

58
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,210
in Bianyang?

59
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,721
Your Highness, don't worry.

60
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,848
I have a grasp of the situation.

61
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,311
If you truly had a grasp of it,

62
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,981
how could so many things
have gone wrong?

63
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,935
My second son recently took a concubine.

64
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,321
Guo Shucheng,

65
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,282
you dare to bring that up?

66
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,494
Ziying's wedding is imminent.

67
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,403
You already owe me an explanation.

68
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,580
Your Highness,

69
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,208
what if this woman

70
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,867
has a face exactly

71
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,711
like Lin Yue'er's?

72
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,352
So, after three years of being missing,

73
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,690
she turns up in your mansion?

74
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,987
Your Guo mansion

75
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,448
is small.

76
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,617
If she escapes,

77
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,620
you won't be able

78
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,456
to show your face in Bianyang again.

79
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,625
Handle it yourself.

80
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,461
Your Highness,

81
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,213
rest assured.

82
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,012
If this pond has been muddied,

83
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,765
it won't be easy to clear it.

84
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,185
The fish in it

85
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,813
won't survive.

86
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,141
Instead of trying to stay out of it,

87
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,736
wouldn't it be better
to leap out of the water

88
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,323
and bite the one stirring it up?

89
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,285
Don't you think?

90
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,204
I understand,

91
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,998
Your Highness.

92
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,460
Good.

93
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,756
By the way,

94
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,637
have you picked a good date

95
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,183
for Ziying and Guo Feng's wedding?

96
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,519
Take care of everything else.

97
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,455
Master,

98
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,174
you look exhausted.

99
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,760
In this treacherous world of politics,

100
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,597
no one can remain pure forever.

101
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,769
Master, you're overthinking things.

102
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,646
Look,

103
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,607
this is lotus soup
from Yunxian Pavilion,

104
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,308
untainted by the mud it grows in,

105
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,435
with a light and sweet taste.

106
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,988
It's always been your favorite.

107
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,274
If you ever need some purity,

108
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,109
I'll have them bring

109
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,704
as much as you want.

110
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,460
You old rascal!

111
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,879
Please get in the carriage, master.

112
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,590
Yu, why are you here?

113
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,725
It's so chaotic outside.

114
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,009
Sit down.

115
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,854
I heard you were injured.

116
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,179
Are you alright?

117
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,314
I'm fine.

118
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:21,309
The Guo family ordered
doors and windows shut.

119
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,736
Yu, you shouldn't have come.

120
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,321
With Sui Ruo'an dead,

121
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,906
everyone in Bianyang is on edge.

122
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,607
No one will pay attention to me.

123
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,618
Sui Ruo'an never understood

124
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,037
why his soldiers betrayed him.

125
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,622
He was arrogant

126
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,165
and foolish.

127
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,334
Or he wouldn't have been so easily used,

128
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,161
serving the one behind the scene
and Guo Shucheng.

129
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,007
Now, I let him die in the same way

130
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,843
to comfort my dad's spirit in heaven

131
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,637
and the souls of thousands
of Lin Army soldiers.

132
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,182
We must still find the Ceasefire Pact

133
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,726
and then kill Guo Shucheng.

134
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,896
Take care of yourself.

135
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,414
