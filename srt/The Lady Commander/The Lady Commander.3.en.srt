00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,620
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,027
Your Highness, you may not know,

4
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,446
but the master is out
handling some matters.

5
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:56,282
(Housekeeper of the Guo mansion)
He'll return the day after tomorrow.

6
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,740
(Mr. Lou)
We ask for your understanding.

7
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,860
(Son of Lord Zhengping, Zhao Dinghong)

8
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,795
Come and take a look.

9
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,131
Fun stuff here.

10
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,888
Be extra careful in the Guo mansion.

11
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,390
Has Guo Feng suspected you?

12
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,808
Even if he has suspicions,

13
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,809
I can handle it.

14
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,894
Guo Shucheng isn't easy to deal with.

15
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,980
Once you obtain
the ceasefire pact, leave.

16
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,356
As for the Sui family,

17
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,691
I'll take care of them.

18
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,401
The Guo and Sui families are close.

19
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,194
Separating them won't be easy.

20
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,362
Act accordingly.

21
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,547
Stop the carriage.

22
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,138
Yue?

23
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,642
Yue, it's really you!

24
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,518
You've returned!

25
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,312
When did you come back?

26
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,231
Come with me.

27
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,650
I'll take you to a safe place.
It's close to the Guo mansion.

28
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,778
Sir,

29
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,739
have you mistaken me for someone else?

30
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm not the girl you speak of.

31
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,911
You've forgotten me?

32
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:24,787
That's alright.

33
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,873
Yue, you know I'd never harm you.

34
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,540
Come with me.

35
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,419
I truly am not the girl you speak of.

36
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,253
Please believe me.

37
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,254
I'll protect you, Yue.

38
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:33,838
Yue.

39
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,214
I'm not.

40
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,423
Your Highness, didn't you hear?

41
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,473
She said she isn't Yue.

42
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,309
Yue,

43
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,436
did you return for him?

44
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,521
Don't you remember
how he treated you before?

45
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,527
Why can't you let her go?

46
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,243
Zhao Dinghong,

47
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,662
are you mad?

48
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,290
Open your eyes wide
and take a good look.

49
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,334
Her name is Tingwu

50
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,211
and she's my new concubine.

51
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:13,711
You...

52
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,420
Your Highness,

53
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,048
I think

54
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,299
you've got it wrong.

55
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,635
I've just arrived here

56
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,929
and we've never met before.

57
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,110
Go home first.

58
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,945
Tomorrow, I'll personally bring you out.

59
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,420
(Guo mansion)

60
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,386
Sir, I didn't mean to gossip,

61
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,846
but from my observations,

62
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,931
Miss Tingwu has been sneaking around
in the mansion

63
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,183
and often tries to pry information
from Yanyu and me.

64
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,020
She's likely not as simple
as she appears.

65
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,940
So, it seems you know quite a bit.

66
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,942
I strictly follow your orders, sir,

67
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,652
and would never slack off.

68
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,493
I don't want to see her
in the mansion.

69
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,244
Understood.

70
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,955
Sir, I know nothing

71
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,123
and will say nothing.

72
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,499
Please spare me.

73
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,667
Spare me!

74
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,545
Fish.

75
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,257
How leisurely you are.

76
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,386
The wind is picking up;
go fetch me a cloak.

77
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:47,889
Madam.

78
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,142
Tell me, you disappeared
and faked your death three years ago

79
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,644
then returned as the top courtesan
of Moon Pavilion.

80
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,730
Now you've let Guo Feng
bring you into the mansion.

81
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,357
What is your true intention?

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,360
Madam, what do you mean by this?

83
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,236
Stop pretending.

84
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,239
Don't you think I can tell
you're Lin Yue'er?

85
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,867
Do you think we're fools?

86
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,400
I've long seen through your act.

87
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,622
Tell me, what are you doing

88
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,082
in our mansion?

89
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,752
Madam, you must be joking.

90
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,295
I'm not

91
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,547
the Lin Yue'er you speak of.

92
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,341
You insolent fool.

93
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,509
How dare you deny it?

94
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,594
Who would sell themselves for art

95
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,429
if not for survival?

96
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,350
I long for the stability
and prosperity of a big household.

97
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,643
Moreover,

98
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,771
I've been admiring a clever

99
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,481
and handsome man like Sir Feng.

100
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,607
How ridiculous!

101
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,068
In Bianyang, there are countless nobles

102
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,986
and you set your sights

103
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,364
on a mere concubine's son
who's already engaged?

104
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,451
I actually have my eye on the master.

105
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,287
I wonder if the master would be willing
to take me as his concubine?

106
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,584
Dream on!

107
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,086
Madam.

108
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,212
If I get rid of her,

109
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,214
I'll be getting rid of Guo Feng too.

110
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,257
Exactly.

111
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,260
She dares to seduce the master.

112
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,220
Make her disappear.

113
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,595
Yes.

114
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,766
Don't be angry, madam.

115
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,684
Guo Feng aside,

116
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,018
what's that concubine anyway?

117
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,320
(Elder son of the Guo family, Guo Ji)
Feng is really troublesome.

118
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,442
He seems to be investigating

119
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,485
the events from three years ago.

120
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,695
After all,

121
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,156
the master doesn't care much
about this concubine's son.

122
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,324
Why don't we just...

123
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:31,909
Madam,

124
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,744
this won't be easy.

125
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,581
(Chief maid of Madam Sui)
His bodyguard Hao Cheng is skilled.

126
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,083
(Nanny Kong)
He never leaves Sir Feng's side.

127
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,043
How do we act?

128
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,211
Lure him away.

129
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,005
Mother,

130
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,215
there's a man named Zou Xu

131
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,010
who's been helping Guo Feng
outside the city.

132
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,262
If something happens to him,

133
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,473
Hao Cheng will surely go to save him.

134
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,184
We can use this to lure him away,

135
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,060
then get rid of Guo Feng

136
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,188
and his concubine together.

137
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,315
Soon Guo Feng will visit
his mother's tomb.

138
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,941
It's a rare opportunity.

139
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,940
(Guo Ji's wife, Guan Xi)

140
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,749
Ask whatever you want.

141
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,126
Your mother...

142
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,977
Help! Help!

143
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,313
Attack!

144
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,961
Sir,

145
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,504
forgive me for arriving late.

146
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,257
How did you know we were in danger?

147
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,758
Miss Guan informed me.

148
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,176
Miss Guan,

149
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,136
may I ask why you sought me out?

150
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,931
I overheard Madam Sui and Ji,

151
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,433
planning to ambush and kill Feng
on his way back.

152
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,562
You must hurry to save him,
or it'll be too late.

153
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,772
Guo Ji is your husband.

154
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,192
How can I trust you?

155
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,902
I can't bear to witness

156
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,487
such fratricide.

157
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,322
You don't have to believe me,

158
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,407
but

159
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,617
you can't gamble with Feng's life.

160
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,536
Today, I saved Feng,

161
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,539
so I hope he'll show mercy

162
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,291
when facing his brother in the future.

163
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,376
It seems Guo Ji tried to lure me away

164
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,295
to attack Zou Xu

165
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,005
and separate you from me.

166
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,089
No need to worry.

167
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,300
I've already sent people
to rescue Zou Xu.

168
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,722
You don't need to attend
the family banquet.

169
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,765
I was wondering why they returned safely

170
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,766
and suffered minor injuries.

171
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,060
It was you who warned them.

172
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,063
My son truly has a good wife.

173
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,024
You're Ji's wife, yet you speak
for Guo Feng?

174
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,817
My dear, you're back.

175
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,321
Plotting against others so openly?

176
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,989
You've completely

177
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,616
disgraced our Guo family

178
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,867
in Bianyang.

179
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,410
So you knew all along?

180
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,995
A mere concubine,

181
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,288
what's there to boast about?

182
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,373
You can't even handle
such a small matter.

183
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,792
As the madam, you don't even know

184
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,420
how to manage the concubines?

185
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,173
Someone must be deliberately framing me.

186
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,090
Silence!
