=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,700
(Guo mansion)

4
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,612
Feng,

5
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,289
take a sip of medicine.

6
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,792
Just a sip.

7
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,003
Feng,

8
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,381
I'm willing to support you
and Miss Tingwu.

9
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,016
No need to worry.

10
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,093
Give me a bit more time

11
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,928
and I'll clarify things with my father

12
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,689
and have him annul the marriage.

13
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,526
Don't be upset, OK?

14
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,735
Ziying,

15
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,529
that's not the reason.

16
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,438
You don't need to comfort me.

17
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,648
Then what's the reason?

18
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,567
Can you tell me why?

19
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,869
Your Highness,

20
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,038
Miss Lin has already left the mansion.

21
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,699
Miss Lin?

22
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,625
Yes.

23
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,951
You mean Tingwu?

24
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,752
Yes.

25
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,254
So

26
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,123
Tingwu is Miss Yue?

27
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,258
Yes.

28
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,191
Yue,

29
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,184
I've already inspected this place
many times.

30
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,819
You can stay with peace of mind.

31
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,859
Yu, this time I went to the Guo mansion
and found

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,162
the battlefield is not as terrifying
as people's heart.

33
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,864
For example, Guo Shucheng,

34
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,241
who held leverage over Zhao Ruiyang
and Sui Ruo'an,

35
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,243
could sit back and benefit
from their conflict

36
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,828
without getting his hands dirty.

37
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,380
Someone like Guo Shucheng

38
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,924
deserves to die.

39
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,885
Poisoning him

40
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,762
was letting him off too lightly.

41
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,432
Years ago, I was under
the general's order

42
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,268
to present the tiger amulet
and Ceasefire Pact to Guo Shucheng,

43
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,645
then hurried back.

44
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,480
But something went wrong.

45
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,024
Before reaching Shuozhou,

46
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,360
I received news of the general's death

47
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,488
despite the withdrawal of the Wuqu army.

48
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,199
I suspected treachery.

49
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,784
Later,

50
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,702
I learned the mastermind

51
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,287
was Zhao Ruiyang.

52
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,456
Seeing the plan fail,

53
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,751
he sent Sui Ruo'an to kill them.

54
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,127
Yue.

55
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,758
Yue, how did Guo Shucheng die?

56
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,469
Did you find what you were looking for

57
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,888
when you left the mansion?

58
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,557
Zhao Dinghong,

59
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,101
you were always insisting
that Yue leave.

60
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,511
Now you seem more concerned about

61
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,188
whether we found the item.

62
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,515
Why put on a facade of deep affection?

63
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,608
You...

64
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,740
Yue, I didn't mean it that way,

65
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,617
just that it was too sudden.

66
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:38,986
Yue,

67
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,246
Guo Shucheng is dead.

68
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,906
What are your plans now?

69
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,824
Didn't you say

70
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,711
you were investigating Guo Shucheng
to avenge me?

71
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,963
He's dead now.

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,673
Why do you still ask about things?

73
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,758
I just want to know the truth.

74
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,886
He still had important items
he didn't turn over.

75
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,526
Yue,

76
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,028
what are you doing?

77
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,909
Zhao Dinghong,

78
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,454
our cooperation ends here.

79
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,378
Father,

80
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,466
how much were you involved back then?

81
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,263
Although you abandoned me,

82
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,475
I can't abandon the Guo family.

83
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,596
(Guo Feng's spy, Zou Xu)

84
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,807
Sir, you rarely summon me
to the mansion.

85
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,893
Why the urgency today?

86
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,279
Any updates on Zhao Ruiyang
and the Lin family case

87
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,739
three years ago?

88
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:09,743
Yue,

89
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,495
stop packing.
I'll take care of it later.

90
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,547
It's fine, Yu. Continue
sharpening the arrows.

91
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,051
I used to sharpen

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,011
the best arrows in the army.

93
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,181
I sharpened all general's arrows.

94
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,231
This year's spring hunt
will be held in Bianyang.

95
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,775
The Fifth Prince will also
be coming to Bianyang.

96
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,644
We'll join the spring hunt team

97
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,647
and try to present the Ceasefire Pact
to the Fifth Prince.

98
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,356
OK,

99
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,908
I'll protect you.

100
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,641
Sir,

101
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,019
I found this bank uses
the same paper as the Zhao family,

102
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,114
with a cloud beast pattern.

103
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,655
Guest, take care.

104
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,874
Come back often.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,629
Guest, please take care.

106
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,631
Take care, guest.

107
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,636
Sir,

108
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,765
look at this jade.

109
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,424
This is

110
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,884
He's jade.

111
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,428
They've monopolized the entire street.

112
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,637
Not just in Bianyang,

113
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,024
but several nearby states as well.

114
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,729
Zou Xu, have you checked the accounts
from back then?

115
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,190
I've indeed checked the accounts
of He's jade shop

116
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,494
and found the funds all flowed
into Lu's Bank.

117
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,960
So,

118
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,255
the military funds from back then
were all here.

119
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,163
Your Highness.

120
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,085
While sorting through
Sui Ruo'an's belongings...

121
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,452
What's wrong?

122
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,505
In Sui Ruo'an's belongings,

123
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,758
I found a letter you wrote
to him three years ago.

124
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,639
Sui Ruo'an

125
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,017
was indeed restless.

126
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,022
Your Highness, Wuqu has withdrawn
its troops.

127
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,184
The King of Wuqu suspected
deception in the city

128
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,320
and abandoned the siege.

129
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,781
However, due to the court's travel,

130
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,033
we may not obtain the land

131
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,412
and military funds.

132
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,664
The King of Wuqu

133
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,087
is unlikely to achieve great things
with his cautious approach.

134
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,505
Your Highness,

135
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,882
are we to

136
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,217
give up just like this?

137
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,888
What else can we do?

138
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,559
Rather than have Lin Haotian
return and accuse us

139
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,769
of delaying military aid and funds,

140
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,646
it's better

141
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,275
if he doesn't return at all.

142
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,250
Guo Shucheng, you're

143
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,502
ruthless enough.

144
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,914
I'll write a letter immediately.

145
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,551
You must deliver it
to Sui Ruo'an quickly.

146
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,094
Remember,

147
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,348
this matter mustn't leak out.

148
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,108
This letter

149
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,029
was really found in Sui Ruo'an's home?

150
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,906
Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,588
This isn't the letter
I originally handed

152
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,882
to Guo Shucheng.

153
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,351
The Ceasefire Pact, which the general
risked his life to obtain,

154
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,980
could've spared the people
from war for a long time.

155
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,774
Yet, due to Guo Shucheng's selfishness,

156
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,850
he kept it hidden for three years.

157
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,903
Because of their greed,

158
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,282
countless loyal Lin Army soldiers
died unjustly.

159
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,120
Zhao Ruiyang must pay the price.
