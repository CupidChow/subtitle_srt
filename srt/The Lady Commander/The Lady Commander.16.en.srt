00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,250
My little brother

4
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,876
has really grown some brains.

5
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,215
He poisoned his own soup,

6
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,886
causing me to lose father's trust,

7
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,431
not to mention

8
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,882
framing Changshi for the poisoning.

9
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,352
Changshi was beaten to death
because of him.

10
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,648
What a clever trick of self-harm.

11
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,902
Just wait and see.

12
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,530
Getting entangled in romantic affairs,

13
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,273
he'll never achieve great things.

14
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,575
One day,

15
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,703
everything will fall apart
because of this.

16
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,166
A concubine's son isn't worth it.

17
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,959
In that case,

18
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,253
let's discard him.

19
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,853
Why did you get me here?

20
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,775
There are too many spies in the mansion.

21
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,352
I've done what you asked me to.

22
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,447
Really? You found it?

23
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,454
All you care about is that thing.

24
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,123
You're not worried at all if I got hurt?

25
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,461
You're not trying to trick me, are you?

26
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,747
Miss...

27
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,334
Yanyu!

28
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,670
Yanyu!

29
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,644
Miss,

30
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,406
I can't stay with you any longer...

31
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,870
Yanyu!

32
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,492
Sir,

33
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,920
I...I was too late.

34
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,591
I found the scent of Agarwood on them.

35
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,634
If I'm not mistaken,

36
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,761
it's the scent from the master's room.

37
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,853
Father was willing to sacrifice

38
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,689
even my life to kill Yue.

39
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,947
Useless.

40
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,782
You fail every time.

41
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,620
She's really lucky.

42
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,823
You asked me to keep an eye
on Prince Zhao.

43
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,209
I discovered he secretly
met with this person.

44
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,217
It's him.

45
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,848
This person

46
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,767
mustn't live.

47
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,352
Yes.

48
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,613
Sir,

49
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,690
Miss Guan has arrived.

50
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,869
Miss Guan, how do you have time
to visit me?

51
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,413
How did you get such a serious injury?

52
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,907
I ran into some bandits

53
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,209
and got a little injury.

54
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,460
It's nothing serious.

55
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,170
No need to worry.

56
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,298
I've come because
there's something urgent.

57
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,677
Please, go ahead.

58
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,554
Feng,

59
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,881
if someone invites you to Moon Pavilion,

60
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,174
don't go.

61
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,976
Your life will be in danger.

62
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,058
How do you know this?

63
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,194
Just don't go, that's all.

64
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,196
Miss Guan,

65
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,740
I haven't thanked you for last time,

66
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,451
so let me thank you now for both.

67
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,299
Lord Zhengping

68
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,468
is selecting a wedding date.

69
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,887
You'd better keep quiet for now.

70
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,433
Yesterday, Tingwu and I
were attacked again at home.

71
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,884
The one who needs to keep quiet
these days

72
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,019
isn't me.

73
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,397
You've gone too far!

74
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,232
You secretly kept a concubine.

75
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,569
If it weren't for Princess Zhao
taking a liking to you,

76
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,487
you'd have lost your head by now.

77
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,072
If there's any mishap

78
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,074
in this marriage,

79
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,451
I won't spare you.

80
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,078
You're just a concubine's son,

81
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,623
yet the princess of Lord Zhengping
has taken a liking to you.

82
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,709
It's a tremendous fortune,

83
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,995
but you're too blind to see it.

84
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,715
You're beyond help.

85
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,305
Our family is indeed bringing honor
to our ancestors,

86
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,932
but Tingwu mustn't come to harm.

87
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,893
If you want me to marry the princess,

88
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,677
it's best if she stays alive.

89
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,857
I don't want to hear this again.

90
00:07:55,224 --> 00:08:00,154
(So, my feelings have become
a burden to Feng.)

91
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,240
(Lord Zhengping Mansion)

92
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,620
What's the matter? Speak now.

93
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,913
Father,

94
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,664
I want to call off the engagement.

95
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,295
What did you say?

96
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,164
Call off the engagement?

97
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,634
Feng doesn't love me.

98
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,011
Rather than both of us suffering,

99
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,347
it's better to end this now.

100
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,590
Marriage is not a matter

101
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,217
to be treated so lightly.

102
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,843
Guo Feng is still young

103
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,386
and immature.

104
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,888
Once the two of you are married,

105
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,014
naturally, he'll...

106
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,766
But his heart belongs to someone else.

107
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,903
I don't want him to marry me
out of obligation.

108
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,979
I'd rather set him free

109
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,448
and also release myself.

110
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,741
You...

111
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,120
I've spoiled you too much
over the years.

112
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,698
Now that the engagement is set,

113
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,293
it can't be canceled for no reason.

114
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,705
You'd better give up on this idea.

115
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,966
Father,

116
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,209
are you really willing to watch
your daughter

117
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,470
marry someone who doesn't love her?

118
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,256
You...

119
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,057
Father,

120
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,604
there's no need to get so angry.

121
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,389
My sister is just momentarily confused.

122
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,441
It's best to put the wedding
on hold for now

123
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,943
and discuss it later.

124
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,200
Get out!

125
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,286
It has nothing to do with you.

126
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,913
Stop pretending to be the good guy here.

127
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,582
If you were really kind-hearted,

128
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,158
your two older brothers wouldn't have
died so early.

129
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,502
Father,

130
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,300
please take care of yourself.

131
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,468
I'll take my leave.

132
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,296
Get out! I have no son like you!

133
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,347
Get out!

134
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,683
