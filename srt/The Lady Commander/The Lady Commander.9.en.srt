00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,045
The temple fair is so lively.

4
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,965
There are even lanterns.

5
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,884
Tingwu,

6
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,054
close your eyes.

7
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,775
Now, open them.

8
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,695
This lantern

9
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,988
is for you

10
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,907
to feel the festive atmosphere
of the fair.

11
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,538
Tingwu,

12
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,373
you don't like the lantern?

13
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,211
Miss, Sir Feng made this lantern
by hand...

14
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,213
I like it very much.

15
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,508
Let's go ahead and explore more.

16
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,718
Alright.

17
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,472
-Miss.
-It's alright.

18
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,298
Sir Feng will take care of her.

19
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,215
I'll take care of you.

20
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,350
Let's walk that way.

21
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,437
I wonder if Yue is also watching
the lanterns now.

22
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,024
My assassin in the Guo mansion
has killed himself.

23
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,651
Guo Feng must've noticed me.

24
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,987
Make sure Yue stays on guard
against Guo Feng.

25
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,614
No,

26
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,866
against everyone in the Guo mansion.

27
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,242
Anything else?

28
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,913
How about

29
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,040
I place another spy inside?

30
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,375
Are you confident

31
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,409
in such a short time,

32
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,744
your spy can infiltrate again

33
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,213
without leaving a trace?

34
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,131
After Yue's assassination attempt

35
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,041
and the assasin's suicide,

36
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,760
the Guo mansion will be on high alert.

37
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,845
If you truly care about Yue,

38
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,599
I advise you to wait and see.

39
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,646
Someone's coming.

40
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,294
Prince Zhao,

41
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,621
I have a message from Sir Feng.

42
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,081
If you want to know something,

43
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,800
why not ask him directly?

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,010
No need to sneak around behind his back.

45
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,186
Listen to me,

46
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,855
those bandits really don't know better.

47
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,950
Why would General Sui be afraid of them?

48
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,360
General Sui has suppressed
the Xuantian Gang for years.

49
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,204
I've heard they have a new leader

50
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,290
who wants to challenge General Sui.

51
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,959
Whatever the case,

52
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,587
they better not mess
with the lives of civilians.

53
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,996
In my opinion,

54
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,706
General Sui should go up the mountain

55
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,134
and wipe out the Xuantian Gang for good.

56
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,054
Feng.

57
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,655
Are you hurt?

58
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,908
Who upset my little princess?

59
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,211
Come, have a candied hawthorn.

60
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,954
Let your brother deal with the person

61
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,298
who doesn't know their place.

62
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,344
It's been a long time

63
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,229
since I've seen Feng smile like this.

64
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,569
Come, take a look.

65
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,738
Let's look at that one.

66
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,199
Sure.

67
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,859
Miss,

68
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,952
would you like to try?

69
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,122
Have fun.

70
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,672
(Remember not to reveal
your martial arts skills too easily.)

71
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,678
Oh, you missed it!

72
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,728
So close.

73
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,569
Try again.

74
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,496
At this rate, it doesn't look like
you'll hit it.

75
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,710
Tingwu,

76
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,420
let me help you.

77
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,606
They got it!

78
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,026
You truly make a perfect couple.

79
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,821
Here is the prize you won.

80
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,063
Here.

81
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,064
Thank you, sir.

82
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,199
Don't mention it.

83
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,458
When you move, I remain still.

84
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,960
When you wander, I don't linger.

85
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,671
I wish there are no eternal farewells

86
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,965
and we may be joined as one,

87
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,176
living as one entity,

88
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,679
dying as ashes in the same coffin.

Can't you stay calm
in the face of things?

94
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,359
Calm down?

95
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,500
She looks exactly the same!

96
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,340
You may think she's not Lin's daughter,

97
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,319
but even you wouldn't believe that!

98
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,639
If she's showing up here,

99
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,599
she might know what happened back then

100
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,199
and could be here for revenge.

101
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,500
I'm done talking to you.

102
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,980
I have to go.

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,919
Where are you going?

104
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,500
I need to investigate!

105
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,220
Come back here.

106
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,500
Sui Ruo'an,

107
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,479
what's there to investigate?

108
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,639
If I don't investigate,

109
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,940
how will I know if she's Lin Yue'er?

110
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,220
Have you ever heard the saying,

111
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,660
"Better to kill wrongly

112
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,540
than to let it go"?

113
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,660
Just kill them all?

114
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,620
Sir.

115
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,060
Search here.

116
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,220
Yes.

117
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,300
My lord,

118
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,260
what happened?

119
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,260
Someone in your household reported

120
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,500
a valuable jade pendant has been stolen.

121
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,439
We suspect the item
is still here,

122
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,460
so here we are.

123
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,519
We've searched other courtyards,

124
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,919
leaving only yours.

125
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,780
We ask for your cooperation.

126
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,060
My lord,

127
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,620
we've found it!

128
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,319
Take her away.

129
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,220
Wait.

130
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,220
My lord, there must be
some misunderstanding.

131
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,740
Tingwu isn't a thief.

132
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,119
The stolen item

133
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,479
was found in this woman's room.

134
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,079
If there's any misunderstanding,

135
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,319
we'll investigate thoroughly later.

136
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,180
No need to trouble yourself.

137
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,860
Take her away.

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,820
Go!

139
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,260
Go.

140
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,020
Sir, don't act rashly.

141
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,980
