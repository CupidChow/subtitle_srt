00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 8=

3
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,549
(Wait, last time, there wasn't
an amulet here.)

4
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,053
(That was close. There's a mechanism.)

5
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,464
(Guo Shucheng really withheld)

6
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,600
(the Lin Army's tiger amulet.)

7
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,433
Why are you so distracted?

8
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,944
What happened?

9
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,697
Earlier,

10
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,532
I went to the library

11
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,607
intending to re-examine

12
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,401
the documents about Zhao Ruiyang

13
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,203
Guo Shucheng had hidden.

14
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,832
But I found the Lin Army's
tiger amulet.

15
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,919
The tiger amulet?

16
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,020
General,

17
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,596
the Wuqu forces haven't withdrawn.

18
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,014
Our grain supplies are running low.

19
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,733
Our backup and provisions
haven't arrived.

20
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,152
We won't be able to hold Shuozhou
much longer.

21
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,400
(Bianyang General)
Send the third battalion to the walls.

22
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,407
(Lin Haotian)
Have the fourth battalion ready.

23
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,026
Be on standby.

24
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,119
General,

25
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,039
the fourth battalion defended against
three waves of the enemy's forces.

26
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,999
They haven't recovered yet

27
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,783
and won't hold out long.

28
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,294
Even if we can't, we must try.

29
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,880
Shuozhou is the gateway to our nation.

30
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,091
Even if it's about to fall,

31
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,054
we must ensure the safe evacuation
of the civilians.

32
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:33,962
The King of Wuqu

33
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,682
won't give us the chance
to evacuate the civilians.

34
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,610
You lead the soldiers in defense.

35
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,737
I'll go negotiate with the King of Wuqu.

36
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,781
At the very least,

37
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,908
I can buy us some time.

38
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,371
General.

39
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,581
The General risked his life

40
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,668
to secure one last chance
for the civilians of the city.

41
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,920
The General has returned!

42
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,005
Vice General Bai Yu, take my order.

43
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,465
Yes, general.

44
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,916
I've signed

45
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,386
a 30-year ceasefire pact
with the King of Wuqu.

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,212
Take this pact

47
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,047
to the Regional Overseer
in Bianyang, Guo Shucheng

48
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,289
and present it to the emperor.

49
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,300
(Ceasefire Pact)

50
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,687
Yes, General.

51
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,400
If you go to Shucheng like this,

52
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,943
I fear he won't easily trust you.

53
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,237
Take my tiger amulet with you.

54
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,354
Seeing this amulet

55
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,282
is the same as seeing me.

56
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,869
I won't fail the task entrusted to me.

57
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,377
When the general was killed,

58
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,996
the emperor was unaware
of the ceasefire with Wuqu.

59
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,172
That's when I knew

60
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,915
the amulet and the pact

61
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,843
had been withheld by Guo Shucheng.

62
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,087
Zhao Dinghong is also
searching for these.

63
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,222
Zhao Dinghong?

64
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,464
Zhao Dinghong claims

65
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,632
he's searching for those

66
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,426
for your sake.

67
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,262
But I have a feeling
it's not that simple.

68
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,482
Zhao Ruiyang is very likely the one
behind all this.

69
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,279
Yu,

70
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,063
have you found anything on him?

71
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,158
Zhao Ruiyang's power is immense.

72
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,818
Guo Shucheng had to hide the amulet

73
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,454
to keep him in check.

74
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,072
But we haven't yet found any evidence
linking Zhao Ruiyang

75
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,959
to the events of three years ago.

76
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,670
We can't

77
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,505
underestimate Zhao Ruiyang.

78
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,302
Yu, we need to move faster.

79
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,711
He's desperate to find the amulet.

80
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,680
It shows Zhao Ruiyang
is getting impatient.

81
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,173
If that's the case,

82
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,725
why not lure him into a trap?

83
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,677
I understand. So...

84
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,898
It's time to make a move on Sui Ruo'an.

85
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,488
Since you're here, show yourself.

86
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,959
Such a pretty girl

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,869
dare come up the mountain alone.

88
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,913
Talk about cooperation?

89
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,206
Why don't you just come with me

90
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,041
and be my wife instead?

91
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,259
How do you like it?

92
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,845
Who said she was alone?

93
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,640
I'm here too.

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,892
Why panicking?

95
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,936
There are only two of them.

96
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,354
There are so many of us.

97
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,897
Are you really afraid of them?

98
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,600
Yu, I don't need your help.

99
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,485
Go!

100
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,488
Please spare me, miss, please!

101
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,490
Can we talk about cooperation now?

102
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,617
Sure.

103
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,247
Sir,

104
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,499
I've uncovered the servant's background.

105
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,659
It turns out Zhao Dinghong

106
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,919
did him a favor years ago.

107
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,578
Zhao Dinghong?

108
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,164
I didn't expect he'd plant a spy here.

109
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,874
What in the world is in that library

110
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,885
that would make him go to such lengths?

111
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,513
What is

112
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,140
Lord Zhengping really up to?

113
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,308
Look into it further.

114
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,768
Understood.

115
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,939
I need to find a way
to get her to leave.

116
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,817
I had them prepare
a calming soup for you.

117
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,652
Drink it so you can sleep better.

118
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,189
These matters

119
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,200
should be handled by servants.

120
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,494
There's no need for you
to attend to them.

121
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,625
You may leave now.

122
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,002
Yes, miss.

123
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,803
It's too dangerous for you
to stay by my side.

124
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,463
I've arranged for Hao Cheng

125
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,307
to purchase a new house
in the countryside.

126
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,934
Tomorrow, you'll move there.

127
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,603
This way, I can be more at ease.

128
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,526
Sir,

129
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,987
are you already tired of me?

130
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,574
I see,

131
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,484
in your heart,

132
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,870
you never truly cared for me.

133
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,371
If that's the case,

134
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,082
I'll leave on my own.

135
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,160
There's no need for you
to come up with excuses.

136
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,036
You know

137
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,588
that's not what I meant.

138
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,886
The way you're now

139
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,055
looks exactly like before.

140
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,849
You're her, aren't you?

141
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,759
You've returned to...

142
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,560
Shh.

143
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,231
If thinking of me as her

144
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,525
makes you happier,

145
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,027
then think of me as her.

146
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,988
Just let me stay by your side.

147
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,562
I'm back.

148
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,733
Sir, did you...

149
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,360
Did you make all of these?

150
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,904
If not me, was it you?

151
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,272
I'm flattered.

152
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,782
How could I have done this?

153
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,650
With these rough hands,

154
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,786
all I'm good for is wielding my sword.

155
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,071
If I'm not mistaken,

156
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,322
are you planning to give

157
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,417
these two balls to Miss Tingwu?

158
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,369
I wonder if Miss Tingwu

159
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,797
has ever visited the temple fair.

160
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,633
These can even retract.

161
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,759
What's the matter?

162
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,168
Oh right.

163
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,054
I almost forgot about
something important.

164
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,431
Zou Xu said

165
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,933
in the past few days,
while following General Sui,

166
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,185
he noticed some unusual behavior.

167
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,012
General Sui has only

168
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,471
met with our master

169
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,608
and hasn't seen any other outsiders.

170
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,279
I find it puzzling.

171
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,026
Logically, despite the mishap

172
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,661
with Madam Sui,

173
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,988
the two families didn't
turn against each other.

174
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,323
That I can understand.

175
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,617
But their relationship remains as usual.

176
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,544
I can't comprehend this.
