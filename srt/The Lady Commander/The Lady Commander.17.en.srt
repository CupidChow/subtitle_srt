00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,580
=The Lady Commander=

2
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,220
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,654
Duan Fei, tell Yu

4
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,248
the item has been found.

5
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,167
Guo Shucheng has intent to kill me.

6
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,086
I'll leave the mansion tomorrow.

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,578
Zhao Ruiyang is still alive.

8
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,047
We can't let him ruin our plans.

9
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,375
I've promised Guo Feng

10
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,011
if we find the Ceasefire Pact,
we won't kill his father.

11
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,013
So the evidence of his crimes

12
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,339
should be sent to the capital

13
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,891
for His Majesty to judge.

14
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,903
Forget it. I'm afraid it might be
unsafe on the road.

15
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,115
I'll keep these myself.

16
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,366
Yes.

17
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,959
Yue.

18
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,218
Dad,

19
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,680
I'll avenge you.

20
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,780
What are you doing here?

21
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,451
Where should I be?

22
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,087
Ji, who are you looking for?

23
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,256
Do you need me to help you?

24
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,511
Go in.

25
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,968
Sir,

26
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,103
it's him.

27
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,064
He instructed us to kill you.

28
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,982
Nonsense.

29
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,683
Whether it's nonsense or not,

30
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,069
you know better than us.

31
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,989
Blame it on your brother for giving
more than you did.

32
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,497
Fine.

33
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,998
Fine.

34
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,043
I admit I'm not

35
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,339
as good as you.

36
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,054
But both of you

37
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,432
must die.

38
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,467
Help!

39
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,510
Murder!

40
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,427
Help!

41
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,646
Stop!

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,899
Murder!

43
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,199
What are you looking at?

44
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,034
Shut up!

45
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,579
Guo Feng,

46
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,630
don't get too complacent.

47
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,341
You think it's only me
who wants you dead?

48
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,469
Little do you know,

49
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,472
your precious concubine

50
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,308
wants you dead even more.

51
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,428
You're back.

52
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,100
What happened?

53
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,983
Do you hate me so much?

54
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,613
Yes,

55
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:56,730
I do.

56
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,407
You wish I were dead,

57
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,575
don't you?

58
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,248
Before, you simply didn't care about me

59
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,751
and I accepted that.

60
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,962
But now you've colluded with others
to harm me.

61
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,298
I...

62
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,802
Did you...

63
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,308
It was really you?

64
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,311
Lin Yue'er,

65
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,221
what do you want me to do?

66
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,472
Tell me,

67
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,650
what should I do?

68
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,986
Where is the mole on your shoulder?

69
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,614
I'm asking you, where did the mole
on your shoulder go?

70
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,783
Where did it go?

71
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,951
Let go of me.

72
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,121
(In returning to the Guo mansion,)

73
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,458
(I've had no regrets about
what I've done.)

74
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,501
(I only didn't expect)

75
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,045
(to harm an innocent person.)

76
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,300
What are you doing here?

77
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,217
What happened?

78
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,928
Lieutenant Bai was almost assassinated
by Guo Shucheng's killers.

79
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,972
He ordered me to bring you out of today.

80
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,080
He's waiting for you outside.

81
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,026
Has Guo Shucheng made a move against Yu?

82
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:57,976
How's Yu doing now?

83
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,936
Don't worry, Lieutenant Bai
wasn't injured.

84
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,979
Pack your things

85
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,897
so we can leave now.

86
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,532
This is too much.

87
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,649
I don't kill him,

88
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,243
but he comes to kill us instead.

89
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,373
Yu is my only family in this world.

90
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,918
I won't allow anyone to harm him.

91
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,120
Guo Shucheng must die.

92
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,172
But...

93
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,508
No need to persuade me.

94
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,551
I've made up my mind.

95
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,970
Help me inform Yu.

96
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,263
It'll happen tonight.

97
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,557
I'll leave here after tonight.

98
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,602
Prepare two items for me.

99
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,364
This is your favorite lotus soup.

100
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,456
Lotus with sandalwood.

101
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,583
Guo Shucheng,

102
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,627
enjoy.
