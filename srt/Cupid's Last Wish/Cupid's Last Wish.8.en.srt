1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,592
Hey, what’s wrong?

2
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:05,054
Korn, what’s wrong?

3
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:06,807
I don’t know.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,819
I should not have separated from you earlier.

5
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:16,088
I’m sorry.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,037
Don’t mention it.

7
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:22,019
And I’m sorry for being an ass.

8
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:26,499
Staying mad at you has wasted so much of my time.

9
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:29,945
I think she’s keeping the holy water in this house.

10
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:32,013
Let’s split up to find it.

11
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:57,419
It’s so dark in there.

12
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,608
You are with me. You don’t have to be scared.

13
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,419
Let’s go.

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,419
Hey.

15
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:26,177
Are you scared?

16
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:28,004
No.

17
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,096
Don’t be scared.

18
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,096
Come on.

19
00:01:57,068 --> 00:02:00,099
Is that the monk we’re looking for?

20
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,099
It probably is.

21
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:05,056
I don’t think any other monk would live here.

22
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,807
Come on.

23
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,219
Namaste.

24
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:29,499
The Venerable Uncle told me to ask you for holy water.

25
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:43,419
Excuse me, the Venerable Uncle told me to ask you for holy water.

26
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:12,419
We’re taking the holy water then.

27
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,311
Thank you.

28
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:59,579
I think he can’t speak.

29
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,659
Why would I speak when it’s not necessary?

30
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:07,317
Sorry.

31
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:09,090
Sorry, Father.

32
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:13,877
I want you two to abstain from talking

33
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:17,619
and stay here for one night.

34
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:22,739
That will make you realize the meaning of coming here.

35
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:27,638
One night?

36
00:04:27,638 --> 00:04:30,739
But we’re in a hurry.

37
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:34,379
You have one more day, don’t you?

38
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:38,379
You’ve come this far.

39
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,170
You’ll make it in time.

40
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,751
You’ve come here to get the holy water to help other people.

41
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,662
You’ve been helping

42
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,672
and listening to other people enough.

43
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:52,099
You haven’t been focusing on yourselves.

44
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:56,099
You should try to be silent

45
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:00,099
and listen to your inner voice

46
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,619
to find out who you are,

47
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:12,619
if you want to learn from this trip.

48
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:16,019
Give it some thought. I’m not forcing you.

49
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,019
What do we have to do?

50
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:32,490
You will not talk.

51
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,899
In other words, you will not communicate verbally

52
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:40,339
because words can be fabricated to be anything

53
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:45,410
from sweet or bitter.

54
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,939
Spoken words can lead anywhere.

55
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:53,059
Anyway, there’s something you need to be careful about when you’re not talking.

56
00:05:54,211 --> 00:06:03,979
Naturally, you can’t fake your true feelings with non-verbal communication.

57
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,539
When the mouth closes, the mind opens.

58
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:29,139
Got it.

00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:44,200
Hey.

68
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:46,204
Have you seen anything?

69
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:55,320
Why did he ask us to stay for one night?

70
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,111
I know that practicing resolute determination is a good thing

71
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,765
but we can do that anywhere. Why here?

72
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:05,240
Besides, we didn’t bring any stuff.

73
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,059
How are we going to eat and sleep?

74
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:10,543
I don’t mind skipping a meal

75
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:11,724
and I don’t mind not sleeping,

76
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,091
but I’m in Lin’s body.

77
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,410
I don’t know what’s going to happen to my sister.

78
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:20,619
Oh, I brought a piece of bread.

79
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:24,619
Would you like to share it?

80
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:26,622
Win.

81
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,174
What?

82
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,939

Lin.

102
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:25,259
This will be over soon.

103
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,059
Where have you been?

104
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,386
Right here.

105
00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:34,386
With you.

106
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,231
Don’t worry, Lin.

107
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:44,100
I will bring you back no matter what.

108
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:51,059
Thank you, Korn, for everything you’ve done for me.

109
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:53,979
I love you too.

110
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,090

111
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,810

116
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:36,939

(I’m sorry.)
(Me too.)

131
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:49,179
You’re up.

132
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,281
Why are you being awkward?

133
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:57,281
If you want to say something, say it.

134
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,299
I’m sorry.

135
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:15,299
Forget it.

136
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:17,034
It’s alright.

137
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,299
Let’s go. Lin is waiting.

138
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,671
It’s okay.

139
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:49,671
I can manage.

140
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:01,497
There they are.

141
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:03,294
How could you not see the bottles?

142
00:20:03,294 --> 00:20:06,640
If they were snakes, they would have snatched your eyes.

143
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,139
I thought I searched this place thoroughly.

144
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,016
The flower garlands are big.

145
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:13,139
Is that so?

146
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,308
You didn’t notice them either.

147
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,217
Your hand brushed against it.

148
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:24,899
Put it back on quickly.

149
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:28,056
Wait.

150
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:29,309
What are you doing?

151
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:30,811
Pouring away the holy water

152
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:32,699
so Win won’t wake up.

153
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,045
I don’t think you should do that.

154
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:38,045
Why are you stopping me now?

155
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,339
Didn’t you see Amorn’s photo fell down?

156
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:45,259
He must be angry with you.

157
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:47,700
Don’t be paranoid.

158
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
It’s just a photo.

159
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:52,739
What if Win doesn't only stay in a coma?

160
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:55,931
What if he dies?

161
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:57,931
That will make you a murderer.

162
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,899
Besides,

163
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:04,179
he’s our nephew.

164
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:10,259
Holy shit.

165
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:11,444
Where does this water come from?

166
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,444
It wasn’t here yesterday.

167
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:17,124
Korn,

168
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:19,124
is there only one way out of here?

169
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:21,468
Yes.

170
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,099
Over there.

171
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:31,908
What do we do?

172
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:39,293
Listen, I’ll go see how deep it is.

173
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:45,219
If it’s not very deep, do you think you could cross it?

174
00:21:51,404 --> 00:21:53,100
I don’t know.

175
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:04,419
I think these tides come and go at specific times.

176
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:06,419
Here’s what we’ll do.

177
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,419
You will go back with the holy water

178
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:11,866
and leave me here.

179
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,131
Then you will come get me when everything is done.

180
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,585
Don’t you have to be there for it?

181
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,259
You’re right. I have to be there.

182
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:19,592
I have an idea.

183
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:21,251
Wait here.

184
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:23,251
I’ll go get help.

185
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:28,539
Be careful.

186
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:30,539
Korn.

187
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:54,379
Korn!

188
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,906
Korn!

189
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:08,906
Korn!

190
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,459
Korn!

191
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:12,277
Don’t do it.

192
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:13,186
Let go.

193
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:13,595
No.

194
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:14,680
I said let go.

195
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,099
Korn!

196
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:21,920
No, In.

197
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,420
Don’t do it.

198
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,054
Let go.

199
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:25,930
Korn!

200
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:35,779
What did you say?

201
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:14,074
Win!

202
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:14,866
No.

203
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,444
I’m going to be with my son.

204
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:17,250
Let go of me!

205
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,699
I’m going to be with my son.

206
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:20,200
Win!

207
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,437
My son!

208
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,770
No!

209
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:25,297
Please be okay.

210
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,419
I’m sorry.

211
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:28,419
Why did you save me?

212
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:30,087
Wake up.

213
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,422
Wake up, Win.

214
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:33,530
Wake up.

215
00:25:37,521 --> 00:25:39,062
Win.

216
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:43,859
Win.

217
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,939
I’m going to be with my son.

218
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,742
How’s the patient?

219
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:49,391
His heart stopped beating at 11 a.m.

220
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:50,594
We’ve given him two cycles of CPR.

221
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,426
- He hasn’t regained consciousness.
- I’ll take it from here.

222
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,722
Please prepare the adrenaline.

223
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:55,320
Okay.

224
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,145
Wake up.

225
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:03,145
Please.

226
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,022
Wake up.

227
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,761
Please be okay.

228
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:08,597
Why did you save me?

229
00:26:08,597 --> 00:26:09,631
Win.

230
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:11,210
Wake up.

231
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,210
I’m sorry.

232
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,508
Wake up.

233
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:16,579

Wake up.

00:27:21,213 --> 00:27:22,579
He has a pulse now.

253
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,579
His vital signs are stable.

254
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,475
You can yell at me, be mad at me, or hate me all you want.

255
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:37,219
Just wake up and talk to me.

256
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,457
Win.

257
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:43,955

Breathe slowly.

266
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,450
Are you okay?

267
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,709
Non.

268
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,539
What did you say?

269
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:39,739
Non.

270
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:47,899
Easy.

271
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:56,339
Non, please help me.

272
00:28:57,482 --> 00:29:01,179
Lin, is it you?

273
00:29:10,745 --> 00:29:12,200
Lin,

274
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:21,059
I’m going to show you something but please don’t scream.

275
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:48,368
Do you remember the night of your accident?

276
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:51,589
You and Win went unconscious for two full days.

277
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:53,619
Slow down.

278
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:58,459
Win woke up first in your body.

279
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:03,299
And now you woke up in his body.

280
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:06,619
How could this happen?

281
00:30:07,127 --> 00:30:08,619
I have no idea.

282
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,779
Where’s Win?

283
00:30:15,811 --> 00:30:17,912
Here’s the thing.

284
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:20,848
Not long after Win woke up in your body,

285
00:30:20,848 --> 00:30:22,819
the Venerable Uncle paid us a visit

286
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:26,549
and told Win to collect holy water from four monks within 7 days

287
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:28,466
so he could perform a ritual.

288
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:31,819
Is he traveling alone?

289
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,505
He’s traveling with Korn.

290
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:36,100
What?

291
00:30:36,223 --> 00:30:38,179
Win is with Korn?

292
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,361
He wouldn't go with him at first,

293
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:46,099
but the Venerable Uncle said they need each other to complete the mission.

294
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:52,179
Anyway, there’s something you need to do as well.

295
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:57,539
What is it?

296
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,845
No one else knows you and Win have switched bodies,

297
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:06,139
except me and Korn,

298
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:10,139
so you must pose as Win

299
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:12,659
until he comes back with the holy water.

300
00:31:25,777 --> 00:31:27,002
Win is safe now.

301
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:29,106
Can I go see him?

302
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,906
I don’t think that’s a good idea for now.

303
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:32,327
He just woke up.

304
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:34,739
Let me examine his overall conditions.

305
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:38,005
If all is clear, I’ll have him moved to the IPD.

306
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:39,717
After that, you guys can see him.

307
00:31:41,096 --> 00:31:42,739
I’m relieved.

308
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,739
No more worrying.

309
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:47,505
Thank you so much, Non.

310
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,542
I told you nothing was going to happen to Win.

311
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,619
That kid is tough.

312
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:58,099
So that means the holy water thing is not real.

313
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:04,840
What a waste of time.

314
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:10,100
Korn.

315
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,337
Yes?

316
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:13,139
What time is it?

317
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:15,539
Almost 4 p.m.

318
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,539
Do you want to get up?

319
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,539
Slowly.

320
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:40,856
It takes many hours to get to my house from here.

321
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:44,739
Will we make it in time?

322
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:47,608
We will.

323
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,180
I can carry that myself.

324
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,180
No, let me.

325
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,477
You can do it.

326
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:23,205
Your mother is on her way.

327
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:26,059
Win.

328
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:28,059
My son.

329
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,568
Mom.

330
00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:41,293
I already examined his overall conditions.

331
00:33:41,293 --> 00:33:44,379
We did the MRI, cardiac, and lung function test.

332
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:48,050
If the results come back normal tomorrow, he'll be able to go home.

333
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,191
I won’t tell you off anymore, Win.

334
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:53,343
I also won’t offend you.

335
00:33:54,628 --> 00:34:00,979
Things have gotten out of hand because of me.

336
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:02,979
I’m sorry.

337
00:34:09,665 --> 00:34:12,979
How are you feeling?

338
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:18,979
I’m fine.

339
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,979
I’m perfectly fine.

340
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:26,536
I probably slept too much.

341
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,499
Are you hurt anywhere?

342
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:33,059
Not at all.

343
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:39,059
I almost didn’t get to see you again.

344
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:56,832
Excuse me, Aunt Porn.

345
00:34:56,832 --> 00:34:58,771
It's the seventh day.

346
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:02,386
Korn and Lin should be on their way back now.

347
00:35:02,386 --> 00:35:03,762
We’ll soon get to perform the ritual with the holy water

348
00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:05,499
and all this worry will be over.

349
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:07,499
Oh, yes.

350
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:11,499
Lin is collecting the holy water to ward off your bad luck.

351
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:15,287
She asked me to keep some bottles.

352
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,659
I’ll go bring them here.

353
00:35:18,454 --> 00:35:19,457
That’s great.

354
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:21,659
I can keep Win company in the meantime.

355
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:23,659
I’ll be right back

356
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:33,425
How did I do, Non?

357
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,659
Okay.

358
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:36,659
Good job.

359
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,755
What?

360
00:35:49,754 --> 00:35:51,179
Seriously?

361
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:53,748
My phone is dead.

362
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:59,179
Hey, if you’re hungry, you can stop somewhere on the roadside.

363
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,179
I should be the one saying that.

364
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:06,505
My mind is not with food right now.

365
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:09,115
It’s with my body.

366
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,607
When I get back into my old body, I’ll eat all the buffets.

367
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:14,487
Just you wait.

368
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:16,909
I can only eat a little when I’m in Lin’s body

369
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:19,936
and I get tired after using a little energy.

370
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:23,339
If I walk a lot, I ache all over the next day.

371
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:28,974
Lin’s body is actually good though.

372
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:31,198
She’s light and easy to carry without getting tired.

373
00:36:31,198 --> 00:36:36,026
If it’d been you who saw the ghost, I would’ve certainly broken my back.

374
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:38,294
Are you saying I’m fat?

375
00:36:38,294 --> 00:36:40,859
No, I’m not saying you’re fat.

376
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,234
You’re just big.

377
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,579
You’re the worst.

378
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:44,200
Watch it.

379
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,859
I mean you’re bigger than your sister.

380
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:48,859
Stop it.

381
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:52,850
It’s the truth.

382
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:03,601
Win.

383
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,189
Are you mad at me?

384
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:10,189
No.

385
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,859
I’m just thinking

386
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:18,314
that this is probably the last time I get to be in a car with you.

13.00 → 12.55 MINUTES LEFT

406
00:38:47,962 --> 00:38:49,985
You should get out here.

407
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:32,817
Win.

408
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:38,819
Is it you, Lin?

409
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:56,539
It’s okay.

410
00:39:57,943 --> 00:40:00,979
You’re safe now.

411
00:40:04,317 --> 00:40:05,868
Are you okay?

412
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:07,868
Of course, I am.

413
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,540
Where’s Korn?

414
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,539
Parking.

415
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,539
He’ll come up soon.

416
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:26,099
Are you and Korn back on good terms now?

417
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:33,051
Yes, we are.

418
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:35,051
We’re friends again.

419
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:40,459
I’m so glad.

420
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:42,459
That’s good.

421
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,459
I have all the holy water.

422
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:50,619
We’ll get back into our old bodies.

423
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,617
Anyway, I have to tell Mom.

424
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:58,619
She went home to get the holy water earlier this evening.

425
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:01,800
I don’t know why she isn’t back yet.

426
00:41:03,157 --> 00:41:05,139
What’s taking her so long?

427
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:14,059
It’s your mother.

428
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,237
Hello?

429
00:41:17,237 --> 00:41:18,419
Can I help you with anything?

430
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:20,389
I’ve searched the entire house but couldn’t find the holy water.

431
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:21,065
What?

432
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:23,911
I just found empty bottles in front of the house.

433
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:25,642
Okay.

434
00:41:25,642 --> 00:41:27,642
What happened?

435
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:33,413
She said the bottles were spilled and she didn’t know who did it.

436
00:41:33,413 --> 00:41:35,413
Damn it.

437
00:41:36,317 --> 00:41:38,499
What should we do?

438
00:41:41,857 --> 00:41:45,297
What’s with that face, Win?

439
00:41:45,946 --> 00:41:50,019
Mom said the holy water I collected is gone.

440
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,961
What should we do?

441
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:54,829
Do I have to collect it again?

442
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:57,678
It’s too late for that.

443
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:58,835
So what now?

444
00:41:58,835 --> 00:42:00,739
Do we have to stay like this?

445
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,742
I won’t let that happen.

446
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:11,413
I have two bottles with me.

447
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:14,148
Shit.

448
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:16,299
You spilled all of it.

449
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,299
Win.

450
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,259
Calm down.

451
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:32,743
What’s going on?

452
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:35,259
The holy water is all spilled.

453
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,259
Relax.

454
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,059
(Where have you been?)

455
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,619
(I was saying goodbye to the abbot.)

456
00:42:49,884 --> 00:42:51,219
(Where have you been?)

457
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:52,773
(What took you so long?)

458
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:55,139
(Was I not allowed to brush my teeth?)

459
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:17,946
I knew something bad was going to happen

460
00:43:17,946 --> 00:43:19,946
so I got the spares just in case.

461

462
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:31,899
You’re very careful, Korn.

463
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:37,277
Venerable Uncle, please perform the ritual before it’s too late.

464
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:39,277
Now that Korn has brought us the holy water,

465
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:45,207
may I ask everyone else to wait outside?

466
00:44:05,718 --> 00:44:09,499
Both of you, please lie down.

467
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:12,979
How are things going?

468
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:30,597
Win.

469
00:45:43,244 --> 00:45:45,290
Korn.

470
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,339
You’re safe now, Lin.

471
00:46:04,414 --> 00:46:06,189
I’m scared.

472
00:46:06,394 --> 00:46:07,564
Don’t be.

473
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,564
I’m right here.

474
00:46:16,242 --> 00:46:18,416
What do you call what happened?

475
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:21,899
Tell me how you feel about me, Win.

476
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:24,499
I don’t feel anything for you.

477
00:46:24,943 --> 00:46:29,819
I want you and Lin to get engaged.

478
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:32,213
I’m willing to take responsibility for everything.

00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:45,672

487
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,339
The water is so cold.

488
00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:03,207

Ouch.

494
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,177
Did I hurt you?

495
00:49:00,177 --> 00:49:01,813
Forget it.

496
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,305
I’m glad you’re safe.

497
00:49:06,794 --> 00:49:07,660
Korn.

498
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,660
What?

499
00:49:10,263 --> 00:49:11,660
I’m sorry.

500
00:49:12,598 --> 00:49:14,703
It’s okay.
