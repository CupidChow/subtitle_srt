1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,162
You are here for the holy water, right?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,610
Come on in. I have prepared it for you.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,290
Anyway, is the second temple far away?

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,290
Around 700 kilometers.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,810
Holy shit!

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,810
What’s wrong?

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,973
You can sleep up here. I’m just afraid you won’t get enough sleep.

8
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:24,130
We have a long way to go tomorrow.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,198
Frankincense. I bought this from an old lady.

10
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,330
She said if I lit this up, it would make the whole trip even more joyful.

11
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,680
Win!

12
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,090
Where are you?

13
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,950
Win!

14
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,250
Can you hear me?

15
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,210

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,540
(Where am I?)

27
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:30,700
(Why is it so cold?)

28
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:58,250
(Frankincense. If I lit this up, it would make the whole trip even more joyful.)

29
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,010
(Frankincense screwed me up big time.)

30

Korn...

31
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,050
Korn, help me.

32
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,739
Korn.

33
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,730
Win!...

34
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,730
Win!

35
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,730
Win!

36
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,340
Win, can you hear me?

37
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Win!

38
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,730
(Korn, I’m right here.)

39
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,730
(My phone.)

40
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,730
(Damn it. There’s no signal.)

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,890
Korn...

42
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,460
Korn.

43
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,890
Korn, help me.

44
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,850
Korn.

45
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,730
Win!

46
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,730
Win!

47
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,660
Win.

48
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,230
Is it really you?

49
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,050
Yes, it is. How did you end up here?

50
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,420
I don’t know.

51
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,230
Never mind. You’re as cold as ice.

52
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,470
Slowly.

53
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,520
Oops!

54
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,780
Be careful.

55
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,910
Win, you look terrible.

56
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,790
Let’s take a rest.

57
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,510
I’ll carry you.

58
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:34,722
I think you should rest.

59
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,019
Win!

60
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:40,019
Win.

61
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:48,019
You’re as cold as ice.

62
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:57,105
Easy.

63
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,971
Win.

64
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,407
Hang on just a second.

65
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,379
What are you doing?

66
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,380
Warming you up.

67
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:09,379
Easy.

68
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,619
Okay.

69
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:31,099
Now, the other one.

70
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,250
6 → 5 DAYS LEFT

71
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:18,860
Win.

72
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,860
Umm.

73
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,140
Win.

74
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,740
It’s morning already.

75
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:37,979
Hey! What are you doing?

76
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,860
Are you okay?

77
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,380
What are you asking?

78
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,260
Your body has cooled down.

79
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,500
Do you think you can continue the journey?

80
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,100
I... Ouch!

81
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,460
What’s wrong?

82
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:17,194
We’ve only been to two places. We still have two more to go.

83
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:21,380
If we don’t count today, we only have four days left.

84
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:25,699
I don’t even want to think about the rest of the journey.

85
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:30,343
Why don’t you change the way you look at it?

86
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:32,582
We only have two places to go

87
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:36,019
and we’ve only spent two days.

88
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,740
More importantly, we’re already halfway there.

89
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,660
Yes, life coach.

90
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,100
What a positive-thinking man you are.

91
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,300
Do you think it would be a good idea for me to punch your face?

92
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,540
Hey.

93
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,140
You should have been the one getting lost in the forest last night.

94
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,660
I got chilled to the bone. Never again.

95
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,060
If I’d been the one who got lost,

96
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,540
would you have saved me?

97
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,620
I would have left you to die.

98
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,300
Thank you.

99
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,180
For what? I would have left you to die.

100
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,900
I know you always say the opposite of what you think.

101
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,140
Yes, Mr. Know-it-all.

102
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,900
What time is it?

103
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,940
Almost 8.

104
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,540
What? Let’s hurry up and pack our things. We don’t want to miss the deadline.

105
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,900
Win.

106
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,140
What is it?

107
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,140
I think I’ve found the way to the temple.

108
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,780
Pa Mok Temple. 500 meters to go?

109
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,780
That means we’re right by the road.

110
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,580
Yeah.

111
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,580
Whoa. So that means we were walking in circles last night.

112
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,220
It would seem that way.

113
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,060
What the hell?

114
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,260
Is this the right direction?

115
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,260
I think so.

116
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,380
It’s cold.

117
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,820
I thought you were coming yesterday.

118
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,060
We got lost in the forest krub.

119
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,700
Ka.

120
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,700
You can speak the way you used to.

121
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,700
Alright.

122
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,060
We were walking in circles

123
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,740
and didn’t know where we ended up.

124
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
There was no phone signal.

125
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,940
I almost died.

126
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,540
We were scared, so we decided to lie down and wait until morning.

127
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,860
When we woke up,

128
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,780
we found ourselves nearby.

129
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,660
That’s what happens when you try to find a way out in the dark.

130
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,660
You’ll get lost despite the light.

131
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:19,580
(Chanting Buddhist proverb in Pali)

132
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,220
An intoxicated person will always fail to see Dharma.

133
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,060
Whenever a person is dominated by intoxication,

134
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,100
there will be darkness.

135
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,780
If your mind is in the wrong place, it will be lost without a way out.

136
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,820
Thank you so much.

137
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,100
There’s one more thing I’d like to remind you.

138
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,700
Karma is a result of one’s actions.

139
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,860
Everything that happens from now on is a result of what you two have done.

140
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,860
Remember my words.

141
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,860
We will.

142
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:07,481
Hey,

143
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:10,340
where have you been? What took you so long?

144
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,620
Was I not allowed to brush my teeth?

145
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,260
Not being allowed to take a shower, I could live with, because the weather is cold,

146
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,595
but are you really not going to allow me to pee and poop?

147
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,659
You could’ve just given me a simple answer. No need to be sarcastic.

148
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,460
I picked up a bad habit from someone here.

149
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:26,980
Stop it. You’re going to get it.

150
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,100
Let’s go. I’m cold and hungry.

151
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,100
Alright, let’s go.

152
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,100
- Unlock the car.
- Done.

153
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,340
Damn!

154
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,140
What’s wrong with you?

155
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,140
You scared the hell out of me.

156
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,260
My stock has been in the red for a year. I’ve lost a hundred thousand already.

157
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,740
Hey, it’s almost the end of June.

158
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,660
Why haven’t they discussed the dividends?

159
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,220
You have a point.

160
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,220
You don’t think they’re planning to steal our money, do you?

161
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,340
(Hello, In.)

162
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,900
Can we talk?

163
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
(Yes, of course.)

164
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,660
Let me be direct. With only two days left until the end of June,

165
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,060
why hasn’t a shareholders' meeting been called?

166
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,420
(Normally it would have been,)

167
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,140
(but an emergency came up.)

168
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,220
That’s not an excuse, is it?

169
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,380
(I don’t think so.)

170
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,340
Alright, I’ll come see you.

171
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,540
Where are you going?

172
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,540
What did she say?

173
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,540
Crazy woman.

174
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:57,940
What can I get for you?

175
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,940
Can I have…?

176
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,740
Rice vermicelli with Northern Thai curry sauce. Northern Thai curry noodles with beef. Oh, you have pan-fried eggs with toppings?

177
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
I’d like one, please.

178
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,340
Can I have…?

179
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,100
This spicy minced pork salad looks good. I’d like one as well.

180
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,435
Can I have this one?

181
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:10,820
Wait.

182
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,925
What’s this? Sticky rice?

183
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:18,300
It’s turmeric parboiled rice and roasted chicken with herbs. It’s a very delicious Shan dish.

184
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:19,585
Okay. Give me that too.

185
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:20,700
Okay.

186
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,780
And…

187
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,300
Stop.

188
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,740
Wait, you have red ant eggs?

189
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,100
Yes.

190
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,051
Can I have fried eggs with red ant eggs?

191
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:29,700
Yes. Okay.

192
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,380
That’ll be all.

193
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,820
Oh.

194
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,660
Boiled eggs.

195
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,220
Boiled eggs, ma’am.

196
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,380
Oh. Pork rind and white pork sausage, too. I forgot.

197
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,300
Pork rind and white pork sausage.

198
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,140
That’ll be all.

199
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,500
Yes, ma’am.

200
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,924
Oh. I forgot to order drinks.

201
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,423
Can I have sunrose willow juice? I’d like to try it.

202
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:50,500
Sunrose willow juice.

203
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,500
Will that be all?

204
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,980
Yes.

205
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,500
Are you sure?

206
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,380
I’m sure.

207
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,500
Okay.

208
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,601
Oh.

209
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,620
Alright, I’m going to standby here.

210
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,220
That was all. An ant just bit me.

211
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:06,340
Okay.

212
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,440
Win, you ordered so much food. Are you sure you can finish it?

213
00:19:10,444 --> 00:19:12,804
Of course. I’m hungry and I’ll eat.

214
00:19:12,805 --> 00:19:14,820
If I can’t finish it, you will.

215
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,300
These look so good.

216
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,900
So good.

217
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,540
By the way, Korn, our next destination is Prachuap, right?

218
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,120
Yes. It’s about a 17 hour drive from here.

219
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,650
[POINT 2 TO 3]
Yes. It’s about a 17 hour drive from here.

220
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:54,660
Yes. It’s about a 17 hour drive from here.

221
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,660
But I think we’ll need to stop on the way otherwise we’ll be too tired.

222
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,140
You’re such an amateur driver.

223
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,660
Excuse me? You’ve become a lot more sharp tongued since you recovered.

224
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,380
Of course.

225
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,940
Anyway, if we take today off,

226
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,540
we’ll only have 3 days left.

227
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:12,954
Yep.

228
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:16,140
It takes a little more than a day to get to the next destination

229
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,140
and another day back to Chonburi.

230
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:19,877
Oh.

231
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:21,277
That’s all the time we have.

232
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:23,204
That means we can’t make any mistakes.

233
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:24,740
You’re right.

234
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,740
Why are you staring at me? Aren’t you going to eat?

235
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,580
I’m full just seeing you full.

236
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,820
Slow down. Don’t gobble down too much.

237
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,180
I’m fine.

238
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,620
Lin’s body can adjust now.

239
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,660
I can eat as much as I want.

240
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,207
Your spirit can handle it, but Lin’s body can’t.

241
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,060
What if you gain 10 kgs after this trip?

242
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,100
You worry too much about Lin’s body.

243
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,420
Slow down or you’ll choke to death.

244
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,420
Drink water.

245
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,420
See?

246
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,180
He looks so much better on the outside.

247
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,660
His bruises have started to heal.

248
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,380
But it’s been 5 days already, Non.

249
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,220
I’m so worried.

250
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,339
I’m worried he won’t wake up.

251
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,020
Hang in there. Don’t give up just yet.

252
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,260
When will he wake up?

253
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,180
I can’t answer that.

254
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,620
It’s up to him.

255
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:44,740
Seeing he’s better now, he should wake up in a few days.

256
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,740
I can’t say.

257
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,900
A week then.

258
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,540
I can’t say.

259
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,620
Two weeks. A month. A year.

260
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,940
I really can’t say.

261
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,078
What?

262
00:21:56,074 --> 00:22:00,340
Okay, enough. He said he couldn’t say and that’s about it.

263
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,940
I won’t take any more of your time. Let me know when you have updates.

264
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,522
Only a few hours until we arrive in Ayutthaya.

265
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,580
I think I’ll stop at the gas station.

266
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,426
Are you sleeping?

267
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:48,917
No.

268
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:50,940
What’s wrong then?

269
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,540
I have a stomachache.

270
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,940
I told you to take it easy when you were eating this morning.

271
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,940
Why did you eat so much?

272
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,780
Why do you keep nagging? I have a stomachache.

273
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,740
Alright, I’ll stop at the gas station ahead.

274
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,620
Are you okay? Don’t poop in my car.

275
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:16,060
Ouch!

276
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,580
Women’s toilets are over there.

277
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
I know.

278
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,580
Geez what the hell.

279
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,340
Holy shit.

280
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,340
What the hell is this blood?

281
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,380
(Korn, I have a situation.)

282
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,340
Win, how are you?

283
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,900
Help me.

284
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,727
I...

285
00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:06,020
I’m bleeding.

286
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,580
What? You’re bleeding? Where?

287
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,580
That area.

288
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,580
That area? What area?

289
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,100
What I have but you don’t.

290
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,020
Brain?

291
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:26,420
Damn it, Korn. I’m talking about what my sister has, but you and I don’t.

292
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,260
Oh, I get it now.

293
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,260
Yes.

294
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,820
I think I’m on my period.

295
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,088
You must help me.

296
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:42,300
But what can I do when it comes to that area?

297
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:28,780
Can I help you?

298
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,820
Where can I find tissue paper?

299
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,700
Tissue paper?

300
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,620
Behind you.

301
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,940
Oh, right. Thank you very much.

302
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,700
Do you need anything else?

303
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,700
Do you have...

304
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,700
Do you have sanitary napkins?

305
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,700
Sanitary napkins?

306
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,580
Here they are. Come take a look.

307
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,020
Which one are you looking for?

308
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,020
I don’t know.

309
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,780
Does your girlfriend usually bleed heavily or lightly?

310
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,620
I don’t know. What I know is that she's very shocked.

311
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,420
Thick or thin pads?

312
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,340
I don’t know.

313
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
Does she prefer ones with wings or without wings?

314
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,100
I don’t know.

315
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,300
She asked me to buy some for her but told me nothing else.

316
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,340
Do you want me to call her?

317
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,100
Can I have a generic one? Something that would be good for every occasion.

318
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,700
How about the ones with wings that fly into the bin,

319
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,660
good absorbency, and no leaking?

320
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,460
I’ll help you choose.

321
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,180
Yes, please. Thank you so much.

322
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,180
You got it.

323
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,500
Win.

324
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,805
Win. Which cubicle are you in?

325
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,540
I’m here.

326
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,500
Win.

327
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,740
It’s me.

328
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,500
Why did you buy so many?

329
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,820
Take this too. This too.

330
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,700
I didn’t know which one you’ll use so I bought them all. Are you okay?

331
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,357
Can we talk later?

332
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:19,500
I’m in a mess.

333
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,500
There’s one more.

334
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:40,780
What the hell are these?

335
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,500
Helping cows give birth is easier than this.

336
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,460
Does it hurt a lot?

337
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,460
How do women walk?

338
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,740
I’m lost.

339
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,540
I don’t know either.

340
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,260
I bought you a pain reliever and water.

341
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,380
Take it so you’ll feel better.

342
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,540
You know about period pain relievers?

343
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,380
I asked the staff while getting the sanitary napkins.

344
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,060
Take it.

345
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,380
And...

346
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,380
here’s chocolate

347
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,100
I heard that it’s a mood booster.

348
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,620
I can hold those for you.

349
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,700
Shall we go?

350
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,820
Yes, let’s hurry.

351
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,220
Do you want me to open the door for you?

352
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,220
I can manage.

353
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,540
I’m having cramps again.

354
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,820
Katin, help me

355
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,820
Why do women have to go through so much pain?

356
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,820
What kind of pain?

357
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,660
My whole body aches and sometimes the pain spikes.

358
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,580
Is it similar to gastritis?

359
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,940
No.

360
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,078
Is it similar to a twisted bowel?

361
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:15,060
No. And I never had a twisted bowel.

362
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,220
I’m hungry.

363
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,860
Huh? What’s wrong with you?

364
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,780
You just said you’re having cramps and now you’re hungry?

365
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:28,840
Hey, I say what I feel. Now I’m hungry. Do you hear me? I’m hungry. I’m hungry.

366
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,740
HUNGRY
Hey, I say what I feel. Now I’m hungry. Do you hear me? I’m hungry. I’m hungry.

367
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,050
HUNGRY

368
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:37,380
I heard you. But you already ate so much today. Why are you hungry so soon?

369
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,540
What’s wrong with eating again after eating a lot?

370
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,820
I’m not a monk who gets full after only one or two meals.

371
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,620
Why are you being sarcastic?

372
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,540
I just…

373
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,780
Say no more, Korn.

374
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,220
No one says you have to wait six hours before you can eat again.

375
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,900
I just want to ask…

376
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,946
Which law forbids us from having more than one meal a day?

377
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:57,860
Tell me.

378
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,660
Are you a dictator?

379
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,740
You won’t let me eat, sleep, poop or pee.

380
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,900
That’s not true.

381
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,980
It is true.

382
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,660
What you’re doing is forbid me from doing all kinds of things, all the time.

383
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,060
I’m in Lin’s body and I can’t fight you

384
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,540
so you’re doing this to me.

385
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,820
You might as well let me starve to death.

386
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,660
Are you okay?

387
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,860
Leave me alone, Korn.

388
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,380
Hey, did you just sigh at me? You bastard.

389
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,380
I didn’t.

390
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,863
Admit it.

391
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,980
Alright.

392
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,420
That wasn’t so hard.

393
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
What food is famous in Ayutthaya?

394
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,675
Grilled prawns?

395
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:48,143
Those are high in cholesterol.

396
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:50,380
How about boat noodles? You can eat as many bowls as you like.

397
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,500
We can get that in Chonburi.

398
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,780
Cotton candy.

399
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,820
We haven’t had savory food but you’re suggesting sweets already?

400
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,020
Since you won’t take any of my suggestions,

401
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,740
why don’t you tell me what you want to eat so I can take you?

402
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,740
Grilled prawns.

403
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,565
What? But you just said they’re high in cholesterol.

404
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:05,715
What’s the matter with you?

405
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,900
Why do you always say the opposite of what you think?

406
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:10,140
Can’t you guess what I want to eat?

407
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,642
How many years have you been friends with me? We’ve known each other since we were kids.

408
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:14,992
If you want to eat something, say it. If you don’t, say it.

409
00:33:14,997 --> 00:33:17,007
If you like or hate something, say it. You son of a bitch.

410
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:17,642
Did you just insult me?

411
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,940
That was for Katin. No, that’s for you. How does it feel to be insulted for a change?

412
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,540
Shut up.

413
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,180
Grilled prawns it is.

414
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,540
I’ll find a good place for you.

415
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,779
Okay?

416
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,521
And sweets too.

417
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,100
What else do you want to eat? Tell me.

418
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,477
Why?

419
00:33:33,475 --> 00:33:34,300
What now?

420
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,241
Why aren’t you hurrying up?

421
00:33:35,244 --> 00:33:38,100
I am.

422
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,540
Aren’t we there yet? It’s almost dark.

423
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,140
You chose a faraway place.

424
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,360
You’re driving too slowly.

425
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,322
I’m following the map.

426
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,032
Win,

427
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,300
do you think we should take the bridge or not?

428
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,188
Take the bridge. We should see an intersection after crossing it. We have to go past the intersection.

429
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:12,980
Let’s not take the bridge. We don’t know where it will lead us. We don’t want to waste time.

430
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Why did you ask me then?

431
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:28,300
See? I told you to take the bridge.

432
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,180
It’s okay. We’ll find a way to make a U-turn.

433
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,620
(Google Map : Make a U-turn.)

434
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,460
We can’t make a U-turn. Don’t you see the barriers?

435
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,020
What if you crashed into them?

436
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,380
Why don’t you drive us, Google Maps?

437
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,740
How much longer do we have to keep driving? I’m hungry. When will I get to eat my prawns?

438
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,340
(Google Map : Make a U-turn.)

439
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,580
What do you want? I said we can’t make a U-turn.

440
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,940
Don’t you see that we have to go straight?

441
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,300
(Google Map : Make a U-turn.)

442
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,980
What’s your problem?

443
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,660
Will you please stop?

444
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:02,580
This is annoying enough as it is. Will you please shut up?

445
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,408
We’ll arrive at the restaurant in half an hour.

446
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:14,460
I think it’s too far away. How hungry are you?

447
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:18,660
If you’re very hungry, I can stop somewhere around here first.

448
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,660
No.

449
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,060
Are you sure you’re okay?

450
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,060
Are you mad at me?

451
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,060
You told me to shut up. I’m doing just that.

452
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,860
What would you like to eat?

453
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,860
Up to you.

454
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,860
Do you know you were a very naughty kid, Win?

455
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,580
You weren’t like the other kids.

456
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,580
You were full of mischief and energy.

457
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,580
You were talkative.

458
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,140
You always talked back.

459
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,780
Lin was the same age as you,

460
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:21,500
but she was nothing like you.

461
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,500
Your sister was well-behaved

462
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,140
and obedient,

463
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:39,140
not stubborn or naughty.

464
00:36:43,112 --> 00:36:49,140
You were bossy.

465
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,140
You threw tantrums when you didn’t get your way.

466
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,500
I want to hear you scream again.

467
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Come back soon, son.

468
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:19,620
Excuse me.

469
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,380
It’s past 6 p.m.

470
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,207
Okay, I’m leaving soon.

471
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:31,380
I’m sorry. I’ve been talking to Win and forgot the time.

472
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:38,260
Please talk to him, Non.

473
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,380
It’s okay. I can put that away.

474
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,380
Goodbye.

475
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,420
Come back quickly, Win.

476
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:40,100
I want to see Lin already.

477
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,140
We’ve arrived.

478
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,140
Aren’t you going to get out? We’re here.

479
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,540
Win? What’s wrong?

480
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:03,540
Nothing.

481
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,460
Let me see.

482
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,220
You’re crying?

483
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,500
I’m sorry.

484
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,860
If you had listened to me, we would’ve already eaten.

485
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,580
You knew I had a stomachache. I don’t even know what’s wrong with me right now.

486
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,740
Why didn’t you listen to me? You should’ve made a turn when I told you to.

487
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,460
Now we’re not even in the restaurant yet.

488
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,660
I’m starving to death.

489
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:38,060
I want to get back into my old body. Why do I have to be in this body?

490
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,820
What are you doing?

491
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,700
I thought I would surprise you

492
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,020
so you wouldn’t have to focus on your pain. I don’t know if it’s working though.

493
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,020
Win, I’m sorry.

494
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,340
You know this is your fault, right?

495
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,804
If you hadn’t yelled at me, if you had listened to me,

496
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:21,579
we would’ve arrived a long time ago. I would’ve already eaten and wouldn’t have had to wait this many hours.

497
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,580
My back has turned green now.

498
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:27,580
No.

499
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,700
Are you feeling better?

500
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,380
Get out.

501
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,380
Are you sure?

502
00:40:52,426 --> 00:40:55,540
How’s the farm running without Win?

503
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:57,780
I will cover this task for Win.

504
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,660
Follow his lead for now, Katin.

505
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,580
Are you and Korn together?

506
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,020
Katin’s saliva is sticky and her stomach is bloating.

507
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,340
Katin needs help.

508
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,740
Thank me for what? I would have left you to die.

509
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,860
I know you always say the opposite of what you think.

510
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,530
7 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE IN UNIVERSITY

511
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,860
Hey, don’t scratch it. Take the anti-itching pill.

512
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,140
I feel itchy.

513
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,260
Your food is served, gimp.

514
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,300
I may be limping but I still can punch you with my hand.

515
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,340
You’re aggressive.

516
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,180
It’s dirty.

517
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,540
What are you doing?

518
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,540
Be gentle.

519
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:21,940
Are you going to write again?

520
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,260
What are you writing? You’re making a mess.

521
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:26,860
Stop.

522
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,340
Eat.

523
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,820
You’re making a mess.

524
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:47,770
[I hate you so much, Korn. I hope you take a long time to recover.]
