1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:01,979
Win!

2
00:00:03,454 --> 00:00:05,020
Win!

3
00:00:09,297 --> 00:00:11,120
Is it really you?

4
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:12,645
Of course.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,179
If I’d been the one who got lost, would you have saved me?

6
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:19,139
I would have left you to die.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,097
Help me. I think I’m on my period.

8
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:23,970
You must help me.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,285
Are you yelling at me in your head?

10
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:34,339
I’m a lady outside. It’s not safe to be in the car alone.

11
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:37,154
What are you talking about? You are assuming things.

12
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:39,539
I haven’t said a word.

13
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:43,152
Sorry, man. Yes. I’m listening.

14
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:46,000
Got it. I gotta go now, Non.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Thank you.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,762
I know now what is wrong with you.

17
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:54,779
The symptoms you have are called PMS.

18
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:57,379
They are symptoms that occur in females when they are on period.

19
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:00,773
The changes in hormone levels cause mood swings.

20
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:02,466
But you don’t need to worry. These symptoms will fade away soon.

21
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:05,059
After eating a few river prawns, you will feel better.

22
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,204
I lost my appetite for food.

23
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:11,290
Thank you.

24
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:18,379
Wow. The prawn head butter is so rich.

25
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,579
(Jeez. Look at the heads.)

26
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,259
(Prawn head butter~~)

27
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:32,204
The dipping sauce is flavorful and spicy.

28
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,967
It tastes really good.

29
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,859
Are you sure you don’t want some?

30
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:44,859
No!

31
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,691
Let me have another bite.

32
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,819
(When will I stop saying the opposite of what I want?)

33
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:03,678
Okay. I’ll stop asking.

34
00:02:03,678 --> 00:02:05,568
I don’t want you to be mad at me again.

35
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:07,568
I’ll finish them all.

36
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:10,900
(Bastard Korn. You should have asked me one more time.)

37
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:20,619
It’s so good.

38
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,619
Are you sure you don’t want to eat?

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,619
No.

40
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:27,139
Okay then.

41
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:29,139
Another bite for me.

42
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:45,259
Very yummy. This place is good.

43
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:47,259
Are you sure you don’t want to eat?

44
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,259
Okay. You don’t want to eat.

45
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:50,637
Come to me.

46
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,635
Didn’t you order this for me?

47
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,635
You want to eat it now?

48
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:01,808
I don’t.

49
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:03,739
But I want my sister to have it.

50
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,613
Wow. It’s so good.

51
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:18,099
Why do you eat that way?

52
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,200
You know nothing.

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,699
They say this is the way to get the true taste of food.

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,149
Win.

55
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:03,149
What’s wrong?

56
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:09,294
It’s delicious.

57
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,499
Then knock yourself out.

58
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:16,651
I could die right here.

59
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,259
I don’t regret that I was born.

60
00:04:18,877 --> 00:04:20,560
You are exaggerating.

61
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,800
I didn’t order this.

62
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,321
We should have a dessert after a meal.

63
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:42,859
Really?

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,491
You may pass it on.

65
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,859
I won’t.

66
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:48,859
It’s good.

67
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:03,339
Slow down.

68
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:15,859
I need every drop of it.

78
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,911
You still have pain in your stomach?

79
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:46,659
Yes.

80
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,139
I thought it would be gone after eating the prawns.

81
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,099
It’s even worse.

82
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:58,099
I understand my sister now.

83
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,979
It hurts really bad.

84
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,617
Here. Hold this warm bottle.

85
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,939
It may help relieve the pain.

86
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:52,060
What can I do to make you feel less discomfort?

87
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,862
I don’t know.

88
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:59,299
I don’t know what else to do.

89
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,509
It’s really painful.

90
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,299
What should we do?

91
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,779
How about this?

92
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:14,779
I sing you a song.

93
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:22,779
♪ Hey, the weather up there is nice, isn’t it? ♪

94
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:25,154
Korn.

95
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:25,888
Yes?

96
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:27,888
Why singing?

97
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:31,139
To help you forget the pain.

98
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,124
Still not better?

99
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,634
No.

100
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:41,139
Wait. I’ll be back shortly.

101
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,552
Stop. Stop laughing.

102
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:50,600
In my dream, I saw a castle and stuff.

103
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,099
When I woke up, I couldn’t help screaming.

104
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:55,552
Korn.

105
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:56,429
Yes?

106
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:58,604
That makes my pain even worse.

107
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:00,611
I have another good one.

108
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:02,303
Give me a sec.

109
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,306
Hello.

I can’t stop…

119
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:32,328
not until your stomach pain goes away.

120
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,779
Keep holding onto it.

121
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:15,090
You fell asleep, finally.

122
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:20,001
Win.

123
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:23,853
Win.

124
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:43,979
Win.

125
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:49,979
I don’t know if you are still mad at me deep inside.

126
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:55,979
But I want you to know that everything I do, I do it for you.

127
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,979
And it never changes.

128
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:03,980
I’ll be waiting.

129
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,933
I’ll be waiting until you open your heart

130
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,933
and accept me back once again.

131
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,900
Shit.

132
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,099
You woke up?

133
00:12:58,306 --> 00:13:00,539
Gosh, my arm.

134
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,730
What the hell happened?

135
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,899
Didn’t you realize that you slept on my arm all through the night?

136
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:08,899
No.

137
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:15,339
My stomach pain is gone.

138
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:19,139
Go have a shower. We can head to the next stop right away.

139
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,601
You can use the bathroom before me.

140
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:28,459
Let’s get a move on.

141
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:30,459
Don’t go back to sleep.

142
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:42,819
(What’s with the smile, Win?)

143
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,739
I have already returned the key.

144
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:22,714
What are you doing?

145
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:23,976
Are you seeing me taking a bath?

146
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,976
Seriously, your sharp tongue.

147
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:30,502
Here.

148
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,201
For me?

149
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,007
Not for a dog for sure.

150
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:37,868
You have to drive a long way.

151
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:40,019
You may get sleepy.

152
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:41,939
Thank you for caring about me.

153
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,568
I don’t care about you.

154
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,090
I care about my own safety.

155
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:49,905
Let's Drink.

156
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:59,099
It’s very strong.

157
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,751
I like it.

158
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:34,545
Hello. What’s up, man?

159
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:36,019
Hey, Non.

160
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,087
Are you free to talk? I have something to talk to you about.

161
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,928
I’m free. Go ahead.

162
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:44,219
I would like to know how my body is doing.

163
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:46,379
How on earth do I know?

164
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:49,059
You should ask yourself.

165
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,303
Come on. I’m being serious here. I asked you nicely.

166
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:55,081
Don’t get me worked up.

167
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,463
Why are you so grumpy?

168
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:58,345
Your body is as usual.

169
00:15:58,345 --> 00:16:00,823
Today is my day off. I’m not at the hospital.

170
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:02,425
But if you want, I can go there for you.

171
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:04,373
No need to.

172
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,121
Well, if anything happens, call me right away.

173
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:10,339
Okay.

174
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,314
How is it going over there?

175
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:16,059
Now? We have visited 2 temples.

176
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,785
2 more to go.

177
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:19,419
1 today

178
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,376
and another one tomorrow then it’s all done.

179
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:24,506
Don’t you take a break at all? It must be exhausting.

180
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:26,721
No, we are good.

181
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:29,419
Another thing is, I’m not driving myself.

182
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,265
So Korn is driving for you?

183
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:35,419
Yes.

184
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:40,539
Does that mean you two are together throughout the trip?

185
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:42,285
Yes.

186
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:44,112
Does that mean you are back on good terms?

187
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:47,979
Or not but you have to be together because of the situation.

188
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:51,653
So are you still fighting or getting back together now?

189
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:53,469
Just usual.

190
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:55,560
Usual? Which one?

191
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,186
You are fighting as usual or being nice as usual?

192
00:16:58,186 --> 00:16:59,564
Or…

193
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:02,939
You are back on loving him as usual?

194
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,521
What’s with all these questions?

195
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:09,139
I’m just curious because I’m worried.

196
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:10,845
So are you back on good terms?

197
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:14,114
Or are you more?

198
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:16,841
Son of a bitch. Stop asking.

199
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:18,361
You are talking too much.

200
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,875
I’m sure you two have made up.

201
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,422
It’s because Korn is next to you. You can’t say what you think, right?

202
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:28,342
No, it’s not.

203
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,842
I have one more favor.

204
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,619
Can you go to my farm? You are free today, right?

205
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,699
If anything happens there, call and tell me right away.

206
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:40,816
Tell me what’s the deal with you and Korn first.

207
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:43,422
And I will go to see your farm for you.

208
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:47,370
Then don’t bother. Just go wherever you want. Bye.

209
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:55,539
They are definitely back together.

210
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,505
What’s with those words you have with Non?

211
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:03,019
What did he say?

212
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:05,299
Why do you want to know? It doesn’t concern you.

213
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,739
What did he say? Tell me.

214
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,739
Just focus on the road and leave me alone.

215
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:15,739
What?

216
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,739
Just drive.

217
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,730
Fine.

218
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,597
Here you go.

219
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,100
Thanks.

220
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,684
Hi, In, Nu. What brings you here this early?

221
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:45,477
Have you eaten?

222
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:48,111
No. Is there anything to eat?

223
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:51,379
Of course. I’ll ask the maid to bring you breakfast.

224
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,380
Let’s talk while we eat.

225
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:57,623
Why are you eating alone, though?

226
00:18:57,623 --> 00:18:59,099
Where is Lin?

227
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,659
She went outside.

228
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:02,779
This early in the morning?

229
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,739
Why haven’t I seen her lately?

230
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:09,282
I didn’t see her while I visited Win at the hospital either.

231
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,282
Where did she go?

232
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,539
I don’t know.

233
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,459
Is it possible that you don’t know where your child is?

234
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:20,893
Lin is a grown-up woman.

235
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,804
She doesn’t need to tell her mother everything she does.

236
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:26,699
When the mother is you, I find it weird that you don’t know.

237
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:33,306
Anyway, how is this farm running since Win is not around?

238
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,091
Are you in charge of it instead?

239
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,272
The workers know their responsibilities.

240
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:38,933
No need to oversee them.

241
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:42,019
And the farm is doing fine at the moment.

242
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:47,699
You don’t check on them. How could you know if there’s a problem or not?

243
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,213
Here’s the deal.

244
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:51,659
I will come here and oversee the farm for the time being.

245
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:55,050
Do you know your way around?

246
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:56,934
Sure, I do.

247
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,807
I helped my brother run this farm before.

248
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:11,339
Hurry up and finish it. Let’s go check if things are in order or not.

249
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:25,979
Hold up.

250
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,099
Hey!

251
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,099
Look.

252
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,099
Listen!

253
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:42,099
You all know who I am, right?

254
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:45,577
I’ll be taking care of this place instead of Win for the time being.

255
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,562
Do you all get it?

256
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,800
Yes, sir.

257
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:55,219
Do you only feed the cows with dry grass?

258
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:59,219
Not just this.

259
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:02,225
Normally, Mr. Win schedules the time for the cows to go out and walk freely.

260
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:06,305
Dry grass is a fibrous feed for cows. It is mixed with…

261
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:08,595
Enough.

262
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,434
Just take the cows out there in the field.

263
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,434
And herd them back before it gets dark.

264
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:15,951
It’s too stuffy for the cows to be in the corrals.

265
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:19,379
This is how people ran the cattle farms back then.

266
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,080
But Mr. Win…

267
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,019
Don’t you get what I said?

268
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:26,699
I’m in charge of here in place of Win.

269
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,699
Understand?

270
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:30,699
Yes.

271
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,493
Release the cows. Why are you still here looking dumb?!

272
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:40,019
Got it, sir.

273
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:50,268
See? The cows can get some stretching out here.

274
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,299
It’s better, right?

275
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:56,299
Just follow through with this, Katin.

276
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,650
What are you mumbling about?

277
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:00,700
No, sir.

278
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:06,909
If Mr. Win knows that Ms. Inthara and Mr. Anucha are meddling with the farm,

279
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,471
he would blow up, Katin.

280
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:16,484
When will Mr. Win get his consciousness back?

281
00:22:16,484 --> 00:22:17,579
Do you know, Katin?

282
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:23,579
(You are back on loving him as usual?)

283
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:25,579
(What’s with all these questions?)

284
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,051
(So are you back on good terms?)

285
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:29,139
(Or are you more?)

286
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,234
Hey!

287
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:36,508
What the hell? You scared the crap out of me.

288
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:37,878
Where’s your mind at?

289
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,459
I saw you zoning out for a while.

290
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:43,459
What are you thinking about?

291
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:49,459
I’m thinking about something. Don’t mind me.

292
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,979
What is bothering you? You can tell me.

293
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:58,979
We only have 3 days left.

294
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:01,019
I’m worried that we can’t make it.

295
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:03,191
We will make it.

296
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,336
We will reach the 3rd temple today, and the 4th temple tomorrow.

297
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,259
The routes to those places should not take long.

298
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:33,579
Are you hungry yet? What do you want to eat?

299
00:23:38,524 --> 00:23:40,715
Don’t you feel hungry too?

300
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,659
You ask me this question every day.

301
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:45,945
I know that I’m high maintenance.

302
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:47,690
But you don’t need to spoil me this much.

303
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,306
I want to eat…

304
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:50,503
I’m not that dictative.

305
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:50,782
I want…

306
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:52,752
And don’t say that anything is fine.

307
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:55,539
If you say that, I will smack you to death.

308
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,056
Listen, Korn.

309
00:23:58,056 --> 00:24:00,389
Just say what you really want to eat.

310
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,364
Say what’s in your mind.

311
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,764
May I talk now?

312
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:09,408
You have said it all. Now,

313
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,208
I must tell you what I want to eat, right?

314
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,779
That’s right.

315
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,924
How about we go to the hotel I work for?

316
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,511
Let’s have Chinese Rice Porridge with Side Dishes.

317
00:24:19,514 --> 00:24:21,731
They also serve yummy Pot-stewed Duck,

318
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:24,950
Salted-fish Fried Rice, and Stir-fried Water Spinach.

319
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:26,979
Yes. Let’s go there. Yes. Yes.

320
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:31,179
Hold on.

321
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:32,730
I think we should go to other places.

322
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,659
What? Why?

323
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:38,259
There are other places serving those things too.

324
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,259
Korn.

325
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:44,958
You have a secret there?

326
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,561
Are you hiding something from me?

327
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,848
Just looking at your face here makes me know that you’re lying.

328
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:52,518
Tell me now. Why?

329
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:53,740
Korn.

330
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,740
It’s that senior colleague of yours, right?

331
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:59,853
No. I’m not hiding anything.

332
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:01,216
There is nothing at all.

333
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:02,611
Then take me to your hotel right now.

334
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:03,733
Go straight there.

335
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:04,640
Can we not go there?

336
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,167
No.

337
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,318
Let’s go somewhere else.

338
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:07,754
I want to eat at your hotel.

339
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,617
Other places have better food.

340
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,059
- Trust me.
- I said we would go there.

341
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:10,817
Can we change to other places?

342
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:12,789
No, we can’t.

343
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,619
Are you sure?

344
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:29,619
Damn it, Korn. What’s with your cover-up?

345
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:33,285
Do you seriously think that people can’t recognize you?

346
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:35,619
You are even more eye-catching, you know?

347
00:25:36,524 --> 00:25:39,619
Stop talking. Let’s just go.

348
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,619
Hi, Korn.

349
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,168
Hi.

350
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,481
What’s the rush?

351
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:47,241
Come on.

352
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:49,619
Korn, I thought you took 7 days off.

353
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:53,210
I’m still off. I’m here to eat.

354
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,973
Korn, why are you in a hurry?

355
00:25:54,973 --> 00:25:56,207
You seem like you are avoiding someone.

356
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:56,878
I don’t.

357
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,048
You have been like this since when we were in the car.

358
00:25:58,048 --> 00:25:58,797
Keep it down.

359
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,007
Hey, Korn. Who is this lady?

360
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:02,426
My sister.

361
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:04,426
Am I your sister?

362
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:05,078
Come on.

363
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:05,788
Your sister?

364
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:06,718
Yes, you are.

365
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:08,296
Why a sister?

366
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:11,059
Didn’t you tell me not to tell anyone that you are my wife or girlfriend?

367
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:12,508
I did that as you wish.

368
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:15,131
Dim Sum place is outside. It’s very good. I’ll take you there.

369
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:16,616
I don’t want Dim Sum.

370
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,601
I want Rice Porridge.

371
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:18,715
But I want to have Dim Sum. Let’s go there.

372
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:20,691
I want Rice Porridge.

373
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:21,654
Win.

374
00:26:21,654 --> 00:26:24,602
I want Rice Porridge. Let’s go.

375
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:30,604
Korn, are you afraid of being seen so much that you cover your face with the menu?

376
00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:33,585
No. I’m reading the menu.

377
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:36,059
Are you that short-sighted?

378
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:38,059
Your face is almost pressed on the menu.

379
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:41,445
What would you like to order, Korn?

380
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:49,518
Do you know it’s me?

381
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,000
Who wouldn’t recognize you?

382
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,939
You act like you don’t want anyone to see you.

383
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:08,299
Alright. My cover-up doesn’t work anyway.

384
00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:12,134
We want 2 bowls of rice porridge,

385
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:13,130
Stir-fried Chinese Olives with Minced Pork,

386
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,321
Stir-fried Water Spinach with Crispy Pork Belly,

387
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:16,589
Pot-stewed Duck with Offal and Duck BloodTofu,

388
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:18,130
Also, my usual omelet.

389
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,334
Tell the cook that these are for my table. I want them all quickly.

390
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,499
Alright.

391
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,580
No need to rush the cook. I can wait.

392
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,819
Hey. Why did you tell her that?

393
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,991
You told me earlier in the car that we can slow things down.

394
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:32,582
No need to rush everything.

395
00:27:32,582 --> 00:27:34,168
Are you a hypocrite?

396
00:27:34,168 --> 00:27:35,877
Stop talking.

397
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:37,349
Bring them quickly. I beg you.

398
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:38,666
Okay.

399
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,459
The hell?

400
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,222
You have ordered. What are you reading now?

401
00:27:52,222 --> 00:27:55,499
There might be some new dishes.

402
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:38,779
Hey! Did you do this?

403
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:40,703
Yes.

404
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,339
Win! Why did you do this?

405
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:45,391
Why, Korn?

406
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,339
Why don’t you want me to meet him?

407
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,259
[I’m here. Come see me if you are free.]

408
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,779
[Chef Phat : You should have told me. Wait a sec. I’ll come to you.]

409
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:58,645
Damn. It’s too late.

410
00:28:58,645 --> 00:28:59,555
What’s the matter?

411
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:02,351
You like him? He likes you? What’s the deal with you and him?

412
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,925
Keep it down. I’ll explain later.

413
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:05,743
Explain now.

414
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,659
Cool down. You are too loud.

415
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:09,939
Do you have a crush on him?

416
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:11,866
I told you to keep your voice down.

417
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:12,577
Then what’s the deal with you and him?

418
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,108
I’ll tell you later. Alright?

419
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:15,939
Tell me right here.

420
00:29:18,918 --> 00:29:21,099
Dr. Non, help us, please.

421
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:25,324
Sang, what are you doing in the middle of the road? You may get hit.

422
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:26,610
Please help us.

423
00:29:32,325 --> 00:29:33,613
Korn.

424
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:38,506
Aren’t you on your leave?

425
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:40,400
Is your matter done?

426
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,109
No, it’s actually not.

427
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:44,109
I just dropped by here for a meal.

428
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,028
Who is this young lady?

429
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,828
My sister.

430
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:55,979
(Sister again?)

431
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,299
I thought she was your girlfriend.

432
00:30:01,297 --> 00:30:04,299
No. She’s not my girlfriend.

433
00:30:05,017 --> 00:30:06,299
(What a fast denial.)

434
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,979
I hope you enjoy your meal here.

435
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:19,299
Listen. You can say that you are here because you miss me.

436
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:21,819
Because I miss you too.

437
00:30:23,063 --> 00:30:25,819
(What? They are missing each other?)

438
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:27,731
You know what?

439
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:32,139
Your replacement is not as compatible as you are.

440
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:35,044
It’s good that you are here today.

441
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:37,044
I have created a few new dishes.

442
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,370
I would like you to try.

443
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,721
I trust your sense of taste the most.

444
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:46,259
(He knows him that well?)

445
00:30:49,703 --> 00:30:52,259
Okay. Bring them to me.

446
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:54,259
That’s my boy.

447
00:30:55,162 --> 00:30:57,453
You are as lovely as always.

448
00:30:57,453 --> 00:31:00,219
(I don’t think this is right. He’ll need to deal with me.)

449
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:05,500
This way.

450
00:31:09,887 --> 00:31:12,219
Key.

451
00:31:13,656 --> 00:31:15,186
I can’t give it to you.

452
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:17,454
If Mr. Win knows, he will be really mad at me.

453
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:20,259
I should not let someone in his office without permission.

454
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:22,937
Why do I need permission?

455
00:31:22,937 --> 00:31:25,296
I just left this home to live on my own.

456
00:31:25,296 --> 00:31:27,171
Why do I feel like I’m unwelcome here?

457
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:29,171
You treat me like I’m an outsider.

458
00:31:29,908 --> 00:31:31,605
I only want to check some documents.

459
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:33,247
Just in case there are problems.

460
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:35,247
Why? Can’t I see them?

461
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:38,459
Please take it easy.

462
00:31:38,677 --> 00:31:42,459
I think you have made your points.

463
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:46,179
But please do not forget that you are not the sole owner of this place.

464
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,179
Win is also an owner.

465
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:54,059
For this kind of thing, I think you should ask your co-owner. Am I right?

466
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,059
Do you see Win here?

467
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,173
Win should wake up soon.

468
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:05,779
You said the other day that you didn’t know when he could wake up.

469
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:07,779
It’s just my presumption on a daily basis.

470
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:11,456
Right now his condition is normal. He is getting better.

471
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:14,779
If you cannot wait for Win to wake up, there is Korn.

472
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,610
Korn will come and help.

473
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,779
I don’t want to talk with a non-family member.

474
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:24,739
But he’s also a shareholder of Warodom farm.

475
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:37,219
I believe that Korn has the same right on this farm like you

476
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:39,219
and Win.

477
00:32:39,573 --> 00:32:44,961
If you really don’t want to talk to Korn, you can talk to him through Lin.

478
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:47,979
Lin should be back together with Korn soon.

479
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:51,688
(Why haven’t I seen her lately?)

480
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:53,195
(Where did she go?)

481
00:32:53,195 --> 00:32:54,687
(I don’t know.)

482
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:56,450
(Is it possible you don’t know where your child is?)

483
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,099
Is Lin with Korn?

484
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,404
Yes.

485
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,048
These are Thai snacks that I recreate from royal Thai recipes,

486
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:23,800
with new ingredients.

487
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,303
And I present them in a contemporary fusion style which is easier to eat.

488
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:29,419
Try them.

489
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,419
This one is Thai Golden Bags.

490
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:37,259
Instead of minced pork, I use smoked ham stir-fried with lobster meat.

491
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:39,259
Please try it.

492
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:48,591
Let me try it instead.

493
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,927
Korn is allergic to mobster, no, lobster.

494
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:57,093
Really, Korn?

495
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,543
Yes.

496
00:34:04,822 --> 00:34:08,179
Alright. Try this one, then.

497
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:11,078
This is King’s Concubine Chili Paste Wrap.

498
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,388
I recreate this from the chili paste recipe of the King’s Concubine Sadab.

499
00:34:13,388 --> 00:34:15,629
And I make them in small bites of green wraps to make them convenient to eat.

500
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:17,029
Please try.

501
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:17,829
Okay.

502
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:25,197
He can’t have this one as well.

503
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:29,699
Korn doesn’t eat chili paste.

504
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,327
Then you can try this one.

505
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:39,619
They look too cute. Korn can’t eat them.

506
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,088
Korn doesn’t eat cute things.

507
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,299
He is allergic to all cutesy stuff.

508
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:50,394
He always keeps cute food for me.

509
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:54,459
But please try it.

510
00:34:58,374 --> 00:35:01,988
This birdie is too adorable to eat, right?

511
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:12,237
Excuse me, Phat.

512
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:14,899
Normally, Lin has more manners than this.

513
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:17,219
Hey, babe.

514
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:20,371
How could you say that I’m bad-mannered?

515
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:22,594
I helped you eat them.

516
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,659
How could you say that?

517
00:35:28,244 --> 00:35:32,511
You know what? Korn is actually a fussy eater.

518
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,157
Not many people know what he can eat and cannot eat.

519
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,450
He’s too polite to refuse people.

520
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,450
He says the opposite to what he really thinks.

521
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:49,690
Lin seems to know you well.

522
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,379
How to put this?

523
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:56,379
Well I, actually…

524
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,539
How to put this?

525
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:07,617
Korn and I are not siblings.

526
00:36:10,851 --> 00:36:11,921
(What’s up with you?)

527
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:16,899
Babe, are you shy?

528
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:22,899
If you don’t say it, I will.

529
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:30,939
Actually, Korn and I

530
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:39,899
are an item.

531
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,482
So what is it exactly?

532
00:36:43,482 --> 00:36:45,899
Are you two a thing?

533
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:54,859
Yes.

534
00:36:55,176 --> 00:36:56,761
Now that you know.

535
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:00,481
Can you please not call my boyfriend at late hours?

536
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:02,533
He’s too polite.

537
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:06,499
Can you let him have some quality time with me?

538
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,499
Please.

539
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:14,499
Sure. Well, please enjoy your food.

540
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:16,259
I’ll excuse myself.

541
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:36,659
Win, what the hell did you do?

542
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:40,659
You and I need to talk, Korn.

543
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,459
Here you go.

544
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,865
Why are you not eating?

545
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,228
Come over here.

546
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:56,370
Katin.

547
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:58,669
Katin!

548
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:00,391
What’s wrong?

549
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:02,045
Your saliva is sticky.

550
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:05,437
Katin’s saliva is sticky.

551
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,411
Her stomach is bloating.

552
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,459
What to do?

553
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,002
You told Pat that I’m your sister.

554
00:38:11,002 --> 00:38:13,355
But you told other people that I’m your girlfriend or wife.

555
00:38:13,355 --> 00:38:15,459
Do you care about Pat’s feelings that much?

556
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,454
You told me not to call you like that.

557
00:38:18,454 --> 00:38:19,259
Listen, Korn.

558
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,899
Can’t you really tell when you can say that and when you cannot?

559
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:26,087
Seriously, Korn. Are you too naive or too…

560
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:27,909
You keep calling me this and that.

561
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,779
Watch your mouth. You are pissing me off.

562
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:32,213
Then what are you gonna do?

563
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:34,213
You are going too far.

564
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,099
Hello, Non.

565
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,099
Katin is in bad shape.

566
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:46,379
What’s wrong with her?

567
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,140
She’s breathing rapidly and shallowly.

568
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,099
Her stomach is bloating.

569
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,099
Her saliva is sticky too.

570
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:55,797
It must be bloating.

571
00:38:55,797 --> 00:38:57,739
Can you come here and check on her?

572
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,690
Okay.

573
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:03,859
What’s the matter?

574
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,419
She never has these symptoms.

575
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:10,779
But from what I see, she is suffering from bloating.

576
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:14,257
Is it serious?

577
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:16,000
It is if she falls down.

578
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,785
She may die.

579
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:20,859
She could die? What should we do?

580
00:39:21,478 --> 00:39:22,859
There’s only one way.

581
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,499
We must stab her stomach.

582
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:26,602
Stab her stomach?

583
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:28,272
Yes.

584
00:39:28,988 --> 00:39:29,958
Do you know how to do that?

585
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,860
I never dare to do it. I can’t.

586
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,139
Normally, Mr. Win does this task.

587
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:37,139
Can any of you do it?

588
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,739
I must go back to the farm right away.

589
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:48,770
Katin is not okay.

590
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,779
You must be okay, Katin.

591
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:00,662
Calm down.

592
00:40:00,662 --> 00:40:02,662
Katin will be okay.

593
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:05,659
Please hang in there.

594
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,050
Please be okay, Katin.

595
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,423
Please be okay.

596
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:38,983
You never showed up before. Why are you meddling with us now?

597
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:42,511
We know what we should do and not do here.

598
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:44,472
Win, stop!

599
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:47,579
Think carefully before you get angry and yell at people.

600
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:50,000
Here’s the truth.

601
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,201
I didn’t come with you because I stopped being mad at you.

602
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,579
I came because I want to end this.

603
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:56,914
Win.

604
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:59,579
Where are you?

605
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,730
Please help me.

606
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,485
Korn,

607
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:32,619
you are the only person in the world that I don’t want to hate.

608
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,619
Can you tell me…

609
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:44,620
what you did that for?

610
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:55,619
I want to go back and be on good terms with you again.
