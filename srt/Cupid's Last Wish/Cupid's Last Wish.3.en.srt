1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
You have to pay respect to four monks and ask them for holy water within the next 7 days.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,600
I wrote down everything in this paper.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,460
(I only have seven days. Will I finish the mission in time?)

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,740
You’re still mad at Korn?

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,280
I’ve been thinking about this for a year and I still can’t think of one reason,

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,880
except he’s been sucking up to my father for his fortune.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,320
Ouch!

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,400
Don’t mess with me!

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,260
I’m her husband.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,260
My wife is always sulking.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,820
Leave me alone already.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,980
You see where your stubbornness got you?

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,980
The abbot said you have to go with me.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,240
Otherwise, bad things will happen to you.

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,600
If you don’t care about your body, at least care about your sister’s.

Be careful.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,180
I know.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,500
We’re almost there.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,020
Keep going, Win.

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,140
Come on.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,720
Win.

23
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,960
Hey! What’s wrong?

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,620
Win!

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,080

Hey, Win.

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,020
Win.

36
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,880
What?

37
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,540
What? It’s dark already?

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,980
Yes.

39
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,360
What happened to me?

40
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,700
You passed out.

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,320
If you hadn’t woken up, I would be taking you to the hospital.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,080
Listen, Win.

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,300
Lin is not as physically strong as you.

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,280
Hadn’t I caught you, Lin’s head could have hit the ground.

45
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,020
Alright. I got it.

46
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,980
Let’s find the abbot so we can leave this place.

47
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,660
What are you looking at?

48
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,440
Don’t look.

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,180
What are you playing, Korn?

50
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,980
I’m not.
It’s not funny.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,460
Just don’t look.

52
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,820
Hey. Stop playing.

53
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,900
What the hell is that?

54
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,020
Gosh. It’s a floating head ghost.

55
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,860
A floating head ghost, isn’t it?

56
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,180
Did you see that?

57
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,520
Win.

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
It’s right there.

59
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,280
It’s the floating head ghost.

60
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,720
No, it’s not. It’s a person.

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,920
I don’t believe you.

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,000
Then turn and look again.

63
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,400
It’s not a ghost but a human.

64
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,160
Come on. Open your eyes.

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,620
Now, look.

66
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,460
Where do you want to go?

67
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,460
To this temple. We would like to see the abbot.

68
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,100
Why at this hour?

69
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,020
My friend is tired.

70
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,020
So we take a break.

71
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,920
I’ll show you the way.

72
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,260
Thank you.

73
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,360
Let’s go.

74
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,440
Come on.

75
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,580
Come have some water.

76
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,200
You can continue your journey later.

77
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,080
(Do you know you can be turned into floating head ghosts through saliva?)

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,680
(If anyone offers you water, don’t take it.)

79
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,600
Well, I have a sensitive stomach. I’m afraid of getting diarrhea.

80
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,720
This is clean rainwater.

81
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,720
I have been drinking it since I was born.

82
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,900
Your friend is also drinking it.

83
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Hey. Don’t drink that!

84
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,240
Win!

85
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,500
What did you do?

86
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,260
It will make you want to pee.

87
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,660
There’s no toilet here.

88
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,060
There.

89
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,320
You can pee there.

90
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,800
You can also pee here.

91
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,140
Why?

92
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,660
Do you think I’m a ghost?

93
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,740
Shit. I’m out of here.

94
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,300
Win!

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,340
Where are you going?

96
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,440
I’m done today. I’ll come back again tomorrow.

97
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,100
I’ll be here early in the morning.

98
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Calm down.

99
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,300
Didn’t you hear her? She said she was a head floating ghost.

100
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,720
Can’t you tell that she was teasing you?

101
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,720
Korn.

102
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,660
The man down there warned us not to drink any water offered.

103
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,980
What if it’s true?

104
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,360
Why did you drink that water?

105
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,480
But head floating ghosts are not real.

106
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,840
How can you be sure of that?

107
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,180
I even got a soul swap here.

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
You’ve got a point there.

109
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,920
Hey, Korn!

110
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,540
Korn, what’s going on?

111
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,180
What the hell are you playing?

112
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,580
How’s that? Did I scare you?

113
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,480
(Asshole)

114
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,260
Korn! What is that thing behind me?

115
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,180
What is behind me?

116
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,400
Trees.

117
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,560
No. Did you hear that sound?

118
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,560
Yes, I did.

119
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,280
It’s gonna be okay.

120
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
If you are scared,

121
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
stay close to me.

122
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,700
Stop kneading my face already.

123
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,320
It’s not a Chinese bun.

124
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,100
Where are we?

125
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,700
My legs are stiff. I can’t walk.

126
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,420
I can’t see anything either.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,500
Don’t worry. I’ll be your eyes.

128
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,980
Don’t look. Don’t listen to anything else

129
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,400
except my voice.

130
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,400
Hey. What’s that?

131
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,180
Don’t leave me.

132
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,240
Okay. I will not leave you.

133
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,460
Don’t leave me behind.

134
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,200
I’m right here.

135
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,080
We have arrived.

136
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,840
Wait. Are you sure?

137
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,840
Yes. Open your eyes.

138
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,120
We are at the temple’s hall.

139
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,620
But I think…

140
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,480
we are here too late.

141
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,620
How come? We have walked so far.

142
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,480
It’s so damn exhausting.

143
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,780
Now what?

144
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,100
We have no choice but to leave.

145
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,880
You’re here?

146
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,920
Good evening.

147
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,520
You are here for the holy water, right?

148
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,960
Come on in. I have prepared it for you.

149
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,960
How did he know?

150
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,180
There's a 5G signal here.

151
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,520
I mean the Venerable Uncle probably called or sent a message to him.

152
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,380
Go.

153
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,220
Have you brought any containers?

154
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,820
Win, you are now in a female body.

155
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,740
Keep reminding yourself of that.

156
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,860
As you walked to here,

157
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,240
I saw you covering his eyes.

158
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,160
Why did you do that?

159
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,040
He’s afraid of ghosts.

160
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,280
They say there are head floating ghosts here.

161
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,960
That’s not true.

162
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,040
I met a middle aged woman earlier. She has messy hair,

163
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,380
wearing old clothes.

164
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,380
She offered us water to drink.

165
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,780
Who is she?

166
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,620
That must be Jan.

167
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,340
She isn’t…

168
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,640
She is…

169
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,220
She is a homeless woman.

170
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,940
She eats and lives in this temple.

171
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,520
She’s not a troublemaker.

172
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,500
She came here before me, actually.

173
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,320
That’s a relief.

174
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,040
I thought she was a head floating ghost.

175
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,600
See?

176
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,360
If you see things with your eyes, not your heart,

177
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,740
you won’t see anything clearly.

178
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,260
If you cover your eyes with your hands,

179
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,000
you are not completely blind.

180
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,900
But if you shut down your heart,

181
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,940
you will be completely blind.

182
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,800
Finally, the first bottle.

183
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,020
It wasn’t that hard.

184
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,280
Hey.

185
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,460
Where have you been?

186
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,640
I was saying goodbye to the abbot.

187
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,420
Wait.

188
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640
What time is it?

189
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,420
It’s 9:45 p.m.

190
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,320
We arrived around 4 p.m.

191
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,500
It took us a bit over 1 hour to walk up here.

192
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,960
Do you think how many hours it takes to walk down?

193
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,760
I think walking down is faster than walking up. Trust me. Let’s go.

194
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,400
Hey! What’s the rush?

195
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,400
Why? Are you scared of ghosts still?

196
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,240
The abbot said there was no ghost here.

197
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,900
No ghost here doesn’t mean no ghost anywhere else.

198
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,340
So?

199
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,220
Is it possible? If I…

200
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,820
What’s wrong?

201
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,980
What do you want to say? Just say it.

202
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,840
We have more places to go.

203
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,080
I said I was going to those places alone.

204
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,000
I allow you to come with me now.

205
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,000
Why?

206
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,800
You want to go with me, right?

207
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,780
No, I don’t.

208
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,040
I’m just afraid of ghosts.

209
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,240
You are?

210
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,880
Yeah.

211
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,900
Win, you can just say the truth in your mind.

212
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,080
It doesn’t make you look bad or anything.

213
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,620
(Jackass)

214
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,120
Wait for me!

215
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,040
You ate quite a lot before going up there.

216
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,840
Slow down. I’m not gonna eat it.

217
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,060
Right now, my body doesn’t feel full yet.

218
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,420
I need to hurry before my body stops me.

219
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,500
This is just the first temple.

220
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,380
I don’t want to imagine how it’s gonna be for the remaining trip.

221
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,640
It’s so exhausting.

222
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,700
Too hot?

223
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
No. It’s too large.

224
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,980
Give it to me.

225
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,440
Are you taking my bun?

226
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,680
No. I’m gonna blow it to make it cool down for you.

227
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,400
Alright. It’s not hot anymore.

228
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,360
Actually, you can just tell me what you want to eat.

229
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,540
Anyway, is the second temple far away?

230
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,620
From here to the next stop is around…

231
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,980
700 kilometers.

232
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,320
What? 700 km!

233
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,800
It’s that far?

234
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,320
I don’t think we can reach there within a day.

235
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,380
Let’s just finish eating and take off.

236
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,860
Who is eating exactly?

237
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,240
You are the only one who eats here.

238
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,780
Go ahead. I’m not gonna eat.

239
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,580
Why is Katin doll here?

240
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,700
Since you kicked me out,

241
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,200
it has always been here.

242
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,660
Get out of my house, Korn.

243
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,480
Don’t ever come back.

244
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,420
We’ll book just one room.

245
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,560
Why just one?

246
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,180
Can you stay alone? Aren’t you afraid of getting haunted?

247
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,720
Good evening, sir.

248
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Good evening. Do you have a vacant room?

249
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,360
We do, sir.	How many rooms do you need?

250
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,260
Only one.

251
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,840
Alright.

252
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,720
This way, sir.

253
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,200
There are not many guests today, so I’ve upgraded your room to a suite room.

254
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,200
This way, sir.

255
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
Here you are. This is your room.

256
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,040
If you need anything, you can call the Front service anytime.

257
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,240
Thank you.

258
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,860
Korn.

259
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,440
I will sleep on the bed and you sleep on…

260
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,060
Hey!

261
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,880
Why is the bathroom wide open like this?

262
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,880
It’s a suite room, I guess.

263
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,020
You can take a shower first if you like.

264
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,440
How can I take a shower here?

265
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,280
You will see my sister naked.

266
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,960
I’m not that kind of person.

267
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,100
No way. I better get a new room.

268
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,560
Hey.

269
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,020
(The bathroom is alright here.)

270
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,120
(Why would I bother, though? This room is all mine.)

271
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,740
(It’s spacious. Good.)

272
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,080
(Wait a minute. What is this?)

273
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,760
(Why is there a loft here?)

274
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,620
Holy shit!

275
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,540
Korn. Korn!

276
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,040
It should be only seven days.

277
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,680
Korn, open the door!

278
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,700
Come on. Open the door!

279
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,080
What’s wrong?

280
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,140
Let me stay here too.

281
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,700
Sorry. I’ve got to go now.

282
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,680
Who were you talking to at this hour?

283
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,940
I got a call from my colleague. He said I didn’t submit an absence leave.

284
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,260
Is he the person who always tags you on Facebook?

285
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,040
Yes. His name is Phat.

286
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,600
Hold on.

287
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,860
Have you been snooping on my Facebook?

288
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,760
No!

289
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,720
I don’t need to do that.

290
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,260
Your post just shows up on my feed.

291
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,260
Really?

292
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,120
Yes.

293
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,060
Why did you answer his call?

294
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,080
Isn’t it too late to call someone at night? It’s out of working hours.

295
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,080
He called about work.

296
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,940
He would yell at me if I didn’t pick up.

297
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,140
From now on, let me answer his call for you.

298
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,380
I will play the role of a bitchy boyfriend for you.

299
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,620
Hold on.

300
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,140
Did you just say ‘boyfriend’?

301
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,200
I just want to find someone to play with.

302
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,740
I want to lecture him.

303
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,500
Or do you want me to lecture you instead?

304
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,140
Be my guest.

305
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,960
Hey!

306
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,660
What are you doing?

307
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,320
Aren’t you going to lecture me?

308
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,480
If not, I’ll go take a shower now.

309
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,820
Close the curtain too.

310
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,200
I’ll leave it open.

311
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,400
Damn it, Korn!

312
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,520
Alright.

313
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,580
Here you go.

314
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,760
Green beans in warm syrup.

315
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,140
It gives you the energy to keep watching the cows all night long.

316
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
Don’t fall asleep, alright?

317
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
I can’t help.

318
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,820
Mr. Win is not around and yells at me.

319
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,140
It’s too boringly quiet. I can’t help falling asleep.

320
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,140
That’s your excuse?

321
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,880
Jorn, listen.

322
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,720
If you are sleepy,

323
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,400
come and sleep in my room.

324
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,560
I will press speed 3 on my fan to blow you all night.

325
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,020
Don’t use your soft voice if you don’t want me to flick at your uvula.

326
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,140
No, thanks.

327
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,440
I feel more at ease sleeping beside Katin.

328
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,460
Contain your flirt, Sang. Or else I tell your mother.

329
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,240
Give me a break. I’m just teasing him for fun.

330
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,560
Right, Jorn?

331
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,520
Come to think of it.

332
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,300
Our Farm has become so quiet since the incident.

333
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,780
True.

334
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,940
Ms. Lin is not home.

335
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,260
I can’t help feeling worried about Ms. Lin.

336
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,800
She goes with Mr. Korn alone.

337
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,980
How is it going to be?

338
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,280
How could Mrs. Pornuma let her go with Mr. Korn like that?

339
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,400
But Mr. Korn is no stranger.

340
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,560
He has been playing with Ms. Lin since they were small.

341
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,840
You are gossiping about your employer.

342
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,140
Mrs. Pornuma might hear you.

343
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,640
No way. She has gone to sleep long ago.

344
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,400
No need to worry at all.

345
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,540
Damn in, Korn!

346
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,860
[Mom]

347
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,620
What’s up, Mom?

348
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,440
Lin, are you still awake?

349
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,040
I’m about to take a shower and go to bed.

350
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,040
How was it today?

351
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,960
It went alright. I got the holy water from the first temple here.

352
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,440
Where are you now?

353
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,440
At a hotel.

354
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,180
Are you okay to sleep alone?

355
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,400
How is the room? Show me.

356
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,520
You don’t need to see. I’ve unpacked and my stuff is all over.

357
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,620
There’s nothing to see.

358
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,920
It’s okay. Let me see just a bit. Come on.

359
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,740
Did you see it?

360
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,580
No. One more time.

361
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,360
Okay now?

362
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,060
I’m sleepy. Let me go to sleep.

363
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,460
I’m done with the bathroom. You can use it now.

364
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,000
Lin, whose voice is that?

365
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,600
(Damn it, Korn)

366
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,280
(What?)

367
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,700
(My mom.)

368
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,580
Your mom?

369
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,360
Yes.

370
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,060
Lin, who are you with?

371
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,340
Uh…

372
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,040
Who is that?

373
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,040
Well, it’s just that…

374
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,340
The water in Korn’s bathroom is not working, so he is using my bathroom.

375
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,560
He’s just done.

376
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,280
He’s going back to his room now.

377
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,180
Good evening, Mrs. Pornuma.

378
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,000
Go back to your room. I’m going to use the bathroom next.

379
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,360
(My room.)

380
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,360
(Go. Get out)

381
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,460
(Get out of here first.)

382
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,500
Look, Mom. He’s left.

383
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,440
Korn has left.

384
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,900
I was shocked. I thought you shared the room with him.

385
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,620
Come on, Mom. Why would I share the room with him?

386
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,780
I won’t do that.

387
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,580
Don’t tell anyone about this trip.

388
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,580
I don’t want people to gossip about us.

389
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,840
I hate it.

390
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
Alright. I  got it.

391
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,540
Good night, Mom. I’m sleepy.

392
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,520
What? Why did she hang up so suddenly?

393
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,460
I’m done talking with Mom.

394
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,320
Can I come in now?

395
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,000
Yes.

396
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,460
Hey.

397
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,260
Is everything okay?

398
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,380
Nothing. I just want to say that

399
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,100
if you want to turn off the light, just do it on your side.

400
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,340
Leave the light on my side on.

401
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,800
I’m going to sleep now.

402
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,100
Damn it, Korn!

403
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,880
What are you doing?

404
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,380
I try to find a comfortable position to sleep.

405
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,660
Fine.

406
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,240
You can sleep up here.

407
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,840
What about you?

408
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,840
I’m not going to switch with you.

409
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,700
I’m just afraid you won’t get enough sleep.

410
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,040
We have a long way to go tomorrow.

411
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,840
It’s not like I care about you.

412
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,580
I just don’t want to die.

413
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,320
Get up here.

414
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Come on.

415
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,380
Hey! What are you doing?

416
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,900
I’m giving you the blanket.

417
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,540
I don’t need it. It’ll be too warm.

418
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,180
You may catch a cold.

419
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,360
I don’t want it.

420
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,620
Hey.

421
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,440
You are afraid that I might catch a cold

422
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,020
because you don’t want me to become a burden, right?

423
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,740
No. Because I care.

424
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,900
I care about Lin.

425
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,200
She’s not as strong as you.

426
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,340
Fine.

427
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,340
Then don’t ever cross to this side

428
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,720
and keep your hands to yourself.

429
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,480
If your hands are on me once, I’ll kick you in the face once.

430
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,500
If your hands are on me twice, I’ll kick you in the face twice.

431
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,760
If you want to know how strong my kick is,

432
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,320
try me.

433
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,920
Hey!

434
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,680
Didn’t you hear what I said at all?

435
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,200
I didn’t do anything.

436
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,660
I’m just putting the blanket on you.

437
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,000
I don’t want it.

438
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,520
Shit!

439
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,120
Korn, you!

440
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,600
Win!

441
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,840
Did you take advantage of my sister?

442
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,320
I didn’t.

443
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,560
But you held her in your arms.

444
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,060
I didn’t. You did.

445
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,940
Why didn’t you tell me?

446
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,120
I did but you didn’t awake.

447
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,840
Win, are you alright?

448
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,580
I’m fine. What time is it?

449
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,660
Shit. It’s 8 o’clock.

450
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,020
Normally, I never wake up this late.

451
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,520
I think Lin’s body needs more rest.

452
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,040
Listen. I’m not going to take advantage of your sister.

453
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,780
Especially, it’s you in her body.

454
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,740
I won’t do such a thing.

455
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,640
Good.

456
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,540
Hurry. We are late.

457
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,040
Pack up and check out.

458
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:46,880
Okay.

459
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,120
Now!

460
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,260
Is he sleeping or dying?

461
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,620
Are you up?

462
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,720
I didn’t sleep. I was just resting my eyes.

463
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,420
But I heard you snoring.

464
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,340
That wasn’t my snore.

465
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,680
Just my breathing sound was loud. Like this.

466
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,000
Really?

467
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,900
Yes.

468
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,080
Win! Don’t. It’s dangerous.

469
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,300
It’s not.

470
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,860
You might fall.

471
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,960
I’m not gonna fall out of the car. I’m this big.

472
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,120
You called yourself big.

473
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,860
I know.

474
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,720
Be careful.

475
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,240
How is it? Breezy, right?

476
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,120
Do you still keep this jacket?

477
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,200
Yes. You remember?

478
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,020
I do.

479
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,180
What is this place?

480
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,100
It’s a northern cuisine.

481
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,800
Will it work?

482
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,020
It will. Trust me.

483
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,880
If it’s not good, I’m gonna kick your ass.

484
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,740
My ass is safe from your kick, right?

485
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,500
Thank you.

486
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,380
What is this? I didn’t order.

487
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,340
It was me.

488
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,060
What is the black thing in this?

489
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,940
This is Crab Chili Paste.

490
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,700
The black thingy is from a paddy field crab.

491
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,320
The crab is pounded finely and mixed with chili.

492
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,100
Try it. It’s good.

493
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Is it really good?

494
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,500
Yes. Try.

495
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,040
Holy crap. It’s really good.

496
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,960
If you knew a lot of yummy foods, you should have told me.

497
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,120
I just learned about this dish last year.

498
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,720
There was a northern food festival at my hotel.

499
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,900
I didn’t know how to tell you…back then.

500
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,420
Go on.

501
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,700
How many more hours until we reach the temple?

502
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,180
Around 2 hours.

503
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,440
But don’t worry,

504
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,580
I’m sure we get there before dark.

505
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,580
Good.

506
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,780
What’s with that stuff you have?

507
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,520
Crispy Rice snack. Have you eaten it before?

508
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,520
Well,

509
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,520
I bought this from an old lady.

510
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,140
She gave me this too.

511
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,500
Frankincense.

512
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,100
She said if I lit this up,

513
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,000
it would make the whole trip even more joyful.

514
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,500
I’m gonna light it up now.

515
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,580
In here?

516
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:24,160
Yeah. If you don’t like the smell, just open the windows.

517
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,860
It smells kinda nice.

518
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,420
It does.

519
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,420
Let’s get going.

520
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,940
Ready? Let’s go.

521
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,040
You just drive along the way.

522
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,900

Win!

571
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,480
Is it really you?

572
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,280
Yes.

573
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,660
If I'd been the one who got lost in the forest, would you have saved me?

574
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,920
I would have left you to die.

575
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,880
What the hell is this blood?

576
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,640
Do you still keep this jacket?

577
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,780
Yes. You remember?

578
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,620
I do.

579
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,780
Win, look!

580
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,140
It’s so beautiful.

581
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,580
8 YEARS AGO

582
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,740
What’s wrong? Are you cold?

583
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,260
Yeah. How could I know?

584
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,260
It’s so damn warm at the foothill.

585
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,200
I told you that it would be cold up here.

586
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,960
Do you need to repeat that?

587
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,180
I don’t.

588
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,120
What are you doing?

589
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,380
Get it.

590
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,060
Aren’t you cold?

591
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,620
Worry about yourself first.

592
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,180
Let’s share.

593
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,880
I don’t want you to freeze to death.

594
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,020
(Thank you.)

595
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,320
It’s so beautiful.
