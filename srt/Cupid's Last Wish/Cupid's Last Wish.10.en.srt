1
00:00:00,343 --> 00:00:01,758
Aunt wants Korn

2
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:03,109
With Lin

3
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:04,867
Engaged

4
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:07,633
I am ready to be responsible for everything.

5
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:09,672
Lin likes Ai Kon?

6
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,093
like

7
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:14,351
And what is it in the past?

8
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:16,726
What do you think about me?

9
00:00:17,937 --> 00:00:18,718
I didn't think anything about you.

10
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:58,703
I'm here

11
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:01,507
Where are you?

12
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:04,711
Whether it's okay, a small engagement event is organized in the house.

13
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:07,109
But if Lin is married, must

14
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:10,320
Ja ... Thank you.

15
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,008
Aunt Porn Sawat is good.

16
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:14,992
Have you come for a long time?

17
00:01:15,414 --> 00:01:16,187
Not long ago

18
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:20,008
I'll be finished. I'll sit and wait.

19
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:22,328
- I'll go see Lin first - Yes

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,992
Hey, I'm not late today.

21
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:34,984
How are you excited?

22
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:37,226
I don't know

23
00:01:37,672 --> 00:01:42,172
Hey, make your face good. I know I don't want to be engaged.

24
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:45,390
You got that right

25
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:48,383
What is this glasses?

26
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:52,734
Well, what is it crazy about me?

27
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:56,937
You don't have to pay attention. You have met Win yet.

28
00:01:58,515 --> 00:01:59,109
Still

29
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,039
And you can talk to it

30
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,523
Didn't talk to both

31
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,914
But after today

32
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:12,804
You and it will talk for a long time.

33
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:15,179
Hey, what are you talking about?

34
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,726
Where did I speak wrong? I'll be engaged.

35
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:19,140
You have to move here, right?

36
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:20,703
You and it must meet.

37
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,140
And you and it will talk for a long time

38
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:28,297
What is this long? I can't read it.

39
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,414
Lin is here.

40
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:51,914
Erkorn, I'll go to pay respect to Uncle Amon first.

41
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:53,054
yes

42
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:10,804
Pee Non

43
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:14,765
Pee Non

44
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:16,648
- Pee Non - Find

45
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:21,898
Lin is afraid

46
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:26,281
Don't be afraid. Lin believes you.

47
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,500
If we say it first, it means we are allergic.

48
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:32,351
um

49
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:34,984

I'm handsome today.

63
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:44,047
Dress up as a man and him as well.

64
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,117
Oh, what about the necklace?

65
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:51,679
Oh, Nang Soi is busy in the kitchen.

66
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:54,929
Oh, why don't you go to help Nong Lavo?

67
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,554
This is really not a matter.

68
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:00,187
Necklace

69
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:01,687
Necklace

70
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:04,414
Wait, elder Go to help the necklace.

71
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:08,062
Huh ... don't have to.

72
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:11,609
There are a lot of people in the kitchen. Going in and cluttering him in vain

73
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:14,078
Stay with me Help me work here.

74
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:16,172
- Yes - scary.

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,086
I held it for a moment. I'll put the orange flower above.

76
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:22,023
Yeah, it will look a little outstanding.

77
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:26,843
Half past eight Win hasn't come down yet.

78
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,836
Can someone please follow?

79
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:31,562
Everywhere was never late.

80
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:36,203
Mom, I'll follow you.

81
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:46,015
Pee Win, mother, come and follow.

82
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,648
Win isn't in the room? Where are you going?

83
00:05:57,117 --> 00:05:58,453
Lin doesn't know, Mom.

84
00:06:01,054 --> 00:06:01,929
It doesn't accept

85
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:03,710
Then wait. Please call.

86
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:07,328
- And then go find it? - I can't find it.

87
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,710
I still haven't found it all over.

88
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:19,109
But in the morning I still see Khun Win.

89
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,539
Dress up very handsome.

90
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:22,875
- Where do you see? - Around this.

91
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,086
Around this time, at about three o'clock

92
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,476
I think you Should not sleep

93
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,390
So excited to find something to do.

94
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:33,515
So let's help find this area first.

95
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,164
Yes, you can go to the light.

96
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:47,343
Calm down. I think I have to find it.

97
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:51,508
Pee Non Lin is not good at all.

98
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:52,765
Calm down

99
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:56,601
Lin was afraid that Win would really escape.

100
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:02,039
I think Iin doesn't do that.

101
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:05,656
Lin said we told the truth to the mother, is it good?

102
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:08,023
What is the truth?

103
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:11,047
Tell

104
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:16,281
Before the matter escalated

105
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:22,476
Lin said that we told me to tell me first.

106
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:25,406
And why Lin wants to know?

107
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:28,851
Don't tell me that Lin likes Ai Kon.

108
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:30,906
Don't know what to say

109
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:35,203
But if you ask if you like it or not, I like it very much.

110
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:38,492
- Pee Non - It's okay.

111
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:45,203
Who said that I like Meaning that he likes elder brother Non

112
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:51,749
Well, Lin knew what those two of them were.

113
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,179
But that Lin asked elder Non

114
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:55,992
Because Lin wants to be sure that elder Non feels the same as Lin.

115
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:59,117
And another thing Lin wants Win and Kon.

116
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,523
He speaks his true feelings once.

117
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:08,906
Maybe

118
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:11,773
It will not be able to do anything.

119
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:13,351
Why?

120
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:14,898
Pee Non

121
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,023
Do you know what the mother said last night?

122
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:22,789
Mother said that she would have Lin engaged with elder Korn.

123
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:27,609
- Really? - Um

124
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,913
What should Lin do?

125
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,218
Then it's engaged.

126
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:39,351
Lin played on the water first.

127
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,547
The engagement story May be a good catalyst

128
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,773
That will make Ain talk about its true feelings

129
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:50,625
- Really? - Really, you're a friend.

130
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:51,992
Believe

131
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:55,570
So elder Non has to help Lin.

132
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:57,781
comfortable

133
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:01,179
What are you doing?

134
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:06,718
Well, I don't think that this matter will be so aggressive.

135
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,953
I think that two days, it will say.

136
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:13,109
It is a impatient person to die. You know.

137
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:16,578
You shouldn't do this.

138
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,593
Lin elder said that I have to talk about this with Mae Lin first.

139
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:23,906
Let's go.

140
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,664
Aunty Porn accepted me that we have a misunderstanding.

141
00:09:33,914 --> 00:09:34,750
About what?

142
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:41,523
Mother

143
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:46,906
Lin, isn't it engaged with elder Kon?

144
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,476
what?

145
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,804
Mother Lin, I'm sorry.

146
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:59,765
But Lin didn't feel like that.

147
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,781
Lincinn, like a brother

148
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:10,453
And Lin is confident.

149
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,867
That elder Kon also loves Lin like a sister

150
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,172
But the mother talked to Korn that day

151
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:24,672
At Korn and Lin

152
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,015
It may not sound Make Sense.

153
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:37,828
But after the accident that day

154
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,531
The person who recovered to take the holy water with elder Korn

155
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:44,609
Meaning Win, Mom

156
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:48,390
Lin and Win switch body. Mom.

157
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:54,547
That the mother said that Lin is not the same

158
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:58,117
Because that is Win, not Lin.

159
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,453
- Ai Sia Kon - No

160
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:05,445
Because you alone Causing me to be like this

161
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,172
If mom doesn't believe Mom, don't disparage.

162
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,789
This kind of edge is done, it doesn't damage anything.

163
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,570
Mother has not yet said anything.

164
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:15,812
Talk a lot. Like we are not wrong

165
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:21,750
That the mother felt that Lin loves elder Korn

166
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:25,148
That is Win. Who likes elder Korn

167
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:31,062
Mom can see what Lin thinks about Korn.

168
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,132
Do you like it?

169
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:36,867
Lin mother is a mother.

170
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,672
Why don't you know what we think of him?

171
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,312
Is this true?

172
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:54,601
Then means

173
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,007
Kon knows that in it. Is it a win?

174
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:00,195
Yes, I know.

175
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,390
I knew since when he revived.

176
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:15,937
What is your mother?

177
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:20,554
I don't know which person is who?

178
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:24,726
Mother, don't think so.

179
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,914
And then

180
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:46,859
Do you like Win?

181
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:56,164
yes

182
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,000
Mother

183
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:08,015
Mother allows the two of them to love each other.

184
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:18,078
I can't find it.

185
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:20,492
I didn't meet either.

186
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:23,156
But I saw a pickup truck disappeared.

187
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:25,390
Not sure if Khun Win drives or not.

188
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,226
Come back to win ...

189
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:32,554
No Win

190
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,070
Or Win will drive out

191
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:40,484
Where did you go?

192
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:42,070
Where did you go?

193
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,656
Where did you go?

194
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:46,656
Mom, my mother is calm, mom.

195
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,624
- Where did you go? - Calm down, mom.

196
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:49,984
Mother is calm.

197
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:51,093
Hey Ai Kon

198
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:08,125
Hey, it's over.

199
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,953
What should I do?

200
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:27,836
Eat a lot. This meal, I raise it myself.

201
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:31,812
Well, you go to be a chef in Bangkok.

202
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:33,468
You leave me

203
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:37,726
Bangkok and Chon Buri. I only drive one hour.

204
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:39,609
I don't leave you.

205
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:44,718
- I asked if you will disappear. - I'm not touchy.

206
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:46,890
Hey, what?

207
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:48,789
You can disappear.

208
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,312
- What are you touched? - Not touchy.

209
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:52,539
- You are touchy - I'm not touchy.

210
00:14:52,564 --> 00:14:53,968
- You are touchy.

211
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:57,015
- Guru, I think you are touchy. - Enough, let go.

212
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,617
- I want to be a chef. - I want to have a girlfriend.

213
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:01,726
Are you crazy?

214
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:30,461
How do you know that I'm here?

215
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,148
Not difficult at all

216
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,039
This is our place.

217
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,422
Then why are you not at home?

218
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:52,375
What about my younger brother?

219
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:57,961
Actually, Lin, he didn't think anything about me.

220
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:00,609
Really?

221
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:06,054
Lin told me and told me to tell me.

222
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:09,843
And if Lin didn't think anything about you

223
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:12,515
Why are he engaged to you?

224
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,937
Let you dare to accept the truth

225
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:20,804
What is your truth?

226
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:35,812
The truth that you How do you feel about me?

227
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:39,757
Icon

228
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,929
I know that you What do you think about me?

229
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,820
And I'm also confident that you know what I think about you.

230
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:53,515
Win

231
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:56,547
Win

232
00:16:59,351 --> 00:16:59,866
mother

233
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:04,015
Don't do this again. My heart will fail

234
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,273
Do you know everyone, they are chaotic.

235
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:09,953
Win

236
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:13,578
Mother has a story to tell

237
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,023
All because of mother

238
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:31,187
That made Win and Korn

239
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,687
Quarrel

240
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,258
Since the father started writing the will

241
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:45,359
It was the last life of my father.

242
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:48,359
Mother feels

243
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:53,195
The whole world of the mother is about to collapse with his father.

244
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:57,359
Mother then became jealous of

245
00:18:00,484 --> 00:18:02,804
Huang the treasure that his father tried to create

246
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,672
He is a good person.

247
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:09,343
He will come to help Win take care of the farm.

248
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:15,500
You don't have to worry, I and my children will take good care of our farm.

249
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,015
Actually, stocks I don't want it at all.

250
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:36,039
Uncle understands, but I want to help you help me.

251
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,062
Because now Win is worried about his father's illness.

252
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,890
Aunt doesn't want him to be uncomfortable.

253
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:48,273
Please help me.

254
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,984
No one really

255
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,695
But my mother didn't tell me for this reason, isn't it?

256
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,086
Because it's not a true reason

257
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:10,390
Actually, my mother knows that

258
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:16,125
Regarding stocks, it will make Win and Korn be wrong.

259
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:21,562
Because my mother knows

260
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:24,758
Win can't accept it.

261
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,187
If you don't matter

262
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,242
It is really like that.

263
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:32,398
You already know, right?

264
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,179
Why is it?

265
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:36,687
Why did my father give you shares?

266
00:19:41,578 --> 00:19:42,703
You answered

267
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:45,101
Then you leave my house.

268
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:47,367
Get out of my life too

269
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,601
And why would you want me to hate with Ai Kon?

270
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,211
Well ...

271
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,445
Mom knows how Win feels about Korn.

272
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:05,506
All of them are my own stupid ideas.

273
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,943
That will separate the win with each other

274
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,951
Mom knows that I can't do it.

275
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:24,381
But the mother is stubborn to do

276
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:31,170
Mother gave him a engagement with Lin.

277
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:36,154
Because if they get married

278
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:38,646
Everything will be ours.

279
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,256
The story that was so aggressive

280
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:49,232
Because the mother herself was wrong

281
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,786
Mother almost caused Win to die.

282
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:54,724
Mother caused Win to die.

283
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:57,115
- Mother is wrong. Mother is not good. - Mother ...

284
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:59,193
Mother is wrong.

285
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,053
Mother, sorry

286
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,131
Mother, sorry

287
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:21,670
Mother, sorry

288
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,185
It's okay, Mom.

289
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,842
You know That when we quarrel

290
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:53,068
I'm never comfortable.

291
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:57,888
I think you almost every day.

292
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:01,162
So what about you?

293
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:05,693
the same

294
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,474
But I have never been angry with you. What do you think about me?

295
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,732
I think that you will disappear.

296
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:21,982
Hey, what is this good person?

297
00:22:24,513 --> 00:22:25,537
Like this, I'm finished.

298
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,928
When do you love me?

299
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:38,318
Since when I don't know

300
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:40,740
Once he realized it

301
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,037
I feel too much about you.

302
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:47,459
How about you?

303
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:50,717
the same

304
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:02,443
I used to think that if I flirt with you as a girlfriend

305
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:06,599
And finally, it had to stop saying goodbye anyway

306
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:09,021
Anyway, I definitely have to pay you.

307
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,162
And if we are dating a friend like this

308
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,803
Anyway, one day, we have to have something wrong.

309
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:16,349
Regardless of what

310
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:19,904
Whether it's a girlfriend

311
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:24,967
I think the relationship It also has an expiration date.

312
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:30,318
And what kind of relationship

313
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:33,638
To be together for the rest of his life

314
00:23:37,912 --> 00:23:38,787
Father and child

315
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:41,154
Proportion

316
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:44,232
You take good.

317
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:50,045
I don't know What will define it?

318
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,498
It's like you and me now.

319
00:24:10,154 --> 00:24:13,670
The past is very good.

320
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:22,115
Are you and me?

321
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:25,685

322
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:31,793

What are you doing here? Don't you go home?

358
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:24,808
- Pee Win - Huh

359
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:29,050
Ah In and Anu met you.

360
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:38,824
Why?

361
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:43,769
Today's engagement work I just came to congratulate.

362
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:45,675
But didn't come in time

363
00:27:49,144 --> 00:27:51,980
Yes, the engagement work has been canceled.

364
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:54,730
So why are you? What else do you want?

365
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:57,746
I keep calm.

366
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:08,058
Mother told Ah In and Anu. About what we quit work engagement

367
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,683
About your family I don't really want to be busy.

368
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,597
Who will love someone like someone? I don't care.

369
00:28:17,644 --> 00:28:18,800
But my interests

370
00:28:20,738 --> 00:28:21,777
It's been a long time

371
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:24,261
I haven't got an answer yet.

372
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:29,886
No profit this year

373
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:32,316
Then stop the business?

374
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:38,925
I'm looking for a way

375
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:47,277
Do you want this?

376
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:50,527
Meaning that I know the owner of the resort one

377
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:55,972
And then he opened the dairy farm at Pak Chong as well

378
00:28:56,832 --> 00:28:58,457
He knew about our business.

379
00:28:59,183 --> 00:29:01,480
Ah, so try to sell him.

380
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:03,605
He was interested in doing it.

381
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,238
Millions of profits

382
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:10,128
Ah think that if we sell him

383
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:12,246
Then share it for a hundred and two hundred

384
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:16,246
Ah, it's okay. Do we try this?

385
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,066
And if it was sold Our children, children, grandchildren

386
00:29:22,237 --> 00:29:24,082
His father tried to create for us.

387
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:26,386
Will let it break because of me

388
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:28,207
I won't

389
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:32,339
Why do you do it? You can't do it yourself.

390
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:34,472
Let the person who is better, isn't it better?

391
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,691
Do not act as a child, do not know a bit.

392
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:39,808
Win Win

393
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,644
calm down

394
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:52,480
I accept that in the past I may not do well enough.

395
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:56,668
I use too much emotion. I was impatient. I didn't listen to anyone.

396
00:29:57,175 --> 00:30:00,136
I know that I still have to learn to edit a lot.

397
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:05,918
But I'm confident

398
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:09,214
That I can still do

399
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:16,144
I would like one year.

400
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:43,207
What?

401
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:45,714
The grandchildren are already weakened.

402
00:30:47,082 --> 00:30:47,714
I know

403
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:52,636
Then it depends on you.

404
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,832
I just don't want it to get worse.

405
00:30:57,386 --> 00:30:58,769
If you think you can do it

406
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,183
I can definitely do it.

407
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:11,237
But one year, if still with red I will come back to talk again.

408
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:15,293
go

409
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:34,683
I don't have to worry. I will help you.

410
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:47,972
What are you drawing?

411
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,418
This is the way I wrote myself.

412
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:54,238
You say it will work.

413
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:57,566
Work

414
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:02,535

415
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:04,558
And what is this?

416
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,761

00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:20,181
Please give me a way. Please give me a way.

506
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:24,252
And I am a friend with these two people!

507
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:29,604
So cool

508
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:33,744
How are you? Are you tired today?

509
00:37:33,854 --> 00:37:34,604
Are you hot?

510
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:36,737
- Hot. - What do you have to think about?

511
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,135

512
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,447
Bakery and cool desserts

513
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:43,705
Made from fresh milk at our farm

514
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:45,987
By the skill that my wife

515
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:47,549
Please invite inside.

516
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,362

Not just a beautiful shop

519
00:37:53,878 --> 00:37:55,627
My wife is also beautiful.

520
00:37:55,652 --> 00:37:56,885
Wait, elder Non

521
00:37:58,494 --> 00:37:59,627
- Be beautiful? - Beautiful. Beautiful.

522
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,564
Of course

523
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:03,190
Here, I will recommend.

524
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:05,627
Here, there will be chocolate cakes.

525
00:38:05,822 --> 00:38:08,260
There is a kitchen. And orange cake

526
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:11,260
And another thing. Sorry.

527
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:13,971
Here, I can't miss it.

528
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,814
Souvenirs That everyone can buy

529
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,815
Can be paid back home.

530
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,744
- Cute? Cute? - Cute.

531
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,190
Cute, right?

532
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:25,674
- I want it. - Tell Mom.

533
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:49,127
Lin said that Non doesn't have to help Lin anymore.

534
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:52,401
Now, anything is in place.

535
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:55,635
Just elder Non on duty is probably already tired.

536
00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:58,307
You're just tired of this. It's okay.

537
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:01,362
Just Lin is not tired. I'm happy.

538
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,604
Thank you elder Non. That has always taken care of Lin

539
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:21,893
You have to thank Lin more.

540
00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:24,002
That gives you the opportunity to take care

541
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:34,205
Be happy

542
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:50,885
Gosh! Cough

543
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,228
So tired?

544
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:55,658
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

545
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,424
Cold ice cream will get tired.

546
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:08,783
thank

547
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,916
This ... One year now.

548
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:19,299
Passed quickly.

549
00:40:20,924 --> 00:40:23,932
Um ... I got a lot better.

550
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,603
A lot more profit than I thought.

551
00:40:29,588 --> 00:40:32,775
Ah, you didn't come to ask you to sell the farm.

552
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:33,853
um...

553
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,174
Get a dividend from that profit

554
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:40,135
Probably won't say anything

555
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:55,673
What's wrong?

556
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:01,197
I miss dad

557
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:14,158
I never thought.

558
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:18,658
That I will take my father's farm Come this far

559
00:41:19,689 --> 00:41:21,189
But you are very good.

560
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:25,697
I can't come to this extent.

561
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:28,189
If no one helped

562
00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:30,822
Who?

563
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:33,587
dog

564
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:35,345
Muyakorn

565
00:41:35,798 --> 00:41:37,064
You are still satisfied.

566
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:41,111
Why can't you call the name directly?

567
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:43,564
Is my name? I'm so shy to watch me.

568
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,548
You said it.

569
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:49,001
The words were cursed. Two words were cursed.

570
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:51,595
You are cursing since childhood until grown up.

571
00:41:52,197 --> 00:41:53,142
Hey, hurt

572
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:58,228
This is an autonomous. You don't know what I think about you.

573
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:00,087
You are already stupid.

574
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:02,892
I know, dear.

575
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:05,923
Hey, what are you doing?

576
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:06,712
Why

577
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:08,993
Wait, the subordinates will come to see.

578
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:10,579
I didn't see anyone seeing it.

579
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,673
Why do I want to hug and want to smell your fragrance?

580
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,478
I

581
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:24,822
I'm here.

582
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:31,275
- I -nin -huh

583
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:35,661

589
00:43:01,098 --> 00:43:01,708
What's wrong?

590
00:43:03,434 --> 00:43:04,528
I wonder if it's wrong.

591
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,067
Come here

592
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,692
Where here

593
00:43:25,192 --> 00:43:26,606
One year ago

594
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:29,927
I'm so tired. I didn't rest at all.

595
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:34,255
But here is a lot of places in the way

596
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:37,832
Should I find something to do?

597
00:43:38,036 --> 00:43:39,450
Go on a trip, some rest

598
00:43:41,013 --> 00:43:43,731
You can see working all day.

599
00:43:44,231 --> 00:43:45,513
When to take a break

600
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:47,653
- Now - find

601
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,263
- Speak immediately? - Um

602
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:56,231
Okay, but before I rest

603
00:43:57,114 --> 00:43:58,333
What do you ask for you?

604
00:43:59,114 --> 00:43:59,966
What are you asking?

605
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:02,208
Bow down

606
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:05,278
fast

607
00:44:07,403 --> 00:44:08,067
Bend again

608
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,802
Bow again

609
00:44:11,028 --> 00:44:11,700
A little more

610
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,356
I ask you

611
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:18,763
Complete massage

612
00:44:23,005 --> 00:44:25,153
Oh, what do you think of asking?

613
00:44:25,825 --> 00:44:27,317
And what do you think I will ask for?

614
00:44:29,263 --> 00:44:29,692
Ask for a kiss

615
00:44:35,811 --> 00:44:36,960
- Ai Kon - Ugh

616
00:44:38,249 --> 00:44:40,514
You can help kiss me as sweet.

617
00:45:05,132 --> 00:45:06,569
- Ai Kon - Ugh

618
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:10,803
I'll count one to three. Then we keep the cloth in the bag

619
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:14,678
- Yes - Three

620
00:45:14,827 --> 00:45:17,530
- Hey, I haven't started yet. You cheat.

621
00:45:19,264 --> 00:45:20,944
Hey, this is a shirt.

622
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,264
- Hey, what? - This is my shirt.

623
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:24,835
- You give me it - when?

624
00:45:24,913 --> 00:45:26,921
- Have you ever given me? - I asked when

625
00:45:27,178 --> 00:45:28,553
- I don't know, but you give me.

626
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:30,702
I haven't said that I just lend it.

627
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,342
- But you gave me - no

628
00:45:32,553 --> 00:45:33,428
Cough

629
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:36,171
- Will you not give? - Not.

630
00:45:36,288 --> 00:45:36,983
Not sure

631
00:45:37,008 --> 00:45:38,233
- I'm not sure - I'm sure.

632
00:45:38,258 --> 00:45:38,968
Yeah, don't give

633
00:45:40,241 --> 00:45:42,210
Hey, what are you doing?

634
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:43,405
- Take it -

635

- Bring it - you give me

636
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:45,882
This is Guba.

637
00:45:46,194 --> 00:45:47,968
- I said I didn't give -

638
00:45:48,616 --> 00:45:49,288
Cough

639
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,843
Cough

640
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,632
Cough

641
00:45:53,022 --> 00:45:54,233
- To give yet

642
00:45:54,258 --> 00:45:55,397
- To also - Ai Kon

643
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,046
- Give it yet - not

646
00:46:00,364 --> 00:46:01,770
- Don't you? - Don't you?

647
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:02,926
- I don't give -

648
00:46:03,817 --> 00:46:04,348
Hey what

649
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:12,668
Hey, Ewin

650
00:46:12,693 --> 00:46:13,696
Do you think you can do it alone?

651
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:14,822
You cheat again.

652
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,259
There is a cheat again.

653
00:46:16,728 --> 00:46:18,572
- Where are you cheating? - Here.

654
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:23,837
help

655
00:46:30,767 --> 00:46:33,603
Enough, okay, okay.

656
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,673
Take it. Where are you going?

657
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:40,298
- Stay here - Er

658
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,353
Take it. If you want it

659
00:46:42,603 --> 00:46:44,064
- You give me it - Okay.

660
00:46:45,572 --> 00:46:46,040
Get up

661
00:47:02,837 --> 00:47:04,361
Why are you driving this way?

662
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,275
This way can come in a moment.

663
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:08,298
What's up?

664
00:47:08,323 --> 00:47:11,111
If you turn it since just a moment ago So far, we have gone.

665
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:14,236
But this way is faster. Believe me, it is a shortcut.

666
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:16,501
Are you saying that you are better than Google Map?

667
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,220
Where did you find it? We still don't know.

668
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:21,783
Hey, if not waiting for someone to eat

669
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:23,978
I don't have to hurry like this.

670
00:47:24,556 --> 00:47:25,345
Do you blame me?

671
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:28,486
You will wait to eat pork leg.

672
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,368

- You - enough to stop talking.

685
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:00,884
- I don't stop. - Still, what to do?

686
