1
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:04,943
Holy shit. Where does this water come from?

2
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:06,219
It wasn’t here yesterday.

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,082
No. Don’t do it.

4
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:09,250
Let go!

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,259
Wake up, Win.

6
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,410
Wake up.

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,506
Non, please help me.

8
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:16,244
Lin, is it you?

9
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:18,499
The holy water I collected is gone.

10
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,250
I have two bottles with me.

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,059
The holy water is all spilled.

12
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,954
Relax.

13
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:25,994
I knew something bad was going to happen

14
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:27,626
so I got the spares just in case.

15
00:00:27,626 --> 00:00:32,419
May I ask everyone else to wait outside?

16
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,120
Win.

17
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,613
Korn.

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,659
You’re safe now, Lin.

19
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:04,343
Thank you so much for helping me.

20
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:07,219
Thank you for helping Win.

21
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,739
Lin.

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,739
Korn and I…

23
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,739
I already knew. Non told me everything.

24
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:28,059
Hey. When in the world were you able to tell her?

25
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:30,059
There was a period of time today.

26
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:33,299
You were in a coma and your heart suddenly stopped beating.

27
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:35,937
What time?

28
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:39,031
In the morning. Around 11 o’clock. I think.

29
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:42,450
I thought I lost you for good.

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,845
But you came back.

31
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:46,358
Once you woke up, I was so shocked

32
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:47,844
since you were still in Lin’s body.

33
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:49,924
How could you get up?

34
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:53,019
But it was Lin in you who woke up.

35
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,585
I was seriously confused.

36
00:01:55,585 --> 00:02:00,974
Yes. I was so shocked when I knew I woke up in your body.

37
00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:03,102
But Non said I didn’t have to be worried.

38
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:05,908
Win was in my body.

39
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:08,419
It was even more shocking, you know?

40
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:11,856
But after I heard that you two went to get holy water together

41
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:15,300
so that I could get back to my body, I could calm myself down.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,539
And I just waited for you to come back.

43
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,299
You are safe now, Lin.

44
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:24,299
Yes.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,105
But my body is aching all over.

46
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:34,299
I don’t know if it’s the effect of our body swap.

47
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,248
No, it’s not.

48
00:02:36,248 --> 00:02:39,988
The past 7 days, Win wasn’t gentle to your body at all.

49
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:41,198
He went through fire and high water.

50
00:02:41,198 --> 00:02:45,528
Don’t wonder if you find marks or bruises on your body.

51
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:48,565
Really, Win? Is it so?

52
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:50,819
What did you do to my body?

53
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:54,819
It will take forever to tell you everything.

54
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:57,428
Go home and get a rest.

55
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,136
You need to rest a lot. Understand?

56
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:01,502
I will take you to exercise.

57
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:02,722
You need hard exercises.

58
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:04,161
What, Win?

59
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:05,915
You have been spoiled for too long.

60
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:08,579
Your body is too weak.

61
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:09,641
You’ll get sick easily.

62
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,158
Enough.

63
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,281
Win.

64
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:15,291
Once you are back to your body, you give orders again.

65
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,398
You need to rest too.

66
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,579
If you want to go home tomorrow, you must try to sleep now.

67
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:25,551
Time to split up and rest

68
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:29,659
Lin, go home. I’ll give you a ride.

69
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:45,205
Hey? Are you leaving me to sleep here alone?

70
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,681
Who would let you sleep alone?

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,939
I’ll be here with you.

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,499
Hey.

81
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:05,435
How did it get here?

82
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:08,185
Did I wake you up? Sorry.

83
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,770
I put it t here.

84
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,542
Does it make you uncomfortable?

85
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:11,380
I’ll keep it away.

86
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,259
No. It’s okay.

87
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,219
Leave it with me.

88
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:18,257
I like to have it sleeping beside me tonight.

89
00:06:18,257 --> 00:06:20,139
I don’t know how Katin is doing.

90
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:22,139
She must be okay.

91
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:26,139
Or else, people at the farm would have called us.

92
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:37,379
Why do you keep looking at me?

93
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,690
Do I have something on my face?

94
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,339
Nothing. I just want to look at you.

95
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:55,339
Stop it already. Go back to your sofa.

96
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:58,608
Go.

97
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:18,579
What are you looking at?

98
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:22,579
You looked at me earlier. Now, I want to look at you for a change.

99
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:33,720
Hey, Korn.

100
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,229
This is the first night that we can go to sleep without worrying about anything.

101
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:39,739
We don’t need to think of what time to get up tomorrow,

102
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,395
or where to go.

103
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,859
Just one complaint, though.

104
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,859
It’s not as comfy as home.

105
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,859
Sure you can be carefree now.

106
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,339
But I need to get up early for work tomorrow.

107
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:57,077
That’s right.

108
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,339
Your 7-day leave is over.

109
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,219
Go to sleep. I will sleep too.

110
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:10,219
I feel a bit weary.

111
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:14,219
Um. Good night.

112
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,808
Good night.

113
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,619
Korn.

114
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:33,419
I’m thirsty.

115
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:44,179
Thanks a lot.

116
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:49,800
Korn.

117
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:51,680
Korn.

118
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,059
I want to pee.

119
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,579
Get down slowly.

120
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,579
Korn.

121
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,659
I’m cold. Turn down the AC for me.

122
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,102
Korn.

123
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:09,659
Korn!

124
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:20,779
I haven’t brushed my teeth yet.

125
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:24,779
Korn.

126
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:31,659
I’m hungry.

127
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:32,887
Are you just messing with me?

128
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:33,985
I’m not going to sleep now.

129
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,457
You are hungry. You want to pee. You want to drink.

130
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:37,457
How about we talk until dawn?

131
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,297
Who did you get this sarcastic behavior from?

132
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:41,792
From you. Who else?

133
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,783
Why are you still helping me after all that nagging?

134
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,379
I need to let it all out. Okay?

135
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,379
Damn it, Korn. What took you so long?

136
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,379
What’s with many bags?

137
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:06,272
Fried Mussel Pancake, pad thai, wonton noodles,

138
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,619
wonton soup, orange juice, yogurt, fruits, shumai, and steamed bun.

139
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,619
You bought too much.

140
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:14,411
You should know the limit of how much you can take.

141
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:16,091
‘Cause I know that you like to eat a little bit of this and that.

142
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:17,783
So I got you a variety of food.

143
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,851
Or I may hear you say you are not feeling satisfied.

144
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,838
I’ll help plate them.

145
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:24,619
Hey. Where are you taking that chair to?

146
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,619
What? Why didn’t you answer me?

147
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:33,099
Where are you going?

148
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:37,099
You could have just told me that you would like to eat out here.

149
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:39,219
I wanted to surprise you.

150
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,219
It’s too boring and stuffy to only stay in the room.

151
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:53,801
Where did you buy all this?

152
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:54,991
In front of the hospital.

153
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,899
There are a few stall vendors open.

154
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,899
They look good. I’m gonna dig in.

155
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:15,826
Woah. Yummy.

156
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,761
Aren’t you joining me? Come on.

157
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:22,059
No. I don’t want to steal your food.

158
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:24,059
Give me a break.

159
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:46,499
Who said he couldn’t finish them all and blamed me for buying too much.

160
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:04,059
Gosh.

161
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,496
Win, what’s wrong?

162
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:07,957
I…

163
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:09,957
You…what?

164
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,826
I’m not full yet.

165
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:17,102
Gotcha…

166
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,909
Not funny?

167
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,894
It’s not funny.

168
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:30,499
I missed how I can eat like this so damn much.

169
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,355
Look.

170
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:34,894
I got my own stomach back. I got my own body back.

171
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,413
I didn’t have to stop with just a few bites.

172
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:38,957
Thank you so much, Korn,

173
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:42,659
for making me be able to eat like before again.

174
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,822
You don’t need to thank me.

175
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:53,979
I get to have my old life with you back as well.

176
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:09,457
Still up, dear?

177
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:12,259
Is everything alright?

178
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,488
It is. I just missed you a lot.

179
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:17,765
I want to hug you.

180
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:22,299
After the ordeal ended, you are back to being my clingy girl again.

181
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:24,988
You know something?

182
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:26,979
You behaved badly last week.

183
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:31,539
I might be too stressed, Mom.

184
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:34,352
Can you forgive me?

185
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:35,469
Absolutely.

186
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:37,499
Where were you earlier?

187
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:39,499
I talked to you dad.

188
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:44,859
Anyway, how did the trip with Korn go?

189
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:49,059
When you asked me to go with him, I was concerned, you know?

190
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,155
I was concerned that it would be too hard for you.

191
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,653
I could handle it just fine.

192
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:55,721
Look at me, Mom.

193
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,948
I came back home all in one piece.

194
00:13:58,948 --> 00:13:59,700
Really?

195
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,488
You don’t have to worry.

196
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:04,894
Korn took care of me really well.

197
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:10,502
Speaking of whom, I have something to talk to you about him.

198
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:13,118
About Korn?

199
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:16,968
We used to talk before, remember?

200
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:19,807
About you and him having feelings for each other.

201
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:26,099
You don’t need to worry. I’ll talk to Win for you.

202
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,506
Let me see how it is going.

203
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:19,579
Win, I have to leave first.

204
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:23,579
I’ll visit you when I have time.

205
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:28,145
I have already been away from work for 7 days.

206
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:30,705
There must be a lot of work waiting for me.

207
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,699
Katin,

208
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,699
look after your dad.

209
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,109
Wait, Korn.

210
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,201
Did I wake you?

211
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:31,579
No.

212
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:40,579
Take it.

213
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:44,579
She’s your baby.

214
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,819
She’s your baby too.

215
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:52,819
I get to be with her when I go home.

216
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,179
But you don’t.

217
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:05,019
Whenever you miss her,

218
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:11,019
come and visit her anytime.

219
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:20,099
Just take it. I’m going back to sleep.

220
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:22,099
Come on.

221
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,450
Okay. See you later.

222
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:09,105
See you later.

223
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,760
The assessment result looks good.

224
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,469
If you feel dizzy and nauseous,

225
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:28,979
or have numbness in the arms and legs, you must let me know right away.

226
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:33,979
Win!

227
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,057
Win.

228
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:38,897
What?

229
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:41,419
Did you hear me?

230
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,419
Yes.

231
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,514
What the hell is wrong?

232
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:48,291
Did you also hear that?

233
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,259
Yes, I heard you.

234
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,979
How are you, Win?

235
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:57,979
He’s perfectly fine now.

236
00:19:58,235 --> 00:19:59,979
He can go home today.

237
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:03,339
You are out of the woods, dear.

238
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,835
Non, can you take Lin out for a second?

239
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:12,299
I have something to talk to Win.

240
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:30,785
Lin, what does your mother want to talk to Win?

241
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:32,339
Do you know about it?

242
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,339
Is everything alright?

243
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,142
Non.

244
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,659
What do you think about the relationship between Win and Korn?

245
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:50,795
They are friends…

246
00:20:50,795 --> 00:20:53,659
very close friends. Like super close.

247
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:55,142
Why?

248
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:57,142
Just friends?

249
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,222
Why do you ask me that?

250
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,127
Let’s be frank.

251
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,010
I think Win and Korn have feelings for each other.

252
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,814
Don’t you think like me?

253
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:14,296
I think the two of them have something special going on.

254
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:15,844
It seems more than just friends, to a certain extent.

255
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:19,831
But they never say or show anything.

256
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:22,939
I don’t want to cross the line.

257
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:25,619
You understand me, right?

258
00:21:26,142 --> 00:21:27,659
Yes.

259
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:30,899
Why do you want to know?

260
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,579
Don’t tell me that you like Korn?

261
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:40,792
I don’t know how to put it into words.

262
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,739
If you asked me…

263
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:45,884
Yes, I do. I like him a lot.

264
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:50,362
Are you okay?

265
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:51,216
Is it hot?

266
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:52,579
I’m okay.

267
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:55,419
Does it hurt anywhere else?

268
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,419
No. Just a slight headache.

269
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:03,419
Non said I slept for too long.

270
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:07,251
You slept for 9 whole days, you know?

271
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,709
I was so scared.

272
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,558
I was scared that you wouldn’t wake up again.

273
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:17,402
Venerable Uncle Arun told Lin to get the holy water from 4 temples with Korn

274
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,619
within 7 days and you would wake up.

275
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:25,462
And we know well that Lin is not capable of doing things on her own.

276
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:28,619
She collapses after being out in the sun for only a few minutes.

277
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:32,152
But Korn went with her.

278
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:34,152
I felt less worried.

279
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,653
What I want to say is that…

280
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,099
I don’t know how you still feel with Korn.

281
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:46,583
Korn is so good to Lin.

282
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,099
He also saved your life.

283
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:59,299
I think I know how Lin thinks of Korn.

284
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:05,299
I can tell that Lin has a crush on Korn.

285
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,299
You may still be mad at Korn.

286
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:15,259
I want you to think of the good things he has done for us.

287
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,099
Another important thing that I want to say is…

288
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:39,180
I want Lin and Korn to get married.

289
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:45,179
They may get engaged first.

290
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,179
Will you be okay with that?

291
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:55,979
If you are, Lin would feel comfortable going out with Korn

292
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,447
without having to hide or secretly talk.

293
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:02,539
You blew up and got into an accident when finding out that time.

294
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:07,859
Do you know what my mom said to me last night?

295
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:13,939
She said she wanted me to get engaged with Korn.

296
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:16,447
Really?

297
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:21,019
What should I do?

298
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:41,059
Just do it, then.

299
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:04,139
Korn, I’m hungry. Do you have anything for me to eat?

300
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,480
There are cucumbers,

301
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,002
eggs,

302
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:16,530
picked garlic, spring onions and coriander.

303
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,305
Nah.

304
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:20,699
How about a plain omelet?

305
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:25,044
I don’t like any of those.

306
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:27,044
How about…

307
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,048
It tastes amazing, Korn.

308
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:58,201
How did you come up with Tonkin Jasmine in scones?

309
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,742
I have this plant in my home in the countryside.

310
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:07,579
I created this recipe because I miss someone there.

311
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:16,060
Interesting.

312
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,828
There’s a background story.

313
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,379
It feels like home.

314
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,600
You feel like you are home when eating it.

315
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:46,702
(I want Lin and Korn to get married.)

316
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:49,579
(They may get engaged first.)

317
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:51,579
(Will you be okay with that?)

4 WEEKS LATER

325
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,988
Why is the grass all over the place?

326
00:27:56,988 --> 00:27:58,988
Sweep it now.

327
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:03,238
Why does no one clean the cow dung?

328
00:28:03,238 --> 00:28:04,811
Have you checked the corral at all?

329
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:07,785
There is cow dung all over the corral.

330
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,450
It must be fresh cow dung. I’ll clean it now.

331
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:14,579
Then hurry up.

332
00:28:15,438 --> 00:28:16,201
Jorn!

333
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:17,442
Yes?

334
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:18,755
Why is there no water?

335
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:20,659
Got it, sir.

336
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,208
Have you washed the cows?

337
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:25,419
I have.

338
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:32,217
This is the real Mr. Win.

339
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:36,157
He’s even more strict than before.

340
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:40,419
Good. Serves you right.

341
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:43,308
Jorn. Sang. What are you talking about?

342
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:44,783
Nothing.

343
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:46,706
Keep sweeping.

344
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:52,638
Mr. Win.

345
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,400
Since you came back to oversee the farm,

346
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:58,001
everyone is more diligent at work.

347
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:02,767
Isn’t it supposed to be like this at all times?

348
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:06,859
Everyone should know their own duties.

349
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:16,859
Well, I better go back to the kitchen and help my mother.

350
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:22,859
He’s so fierce. That makes him even hotter!

351
00:29:26,622 --> 00:29:28,299
Yes, Mr. Win.

352
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:37,099
Win.

353
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:34,028
What brings you here early in the morning?

354
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:35,789
Don’t you go to work?

355
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:37,977
My work shift is in the afternoon today.

356
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:40,459
Your mother called me

357
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:43,663
She said she had something to talk to me about.

358
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:45,730
It seems to be an important matter.

359
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:55,019
I don’t know what it’s about exactly.

360
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,530
You’ll find out when you talk to her.

361
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,285
Okay.

362
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,059
Are you coming with me?

363
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,019
What’s the matter?

364
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:30,019
Nothing.

365
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,019
I didn’t think I could get a ride from you again.

366
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:40,019
Let’s go see your mother.

367
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:42,019
Um.

368
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:52,551
Whenever you feel like sitting in my car,

369
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:54,551
you can tell me anytime.

370
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,054
Mom, why are you calling me here?

371
00:32:15,054 --> 00:32:17,139
Let’s talk when everyone is here.

372
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,139
Okay.

373
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:21,705
Good morning, Aunt Pornuma.

374
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:27,139
Good morning. How are you? Do you want some drinks?

375
00:32:27,275 --> 00:32:29,139
I’m good. Thanks.

376
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:31,939
How is your work? Busy?

377
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:37,739
After a 7-day absence, there are quite a lot of things for me to clear up.

378
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,751
I’ll make this short, then.

379
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:47,149
I would like to thank you for your help.

380
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:49,819
You accompanied Lin and brought her home safely.

381
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:57,066
Actually, you don’t need to thank me.

382
00:32:57,066 --> 00:33:00,099
Lin and I have known since childhood.

383
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:02,595
It was not a big deal at all.

384
00:33:02,595 --> 00:33:05,899
It was not a big deal because it was Lin.

385
00:33:11,562 --> 00:33:15,419
If you don’t have good feelings, it will be a big deal.

386
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:18,659
What I meant is that

387
00:33:18,853 --> 00:33:23,179
I know how you two feel toward each other.

388
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,251
I’ll get to the point now.

389
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:35,434
To be frank, I allowed Lin to go on the trip to get the holy water with just you alone	because I trust you.

390
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:37,786
But after considering,

391
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:41,832
you spent 7 nights together.

392
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:46,709
It may be common these days for young people.

393
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:53,259
But I’m a bit conservative like those elders from the old days.

394
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:57,219
I can’t help feeling worried.

395
00:33:57,762 --> 00:34:01,339
I don’t need to go into details about my concern.

396
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:08,419
I think you understand what I’m trying to say here.

397
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,139
I understand.

398
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:29,899
Can you confirm to me you didn’t take advantage of her during those 7 days?

399
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:40,139
Can you confirm that?

400
00:34:44,678 --> 00:34:47,179
I can’t confirm that.

401
00:34:52,515 --> 00:34:55,980
Did you do that because of the spur of the moment

402
00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:59,540
or because of your true feelings?

403
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:06,977
It was from my true feelings.

404
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:12,788
Then, you have good feelings for my child.

405
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:18,379
Like I said, I’m quite conservative about this kind of thing.

406
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:21,459
What should we do now?

407
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:40,109
I’m willing to take responsibility for everything.

408
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:47,219
Then do this.

409
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:56,419
I want you and Lin

410
00:35:56,933 --> 00:36:00,259
to be engaged.

411
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:15,979
Win.

412
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:20,699
Win, stop.

413
00:36:24,922 --> 00:36:26,979
You knew about this, right?

414
00:36:27,508 --> 00:36:28,979
Please don’t lie.

415
00:36:32,299 --> 00:36:34,299
Yes, I did.

416
00:36:37,122 --> 00:36:39,404
If you did,

417
00:36:40,268 --> 00:36:42,019
are you really okay about it?

418
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:58,019
Why do I have to be not okay?

419
00:37:00,189 --> 00:37:03,687
Don’t you…

420
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:06,019
Don’t you have feelings for me?

421
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,404
I do.

422
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:24,379
I feel good.

423
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:30,377
I feel good to have you as my friend.

424
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:42,379
And you are about to get engaged with my sister.

425
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:46,499
I don’t have to worry about her anymore.

426
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:54,145
Win.

427
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:56,499
If you are not too stupid,

428
00:37:57,038 --> 00:38:02,420
you should know how I feel about you,

429
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,499
and how we feel about each other.

430
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:16,499
I don’t feel anything for you.

431
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,325
Then…

432
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:26,499
What do you call what happened?

433
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,499
Tell me how you feel about me, Win.

434
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:35,059
What do you feel about me?

435
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:41,059
I’m your friend.

436
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:43,059
I’m your close friend.

437
00:38:44,762 --> 00:38:47,059
What else can I be?

438
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,595
14 DAYS LATER

439
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:45,130
Mr. Win.

440
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,659
The signboard is here. Where do you want me to keep it

441
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,000
Keep it at the back for now.

442
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,459
Got it, sir.

443
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:13,459
Here you are.

444
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:17,059
Why did you come out here? It’s really sunny.

445
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:24,179
I came to tell you to stop working and come home to rest.

446
00:42:24,564 --> 00:42:27,002
My engagement is tomorrow.

447
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,619
My brother must look good.

448
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:34,139
Okay. You head home first. I’ll be there shortly.

449
00:43:28,494 --> 00:43:31,219
How did you find me?

450
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,619
It’s not that hard. This is our place.

451
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:46,868
I know how you feel about me.

452
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:51,259
And I’m sure you know how I feel about you.

453
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,392
Win, Mom is looking for you.

454
00:44:25,392 --> 00:44:28,797
Win is not in his room? Where is he?

455
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:30,712
I don’t know.

456
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:35,334
But the pickup truck is gone. I’m not sure if Mr. Win took it.

457
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:37,299
Win took the car and drove away?

458
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,219
Korn.

459
00:45:51,386 --> 00:45:54,219
Korn.

460
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:06,585
Yes?

461
00:46:06,585 --> 00:46:08,585
I want coffee.

462
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:11,554
At this hour?

463
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:13,580
It will keep you awake.

464
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,819
Then be it.

465
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:21,859
I want to stay up and talk to you.

466
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:27,859
Alright. Give me a minute.

467
00:46:58,897 --> 00:47:01,438
Why 2 cups of coffee?

468
00:47:01,438 --> 00:47:03,339
So I can stay awake and keep you company.

469
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:17,820
It smells good.

470
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:19,820
What smells good?

471
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,819
This coffee.
