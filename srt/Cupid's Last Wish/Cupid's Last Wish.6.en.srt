1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Anyway, how is this farm running since Win is not around?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,260
I’ll be taking care of this place instead of Win for the time being.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,020
Just follow through with this, Katin.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,740
Are you two a thing?

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,620
Katin’s saliva is sticky.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,460
Her stomach is bloating.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,220
Is it serious?

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,200
It is if she falls down. She may die.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,860
She could die?

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,260
You will be okay

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,100
Please be okay, Katin.

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,540
You will be okay.

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,540
Calm down.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,380
Katin will be okay.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,760
Please be okay.

Katin.

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,120
Please be okay.

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,540
You poor thing.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,380
Does it hurt a lot?

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,440
Has anyone called an animal husbandman?

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
Not yet.

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,160
But Ms. Lin has heard about this.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,880
Dr. Non just called her.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,700
Why did you tell Ms. Lin?

33
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,700
Does she know what to do?

34
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,540
She is with Korn.

35
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,180
I think he’ll know what to do.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,820
Really?

37
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,440
Ms. Lin!

38
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
This way!

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,320
This way please!

40
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
You’re safe now, Katin.

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,320
This way, Ms. Lin.

42
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,480
Jorn.

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,900
Yes.

44
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,480
Why are you standing here confused? Get a blade to shave her.

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,740
Oh, okay.

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,080
Do you have one?

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,020
Ugh!

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,020
Give me the key to the storage.

49
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,140
Okay.

50
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,900
Quickly.

51
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,640
Give me the whole ring.

52
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,500
Here you go.

53
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,900
Katin.

54
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,320
Hang in there, Katin.

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,780
Move!

56
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,600
Where is she hurrying off to?

57
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,120
Shave her hair.

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,540
Okay.

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,820
Help me.

60
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.
Help me.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,980
Okay.

62
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,060
Done.

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Okay.

64
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,140
Easy.

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,120
Are you done?

66
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,260
Yes.

67
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,000
You guys hold her head.

68
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,100
Go, four-eyes.

69
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,380
Give me the needle.

70
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,860
Let me help.

71
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,500
Ready?

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,220
One, two, three.

73
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,740
Is it in?

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,620
I’ll take it out.

75
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,880
She is breathing normally.

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,880
You’re safe now.

77
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,340
Lin!

78
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,300
Win, are you alright?

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,660
Katin is okay now.

80
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,800
Thank you.

81
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,480
Thank you so much, Korn.

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,160
It’s okay.

83
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,840
Don’t you think this is weird?

84
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,480
What is?

85
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,140
Lin’s knowing about these things.

86
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,980
She probably has seen Win do it.

87
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,200
You’ve been with me since you were born but you didn’t even inherit half of my intelligence.

88
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,280
She doesn’t look like someone who has done it for the first time.

89
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,000
Here it is, Jorn.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,300
You’ve given her the medicine, right?

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,780
Yes.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,360
Wipe and moisturize her wound.

93
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,360
Yes, Ms. Lin.

94
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,880
And keep checking it.

95
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,620
I will.

96
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,380
How did her stomach get bloated?

97
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,880
She’s probably eaten the grass in the field.

98
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,440
How did she get out there?

99
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,640
Who took her?

100
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,420
I did.

101
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,240
What?

102
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,800
Why did you let her eat so much?

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,080
Are you insane? How many years have you been raising cows? How could you not know about this?

104
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,740
Were you slacking off? Did you not check on her?

105
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,940
I wasn’t slacking off.

106
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,280
Someone gave me an order to take her out there.

107
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,940
Who?

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,140
Wait.

109
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,060
I’m coming with you.

110
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,520
Win.

111
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,760
Win.

112
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,980
It’s smelly and hot.

113
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,560
What am I doing here?

114
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,160
Quickly turn on the AC and get me water.

115
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
I told you to raise an umbrella over me. Why didn’t you?

116
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,700
You never showed up before. Why are you meddling with us now?

117
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,060
Lin, where have you been all day?

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,160
If I’d come back later than I did, Katin would have died.

119
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,800
And if she died, would you guys be able to take responsibility?

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,800
Huh?

121
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,440
Hey.

122
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,820
Let go.

123
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,440
I meant well.

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,020
I just wanted to help while Win is sick.

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,960
Help? Who even needs your help?

126
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,020
We know what we should do and not do here.

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,580
Don’t mess up our process.

128
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,460
I would say you’re stupid, but you’re far beyond that.

129
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,460
You’re stupid and arrogant.

130
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,760
You never really know anything.

131
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,520
If you want to help, please do nothing and enjoy taking our family’s money.

132
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,640
Leave us alone.
Lin.

133
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,860
You as well.

134
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,080
You come in and try to manage things.

135
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,280
Are you going to say you’re helping?

136
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,500
Save it. I’m sick of your words.

137
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,920
Go back to where you came from.

138
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,240
Get out!

139
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,560
That’s enough.

140
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,460
Get out!

141
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,700
Lin, that’s enough.

142
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
Lin, enough.

143
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,820
Get out!

144
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,340
Let go of me, Korn!

145
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,460
Get out!

146
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,220
Korn!

147
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,680
Let go!

148
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,400
I said let go of me!

149
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,300
Let go of me!

150
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,300
You were right. Lin is acting weird.

151
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,140
You know who she’s acting like?

152
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,660
Who?

153
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Win.

154
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,320
Let go of me, Korn!

155
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,700
I said let go of me!

156
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,220
Let go!

157
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,780
You had to carry him out of there?

158
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,580
Non, you have to stand by here and stop those two.

159
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,260
Don’t let them interfere with my farm again.

160
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
I have my job at the hospital.

161
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,040
It’s only 3 days. Can’t you help me?

162
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,440
Look, my job is not like the others.

163
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,000
I can’t just take days off on a whim.

164
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,580
I have to request for leave in advance.

165
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,920
Are you really my friend?

166
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,740
Of course. I’m your best and beloved friend.

167
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,240
Fine, I’ll keep watch over this place every day.

168
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,060
Win, you shouldn’t have insulted them like that.

169
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,060
After all, they’re your relatives.

170
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,800
I don’t want anything to do with them.

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
They should consider themselves lucky that I didn’t slap something on their faces.

172
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
Now I’m getting angry again.

173
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
Hey!

174
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,040
Win, stop!

175
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,000
Let go of me!''

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Get yourself together!

177
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,420
You shouldn’t be doing this to them.

178
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,380
Let go of me!

179
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,440
They’re interfering with my farm!

180
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,000
Let go!

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,160
They have every right.

182
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,180
What freaking right?

183
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,640
This is not your farm alone.

184
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,520
Am I right?

185
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,680
Think carefully before you get angry and yell at people.

186
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,880
You’re right. I don’t think enough.

187
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,480
I’m hotheaded.

188
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,000
And I forgot that this is not my farm alone.

189
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,520
It’s yours too.

190
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,440
Win…

191
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,360
Save it.

192
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,380
Save it.

193
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,560
Are you going to say

194
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,960
you didn’t mean what you said?

195
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,180
I know this is not my farm alone.

196
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,480
It’s yours too.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,380
I still can’t stop wondering why my father gave you the shares.

198
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,060
Tell me, Korn.

199
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,960
Why?

200
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,240
Why?

201
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,360
Tell me.

202
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,880
Win.

203
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,920
Calm down.

204
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,560
Shut up, four-eyes.

205
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,120
This is none of your business.

206
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,700
You know what, ever since that day, I’ve been looking for a reason

207
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,580
why you took my family’s fortune.

208
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,000
But the more I look,

209
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,840
the more I can’t think of anything,

210
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,840
except that you’re greedy.

211
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,660
And the bad things that’s happened,

212
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,100
the car accident, my switching bodies with my sister,

213
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,420
my quest to get the holy water,

214
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,420
which I don’t know if it will help anything,

215
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,200
I don’t even know what’s going to happen to my sister,

216
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,380
it’s all because of you.

217
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,120
Because of you.

218
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,140
It’s all on you.

219
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,220
Win.

220
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,160
One day you will understand me.

221
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,160
It’s going to be okay.

222
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,300
Leave him be for now.

223
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,460
Don’t think too much.

224
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,460
You’re here.

225
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,420
Do you know what your daughter said to me?

226
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,760
Yes, someone has already told me.

227
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,400
I must apologize for Lin.

228
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,300
She doesn’t seem like herself after the accident.

229
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,240
That doesn’t bother me.

230
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,840
By the way, why did you lie to me?

231
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,520
About what?

232
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,140
We just talked about it this morning. Have you forgotten?

233
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,880
You said you didn’t know where Lin went.

234
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,120
You knew she was with Korn, right?

235
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,740
Don’t tell me you didn’t know.

236
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,800
You would never let your dear daughter go anywhere alone with a guy.

237
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,040
They were together, weren’t they?

238
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,600
I knew about it.

239
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,620
This might sound crazy,

240
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,660
but a mother should do crazy things if it means there’s a chance.

241
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,520
Lin went with Korn to get holy water.

242
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,820
It will wake Win up.

243
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,020
Who told you that?

244
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Your brother the Venerable Uncle.

245
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,460
My brother told you that?

246
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,360
He said if they could get holy water from four monks at four temples within 7 days,

247
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,840
he’ll perform a ritual and Win will come back.

248
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,080
I’ll talk to Lin about today.

249
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,300
Do you believe that?

250
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,860
But our brother told her.

251
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,340
It’s too unbelievable.

252
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,600
(Why, Korn?)

253
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,900
(Why did my father give you the farm’s stocks?)

254
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,340
(Answer me, Korn!)

255
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,340
(You came to my house day in day out)

256
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,920
(because you wanted to suck up to my dad.)

257
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,800
(You are no different than those 2 parasites.)

258
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,920
(And the bad things that’s happened,)

259
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,440
(it’s all because of you.)

260
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,180
(Because of you.)

261
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,940
(It’s all on you.)

262
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,280
How is Katin doing?

263
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,220
I was just dressing her wound.

264
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,260
Anyway, you were good, Ms. Lin.

265
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,560
You looked just like Mr. Win.

266
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,160
I wonder if you guys have switched bodies.

267
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,200
You’re talking nonsense, Jorn.

268
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,300
I’m his sister. Of course I remember what he usually does.

269
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,080
Go take a break.

270
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,200
Alright.

271
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,200
How are you?

272
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,200
You’re still here.

273
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,760
I’m about to leave.

274
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,960
I just wanted to check on my moody friend.

275
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,960
Relax.

276
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,040
I don’t want the two of you to fight.

277
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,560
You know why I’m mad at him.

278
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,520
You know he didn’t mean it

279
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,740
but you were angry so you didn’t listen to him.

280
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,440
You two have known each other since you were 7 or 8.

281
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,740
Do you really see him as such an asshole?

282
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,460
Think about it.

283
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,020
If it still doesn’t make you feel better,

284
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,200
try to think of the good things he’s done for you.

285
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,940
I may not be as close with you as you two are close with each other,

286
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,260
but in my eyes, you love each other.

287
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,880
I think my feelings are one-sided.

288
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,680
Oh, come on.

289
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,800
He went alone with you

290
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:51,320
even though he knew you’d verbally and physically attack him

291
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,340
and he never complained.

292
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,740
What does that show about his feelings about you?

293
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,420
I think

294
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,000
before continuing your journey,

295
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,200
you guys need to talk it out.

296
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,560
I’m sorry for being insensitive.

297
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,860
I’m stupid.

298
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,000
I’m slow

299
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,260
and I know why you’re mad at me

300
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,120
but I can’t talk about it yet.

301
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,840
When we have time and when the time comes,

302
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,280
I will tell you everything.

303
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,960
And as soon as you get back into your old body,

304
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,680
I will return everything to you.

305
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,480
I can trust you, right?

306
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,280
Hello.

307
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,420
Hi, Mom.

308
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,220
Where have you been?

309
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,900
The hospital.

310
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,200
How’s Win?

311
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,500
Still the same.

312
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,640
By the way, your aunt and uncle just told me about you.

313
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,200
It’s infuriating.

314
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,660
Don’t listen to them.

315
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,600
If you want to know the truth,

316
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,240
I’ll tell you everything from the beginning.

317
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,220
There’s no need. I’ve heard enough.

318
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,080
I understand it’s infuriating.

319
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,800
but you’re young.

320
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,220
You have to listen to older people sometimes.

321
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,420
Why do I have to?

322
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,480
Does that logic still apply today?

323
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,700
Because there are still older people in this world.

324
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,660
When we’re gone and there’s only your generation left,

325
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,220
you can do whatever you want.

326
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,860
Let’s not talk about this anymore.

327
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,420
The more I talk about it, the more angry I become.

328
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,940
Are you going to sleep here tonight or continue your journey right away?

329
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,720
We’re going now.

330
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,060
There’s only two days left.

331
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,060
I don’t want to waste time.

332
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,020
Let’s go.

333
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,800
Okay.

334
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,560
Can you wait at the car, Korn?

335
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,400
I need to talk to Lin.

336
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,280
Sure.

337
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,940
What is it?

338
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,180
I can tell how you feel about Korn.

339
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
How do I feel?

340
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,960
You think I like him?

341
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,920
Me? Like him?

342
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,800
I’m your mother, Lin.

343
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,560
I know how you feel about him.

344
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,100
I’ve noticed it for some time.

345
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,540
Since when?

346
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,380
Since your father’s funeral.

347
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,760
You’re not a kid anymore.

348
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,780
I understand.

349
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,840
Besides, you’re now traveling

350
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,840
and spending the nights with him in other cities,

351
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,160
you could get carried away and fall for him.

352
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,000
It's normal.

353
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,440
What are you telling me?

354
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,960
I think Korn likes you too.

355
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,920
He is actually a nice guy.

356
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,140
If you like each other, I have nothing against it.

357
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Win is the only person who doesn’t know yet,

358
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,040
but if he wakes up,

359
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,440
I’ll talk to him about you guys and make him understand.

360
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,720
Don’t worry.

361
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,720
I’ve been meaning to ask but forgot.

362
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,460
How many places have you collected holy water from so far?

363
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,800
Two.

364
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,860
I’ll let you keep it.

365
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,340
Are you sure you’re okay to drive, Korn?

366
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,680
Yes.

367
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,060
I’m not sleepy yet, and Prachuap is close by.

368
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,600
Drive safe and please take care of Lin.

369
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,000
I will.

370
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,840
We’re going then.

371
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,440
Have a safe trip.

372
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,300
Bye.

373
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,620
Do you think that’s the holy water?

374
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,680
Probably.

375
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,880
Shall we go take it now?

376
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,240
Not yet.

377
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,940
What are you waiting for?

378
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
I thought you said you didn’t want Win to wake up

379
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,380
and you’re going to have him declared incompetent

380
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,380
so his shares would be ours?

381
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,660
You think she’ll give it to you if you walk in and ask?

382
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,860
Dumbass.

383
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,920
Be patient. There has to be a way.

384
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,660
We’ll arrive in a little more than 4 hours.

385
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,980
You can take a nap if you want.

386
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,940
Win,

387
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,260
are you asleep?

388
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,460
No.

389
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,140
What’s wrong?

390
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,940
Did your mother say something that bothered you?

391
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,720
No.

392
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,780
Something is wrong.

393
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,080
Nothing is wrong.

394
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,480
What’s wrong?

395
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,520
Stop bugging me.

396
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,300
Just focus on driving.

397
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,720
You’re not telling the truth.

398
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,720
You want to know the truth so much?

399
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,720
Fine.

400
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,100
Here’s the truth.

401
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,680
I didn’t come with you because I stopped being mad at you.

402
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,920
I came because I want to end this.

403
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,180
Stop trying to talk to me.

404
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,420
It’s annoying.

405
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,800
I’m sorry.

406
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,560
It’s none of my business.

407
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,600
If you’re tired, you can sleep.

408
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,920
Don’t worry about me.

409
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,700
Win.

410
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,700
Win.

411
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,480
Win.

412
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,440
Win.	Help me.

413
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,340
Lin!

414
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,200
Lin!

415
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,500
Lin!

416
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,200
Lin!

417
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,860
Where are you, Lin?

418
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,020
Lin!

419
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,760
Where are you, Win?

420
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,420
Please help me.

421
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,720
Lin.

422
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,180
Lin.

423
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,240
Lin.

424
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,840
Win.

425
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,420
Lin.

426
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,820
Please help me, Win.

427
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,120
I’m sorry.

428
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,160
I’m sorry, Lin.

429
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,840
I’m sorry.

430
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,260
You’re okay, right?

431
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,660
Win.

432
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,440
I’m sorry.

433
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,600
I’m sorry, Lin.

434
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,580
I’m sorry.

435
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,820
Lin!

436
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,960
Lin!

437
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,500
Lin!

438
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,500
Lin, I’m sorry!

439
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,200
I’m sorry! Come back!

440
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,140
Lin!

441
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,140
I’m sorry!

442
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,640
Lin!

443
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,440
Lin!

444
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,580
Win.

445
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,420
Lin!

446
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,300
Win.

447
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:07,720
Win.

448
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,580
What’s wrong?

449
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,320
Win, what’s wrong?

450
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,760
Win, what’s wrong?

451
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,520
Calm down.

452
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,700
What’s wrong?

453
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,320
I dreamed about Lin.

454
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,020
She was very scared

455
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,920
and suddenly disappeared.

456
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,680
I couldn’t help her.

457
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,380
It’s my fault.

458
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,140
It’s my fault.

459
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,400
Win.

460
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,800
Stop it.

461
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,680
It’s not your fault.

462
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,020
No one wanted this to happen.

463
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,820
We’re fixing it.

464
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,120
We’ll bring Lin back. Trust me.

465
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,360
What if we fail?

466
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,600
We won’t.

467
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,980
I won’t let anything happen to Lin.

468
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,780
I don’t love and care about Lin any less than you do.

469
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,040
It’s going to be okay.

470
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,560
(Mom was right. He loves Lin.)

471
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,640
(Hang in there, Win.)

472
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,660
(This will end soon.)

473
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,360
Are you alright?

474
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,540
I’m fine.

475
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,280
I probably worried too much.

476
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,700
I’m okay now.

477
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,840
Let’s go.

478
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,740
Are you sure?

479
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,980
POINT 3

480
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,560
POINT 4

481
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,880
We’ll arrive in 5 minutes

482
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,300
but we need to take a boat.

483
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,480
To an island, I think.

484
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,240
Is there no other way?

485
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,620
I think we can also go that way

486
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,300
but it's a 30-minute walk.

487
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,300
Are you up for it?

488
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,520
It’s dark now.

489
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,280
We can’t see anything.

490
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,000
What will I do if I lose you?

491
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,800
Let’s find somewhere to rest.

492
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,020
I’m fine.

493
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,140
But Lin’s body is not.

494
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,180
I said I’m fine.

495
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,800
Win.

496
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,700
I beg you.

497
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,660
Trust me for once.

498
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,320
I’m really worried about you.

499
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,660
It was an exhausting day for you and Lin.

500
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
You should rest.

501
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,840
Please.

502
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,860
Just this once, trust me.

503
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,500
Please, Win. I’m really worried about you.

504
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,160
(You’re not worried about me. You’re worried about my sister.)

505
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
Let go.

506
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,740
Do you have an available room?

507
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,760
Yes, it’s 500 baht for a quick stay and 900 baht for the night.

508
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,160
We’d like to book one room.

509
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,820
Two.

510
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,280
Why?

511
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,380
I want to sleep alone tonight.

512
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,700
Aren’t you scared of ghosts?

513
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,860
I don’t care.

514
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,560
Since you have the golden opportunity to be alone in your room tonight,

515
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,900
I can get you some hot girls.

516
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,460
Interested?

517
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,340
No, thanks.

518
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,880
Would you like to see their photos?

519
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,060
I’m a dealer.

520
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,480
I can give you a discount.

521
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,240
What do you say?

522
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,900
You’re Lin.

523
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,660
You’re not Win.

524
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,260
You’re Lin.

525
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,300
You’re not Win.

526
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,520
You’re Lin.

527
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,860
You’re not Win.

528
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,180
You’re Lin.

529
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,000
You’re not Win.

530
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,000
You’re Lin.

531
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,380
You’re not Win.

532
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,880
You’re Lin.

533
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,200
You’re not Win.

534
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,640
You’re Lin.

535
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,720
You’re not Win.

536
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,740
You’re Lin.

537
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,500
You’re not Win!

538
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,000
You idiot!

539
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,180
You idiot!

540
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,220
You idiot!

541
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,220
You idiot!

542
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,880
You idiot!

543
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,140
You idiot!

544
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,760
You idiot!

545
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,500
You idiot!

546
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,440
3 DAYS LEFT → 2 DAYS LEFT

547
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,000
Hey.

548
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,900
Did you get any sleep last night?

549
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,880
Not much,

550
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,400
but it’s not important.

551
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,400
Let’s go. We have many places to visit.

552
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,020
Are you coming? The boat will leave in 5 minutes.

553
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,680
Win,

554
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,780
aren’t you coming?

555
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,020
Where are you going?

556
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,880
The way I told you about last night.

557
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,400
I’m walking.

558
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,400
But the boat will be faster.

559
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,460
It will take only 5 minutes.

560
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,960
If you want to go by boat, go.

561
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,140
What’s wrong, Win?

562
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,920
Tell me.

563
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,340
If you want to, just go.

564
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,460
We’ll only be apart for a while. Nothing should happen.

565
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,960
But if something were to happen, you could just leave me to die.

566
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,960
I want to keep a distance from you.

567
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,440
Why?

568
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,940
What are you mad at me about now?

569
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,740
You can yell at me like you used to.

570
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,280
Say it.

571
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,740
Say it.

572
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,900
Let go.

573
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,140
I don’t want to have feelings for you anymore.

574
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,300
Leave me alone.

575
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,820
Why?

576
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,440
I don’t want to be soft again.

577
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,220
Let me go.

578
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,820
I want to think about my feelings.

579
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,520
We can meet each other there.

580
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:14,900
Go.

581
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,340
What’s wrong?

582
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,160
What’s wrong, Korn?

583
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,740
I don’t know.

584
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,900
I think she’s keeping the holy water in this house.

585
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,180
Let’s split up to find it.

586
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:17,820
6 YEARS AGO

587
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,620
What are you making?
6 YEARS AGO

588
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,280
6 YEARS AGO

589
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,960
Homemade cream cheese.
6 YEARS AGO

590
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,540
First, I’m going to add milk
6 YEARS AGO

591
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,980
then boil it.

592
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,240
What next?

593
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,160
When it starts to stick, filter it.

594
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,440
Homemade cream cheese is ready.

595
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,580
Oh, Korn.

596
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,000
I think it'll be faster to buy it than to wait for you to finish making it.

597
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,840
Homemade tastes better.

598
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,260
And could be much better with milk from your farm.

599
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,680
By the way,

600
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,800
I’ve been meaning to ask.

601
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,800
Why do you want to be a chef?

602
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,160
Because of you.

603
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,540
You and Lin love desserts.

604
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,480
I want to make desserts for the people I love.
