1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,980
You never showed up before. Why are you meddling with us now?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,580
We know what we should do and not do here.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,580
Win, stop!

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,820
Think carefully before you get angry and yell at people.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,640
Do you think that’s the holy water?

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,360
Shall we go take it now?

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,360
Here’s the truth.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,520
I didn’t come with you because I stopped being mad at you.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,940
I came because I want to end this.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,580
You idiot!

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,060
You idiot!

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,660
You idiot!

13
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,900
No one wanted this to happen.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,640
We’re fixing it.

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,500
I won’t let anything happen to Lin.

16
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,640
I don’t love and care about Lin any less than you do.

17
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,420
(He likes your sister. He does everything for her.)

18
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,460
(He is just being nice to you. Don’t let up easily.)

19
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,360
(You must pull yourself together, Win.)

20
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,740
You don’t need to worry about anything here.

21
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,180
You will give me your word, right?

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,680
Yes, I’ll give you my word.

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,740
(He must have used this approach to get the inheritance.)

24
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,820
(He must have sucked up to my dad when he was most vulnerable.)

25
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,780
(Win, you are the family’s tower of strength.)

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,980
(Get this over with and get your old life back.)

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,740
He’s not here yet?

36
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,900
Who do you mean?

37
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,880
I saw you looking for someone.

38
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,400
He’s taking a boat here.

39
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,620
I thought he would arrive before me.

40
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,700
So I was looking for him.

41
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,180
I saw only you here.

42
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,380
(Why is he not here yet?)

43
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,960
(Never mind. I better ask for holy water and leave.)

44
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,280
I came for holy water.

45
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,440
Why do you need it?

46
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,540
Venerable Uncle Arun told me to get holy water here.

47
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,360
Holy water is just a spiritual anchor.

48
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,580
If your heart is strong and happy,

49
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,500
Holy water is not necessary.

50
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,980
It’s necessary. Or else I would have made an effort to be here.

51
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,560
You think it’s necessary because of a lasso you make.

52
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,240
That lasso does not only tie you,

53
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,640
but also the person coming with you.

54
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,640
That person is in the Karma trap of yours.

55
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,300
But everything happened because of him.

56
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,580
Before blaming others,

57
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,260
why don’t you look back at yourself first?

58
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,540
Is it because of your ego

59
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,540
or the resentment in your heart?

60
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,160
You have built up quite a lot of anger in you.

61
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,160
Isn’t it heavy at all?

62
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
I will give you holy water

63
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,640
in exchange for the resentment in your heart.

64
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,120
Do you want me to forgive him?

65
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,980
Think carefully.

66
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,180
Don’t let the emotions get the best of you.

67
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,960
What has he done wrong?

68
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,320
Has he really done that?

69
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,420
Most importantly, what do you get out of this anger?

70
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,600
Does it have a good or bad effect on you?

71
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,320
Does it have a good or bad effect on you?

72
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,300
You came to my house day in day out

73
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,820
because you wanted to suck up to my dad.

74
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,100
Answer me.

75
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,440
Answer me!

76
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,780
You know well that I hate his guts.

77
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,120
Why do you still talk to him?

78
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,480
Slow down.

79
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,120
Shut up!

80
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,960
Holy water may help you and your sister.

81
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,380
But what can make your heart feel at ease

82
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,520
is none other than your heart itself.

83
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,280
Holy water may help you and your sister.

84
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,880
But what can make your heart feel at ease

85
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,240
is none other than your heart itself.

86
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,480
Thank you.

87
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
Where is he? How come he hasn’t gotten here yet?

88
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,200
He left before me. How could he get here after me?

89
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,480
Hey! What’s wrong?

90
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,320
Korn! Are you okay?

91
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,960
Korn, what’s wrong?

92
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,800
I don’t know.

93
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,120
He probably stepped on a sea urchin.

94
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,500
Sea urchin?

95
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,260
Can you check?

96
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,320
Okay.

97
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,720
We are nearly there.

98
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,000
Ouch.

99
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,840
Too hot?

100
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,260
No, it’s alright.

101
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,920
Just soak your foot in here for about 10-15 minutes.

102
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,200
If it doesn’t get better, you must tell me right away.

103
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,980
I’ll take you to see the doctor.

104
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,380
Why do you know about this stuff?

105
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,380
You are an animal husbandman.

106
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,180
I’m from Chonburi province.

107
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,720
I’m also from Chonburi but I don’t know.

108
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,480
Listen, Korn. We must learn some general knowledge.

109
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,140
One day we may need to use it to take care of someone.

110
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,420
Why were you here late?

111
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,600
The boat ran out of fuel.

112
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,980
They had to wait around half an hour before another boat brought a refill.

113
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,160
It was so delayed.

114
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,960
How did it go with the holy water?

115
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,640
I already got it.

116
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,640
Did the abbot there say anything?

117
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,080
(What has he done wrong?)

118
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,080
(Has he really done that?)

119
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,000
(Most importantly, what do you get out of this anger?)

120
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,240
(Does it have a good or bad effect on you?)

121
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,480
Not much.

122
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,680
Anyway, what Venerable Uncle Arun warned me was right.

123
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,220
What are you talking about?

124
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,920
That I am a bad luck magnet.That I am a bad luck magnet.

125
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,860
And you are the one who can push it away from me.

126
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,660
And today, the bad luck is on you.

127
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,060
I should have separated with you earlier.

128
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,760
I’m sorry.

129
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,460
Don’t mention it.

130
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,980
And sorry…

131
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,420
for being an ass,

132
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
for talking harshly to you,

133
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,180
for my emotional outburst,

134
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,620
and for that matter too.

135
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,580
That matter?

136
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
My father gave you the farm stock.

137
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,100
Actually, I had no right to be upset.

138
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,340
My father had the right to give anything to anyone as he wished.

139
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,680
He didn’t let me have the farm all by myself

140
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,660
as he knew that I couldn’t take care of it.

141
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,960
I really suck.

142
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,480
I’m not dependable.

143
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,560
If you were not dependable, your farm would have been out of business.

144
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,240
It could get out of business soon.

145
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,680
But let’s put that on the side.

146
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,760
Let’s focus on the present.

147
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,980
I must bring Lin back to her body.

148
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,660
I will deal with the farm’s situation later.

149
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,680
Staying mad at you

150
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,520
has wasted so much of my time.

151
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,800
Win.

152
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,560
I’m happy to hear you saying that.

153
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,560
But you know what?

154
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,140
No matter how furious you are at me,

155
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,140
I never hate you.

156
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,220
Let’s become friends again.

157
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,220
(It’s good enough to be just friends.)

158
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,220
(Friends? Just friends?)

159
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:44,780
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, then.

160
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,340
Game! I’ll start finding you guys now.

161
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,800
Bang! I found Win.

162
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,240
Bang!

163
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,700
Did Win tell you?

164
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,220
Where’s Lin?

165
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,720
Only Lin left now.

166
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,080
Lin, come out.

167
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,940
Lin!

168
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,060
Lin, come out. I’m hungry.

169
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,220
Lin!

170
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,140
Lin might not be hiding around here.

171
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
Lin, where are you? Lin!

172
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,420
Lin!

173
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,420
Lin!

174
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,680
I’ll get Dad.

175
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,280
I’m a doctor now but I still can’t help you.

176
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,820
I’m so useless.

177
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,820
You sure you’re okay?

178
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,820
Yes.

179
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,520
Almost there.

180
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,600
This side.

181
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,600
Why?

182
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,900
Come on.

183
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,460
You hurt your foot. How can I let you drive?

184
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
I’ll drive for you.

185
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,580
But the steering wheel of this car is pretty heavy.

186
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,460
Can you control it?

187
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,580
Hey, Korn.

188
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,820
Even though I’m in Lin’s body,

189
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,280
this is easy peasy for me.

190
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,260
But I can drive.

191
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,500
Come on. I can drive.

192
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,200
Let me do something for you.

193
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,080
Be careful.

194
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,700
Hey, careful.

195
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,520
Hey, careful.

196
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,140
Win.

197
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,380
Win.

198
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,480
Yes?

199
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,900
Is everything alright?

200
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,960
Yes.

201
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,560
Are you sure you can drive?

202
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,560
Yes. I can do it.

218
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,860
I want to give this basket to the nurses taking care of Win.

219
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,160
Sure.

220
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,940
Grapes are Mr. Win’s favorite fruit.

221
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,440
Too bad that he cannot have it.

222
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,800
Hey, In. Where did you go?

223
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,260
Nowhere. Nu and I will move in here.

224
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,260
What?

225
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,860
Win is at the hospital. Lin is not home.

226
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,620
You are all alone. If anything happens, can you handle it?

227
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,160
I can’t help feeling worried.

228
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,380
So I decided to be here for the time being.

229
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
We are family after all.

230
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,220
We should help each other in difficult times.

231
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,400
Right?

232
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,080
You can go to the hospital.

233
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
I think she’s keeping the holy water in this house.

234
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,480
Let’s split up to find it.

235
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,700
Got it, sis.

236
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,700
Let me have a short break. My body is aching.

237
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,540
I need to stretch my body outside.

238
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,560
Win.

239
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,220
Where are you going?

240
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,760
Get some coffee. Do you want anything?

241
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,320
It’s alright. Come here.

242
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I pay.

243
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,480
It’s not about the money.

244
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,700
Come over here.

245
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,080
What is it?

246
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
Come on.

247
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,240
What’s the matter?

248
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,880
Turn on your back.

249
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,280
Why?

250
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,660
Just do it. Come on.

251
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,480
Come on.

252
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,280
Fine.

253
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,200
It was a long drive. Your body must get stiff.

254
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Let me give you a massage.

255
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,020
Enough.

256
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,980
I don’t want to feel sleepy.

257
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,720
Are you hungry?

258
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,140
Let’s grab a bite.

259
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,560
I let you choose.

260
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,760
Choose what you want to eat.

261
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,540
You can be as fussy as you like.

262
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,080
I let you get back at me.

263
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,060
You already gave me permission.

264
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,680
Yes.

265
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,180
Good.

266
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,920
Enough.

267
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,820
Woah. What should I eat first?

268
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,820
This one first.

269
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,300
Gosh. It’s so delicious.

270
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,960
And this.

271
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,560
It’s so good.

272
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,780
Okay.

273
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,260
Look at you.

274
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,260
Is your stomach fulfilled by just staring at me?

275
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,520
Just looking at you eating is enjoyable enough.

276
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,280
I knew that you would like this restaurant.

277
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,540
What? I told you to pick what you liked.

278
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,780
I like whatever you like.

279
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,980
I’m gonna eat now.

280
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,140
Hold on.

281
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,740
I peel the shell off for you.

282
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,220
My hands are already messy.

283
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,400
You can just sit there and eat comfortably.

284
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,120
You can be nice too.

285
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,880
Then don’t eat.

286
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,100
I can do it myself.

287
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,420
Win.

288
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,100
What?

289
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,800
Have a dessert.

290
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,120
My stomach is about to explode.

291
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,080
So you are not gonna eat?

292
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,040
Yes, I am.

293
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,160
Hm?

294
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,160
Korn.

295
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,320
I did bad things to you.

296
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,540
Though I can’t remember them all.

297
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,880
I want to clear up with you.

298
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,740
I won’t go back and do such things again.

299
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,960
Can you be a mirror and reflect my flaws?

300
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,820
Tell me what they are.

301
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,240
Do you want me to do that?

302
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,020
Yes. Go ahead.

303
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,180
You are not gonna be mad at me after I say that, right?

304
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,300
I’m not gonna be mad.

305
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,440
I promise.

306
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,760
Nothing much.

307
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,080
You like to yell at people.

308
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,100
You get mad easily.

309
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,940
You don’t listen to other people’s opinions.

310
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,600
You are gluttonous.

311
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,680
You are whiny…

312
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,360
Five flaws?

313
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,180
Isn’t it too much?

314
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,720
Eh?

315
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,320
Who would be as good as you?

316
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,260
What?

317
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,680
I was being frank to you and you thought I criticized you.

318
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,980
Alright, then.

319
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
You can go on.

320
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,680
There’s one more bad thing that’s really important.

321
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,500
You like to do the opposite of what you say.

322
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,540
Like what?

323
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,980
Like when you said you were okay to drive.

324
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,820
But look at you now.

325
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,440
You look so pooped.

326
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,540
Then?

327
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,060
That’s all for now.

328
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,120
If I have more, I’ll let you know later.

329
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,420
That’s not just all. You gave me freaking six flaws.

330
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,880
Let’s just go. I don’t feel like eating anymore.

331
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,380
Alright.

332
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,380
Wait.

333
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,180
Don’t walk just yet.

334
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,160
Let me help.

335
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:53,760
3rd STOP

336
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:17,820
4th STOP

337
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,360
Damn.

338
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,640
I feel so much better after a shower.

339
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,540
I’m so tired.

340
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,140
Really really really

341
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,280
tired!

342
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,240
Hey, your steering wheel is so damn heavy.

343
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,460
And there are so many curves.

344
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,600
I turned and turned the steering wheel like a fire baton.

345
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,100
I think I could drive a truck now.

346
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,360
By the way, you bought this car to use or just because it’s beautiful?

347
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,120
Most cars have power steering wheels nowadays.

348
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Why do you use this heavy steering?

349
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,640
Why? You don’t have money or what?

350
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,340
I don’t think so. I think you are just too indie.

351
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,580
You don’t care about the environment

352
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,040
Hey.

353
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,700
I’m picking on you here. Talk to me.

354
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,040
How is your foot?

355
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,840
It doesn’t hurt much now.

356
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,300
Look.

357
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,460
Ouch.

358
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,540
You called that ‘doesn’t hurt’?

359
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,300
And you said I didn’t speak my mind.

360
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,220
You are too. You don’t say what you really feel.

361
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,300
Come here.

362
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,620
Let me dress your wound.

363
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,320
Hey. Where are you going?

364
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,020
Sit down.

365
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,760
What?

366
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,700
Sit down.

367
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,580
I can’t believe it.

368
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,720
Hey. I can do it myself.

369
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,560
Let me help.

370
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,140
Ouch.

371
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,040
Sorry.

372
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,940
It’s okay.

373
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,840
I’ll clean it now.

374
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,220
It will sting a bit.

375
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,980
Aching? I’ll give you a rub down.

376
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,400
Not aching. It’s just itchy.

377
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,400
Don’t deny.

378
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,100
Come here. Don’t be stubborn.

379
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,820
Otherwise you won’t get to sleep.

380
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,940
Ouch. What the hell are you doing?

381
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,140
Wait. Foot massage?

382
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,440
Yes.

383
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,880
You don’t need to.

384
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,980
I do.

385
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,980
You drove all day.

386
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,180
Look. Very stiff here.

387
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,660
You may not be able to walk tomorrow.

388
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,380
And you have been pampering me all day.

389
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,840
Let me pamper you too.

390
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,540
Korn.

391
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,020
Come to think of it.

392
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,020
We haven’t talked like this for years.

393
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,640
How are you doing now? How’s your life?

394
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,960
Any updates?

395
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,880
Nothing out of the ordinary.

396
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,880
I wake up in the morning and go to work.

397
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,380
I go back home, swim, and watch a series.

398
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,940
Who do you go with? That senior colleague of yours?

399
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,100
I just go alone.

400
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,880
Well…

401
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,560
aren’t you seeing someone?

402
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,420
No.

403
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,220
No as no you really have no one.

404
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,620
Or no as you still haven’t found the one you like.

405
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,260
Just a casual date and go separate ways or something like that?

406
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,280
No as a no.

407
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,560
But I have someone now.

408
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,120
Who?

409
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,720
You.

410
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,080
I mean someone you talk to like a date.

411
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,080
I don’t have anyone.

412
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,240
What about you?

413
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,780
I only spend my time with the cows at my farm.

414
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,260
Do you want me to date a cow?

415
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,260
Lin opens a bakery shop for you.

416
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,000
Do you…

417
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,840
want to go back there and help her?

418
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,740
If you want to do anything, just do it.

419
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,100
You don’t need to ask me.

420
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,520
You said your father had the right to give anything to anyone.

421
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,920
And he gave it to me.

422
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,180
I thought that I didn’t deserve it from the start.

423
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,580
It should belong to you.

424
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,940
After this holy water trip is over, I will return my stocks back to you.

425
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,600
I never really want it.

426
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,020
And if there’s anything you want me to help you with,

427
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,400
you can tell me anytime. I’m happy to help you

428
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,940
I’m glad that we are back on good terms.

429
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,340
I want to thank you too.

430
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,380
And I’m also glad

431
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
to have you back.

432
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,720
Go to sleep now.

433
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,380
We must get up early tomorrow.

434
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,440
1 DAY LEFT

435
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,500
Are you sure you have looked through?

436
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,140
Yes. You also saw that I didn’t stop at all yesterday.

437
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,880
What about you? Didn’t you get anything?

438
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,100
Where did she keep those bottles?

439
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,820
Don’t tell me she’s carrying them around.

440
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,920
Are you two having coffee?

441
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,200
Do you want some?

442
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,600
That would be nice.

443
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,000
How is Win doing?

444
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,720
Just the same.

445
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,580
You told us that Lin is going to get holy water to make Win get up.

446
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,580
Has Lin gotten any of it yet?

447
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,180
She came back that day and gave it to me.

448
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,340
She has left it with you?

449
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,700
Where do you keep it?

450
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,700
Let’s have coffee.

451
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,980
Korn, that looks so yummy.

452
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,040
Sister. How much is it?

453
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,640
5 baht each.

454
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,080
It’s good.

455
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,340
It’s really good.

456
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,180
Do you want to eat it?

457
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,520
Then buy it.

458
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,560
Come on, Win. Don’t tease him.

459
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,720
I went inside the temple, but I couldn’t find the abbot.

460
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,760
Do you happen to know where he is?

461
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,700
I’m not gonna tell you.

462
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,240
So you know.

463
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,900
Tell us where he is.

464
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,940
Here.

465
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,100
Not enough. I need 2 pieces.

466
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,760
What a greedy kid.

467
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,540
He’s taking a pilgrimage.

468
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,640
What should we do?

469
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,280
Did he leave any holy water to you?

470
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,620
Did he?

471
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,560
No.

472
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,680
What now?

473
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,680
But…

474
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,740
the abbot said if anyone asked for holy water,

475
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,640
tell them to meet him at the cave behind the temple.

476
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,860
He will give it to them there.

477
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,600
What? You should have told us from the beginning.

478
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,640
Which cave?

479
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,180
There is only one.

480
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,900
You can search for it on Google Map.

481
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,420
Do you have that?

482
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,720
This?

483
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,060
Yes.

484
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,340
Let’s get going.

485
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:29,840
Okay.

486
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,340
Come on, sis. What’s the rush?

487
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,360
You are here to get the holy water for your wedding, aren’t you?

488
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,700
A wisecracker, huh?

489
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,020
Good job, kid.

490
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,420
Hey! You haven’t paid yet.

491
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,800
Come back and pay.

492
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,700
We should be there soon.

493
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,560
Do you remember when we went to Phu Kradueng?

494
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,100
The trail is much harder than this.

495
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,760
I remember.

496
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,280
Non bailed on us.

497
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,460
We went there together, just the two of us.

498
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,960
You carried a lot of food and stuff to the hill.

499
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,960
You also ate with me.

500
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,960
And when we went to Pai.

501
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,100
You didn’t carry anything.

502
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,380
What happened that night?

503
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,200
You became so hungry.

504
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,640
And you rode a bike down the hill in the middle of the night.

505
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,640
You were so wasted that night.

506
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,860
You kept shaking the bike.

507
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,500
You were wasted too.

508
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,080
You threw up in a restaurant one time. Remember?

509
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,380
You slept on a footpath.

510
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,580
If I hadn’t lifted your legs off the road, you would have been run over by a car.

511
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,340
Stop teasing me with that incident.

512
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,480
We went to so many places back then.

513
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,720
We went to the mountains, beaches, and waterfalls.

514
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,340
I almost died there.

515
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,100
Are you able to swim again?

516
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,280
Win!

517
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,520
Not yet.

518
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,920
I’m still afraid of going in the water.

519
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,800
Let’s keep on.

520
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,800
It’s the last place now.

521
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,080
Let’s end this together.

522
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,420
It’s dark.

523
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,420
You are with me. Don’t be afraid.

524
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,420
Let’s go.

525
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,840
Watch out.

526
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,580
Where does the water come from?

527
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,140
Korn!

528
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,360
Korn!

529
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,760
Korn!

530
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,140
Korn!

531
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,540
No, In. Don’t.

532
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,160
Let it go!

533
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,320
What did you say?

534
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,080
Win!

535
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,900
Win! No.

536
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,240
I’m going to be with my son.

537
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,740
I love you, Win. I never told you.
