1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,620
Korn, help me name it.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,370
Alpha, Beta, Pi R

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,140
Why not ‘Pi^2’ then?

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,140
It’s too complicated.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,940
You said a trendy name.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,020
I want a female name, not a male name.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,540
And I want it to sound cute.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,310
Okay. So you want a female name, not a male name.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,140
And you want it to sound cute.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,740
Yes.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,310
Primrose, Iris, Daisy, Lily?

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,510
You might as well bring me a flower bouquet.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,710
Try something like Lodchong, Bualoy, Tubtib Krob.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,540
Are you naming your calf, or are you actually hungry?

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,600
Naming! And I want a Thai name.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,600
A Thai name?

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,570
Sopa, Sopee, 	Somporn, Somsak, Sommai, Sopeepannarai

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,370
Yeah, Somporn

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,280
Seriously, Korn.

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,310
You must have been into novels too much.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,940
Those names sound so old-fashioned.

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,540
You said a Thai name. So I came up with some.

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,370
It can’t be any more Thai than those names.

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,970
Our perception of Thainess must be different.

25
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,740
You don’t like any of the names I said.

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,510
Just think of it yourself.

27
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,600
Sulking?

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,970
I’m not.

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,940
Mr. Win. Mr. Korn!

30
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:29,770
What’s going on?

31
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,310
Baibua’s water bag broke.

32
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,310
Come on.

33
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,340
One two three.

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,510
One two three.

35
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,000
The head is out.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,140
One two three.

37
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,540
One more time.

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,540
One two three.

39
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,940

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,480
There you are.

49
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,820
What are you going to name it?

50
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,600
I name you Katin.

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,650
Katin as a three?

52
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,680
No.

53
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,570
Katin as in merit-making.

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,020
Katin, merit-making. Katin.

55
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,570
It sounds like both of your names.

56
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,340
Sawin - Thapakorn

57
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
Saworn - Thapakin

58
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,510

Korn - Win, Kinthorn - Nonkin

60
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,880
Katin!

61
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,450
Hey, Jorn.

62
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:44,940
Yes?

63
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,370
You shouldn’t have become a cattle farmer.

64
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,420
You should become a mechanic. A mechanic who welds things together.

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,480
I prefer to be a cattle farmer.

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Do you seriously pick this name?

67
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,450
Yes. It’s my baby.

68
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,450
I want to name her like this. Do you have a problem?

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,650
You always want things your way.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,020
I will have to help you feed her anyway.

71
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,080
That’s right.

72
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,650
All right. Let me take it from here.

73
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,050
Come on. Come to Papa. 	Katin.

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,370
You are quite heavy, Katin.

75
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,910
Take some rest now, Baibua.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,370
I promise…

77
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,710
I will take care of your baby

78
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
just like how my dad took care of you.

79
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,880
May I sit with you?

80
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,050
Um.

81
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,800
Are you thinking about your father?

82
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,450
Um.

83
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,280
If he were alive, I would have run to him

84
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,710
and told him that his beloved Baibua had given birth.

85
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,370
It’s a girl.

86
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,650
You are a grandpa now.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
I named her Katin.

88
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,800
She’s really adorable.

89
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,020
I promise you, Dad.

90
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,200
I will take good care of her,

91
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,310
just like how you care for Baibua.

92
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,110
I wish he were still alive

93
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,740
so that he could see Katin.

94
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,570
Win.

95
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,220
I think your father knows it somehow.

96
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,510
This may not be the time to do this.

97
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,170
But I have something for you.

98
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,450
What is it?

99
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,450
Hey, Korn.

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,880
Why are you being so softie?

101
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,370
Hey.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,080
This is a magic plush doll.

103
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,080
How?

104
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,740
It’s just a typical stuffed animal.

105
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,880
Here you are.

106
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,600
How is it?

107
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,600
It’s yours.

108
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
Thanks a lot.

109
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,600
But Katin is your baby too.

110
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,970
My baby has folded ears.

111
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,370
Keep it. I really want to give it to you.

112
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,370
Win.

113
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,570
Hm?

114
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,942
No matter what happens,

115
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,828
I promise

116
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:47,485
that I’ll always be with you.

117
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,057
Um.

118
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,657
Time to go to bed.

119
00:09:58,428 --> 00:09:59,657
You have an important event coming.

120
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,857
You need a good rest.

121
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,342
What time is it now?

122
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:16,971
2.30 a.m.

123
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,028
Just 30 minutes.

124
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:23,114
I don’t think I should sleep.

125
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:24,600
Aren’t you sleepy?

126
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:27,342
No. Are you?

127
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,257
If you are sleepy, just go to bed.

128
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,257
Before turning in, don’t forget to warm a glass of milk and drink it, you big softie.

129
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey, Mr. Win.

130
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:40,885
Don’t think too little of me.

131
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,857
Let’s compete.

132
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,942
Compete what?

133
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,940
Hey. What are you doing?

134
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:58,142
You are cheating, Win.

135
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,140
Korn, go over there,

136
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:46,400
It’s breezy, isn’t it?

137
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,742
Breakfast is here.

138
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,457
Delicious breakfast is here.

139
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,542
It’s all delicious.

140
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:06,314
Let’s eat.

141
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:18,257
Thank you so much, Soi.

142
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,028
You came all the way here to deliver it.

143
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,571
Stop flirting with me already.

144
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,171
Lin.

145
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,085
Why aren’t you home?

146
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,314
It’s sunny.

147
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:33,457
I want to bring this to you two.

148
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:37,942
Mom said you didn’t come back last night.

149
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:43,914
I couldn’t sleep.

150
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,057
Me neither.

151
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:59,171
Here’s your breakfast.

152
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:06,828
Thanks a lot, Lin.

153
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,371
Have you eaten?

154
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,428
I don’t want to eat.

155
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:19,914
Win, can you take me to see Baibua’s baby.

156
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,485
Sure. Let’s go.

157
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,171
Is it yum, Katin?

158
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:39,171
It would be great if Dad were here.

159
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:53,428
I understand you, Lin.

160
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,057
It’s gonna be okay.

161
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,050
I’m sorry for your loss.

162
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:43,971
Just let the tears out.

163
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:49,314
We don’t need to be strong all the time.

164
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:09,310
My dad has passed.

165
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:13,628
He really has passed away.

166
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:19,057
Win.

167
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,457
No matter what happens, I will always be with you.

168
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,771
Why did this happen to my family?

169
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:36,257
Why, Korn?

170
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:45,257
Why did it have to be my dad?

171
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,000
If you’re done crying,

172
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:49,485
wash this shirt for me.

173
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:51,257
Your mucus is all over.

174
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,942
What crap did you just say?

175
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:55,600
I’m kidding.

176
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,457
Hey, you guys.

177
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:03,485
Am I here too late?

178
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:05,742
What took you so long?

179
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:07,740
I just got off work.

180
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,740
Didn’t your shift end long ago?

181
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:12,257
Fine, I fell asleep. You dumbass Korn.

182
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:16,200
It’s not too late, right? Where’s your mother?

183
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,685
Why don’t you ask my dad?

184
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Let’s go.

185
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:27,400
Don’t tell anyone that I cried.

186
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:28,971
It’ll ruin my image.

187
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:31,371
Okay.

188
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:33,370
Let’s go.

189
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:55,428
I hope to see you again in the next life, honey.

190
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,114
It will be okay, Mom.

191
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:50,028
I will take care of the farm, Mom,

192
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
and Lin as best as I could.

193
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:00,828
Please do not worry, Dad.

194
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,542
I’ll help you.

195
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:18,971
Let’s leave here.

196
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,228
Thank you for coming.

197
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,400
Goodbye. Take care of your health.
See you again.

198
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,057
Please take care of your mother.

199
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:28,050
Hi, In.

200
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:32,228
I’m sorry for your loss.

201
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:35,571
I took the earliest flight and dashed here.

202
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,485
Thanks.

203
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:41,114
May I talk about my brother’s will after the funeral?

204
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,285
It’s something we need to settle after all.

205
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:51,714
Seriously,

206
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,457
that's what they are here for?

207
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,571
Win, what are you going to do?

208
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,114
You have time for that, right?

209
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:04,057
Win, say hi to your aunt and uncle.

210
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Never mind him. I know he doesn’t like me.

211
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,571
When I was small, I didn’t want to be with my relatives whom I didn’t like as well.

212
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:13,400
Let’s go, Nu.

213
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:34,085
Win.

214
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:49,457
Can you not say anything right now?

215
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,942
I’m still pissed.

216
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,314
What pissed you off?

217
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,600
Those 2 parasites.

218
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:02,485
Damn, my dad has just passed.

219
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,628
They are ready to leech us.

220
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:08,228
I hate them to guts.

221
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:15,685
Here.

222
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,680
What are you doing?

223
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:27,400
What is it?

224
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:28,914
Open it.

225
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,571
You open it.

226
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,200
Try it.

227
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,485
Ice cream?

228
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,228
Um.

229
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
What flavor is this?

230
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,514
Fresh milk.

231
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,057
Try it.

232
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,657
Come on. Just one bite.

233
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:03,400
How is it?

234
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,800
It’s good. Where did you buy it?

235
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:08,800
I made it.

236
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,028
It’s good, right?

237
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,600
Well, it’s aromatic and creamy.

238
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,542
But I don’t think it’s sweet enough.

239
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:28,428
You think it should be sweeter, right?

240
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,400
Sweetmeat must be sweet.

241
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,628
It is not called sweetmeat for nothing.

242
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,685
But I think it’s sweet enough.

243
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,600
People these days don’t like things that are overly sweet.

244
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:55,828
But some people prefer their things to be really sweet.

245
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,028
Don’t overgeneralize.

246
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:11,314
Here. Try it for yourself.

247
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:19,914
How is it?

248
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,342
It’s sweet.

249
00:22:24,914 --> 00:22:25,914
It can be sweeter.

250
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,342
But it’s sweet enough.

251
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,057
I think it can be a bit sweeter.

252
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:33,400
But I think it’s already sweet.

253
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,657
It can be sweeter.

254
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:38,771
It’s already sweet.

255
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,114
Make it sweeter.

256
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,342
Hello, Aunt In. Hello Uncle Nu.

257
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:17,514
Where’s your mother?

258
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:19,171
She is out to pick the lawyer up.

259
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,857
They should be here soon.

260
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,542
Please wait in the living room.

261
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:31,485
Where are your manners and respect?

262
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,657
Both of you don’t deserve my respect.

263
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:42,650
He’s an outsider.

264
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:44,650
He is considered a family member.

265
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:46,650
More importantly,

266
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:50,314
he is more useful to the farm than both of you.

267
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:55,171
Let’s go.

268
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:02,628
This will was made by me, Amorn Warodom,

269
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,485
to declare my intention that after my death,

270
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,971
all of my assets shall be distributed as follows:

271
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:16,200
1. My house and land, cars, including the government bonds worth 10 million baht

272
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,857
shall be given to Mrs. Pornuma Warodom, my spouse.

273
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:23,628
2. The stocks of Warodom Farm Co., Ltd.

274
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,257
shall be distributed to 4 equal portions of 25%

275
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,885
and given to Ms. Inthara Warodom,

276
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:31,880
Mr. Anucha Warodom,

277
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,942
Mr. Sawin Warodom,

278
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:36,940
and Mr. Thapakorn Chaiphitak.

279
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,742
3. Money in my personal savings account worth 15 million baht

280
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,000
shall be given to Miss Lalin Warodom, my daughter.

281
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:51,771
As I am writing this will,

282
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:58,514
I, Amorn Warodom, declare that I’m of sound mind

283
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:02,285
and not acting under duress or undue influence

284
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,657
and in the presence of my lawyer and undersigned witnesses.

285
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:09,457
You can now review it.

286
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:15,571
How come that bloke gets the stocks.

287
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,085
He’s a nonfamily member.

288
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:20,857
Now I understand why you said he was like a family member.

289
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:24,600
You must have brought him along while sucking up to my brother.

290
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,228
Make sure the farm does not fold.

291
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:42,914
Did you know about my father giving you the stocks?

292
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,257
Why, Korn?

293
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,971
Why did my father give you the farm’s stocks?

294
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,970
Answer me, Korn!

295
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:56,685
You came to my house day in day out

296
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:59,171
because you wanted to suck up to my dad.

297
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:03,371
What a snake friend!

298
00:26:04,514 --> 00:26:07,085
You are no different than those 2 parasites.

299
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,657
You want my family’s assets.

300
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,942
You want to live off my family?!

301
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:14,628
Answer me, Korn.

302
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:16,620
Answer me!

303
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:18,620
Why?

304
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:31,000
Get the hell out of my house.

305
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:33,314
Get the hell out of my life.

306
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:38,914
Get out of my house, Korn.

307
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,910
Don’t ever come back.

308
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,971
You don’t belong here anymore.

309
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,171
Get the hell out and don’t ever come back.

310
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:09,257
ONE YEAR LATER

311
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:15,828
Warodom Farm is a leading dairy farm in the eastern region.

312
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,857
It is located on 50-rai private estate in Chonburi province.

313
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:30,428
The founder, Mr. Amorn Warodom, began the dairy business in 1961.

314
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,342
It has been over 60 years since Warodom farm was established in Thailand.

315
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:40,800
The dairy cows here are all premium breeds guaranteed by numerous awards.

316
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,628
The atmosphere, feed, and attentive caring

317
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:51,142
make the dairy cows happy and be able to produce premium milk to the customers.

318
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,857
In this 60th year in business, Warodom Farm is under the management of

319
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,000
the 2nd generation led by Mr. Sawin Warodom.

320
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,657
Mr. Sawin uses this opportunity to extend the well-established dairy farm

321
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,085
to agritourism with a wide range of fun activities within the farm.

322
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:12,142
And a bakery shop that uses its own dairy products…

323
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,828
Shut it down.

324
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,114
Why are you still presenting this to me?

325
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:28,685
What’s wrong, dear?

326
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:32,680
Do you want me to revoke this project?

327
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:36,314
Or do you want to rework it?

328
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,800
Which parts do you want us to change?

329
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,800
Here I go.

330
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:48,371
I told you we didn’t sell bakeries.

331
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,228
No bakery shop whatsoever.

332
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,220
And I said that so many times.

333
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,200
Well, Win.

334
00:28:58,142 --> 00:29:00,628
It was me who came up with the bakery idea.

335
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:01,885
What, Lin?

336
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,114
I said I was the one who…

337
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,171
I heard that.

338
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:08,170
But why, Lin?

339
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:13,914
I want to do it.

340
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,257
Our farm has a thousand things to do.

341
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:21,200
Why don’t you try them first? You may like it.

342
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:25,714
But I think a bakery shop is good for our farm.

343
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,057
Our milk is of high quality.

344
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,257
We could use them to produce cream, cake, and bakeries.

345
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:32,228
It should bring more benefits to our farm.

346
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,571
What a great team.

347
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,342
Do you think I don’t know?

348
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:40,200
Why did you bring back that troublemaker to our farm?

349
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:42,371
Are you happy to see me getting worked up like this?

350
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:48,480
Listen. I think a bakery shop can help our farm…

351
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:49,600
Enough, Lin.

352
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:51,857
Stop talking about it.

353
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,571
Please excuse us. You may continue this project.

354
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,257
Sorry.
Be more careful!

355
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:35,514
Pick them up.

356
00:30:35,571 --> 00:30:36,314
Sorry, Chef.

357
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,971
Get it out of my way.

358
00:30:38,857 --> 00:30:40,457
You knew about the incident, right?

359
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:40,857
Yes.

360
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,914
We have 2 hours to finish a new wedding cake.

361
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:47,600
But Chef. 	It takes at least an hour to make and bake a cake.

362
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Can we really do it?

363
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,428
We must!

364
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:51,685
Why are you not starting it?!
Yes, Chef.

365
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:55,542
Let me handle it.

366
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,714
Eggs, please.

367
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,428
Num, make the frosting.

368
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,942
Pim, warm up the oven.

369
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,428
Noon, prepare the piping tips.

370
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,114
If we are still in the red like this, our farm will fold in 3 months.

371
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,714
What should I do, Dad?

372
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,571
Give me the frosting.

373
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,057
Okay.

374
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,742
Num, make a new batch of frosting.

375
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:40,628
Make use of what we have left.

376
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:42,620
I will decorate it as a rustic wedding cake.

377
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
I need flowers and fruits.

378
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,228
Get them for me.

379
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,028
Yes, Chef.

380
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:21,514
Who let these cows out?

381
00:33:26,828 --> 00:33:30,142
Come on, Cookie and Cocoa. Let’s go back.

382
00:33:30,914 --> 00:33:32,140
Cookie and Cocoa, come on.

383
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,085
Come on. It’s about to rain.

384
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:38,142
Move.

385
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:50,600
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

386
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:04,171
Are you free to talk? I want to talk to you.

387
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,285
I can’t talk right now. I’ll call you later.

388
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:15,628
Sorry to keep you waiting.

389
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:18,857
Korn.

390
00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:20,342
Yes.

391
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,228
How lucky that you are still here. We could do it just in time.

392
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:26,600
No more problems, right?

393
00:34:27,571 --> 00:34:28,371
No.

394
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,457
I admire how you finish it in time.

395
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:33,057
But…

396
00:34:34,457 --> 00:34:38,742
I saw that you use the fruits from the buffet section

397
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:41,371
and the flowers from the wedding.

398
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:46,285
Why did you do that? Do you have an explanation for me?

399
00:34:49,142 --> 00:34:50,914
No, Chef.

400
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:56,114
Brilliant problem-solving.

401
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:02,914
All organizations need a man with good problem-solving skills like you

402
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:07,485
Geez, Chef.

403
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,200
I thought you called me here to yell at me.

404
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:22,514
Who would dare to do that to my Chef Korn?

405
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,114
You are our valuable and brilliant chef.

406
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:32,742
I must protect you at all costs.

407
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:37,428
Thank you.

408
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,971
I have to take this call. Please excuse me.

409
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,580
Hello, Lin. What’s up?

410
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,440
Korn, you are okay to talk, right?

411
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,980
Yes.

412
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,920
Win found out about our bakery shop.

413
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,140
I don’t know what to do now.

414
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,920
Mom even tried to convince him.

415
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
But Win refused to listen.

416
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,180
I don’t know what else I should do now, Korn.

417
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,160
Did you tell Win that I had nothing to do with it?

418
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,020
I already told him that. Win didn’t want to listen.

419
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,760
Lin. Hello, Lin.

420
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,500
Lin!

421
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,500
You have been secretly talking with my sister?

422
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,060
What’s your problem? Are you lacking warmth and affection?

423
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,880
Why the hell are you always around my family?

424
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,700
Win, calm down. I can explain.

425
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,700
Lin just asked for my advice.

426
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,420
Advice?

427
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,420
You call him to get his advice?

428
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,600
You have me.

429
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,600
Why do you ask Korn for advice?

430
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,760
It’s about the bakery shop, isn’t it?

431
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,500
Even I have to say it ten times

432
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,540
a hundred times or a thousand times, I don’t allow it!

433
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,280
And no one in this world can change my decision.

434
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,120
And you, Korn.

435
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,640
Get the hell away from my sister.

436
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,640
And let me make it clear to you again

437
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,500
that I will never let my farm

438
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,360
accommodate your bakery shop.

439
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,700
Win, listen to me.

440
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,100
End of discussion!

441
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,720
Hello. Win!

442
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,500
Win!

443
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,820
You know well that I hate his guts.

444
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,700
Why do you still call him?

445
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,200
Why do you still talk to him?

446
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,160
Why do you talk to him?!

447
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,240
Answer me.

448
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,020
Stop it.

449
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,720
Lin contacts Korn.

450
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
You know it too?

451
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,760
Is this how you want?

452
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,240
Come here.

453
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,740
Where are we going?

454
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,240
Come!

455
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,460
Where are you taking her to, Win?!

456
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,720
Hurry up.
Where are we going, Win?

457
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,500
Come here!

458
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,900
Win.

459
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,860
We will end all this so that Korn can leave us alone.

460
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,260
Win, where are you taking her to?

461
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,200
Win!

462
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,460
Where are you going?

463
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,260
Come back.

464
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,140
Win!

465
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,680
Win!

466
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,820
Win!

467
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,580
No!

468
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,780
Let’s go home, Win. I’m scared.

469
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,520
I beg you.

470
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,900
We are not going back.

471
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,900
I must clear this with him.

472
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,120
This shit must end tonight.

473
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,300
I will not contact him again.

474
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,500
I don’t believe any of your words.

475
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,860
How many times have you told me that?

476
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,120
You still find your way back to him.

477
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,820
Why do you have to talk to him?

478
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,200
Slow down.

479
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,140
Shut up!

480
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,440
Arun.

481
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,640
Arun.

482
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:32,980
Arun.

483
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,160
Come out.	Arun.

484
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,900
Arun.

485
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,500
Please help the kids. They are in trouble.

486
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,300
I know. I know.

487
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,080
Stop yelling. People might see you and get scared.

488
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,640
I would go up there if I could.

489
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,020
I’m scared, Win. I beg you.

490
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,400
Lin.

491
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,260
Lin!

492
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,440
Where is Lin?

493
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,440
What the hell happened?

494
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,360
How come I’m in Lin’s body?

495
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,260
[Lalin Warodom]

496
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,560
Lin.

497
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,000
How are you, dear?

498
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,260
Are you hurt?

499
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,820
Please help support her.

500
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,240
Slowly, dear.

501
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,740
Tell me, dear.

502
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,400
You are okay, right?

503
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,580
(Is this real?)

504
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,240
What the hell happened to me?

505
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,600
What did you say?

506
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,500
Is she okay?

507
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,140
Let me get the doctor. Just a moment.

508
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,980
How are you, Lin?

509
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,500
Korn, you’re here.

510
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
Korn, you son of a bitch!

511
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,220
It’s all because of you.

512
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,540
I’m like this because of you!

513
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,540
Don’t act dumb.

514
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,120
You put me into this.

515
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,420
You asshole.

516
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,240
Help. Help us.

517
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,240
Help.

518
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,420
What’s going on?

519
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,720
Lin, calm down.

520
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,280
Calm down.
It’s all because of you.

521
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,000
What’s wrong?

522
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,560
Let go of me, four-eyes!

523
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:11,380
You have to pay respect to four monks and ask them for holy water within the next 7 days.

524
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,880
I wrote down everything in this paper.

525
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,440
I’ve been thinking about this for a year and I still can’t think of one reason,

526
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,000
except he’s been sucking up to my father for his fortune.

527
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Ouch!

528
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,500
Don’t mess with me!

529
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,380
I’m her husband.

530
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,380
My wife is always sulking.

531
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,980
Leave me alone already.

532
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,140
You see where your stubbornness got you?

533
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,280
The abbot said you have to go with me.

534
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,320
Otherwise, bad things will happen to you.

535
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,600
If you don’t care about your body, at least care about your sister’s.
