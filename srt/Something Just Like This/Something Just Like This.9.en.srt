Today's stream really affected me.

You guys have disrupted
the retail industry

15
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,789
using methods I wouldn't
have thought of.

of thousands of customers.

QE's malls can only dream
of having such traffic.

19
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,720
Especially Jia Yun. Her performance
was particularly notable.

Why did you bring this up all of a sudden?

154

Surely you've noticed the amount of time
Duan Ran and I are spending together.

you no longer have feelings for Duan Ran?

172
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,050
[B2]

173
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,210
Jia Yun? Yes, speaking.

174
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,300
How about dinner tonight?

175
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,670
Sure.

176
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,520
Then, I'll give Duan Ran a call.

177
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,780
That's just the smell
of fire extinguisher.

178
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,970
No, something's burnt.

179
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,350
You heard the firemen.

180
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,560
Luckily nothing caught fire.

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,060
Mr Duan Jr, how about a dinner date?

182
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,490
[Dinner?]

183
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,930
Sure.

184
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,460
Where did you learn to dance like that?

185
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,230
You were absolutely stunning today.

186
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,810
What's the use? I still lost.

187
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,660
Join me.

188
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,480
[You're always welcome here.]

189
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,700
Didn't you tell me

190
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,270
you have a thing for hot pots?

191
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,010
I scoured the whole of Xiamen

192
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,500
and found the most authentic
Chongqing hot pot restaurant.

193
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,920
I think you'll love it.

194
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,690
He said you love hot pots

195
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,020
because hot pots are cheap.

196
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,780
He wasn't thinking of

197
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
what you want.

198
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,570
Always so self-centered.

199
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,910
Guys like him

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,580
are never going to make it.

201
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,560
What do you feel like?

202
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,810
Whatever you like, Mr Duan Jr.

203
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,570
[What do I like?]

204
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,310
What cuisine do you have in mind?

205
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,180
Eastern or Western?

206
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,440
Western.

207
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,750
Better ambience.

208
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,980
Western food?

209
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,970
Sure. I'll make the reservation.

210
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,990
He's totally different from Chen Lang.

211
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,980
He listens,

212
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,020
he asks.

213
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,940
It isn't all about him.

214
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,910
Chongqing hot pot?

215
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,490
Okay. Let's go for that.

216
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,920
What did I tell you?

217
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,250
He has his own logic for everything.

218
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,930
He'll justify his opinion

219
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,330
with all kinds of reasons.

220
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,460
He's more stubborn.

221
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,210
Working or living with a guy like that...

222
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,890
Hold on.

223
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,910
Today I'm wearing

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,730
a beautiful, flowing dress.

225
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,240
If I go to a hot pot shop,

226
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,180
it'll be a disaster.

227
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,870
Never mind, maybe next time.

228
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,040
I'm hanging up.

229
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,480
What's that about?

230
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,100
Mr Duan Jr, remember
to dress handsomely tonight.

231
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,810
[What do you mean?]

232
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,520
Are you trying to tell me something?

233
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,680
Big-hearted.

234
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,190
Caring.

235
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,370
Attentive.

236
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,000
So you,

237
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,810
you're just ignorant

238
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,170
about how lucky you are.

239
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,010
Is that so?

240
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,820
Sure. What time works best for you?

241
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,810
Pick a place.

242
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,570
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

243
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,300
[Okay. I'll send you the address.]

244
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,490
Okay. Bye-bye.

245
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,390
So, little Missy,

246
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,480
I've even booked the dinner date for you.

247
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,830
I'll forward his address

248
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,810
to you later.

249
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,520
Do your best tonight.

250
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,440
I'm going?

251
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,720
Zhang Jia Yun, What do you mean?

252
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,530
What were you thinking?

253
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,300
"What was I thinking"?

254
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,010
Just do your best, Missy.

255
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,210
Hold up.

256
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,400
The...

257
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,910
Let me ask you something.

258
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,700
If you think Duan Ran's such
a wonderful guy,

259
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,500
why didn't you make a move on him?

260
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,240
Get real. Why would I break up
my dream couple?

261
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,370
Besides, you and Duan Ran
have too much history.

262
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,170
It won't be easy for a third party
to cut in.

263
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,860
Most of all,

264
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,780
we're bestie.

265
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,400
And girlfriends' boyfriends
are off limits.

266
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,490
What are you saying?

267
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,690
Okay, okay.

268
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,120
A night of romance is worth
a thousand gold.

269
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,660
Better pick the flower
while it's blooming.

270
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,620
If you don't pick it, someone else will.

271
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,750
-Listen...
-Alright already.

272
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,030
We've been over this.

273
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,100
Do your best and tell me how it went.

274
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,870
I say, Mr Wang,

275
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,100
ever heard of preventive maintenance?

276
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,900
When's the last time it was done?

277
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,410
How could such a disaster happen?

278
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,570
We did.

279
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,780
We did a maintenance

280
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,700
on the wiring just two months ago.

281
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,990
This... This is impossible.

282
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,930
Mr Wang.

283
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,950
Do you guys have CCTV around here?

284
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,990
Yeah.

285
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,730
CCTV? Sure. It's right there.

286
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
As for the footage,

287
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,000
you have to request it from HQ.

288
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,120
That's fine.

289
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,980
Go to HQ with Mr Wang

290
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,200
and check the footage.

291
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,390
I have someone on tonight.

292
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,870
-Let's go.
-No problem.

293
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,050
Come.

294
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,280
[Love]

295
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,110
Why is it you?

296
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,080
Why do you look so disappointed to see me?

297
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,010
Didn't Jia Yun ask me out?

298
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,560
Something came up.

299
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,940
Can't I fill in for her?

300
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,780
Sure you can.

301
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,070
It's good, actually.

302
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,850
I was dreading going to a business dinner

303
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,390
after such a long day of streaming.

304
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,630
Instead, I get to have a relaxing
family meal with you.

305
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,120
Great.

306
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,350
Why is dinner with Jia Yun

307
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,760
a business dinner?

308
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,460
Why not?

309
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,870
I saw her playing with your hair.

310
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,670
Give me a little space, will you?

311
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,080
Don't be jealous.

312
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,410
I'm jealous?

313
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,840
How am I jealous?

314
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,940
Honestly, if you become
an item with Jia Yun,

315
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,850
I'd be happy for you and congratulate you.

316
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,620
So why did you two

317
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,360
set me up on this dinner date?

318
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,100
We set you up?

319
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,140
I'm just worried that

320
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,880
you may never escape the trauma
of being dumped.

321
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,010
I wonder who

322
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,130
called me in the middle of the night

323
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,100
to pour out his drunken sorrows...

324
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,410
I wonder who

325
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,540
pursued her senior
all the way to Shanghai,

326
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,890
only to fail in the end,

327
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,340
I lost interest in him, okay?

328
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,260
Were you even listening at that time?

329
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,760
It's always you who lost interest.
Got it.

330
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,930
But of course.

331
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,230
Enough about that.

332
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,380
Hey.

333
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,560
We'd like to order.

334
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,220
Give it to him.

335
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,880
Everyone.

336
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,150
You've worked hard.

337
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,640
But it's thanks to your hard work

338
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,710
that we managed to beat Rui

339
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,950
and win the rights to stream for Pineapple
in the next season.

340
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,200
Bravo!

It's thanks to your leadership, Mr Chen.

We sure wiped the floor with them.

343
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,300
Yeah. We even made Zhang Jia Yun
do that ridiculous dance.

344

Mr Chen, you're the best!

345
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,520
She danced pretty well.

Guys, do you see it now?

347
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,300

Everyone. Eat hard, drink hard.

the opportunity.]

Mr Wu, you're the type of people
I enjoy working with.

Thanks for the praise.

But I need to remind you something.

370
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,250
I was going through the numbers.

371
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,810
It seems your total skirt sales

372
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,240
isn't even one tenth of Rui's.

373
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,550
So,

374
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,370
skirts are out of the agreement.

385
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,120
I've been wanting to ask you something.

386
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,360
Your first love in the UK.

387
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,350
Why did you break up with her?

388
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,690
Be honest.

389
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,750
We...

390
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,780
She's older than me.
My parents disapproved of it.

391
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,870
So when she returned to the UK,
we broke up.

392
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,430
What about you?

393
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,090
My story's the same.

394
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,280
He wanted to stay in Shanghai.

395
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,290
But I wanted to go to Xiamen.

396
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,550
Do you still keep in touch?

397
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,770
Not really.

398
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,800
At most through WeChat Moments.

399
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,700
What about yours?

400
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,320
I don't contact her either.

401
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,320
What was she like?

402
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,180
Her?

403
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,130
Sociable.

404
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,810
Free spirited.

405
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,880
Sounds like a nice girl.

406
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,790
Now I see it.

407
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,550
So you weren't good enough for her.

408
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,980
Let me ask you something.

409
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,600
Shoot.

411
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,020
why haven't we gone steady yet?

412
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,720
Look.

413
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,610
We've been neighbours since
we were kids.

414
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,280
We've known each other
for over 20 years.

415
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,250
In secondary school, we ate at the same
table every meal.

416
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,000
We even shared the same toothbrush mug.

417
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,430
Just as we did other daily necessities.

418
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,120
We're closer than
an old couple, for god's sake.

419
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,500
But why haven't we dated?

420
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,940
How would I know?

421
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,780
I'm talking to you. Put away the phone.

422
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,130
It's fine. Let me read this.

Do you have anything to say to me?

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,160
Are you trying to trick me?

427
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,820
I'm thinking about

428
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,850
how to console you tomorrow.

429
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,120
Xi Xi,

430
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,210
forget about that.

431
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,160
You

432
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,450
should think about what to eat tomorrow.

433
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,420
Tomorrow night, I'll buy you dinner

434
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,860
to make it up to you.

435
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,220
A little consolation.

436
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,970
Today I kept calm under pressure
and rose to the occasion.

437
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,090
Everybody saw that.

438
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,810
If I hadn't kept you on your toes,

439
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,700
how could you have such a remarkable
performance?

440
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,610
The power outage was an accident,
a force majeure.

441
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,470
All you showed was your petty attitude.

442
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,050
And maybe a little bit of technical skill.

443
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,190
Hello.

444
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,080
Mr Duan, did you see the footage?

445
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,210
Yes, I did.

446
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,540
It was indeed caused
by deteriorated wiring,

447
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,730
not human intervention.

448
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,740
Alright, got it.

449
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,050
I think...

450
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,160
What is it?

451
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,950
Nothing.

452
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,960
Are you finished?

453
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,890
I told you I was finished.

454
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,490
You should go home soon.

455
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,730
Tomorrow's the big day.

456
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,560
Let's go.

457
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,820
-Let's go.
-You first.

458
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,260
No, you first.

459
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,370
Go home. Tomorrow's a busy day.

460
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,970
I'm tired too.

461
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,170
Just let me rest for a bit.

462
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,500
No.

463
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,290
You should get going.
You have a lot of work to do.

464
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,440
Don't you fall asleep.

465
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,970
Are they going to announce the CEO?

466
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,400
Of course.

467
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,880
Come, let's check it out.

468
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,460
Say, who do you think will win?

469
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,990
Isn't it obvious?

470
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,660
Mr Duan Jr was a shoo-in.

471
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,900
But yesterday's power disruption

472
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,420
made Xi Xi's victory

473
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,030
seem even more impressive.

474
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,580
How could you say that?

475
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,140
Mr Duan neutralised the crisis

476
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,660
in less than 15 minutes.

477
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,000
Surely such outstanding decision making

478
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,780
trumps winning any competition?

479
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,040
You have a point.

480
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,340
I saw Mr Duan in a new light yesterday.

481
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,060
Anyway, we'll have a new CEO today.

482
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,580
It's okay if it's Duan Ran.

483
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,900
At least Xi Xi

484
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,990
isn't counting on becoming the CEO.

485
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,550
But if Xi Xi's chosen,

486
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,590
Duan Ran's going to have a hard time.

487
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,560
Ran Ran.

488
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,060
Xi Xi.

489
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
Yesterday,

490
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,810
Mr Duan, the board and myself

491
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,170
have discussed it.

492
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,100
We've come to a consensus regarding

493
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,600
the appointment of Rui Live's CEO.

494
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,850
As per our conclusion in that meeting,

495
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,490
we hereby appoint

496
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,400
Qian Xi Xi as Rui Live's CEO,

497
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,890
effective immediately.

498
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,290
If there are no objections,

499
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,210
then it's settled.

500
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,890
I have an objection.

501
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,870
What objection may that be?

502
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,560
This company...

503
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,350
I... I have put in so much sweat and blood

504
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,490
for this company,

505
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,610
haven't I? I have put out

506
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,850
more than one fire in this company.

507
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,180
You saw what happened yesterday
at our streaming showdown.

508
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,280
Didn't you?

509
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,310
So on what criteria

510
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,640
do you judge which one of us
was going to be the CEO?

511
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,350
I'll answer that question.

512
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,000
In light of how you two have handled
the old stock,

513
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,010
recruited streamers,

514
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,200
and built the brand,

515
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,410
we unanimously agreed

516
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,850
that Qian Xi Xi would have
a greater impact on helping Rui

517
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,130
restore its direction

518
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,600
and morale.

519
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,990
She's more pragmatic

520
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,210
and more diligent.

521
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,160
She's also wise.

522
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,190
So the board unanimously agreed

523
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,780
that Qian Xi Xi is the candidate

524
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,720
for the position of Rui Live's CEO.

525
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,800
Look,

526
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,760
when it comes to being pragmatic,

527
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,960
sure, she's just that little more
pragmatic than me.

528
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,850
But our company

529
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,280
is way over its birth pangs now.

530
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,900
What our company needs now

531
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,300
is a leader who can focus
on the big picture

532
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,770
and think big.

533
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,940
And that person is me.

534
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,960
Xi Xi has no idea.

535
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,490
She's weak in this area.

536
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,560
First of all, Duan Ran, I disagree
with your opinion.

537
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,190
Second,

538
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,400
if you believe Qian Xi Xi is lacking
in any area,

539
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,040
you could always help her
and guide her.

540
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,420
In a company,

541
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,910
everybody should be given the opportunity

542
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,500
to do what they do best.

543
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,770
Why...

544
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,800
should I help her?

545
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,750
How can I help her?

546
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,350
Besides, I'm here to become
an entrepreneur.

547
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,100
Why should I help a ditz
with no business

548
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,360
or leadership experience?

549
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,990
Why should I teach her?

550
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,180
Why?

551
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,390
Duan Ran.

552
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,880
Watch your attitude.

553
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,620
And your words.

554
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,150
You went a little too far there.

555
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,430
Am I wrong?

556
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,510
Am I wrong?

557
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,790
Tell you what.

558
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,010
Why don't we

559
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,210
split the company into two divisions?

560
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,690
Or even two business units.

561
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,200
Both of us will be in charge.

562
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,960
Xi Xi will manage external affairs
while I manage internal operations.

563
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,390
How's that?

564
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,610
Childish.

565
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,030
Do you really think this will benefit Rui?

566
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,470
It's at least way better than

567
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,130
putting only her in charge.

568
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,070
Duan Ran.

569
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,750
The board has given this matter
its due consideration.

570
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,320
Their decision

571
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,770
is for the greater good.

572
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,160
You always criticise her
for thinking small.

573
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,130
But I feel, at this time,

574
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,400
you're the one who needs some
self-reflection.

575
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,370
Well, let's put an end
to this discussion, shall we?

576
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,850
Qian Xi Xi

577
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,600
shall serve as Rui Live's CEO.

578
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,250
Effective immediately.

579
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,470
Xi Xi,

580
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,400
Rui Live is counting on you.

581
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,800
But please be aware

582
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,910
that you don't have much time.

583
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,640
Five months from now,

584
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,600
if you can't match QE Marketplace
in terms of sales

585
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,660
like Duan Ran promised,

586
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,320
we will have to sell off Rui Live.

587
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,120
Sure. Got it.

588
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,060
I completely understand.

589
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,930
I'm very thankful today for Uncle Duan

590
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,150
and Uncle Shen's trust.

591
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,910
Very thankful indeed.

592
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,100
Thankful is right!

593
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,510
You're totally unqualified

594
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,040
for this position.

595
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,150
I'm thankful to all of you for teaching me

596
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,990
the meaning of "beware the thief
that lives in your family."

597
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,410
Thief!

598
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,580
Duan Ran.

599
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,200
Who are you calling a thief?

600
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,000
Ever since we were kids,

601
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,580
you've always encroached on my space.

602
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,730
You take my stuff,

603
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,900
drive my car,

604
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,660
and use all my belongings.

605
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,100
Now that I'm an entrepreneur,

606
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,700
you even took away my company.
How is that fair?

607
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,230
Duan Ran, this is a meeting.

608
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,500
This is a meeting for seniors.

609
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,020
I have no right to be here.

610
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,250
Ran Ran.

611
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,040
Xi Xi,

612
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,820
don't mind him.

613
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,240
It's just one of his hissy fits.

614
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,000
Xi Xi.

615
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,260
Don't stoop to Duan Ran's level.

616
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,370
I'll talk to him at home.

617
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,140
Do your best.

618
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,960
I have a good feeling about you.

619
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,690
Don't worry, Uncle Duan.

620
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,100
I'll give it my all.

621
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,610
I wouldn't want to let you

622
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,090
or Uncle Shen down.

623
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,630
Just don't let yourself down.

624
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,200
Thanks, Uncle Duan.

625
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,440
I can't see you off, then.

626
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,500
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

627
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,220
Do you two even know what
live streaming e-commerce is?

628
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,940
Idiots.

629
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,950
How did it go?

630
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,100
What's the situation?

631
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,470
Who's the CEO?

632
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:17,370
This time, it seems Uncle Duan
and Uncle Shen are bent on

633
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,320
putting me through hell.

634
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,720
You mean

635
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,270
they've appointed you as the CEO?

636
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,030
Congrats on your promotion, Director Qian.

637
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,220
Don't forget us at the top.

638
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,960
Don't forget us.

639
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,760
Wise decision by Mr Duan Sr.

640
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,290
See? I told you they would
pick Director Qian.

641
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,060
When did you say that?

642
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,820
Weren't you praising Mr Duan

643
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,910
for his excellent decision making?

644
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,960
But then I said...

645
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,780
I said Director Qian did a great job

646
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,370
with the old stock.

647
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,610
Did you say that?
How come I didn't hear it?

648
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,170
Your ears must be damaged.

649
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,500
-No, yours.
-Enough, enough.

650
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,550
-Pipe down.
-I said it.

651
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,650
Stop bickering.

652
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,810
Since Mr Duan Sr and Mr Shen
have chosen me,

653
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,469
they must have their reasons.

654
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,150
Since they've chosen me,

655
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,980
I mustn't disappoint them.

656
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,250
In the next five months,

657
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,639
I'll pull Rui up from the ashes.

658
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,190
As for your roles

659
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,290
and responsibilities,

660
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,719
I've thought it through.

661
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,409
Company meeting!

662
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,770
-Mr Duan.
-[Hey, Yu Shi.]

663
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,110
Let's go to the security room
and check out the footage.

664
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,010
I can't.

665
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,660
Director Qian just called
for a company-wide meeting.

666
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,710
[How about after the...]

667
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,440
Can't you see this is urgent?

668
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,040
What's Xi Xi up to?

669
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,100
[Mr Duan.]

670
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,120
Never mind. I'll go by myself.

671
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,130
Pause.

672
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,540
What is it?

673
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,610
The people pushing the baby stroller.

674
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,930
I've just seen them pass by.

675
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,620
That's right. Their routes are identical.

676
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,780
Skip forward.

677
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,810
About 40 minutes.

678
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,120
-Okay.
-Let's see.

679
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,990
Pause.

680
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,610
Look.

681
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,490
It's the same route again.

682
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,890
And the same place.

683
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,360
That means

684
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,510
not only did someone cut off the power,

685
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,770
that person even knew I'd check the CCTV.

686
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,130
So that person came here

687
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,750
to tamper with the footage.

688
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,040
They've edited the part where
they cut off the power.

689
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,380
Who's in charge of the security team?

690
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,880
That's outside our jurisdiction.

691
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,870
The CCTV footage gets uploaded
in real time.

692
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,030
It may very well be a coincidence.

693
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,570
Who could have the ability

694
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,220
to mess with the footage?

695
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,950
That's virtually impossible.

696
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,880
No. I can't be wrong about this.

697
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,000
So,

698
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,850
what position will Xi Xi

699
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,330
give Mr Duan?

700
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,990
I'm not sure.

701
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,160
-Thanks.
-But I'm guessing

702
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,830
Business Development?

703
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,310
After all, it's related to what
Mr Duan studied in the UK.

704
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,290
Business Development?

705
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,430
No way. It's too fancy a title.

706
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,710
I don't think so.

707
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,990
If I were Xi Xi,

708
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,680
I would make Duan Ran my male secretary.

709
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,550
Sounds good.

710
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,570
Make Duan Ran follow you around
and pour your drinks.

711
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,760
Exactly.

712
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,380
He could be a bodyguard. He's so hefty.

713
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,390
Xi Xi.

714
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,330
Good day, Director Qian.

715
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,270
No need to stand up. Sit.

716
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,250
I think I'll sit here instead.

717
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,640
Hello, everyone.

718
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,600
It's about time.

719
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,150
Let's not wait for the rest.

720
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,890
This is my first regular meeting

721
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,750
as the CEO of Rui Live.

722
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,590
Here's the agenda for our meeting today.

723
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,780
Go on.

724
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,410
I'm curious.

725
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,830
We've set a time for this meeting.

726
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,710
Where were you?

727
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,890
I had stuff to do.

728
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,560
What stuff?

729
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,010
What do you care? There was a jam.

730
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,790
Get on with the meeting.

731
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,440
A jam?

732
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,580
Is that a valid excuse?

733
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,800
Stand up.

734
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,340
What for?

735
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,660
Stand there.

736
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,970
Five minute timeout.

737
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,730
Get up and take your timeout.

738
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,600
Do it!

739
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,110
Will you stand?

740
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,960
You want to play hardball?

741
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,900
Who's playing hardball now?

742
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,220
You're the one who's late

743
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,940
on my first day as CEO.

744
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,000
Will you stand?

745
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,370
Nope.

746
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,310
Alright, I'll stand.

747
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,490
I'll stand.

748
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,150
I'll stand.

749
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,600
I'll stand.

750
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,580
You guys carry on.

751
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,560
Stand properly. No loitering.

752
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,210
Let's continue.

753
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,020
This is my first regular meeting

754
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,980
as the CEO of Rui Live.

755
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,180
The main agenda for today

756
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,200
is to assign each of you
your roles.

757
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,770
We've worked together for so long.

758
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,590
Based on my understanding of you guys,

759
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,290
here's how it'll look.

760
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,610
Okay. I got it. Thanks.

761
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,750
I'll reply to you now.

762
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,930
We're in a meeting! Can you keep it down?

763
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,330
Excuse me.

764
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,870
The Head of Finance will still be Yu Shi.

765
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,940
Thank you for your trust in me.

766
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,030
In other words, Yu Shi handles the money.

767
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,360
Don't worry. You can count on me.

768
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,660
Do a good job.

769
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,590
Do your best.

770
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,910
Next is the supply chain.

771
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,080
Supply chain...

772
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,150
Supply chain...

773
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,020
Mr Five.

774
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,110
You'll handle the supply chain.

775
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,600
We'll definitely have our own brand
down the road.

776
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,370
Supply chain is vital.

777
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,570
You do it.

778
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,970
Are we really going have
a self-owned brand?

779
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,470
Let's work hard.

780
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,740
Anything for you.

781
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,120
That's the spirit!

782
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,960
Next is technical support.

783
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,510
I was torn when it came
to the other roles.

784
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,830
But for technical support,
the choice was obvious.

785
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,360
Su Su it is.

786
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,940
Rest assured, Director Qian.

787
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,200
Keep up the good work.

788
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,520
Cut it out.

789
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,770
Jia Yun.

790
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,960
You.

791
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,600
What? I'm busy.

792
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,810
Xi Xi, as you know,

793
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,830
I don't like being the Team Leader.

794
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,530
Please spare me.

795
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,960
Of course I know your preferences.

796
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,620
But I'm not going to spare you.

797
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,450
Great news.

798
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,800
Pineapple's contract just came in.

799
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,690
You'll be doing the live streams
for their skirts.

800
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,100
Okay, sure.

801
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,310
Told you I know you well.

802
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,410
No problem.

803
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,900
Your five minutes

804
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,090
is almost up.

805
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,050
Hey, you there loitering.

806
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,150
Take a seat.

807
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,460
Are you talking to me?

808
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,620
Your seat's over there.

809
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,980
I don't want to.

810
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,930
Are you feeling indignant?

811
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,200
I think you know the answer.

812
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,480
And you don't?

813
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,500
You were late to our first meeting.

814
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,450
I won't take a seat.

815
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,220
You apologise to me,

816
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,370
I go back to my seat.

817
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,390
If you won't apologise,

818
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,110
then forget it.

819
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,200
You were late and you
want me to apologise?

820
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,470
Apologise!

821
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,480
Don't mind me.

822
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,620
Can't you just sit down?

823
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,980
Alright. That's about it

824
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,290
for today's agenda.

825
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,050
If you have any ideas

826
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,160
or suggestions, feel free to come to me.

827
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,830
Yu Shi, after this meeting,
let's go to the warehouse

828
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,860
to check on the old stock.

829
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,770
You got it.

830
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,990
Meeting adjourned.

831
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,770
Don't...

832
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,300
Qian Xi Xi.

833
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,070
Qian Xi Xi!

834
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,460
-I'm talking to you.
-What do you want?

835
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,560
You haven't given me a role.

836
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,480
You want a role?

837
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,650
You were late and rude to your boss.

838
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,670
That's two cardinal sins,
and you want a role?

839
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,800
You're the CEO. Whatever you say goes.

840
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,050
Be my intern, then.

841
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,120
And if you fail, you can always
be a floor manager at QE.

842
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,910
An intern?
