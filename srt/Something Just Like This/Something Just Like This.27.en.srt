[Episode 27]

4
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,210
Since both the valid votes
go to Zhang Jia Yun,

5
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,390
I hereby announce

6
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,900
that from now

7
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,900
until the board assumes control,

8
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,670
Zhang Jia Yun will manage
Rui's day-to-day business,

9
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,070
effective immediately.

10
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,480
All right, that is the end of our meeting.

11
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,880
We have a candidate,

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,780
so I'll get going.

13
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,770
Don't cry.

14
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:38,860
Quiet.

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,820
Fei Fei.

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,190
Who's that?

17
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,759
Quiet, it is the landlord.

18
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,110
The landlord? Then open up.

19
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,170
I haven't paid rent for three months.

20
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,870
Great.

21
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,759
Doesn't he have the key?

22
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,220
I changed the lock after I moved in.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,860
She is always not home. Where did she go?

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,300
Zhang Jia Yun, did you vote for yourself?

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,590
We all agreed to vote for Xi Xi.

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,650
What's your problem?

27
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,590
Just how badly do you wish to be the CEO?

28
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,690
That's enough.

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm Rui's CEO now.

30
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,000
Yu Shi,

31
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,650
compile this quarter's statement

32
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,980
and send me a copy.

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,980
Su Su,

34
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,170
compile all broadcasters'
live stream data

35
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,500
since Chen Lang left

36
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,230
and send it to me.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,930
As for the broadcasters,

38
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,870
aren't you all free?

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,880
I want an inventory
of all the brands you've promoted,

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,280
including the supply chain

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,640
and individual products.

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,740
I need to see them

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,050
by tomorrow.

44
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,990
That's right.

45
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,180
Duan Ran,

46
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,860
once we have the data,

47
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,829
I need your help tomorrow

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,420
to report to the board of directors.

49
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,270
Well, if there are no further questions,

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,500
I'll be in my office.

51
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,910
Feel free drop by.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,510
You have an office now?

53
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,970
The CEO's office.

54
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,110
You...

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,460
She...

56
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,530
She really thinks she's the CEO.

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,410
Don't look at me. No way.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,140
Mr Duan,

59
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,140
why didn't you say a word?

60
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,100
Aren't you angry?

61
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,770
Work hard, all of you.

62
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,550
I'm speechless.

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,300
Three months of overdue rent,

64
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,780
and you're still alive?

65
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,380
My boyfriend's gone.

66
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,870
So are my roommates.

67
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,460
I lost my job,

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,100
and now I'm bearded.

69
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,950
How am I supposed to pay rent?

70
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,990
Take my advice.

71
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,610
Let's go to the hospital

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,750
and consult a doctor about that beard.

73
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,080
Maybe there's a treatment.

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
No way.

75
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,700
I don't want to see a doctor.

76
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,810
Then what do you want?

77
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,650
You want to be bearded forever?

78
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,620
Did you know?

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,370
Now, I get insomnia every night.

80
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,490
I become very scared after it gets dark,

81
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,630
I don't dare to sleep at all.

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,410
I'm scared if I fall asleep,

83
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,490
in my dreams, I'll...

84
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,110
I'll...

85
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,390
You're crying again?

86
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,210
Stay here tonight, all right?

87
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,700
Keep me company here.

88
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,300
Bad idea.

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,700
Tell you what,

90
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,380
I'll stay here with you tonight.

91
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,440
But in the morning,

92
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,300
you'll go to the hospital with me.

93
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,040
You...

94
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,550
Don't be rash.

95
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,840
Let me do the talking.

96
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,060
She is here.

97
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,750
Let's begin.

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,090
Everyone,

99
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,500
I was appointed

100
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,020
as the company's new CEO

101
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,150
for my passion and sense
of responsibility.

102
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,350
But did you ever think

103
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,900
why Rui has experienced so many problems?

104
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,409
My answer is

105
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,750
subpar management.

106
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:48,140
That's why each department
was unable to perform.

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,500
Hence,

108
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,070
we need to implement
Rui's reform together.

109
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,380
Reform?

110
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,820
That's right.

111
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,620
First of all,

112
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,440
we will carry out monitoring
measures for the products

113
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,390
and customers' feedback system.

114
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,090
For this task,

115
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,700
Yu Shi, Su Su,

116
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,830
you two will be in charge.

117
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,070
Ms Zhang, I majored in finance.

118
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,720
Horses for courses.

119
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,500
Every man to his trade.

120
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,830
Now you want me to do

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,870
customer feedback?

122
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,370
What if I fail?

123
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,410
That's right, Jia Yun.

124
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,090
Customer service

125
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,980
gives me traumatic flashbacks.

126
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,920
I feel we should engage a
professional service provider.

127
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,850
Although Xi Xi

128
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,310
took responsibility
for Fei Fei's incident,

129
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,900
I'm sure all of you know

130
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,659
how it started.

131
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,870
I don't wish to hear
declines or excuses anymore.

132
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,670
Solve your own problems.

133
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,250
Atone for your mistakes.

134
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,570
The second point concerns broadcasters.

135
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,000
We will carry out
broadcasters' training programs.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,710
Not only the new broadcasters,

137
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,370
all non-head broadcasters

138
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,690
are required to join.

139
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,620
Our company does not even
have a head broadcaster now.

140
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,000
In other words, everyone
has to go for training.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,040
That's right.

142
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,140
I expect hard work from all of you.

143
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,970
There was no competition
within the company.

144
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,900
Everybody sold

145
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,740
as much as they felt like.

146
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,560
It is different now.

147
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,620
Now, we are going to come up with

148
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,870
a performance review system.

149
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,100
Each month,

150
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,790
the top three broadcasters
in terms of ratings

151
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,810
will have five percent more
commission for that month.

152
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,110
On the flip side, the bottom rung

153
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
will get a five-percent deduction.

154
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,500
Those who stay at the bottom
for six months straight

155
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,820
will be fired.

156
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,310
We are streaming
eight hours each day as is.

157
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,470
With the graded training program,

158
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,580
we'll be here all day, all week.

159
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,120
We are not paid a lot to start with,
and you will deduct some more?

160
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,720
Ms Zhang, shouldn't we
put out the fire first?

161
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,840
We're not out of the woods yet

162
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,660
with the SAIC and Perfect Blue.

163
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,710
Why don't we solve this first
before talking about reform?

164
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,900
Mr Duan and Xi Xi have been trying

165
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,250
to put out that fire.

166
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,160
But whenever they put a fire,
another would kindle.

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,590
We need to solve the problem
at its roots

168
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,350
by doing away with any
issues left from the past.

169
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,310
I don't want to play fireman.

170
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,820
But what if the fire spreads?

171
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,700
Therefore, I will announce
the following step.

172
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,340
I'm thinking about working
with Cloud Live next.

173
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,430
It's still in the works,

174
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,300
but I thought I'd let you know.

175
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,600
We work in the same industry anyway.

176
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,700
Why go against each other, right?

177
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,220
I understand how you feel,

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,419
but we need to handle
certain things step by step.

179
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,550
Turning to Chen Lang all of a sudden.

180
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,550
You know his history

181
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,050
with our company.

182
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,930
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

183
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,260
Since we're reforming,

184
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,930
may as well go all the way.

185
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,400
Meeting adjourned.

186
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,820
What does she mean by that?

187
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,250
Mr Duan.

188
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,620
What are you all doing here?

189
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,050
We need to talk.

190
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,150
Did you know what she said in the meeting?

191
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,340
A reform.

192
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,470
Involving Chen Lang.

193
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,180
Do you know about all this?

194
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,920
Collaborate with Chen Lang?

195
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,030
That's right.

196
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,420
Zhang Jia Yun has just risen to power,

197
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,820
and she's doing that?

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,470
Yes.

199
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,610
That's why we came to ask you.

200
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,690
We want to know what you make of it.

201
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,150
I have no comment.

202
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,790
Does that mean you are
not against it or what?

203
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,380
Recently,

204
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,810
I have been pondering

205
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,340
what the meaning of life is.

206
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,590
Before, I used to

207
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,950
work so hard everyday

208
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,220
for long hours,

209
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,470
and got so exhausted.

210
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,860
I couldn't sleep.

211
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,250
And for what?

212
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,220
Life is beautiful.

213
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,860
Life is good.

214
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,900
Now that I'm relaxed,

215
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,410
what is apparent is all
the goodness in life.

216
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,820
Embrace nature.

217
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,890
I especially admire your
attitude towards life.

218
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,780
Never in a hurry,

219
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,740
nothing to worry about.

220
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,720
You keep potted plants in the office

221
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,340
and water your plants
whenever you have time.

222
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,230
That is life.

223
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,510
Don't say that, Mr Duan.

224
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,370
We braced through so many hardships.

225
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,580
I don't think

226
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,240
we're so easily defeated.

227
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,920
We don't need to work
with the likes of Chen Lang.

228
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,020
That's right.

229
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,930
This one can't take too much water, right?

230
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,950
Yes, succulent plants...

231
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,180
I knew it. The roots are all rotten.

232
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,470
Anything else?

233
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,150
If not, you should get back to work.

234
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,420
Ms Zhang just got promoted.

235
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,610
She needs you.

236
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,610
Work properly, all of you.

237
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,370
Put your back into it.

238
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,840
While you are still young,

239
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,160
you must work hard

240
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,020
so you will be successful in the future.

241
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,700
Don't give up, alright?

242
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,340
Do your best

243
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,360
and provide Ms Zhang support

244
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,290
to better our company.

245
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,730
I'm tired.

246
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,740
I need to rest here for awhile.

247
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,460
Get back to work, all of you.

248
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,910
Work hard.

249
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,570
Let's go.

250
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,540
[There are two valid votes left.]

251
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,050
[Both of them go to Zhang Jia Yun.]

252
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,690
[Jia Yun,]

253
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,440
[I need you to do me a favour.]

254
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,820
[Which is?]

255
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,460
[Which is to become the CEO.]

256
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,440
[Why don't all of us
cast our votes for Xi Xi?]

257
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,470
[It is decided.]

258
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,020
[Let's all vote for Xi Xi.]

259
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,300
[Let's get on it.]

260
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,700
[Come on.]

261
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,240
[Didn't we agree]

262
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,790
[not to see each other?
What if we're seen?]

263
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,950
[This is for Xi Xi.]

264
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,150
[Jia Yun, we will
thank you properly in future.]

265
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,340
[I'm glad you know.]

266
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,080
[Don't forget my treats.]

267
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,730
Fei Fei,

268
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,110
here.

269
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,330
The doctor said it's hormonal imbalance

270
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,590
was likely due to an unhealthy lifestyle

271
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,540
and emotional problems.

272
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,920
So starting today,

273
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,280
be a good girl.

274
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,620
Take your meds on time.

275
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,800
And

276
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,890
just take it easy.

277
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,170
You'll be fine.

278
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,960
Fei Fei, the doctor also said

279
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,630
you should watch your diet

280
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,820
and eat regularly.

281
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,270
Here,

282
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,560
eat some vegetables.

283
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,220
And eggs too.

284
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,980
Hurry up and eat.

285
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,660
Xi Xi,

286
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,360
because of me,

287
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,250
your life is a mess now.

288
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,630
Why are you still being so good to me?

289
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,850
I did not lose my job because of you.

290
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,350
You are just a remote cause at most.

291
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,380
Honestly, I came here

292
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,380
because I wanted to help you.

293
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,670
Second, I wanted to find clues

294
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,290
that might explain what went wrong
with the liquid foundation.

295
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,720
You are so honest.

296
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,720
That's the best policy.

297
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,660
I haven't had veggies in ages.

298
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,550
Eat up.

299
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,450
There was a hubbub about the beard.

300
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,020
Now, everyone is so quiet.

301
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,860
We can't even stream.

302
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,930
Or make any money.

303
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,620
We have no money
and nothing to do.

304
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,240
Do you think our company

305
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,840
has bad feng shui?

306
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,180
In just a few months,

307
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,950
we've gone through three CEOs.

308
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,460
At first, I thought Ms Qian would last.

309
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,360
But because of the beard scandal,

310
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,680
she was forced to leave.

311
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,010
Now I feel like leaving.

312
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,850
I heard all the broadcasters
wish to leave too.

313
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,100
Give me a hug.

314
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,810
You missed me, right?

315
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,690
You bet.

316
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,790
What's this?

317
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,590
What's the luggage for?

318
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,690
Later, when you're back,

319
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,380
ask her to move out.

320
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,200
I'll move here to stay with you.

321
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,250
That's enough. People...

322
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,550
People are watching.

323
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,790
Cut it out.

324
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,440
-What's that?
-Your daily necessities.

325
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,170
-Take it.
-Daily necessities?

326
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,480
Is it too heavy?

327
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,230
Put it down.

328
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
What kind of necessities are these?

329
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,120
Did you put iron inside the bag?

330
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,900
You've resigned already,

331
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,390
yet you're still investigating.

332
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,730
I thought we could go out more often.

333
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,900
I know you are worried about me.

334
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,070
However,

335
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,150
this incident did

336
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,020
happen during my tenure.

337
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,780
I do what I can to help.

338
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,390
Fine. After all, my girlfriend

339
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,140
is such a kind-hearted person.

340
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,540
I don't know what you need,

341
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,500
but

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,180
It is nothing.

511
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,350
Sorry for summoning you this late.

512
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,810
Hope I didn't disturb you.

513
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,400
No need to apologise.

514
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,580
What's up?

515
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,840
Nothing, I just need a drinking partner.

516
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,770
Come on.

517
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,710
What's up with you? This isn't like you.

518
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,230
I'm in a bad mood, that's all.

519
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,760
And after going through my contact list,

520
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,970
I realised

521
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,870
you're the only person I could rant to.

522
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,340
My ex-boyfriend.

523
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm quite honoured.

524
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,820
Tell me, what happened?

525
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,710
We have known each other for years.

526
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,420
In your opinion,

527
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,140
am I a failure?

528
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,120
Be honest.

529
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,350
If you are a failure,

530
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,970
the rest of us are nothing.

531
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,650
You're now

532
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,550
Jiang Zhe Yang's

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,260
big time agent.

534
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,680
You're the envy of the world,

535
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,070
and you feel bad?

536
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,850
You expect too much from yourself.

537
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,220
That I do.

538
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,620
But not in the right places.

539
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,140
I just feel that

540
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,820
we have to put in effort

541
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,950
and work hard.

542
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,940
Once we do that,

543
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,180
we will be able to

544
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,680
control our own lives.

545
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,070
But

546
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,260
sometimes, I feel,

547
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,420
working hard only to fail in the end

548
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,300
is the worst thing ever.

549
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,420
Anyway, no party lasts forever.

550
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,490
And people will always leave.

551
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,490
No, wait.

552
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,990
What do you mean by that?

553
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,140
Did you and Yang Yang fall out?

554
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,430
You can't tell me?

555
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,630
Fine. If you can't tell me
the whole story,

556
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,510
just say

557
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,630
if it's him or his mother's problem.

558
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,050
I'll take care of it.

559
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,010
Don't drink on your own here.

560
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,660
No need, I'm fine.

561
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,260
I know how to handle

562
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,970
my own matters at work.

563
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,250
The end result may not be good

564
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,770
but at least it is the right thing to do.

565
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,930
Besides, I'm grateful enough
having you here

566
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,090
with me.

567
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,420
Thank you.

568
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,180
So you're saying

569
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,190
you're just here

570
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,780
to drown your sorrows

571
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,540
and nothing I say matters?

572
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,420
In that case, let's drink.

573
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,900
You know me best.

574
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,140

577
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,690
You called, Ms Zhang?

578
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,970
Come in.

579
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,300
You see,

580
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,060
I just got promoted.

581
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,880
I thought I would

582
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,670
pick my key executive's brain

583
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,660
on where to take the company.

584
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,710
I have a plan for you.

585
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,510
Now, I'm engaging

586
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120
a well-known cafe chain

587
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,870
to talk about collaboration.

588
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,150
I'm thinking, our company and
Cloud Live will stage a special for you.

589
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,410
It sounds good,

590
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,570
but working with Chen Lang is just...

591
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,540
Yuanbao,

592
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,630
I know your father

593
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,120
is a very successful businessman himself.

594
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
Business is business.

595
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,330
You know this more than anyone here.

596
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,200
Let's be rational.

597
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,030
Anyhow, the coffee chain is

598
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,880
my bargaining chip against Chen Lang.

599
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,010
Keep it to yourself.

600
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,430
Don't tell others.

601
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,270
Jia Yun is firing on all cylinders.

602
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,520
She's even giving us

603
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,930
a one-on-one talk.

604
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,490
Well, she's the new CEO.

605
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,750
It is your turn.

606
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,340
I'll get going. Goodbye.

607
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,700
Go ahead. Don't worry.

608
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,890
Are you going to talk to
me about staff training?

609
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,760
I'm in talks with
the producers of "Minion"

610
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,180
for movie derivatives.

611
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,580
I was thinking of organising a special

612

with you and Cloud Live.

Really? Thank you, Ms Zhang.

614
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,020
But the Minions collaboration

615
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,160
is my bargaining chip against Chen Lang.

616
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,730
Don't tell others about it.

617
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,060
Sure, don't worry. I won't.

618
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,340
Mr Five, go ahead.

619
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,080
-How did it go?
-It was not bad.

620
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,560
I'm fixing you up with a hot brand

621
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,830
called Recluse.

622
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,090
Recluse?

623
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,470
I showed them your work

624
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,040
and they liked it a lot,

625
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,510
so they decided to use your design

626
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,790
to create a series of products

627
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,330
under your own original label.

628
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,660
The first batch will be marketed online.

629
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,020
My target is to

630
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,990
promote you as

631
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,810
a top notch designer
in the live stream industry.

632
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,330
I plan to realise that
together with Cloud Live.

633
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,380
But

634
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,200
this collaboration with Recluse

635
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,910
is my bargaining chip against Chen Lang.

636
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,310
Don't tell anyone about this.

637
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,950
Cola,

638
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,870
I've always thought you have the potential

639
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,460
to be Head Broadcaster.

640
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,760
It's just that you were

641
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,740
overshadowed by Yuan Yuan.

642
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,420
I think it is very unfair for you.

643
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,310
Luckily,

644
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,740
now, both Yuan Yuan and Xi Xi have left.

645
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,150
Rui needs our own
head broadcaster urgently.

646
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,260
However, currently,

647
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,970
Rui is in a unique situation.

648
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,020
Therefore, I wish to
collaborate with Cloud Live.

649
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,250
But Cloud Live has always
thought of us as a competitor.

650
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,610
What makes you think

651
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,830
Chen Lang will collaborate with us?

652
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,830
Do you know who initially got
the deal with Pineapple Xpress?

653
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,810
I did at that time, and
I will this time round.

654
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,390
Yuan Yuan's era is over.

655
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,460
From now on, we will welcome

656
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,260
Cola's era.

657
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,320
That being said,

658
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,230
our collaboration with Pineapple Xpress

659
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,449
is my bargaining chip against Chen Lang.

660
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:21,290
Don't disclose it to anyone.

661
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,179
All right.

665
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,219
And, she wasn't sure whom
that particular bottle

666
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,460
was from.

667
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,920
Fei Fei,

668
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,790
why did you buy so many
of the same

669
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,010
Perfect Blue products?

670
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,840
From various places, even?

671
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,700
I was hoarding.

672
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,440
There were special offers.

673
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,260
So I bought them out.

674
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,880
So, this product was widely sold

675
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,190
to a lot of people.

676
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,070
Why only you have such a
serious reaction to it

677
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,290
and grew a beard?

678
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,920
The doctor said

679
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,350
she's been having hormonal imbalance.

680
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,680
Her body is sensitive,

681
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,900
hence the beard.

682
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,300
Fei Fei,

683
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,340
so back then, how did you know that

684
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,760
the defective product you used

685
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,090
was sold by our platform?

686
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,990
I got the beard

687
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,810
when I just broke up.

688
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,180
I was in a bad mood.

689
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,180
I wasn't thinking straight.

690
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,070
Moreover, your employees

691
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,430
were so rude towards me.

692
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,980
So I got furious

693
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,560
and decided to find fault with you.

694
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,820
It is something any female who just
went through breakup would do.

695
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,140
It's understandable.

696
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,850
I'm sorry that you broke up.

697
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,880
You're angry? Fine.

698
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,330
But did you realise what

699
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,810
your little shenanigans cost us?

700
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,980
Fei Fei knows she did wrong.

701
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,680
Did I ask you to come here to complain?

702
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,900
Be more gentle.

703
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,570
You are so fierce.

704
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,570
She'd better know it.

705
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,710
I just want you to know that

706
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,790
due to your impulsive behaviour,

707
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,530
our company's out of business

708
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,550
and our CEO is unemployed.

709
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,370
Two of our employees, Su Su and Yu Shi,

710
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,300
are even going to Taizhou
to look for your boyfriend.

711
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,910
Who?

712
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,920
The people who went looking
for your ex.

713
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,440
The people who were mean

714
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,010
to you when you came to us.

715
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,680
Actually, they did not mean to be rude.

716
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,300
That cute girl

717
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,520
with the glasses.

718
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,390
She was going through
the same thing as you.

719
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
She just broke up with her jerk
of a boyfriend.

720
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,980
She was on the edge of despair.

721
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,360
We all experience setbacks
in our relationships,

722
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,980
but that doesn't mean you can act out.

723
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,180
What about Zhang Si?

724
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,380
We found him.

725
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,020
However, Zhang Si

726
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,610
has found a new girlfriend in Taizhou.

727
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,580
Duan Ran,

728
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,760
you...

729
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,390
Must you say that?

730
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,590
You... Stop talking.

731
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,440
Fei Fei, listen to me.

732
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,460
In my opinion,

733
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,050
the kind of love that you're looking for

734
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,820
can only be found

735
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,670
in your parents.

736
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,260
Think about it.

737
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,290
You have such high expectations.

738
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,300
Which means,

739
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,010
in this world, everyone you
come across in your life

740
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,470
will only disappoint you.

741
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,910
If you wish to be loved,

742
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,350
first, you need to be
psychologically independent.

743
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,190
If you know how to love yourself,

744
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,340
others will also know how to love you.

745
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,940
Am I right?

746
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,880
Emotional independence

747
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,440
and self-love

748
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,600
are very important.

749
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,770
But for now,

750
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,500
I have a suggestion.

751
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,990
You should stop your trouble-making ways

752
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,170
for starters.

753
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,270
Let me tell you,

754
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,980
Xi Xi has stayed here for so long.

755
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,230
She is the CEO of our company.

756
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,500
She was dismissed

757
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,590
and yet comes here everyday

758
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,790
to keep you company

759
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,660
and do chores for you.

760
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,980
Xi Xi,

761
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,230
you lost your job because of me.

762
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,990
I'm sorry.

763
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,100
Not only her,

764
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,160
our entire company is in shambles.

765
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,270
All the people

766
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,490
who depend on the company
for a living.

767
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,620
Is there anything I can do

768
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,690
to make it up to you?

769
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,210
You are here.

770
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,240
How's the situation?

771
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,390
Since Zhang Jia Yun became CEO,

772
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,010
everyone's scared.

773
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,600
Everyone wavered when I

774
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,530
suggested jumping ship.

775
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,260
As expected.

776
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,700
Given the hideous situation there,

777
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,820
career progression is out of the question.

778
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Did you remind them

779
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
that Cloud Live can give them

780
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,530
a better future?

781
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,650
Sure,

782
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,930
in that case, give them one more push

783
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,720
for them to come over quickly.

784
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,360
This is "Circus Sideshow"

785
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,010
by Georges Seurat.

786
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,870
Look at the audience.

787
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,700
Happiness, excitement,
curiosity, contentment.

788
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,150
The only emotion lacking is guilt,

789
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,650
as if cruelty

790
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,500
has nothing to do with them.

791
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,460
This is too cruel for the animals.

792
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,020
Do you know what I saw from this painting?

793
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,390
It is the survival of the fittest.

794
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,010
Jia Yun,

795
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,870
after so many years,

796
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,290
this is the first time you asked me out,

797
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,780
right?

798
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,670
Why? Mr Chen, are you too busy

799
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,090
to keep me company?

800
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,510
I wouldn't dare.

801
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,670
I'm honoured. I'm very honoured.

802
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,700
All right, cut it out.

803
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,150
I'll say this upfront.

804
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,640
I'm not on a date with you today.

805
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,180
I'm here to talk about work.

806
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,110
How disappointing.
How disappointing indeed.

807
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,140
So, what can I do for you?

808
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,550
You have to call me Ms Zhang now.

809
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,980
Sure.

810
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,570
Ms Zhang,

811
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,060
how can I help you?

812
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,940
You see,

813
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,190
I recall that although you've left Rui,

814
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,680
you still have a stake in the company.

815
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,670
At the end of the day,

816
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,460
Rui is still your baby.

817
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,590
That's right.

818
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,310
If that is the case,

819
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,200
now, Duan Ran and Qian Xi Xi who you hate

820
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,570
are both gone.

821
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,970
So,

822
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,060
can we bury the hatchet

823
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,860
and do a special with Rui and Cloud Live?

824
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,010
I'm not greedy.

825
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,500
50-50.

826
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,110
What do you say?

827
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,430
You call that not greedy?

828
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,270
I knew it.

829
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,340
So this is your aim.

830
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,840
Jia Yun, say...

831
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,440
No, I mean, Ms Zhang.

832
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,340
I have been a businessman for years.

833
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,510
When I received that phone call
from you last night,

834
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,080
I had a feeling

835
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,100
it was about this.

836
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,090
However, I'm perplexed about one thing.

837
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,980
You're so close with Wu Zhong Quan.

838
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,040
In fact, both Duan Ran and Qian Xi Xi

839
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,880
first knew him through you.

840
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,800
If, with his help,
you decide to snatch away

841
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,390
Pineapple Xpress' special,

842
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,640
wouldn't that be my loss?

843
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,500
I will be devastated, won't I?

844
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,880
You already guessed that

845
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,060
I'm actually after Pineapple Xpress?
