[Episode 13]

4
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,480
I know your shareholders.

5
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,760
-They are from QE Group, right?
-Yes, that's right.

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,930
I'm here to talk about acquisition.

7
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,880
Acquisition?

8
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,490
Mr Bai, just now you said

9
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,500
our company's capital structure
is very complicated.

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,100
Acquisition is probably...

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,700
But that's all right, Mr Bai.

12
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,539
We can talk about other
forms of cooperation.

13
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,470
I'm not planning to acquire your
streaming company.

14
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,250
Rather, I'd like to buy the

15
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,340
bulletproof coffee you are doing.

16
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,990
Understood, understood.

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,140
This bulletproof coffee we are selling now

18
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,539
does have great sales.

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,670
We have been busy with
this for the past few days.

20
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,330
Many brands came to
talk about partnership.

21
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,770
However, Mr Bai, I'll be honest with you.

22
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,950
It is not up to me.

23
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,220
Because the patent of this coffee

24
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,950
doesn't belong to our company.

25
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,410
I know.

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,530
There's a broadcaster named Si Yu.

27
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,910
She owns it.

28
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,970
Known on the internet as Yuan Bao.

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,370
Yes, that's right. Yuan Bao.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,600
This coffee is Yuan Bao's
exclusive recipe.

31
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,829
In that case, Ms Qian,
can you bring me to her?

32
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,570
No problem. Leave it to me.

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,850
Ran Ran.

34
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,880
I don't think I have heard
of this brand before.

35
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,760
Madam, this brand is a
personal shoppers' shop.

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,720
All the brands inside are
mixed and sold together.

37
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,700
Really?

38
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,810
All these well-known brands
are gathered at one place?

39
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,780
Yes, we have all kinds of brands.

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,630
Look, this bag is so beautiful.

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,710
Have a look.

42
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
How great.

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,579
Impressive.

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,720
Have a look.

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,740
Do you have all the luxury brands here?

46
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,740
Basically, yes.

47
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,070
Great.

48
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,080
This colour is my favorite.

49
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,620
-Is that so?
-Yes.

50
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,970
It suits you, look.

51
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,700
Also, this year, these

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,760
-metal accessories seem to be in trend.
-That's right.

53
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,560
You have this bag as well?

54
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,790
This just came out this year,
and it is a limited edition.

55
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,530
Madam, you know your bags.

56
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,579
This is especially hard to find.

57
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,980
-Is this crocodile skin?
-Yes, that's right.

58
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,490
Simple styles like this one
suit people my age best.

59
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,480
Try holding it.

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,780
-No.
-Go ahead. It is all right.

61
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,160
-I have more than enough bags.
-Leave them all here.

62
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,590
It truly is beautiful.

63
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
Madam, what else do you like?

64
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,590
I'm just browsing.

65
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,560
Madam, I'll get all these for you.

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,530
No. You're kidding me.

67
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,910
Don't do that.

68
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,310
Don't you find it tiring juggling
between streaming

69
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,450
and running a coffee business?

70
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,430
Let me tell you.

71
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,079
Now, a good opportunity to sell
your business finally came by.

72
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,150
Someone is acquiring my coffee?

73
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,250
-Why are you so smart?
-Really?

74
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,790
Let me tell you, it is none other than

75
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,010
the boss of Axis Coffee.

76
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,810
Anyway, I gave it some thought.
It is profitable for us either way.

77
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,800
Mr Bai.

78
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,470
This is Yuan Bao, from our company.

79
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,850
Yuan Bao is an outstanding

80
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,390
and awesome broadcaster.

81
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,130
She is also the inventor
of Bulletproof Coffee.

82
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,140
Go ahead and say hi.

83
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,600
Boss of Axis Coffee, Mr Bai.

84
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,530
Father.

85
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,990
What?

86
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,360
Be careful.

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,030
Thank you.

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,280
All right, thank you.

89
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,760
Ran Ran.

90
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,150
QE, a large-scale mall,

91
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,780
will be yours.

92
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,630
It belongs to my father
and a few uncles of mine.

93
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,490
It does not have much to do with me.

94
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,960
Surely, you'll have a share.

95
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,780
-After all, it is a family business.
-True.

96
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,150
How great.

97
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,040
On my way here, I saw

98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,680
many well-known
brands in the malls.

99
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,750
Yes.

100
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,020
I wonder if you are familiar
with their management?

101
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,530
I basically know all of them.
We would chat sometimes.

102
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Madam, is something the matter?

103
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,170
Actually, it is not a big deal.

104
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,480
I'm just thinking,
if you know them well enough,

105
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,200
perhaps we could work something out

106
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,960
in regards to Yang Yang's business.

107
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,170
I understand, yes.

108
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,300
I'm sure you are aware

109
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,010
that Ouyang is Yang Yang's manager.

110
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,100
Well, I'm unable to help

111
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,909
in terms of Yang Yang's career.

112
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,840
However, as his mother,

113
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,390
I really want to do my best

114
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,010
to help him in other aspects.

115
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,510
Yes, that's right. I understand.

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,380
I'm saying this because
you are not an outsider.

117
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,120
Sometimes, I think to myself,

118
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,420
what if one day

119
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,840
Yang Yang and Ouyang have a fight,

120
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,480
and Ouyang ends up leaving Yang Yang?

121
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,040
Yang Yang and I would be helpless.

122
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,720
I hope you can understand
a mother's concern.

123
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,410
I understand, madam.

124
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,290
Have faith in Ouyang, she won't.

125
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,640
Ouyang won't do that.

126
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,200
Also, madam,

127
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,960
should you ever need my help,

128
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,180
just say so and I'll do my best.

129
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,980
-I'm serious. Don't worry.
-Thank you so much.

130
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,560
Just now, you mentioned business.

131
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,680
I have just the opportunity for you.

132
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,690
Is that so?

133
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,900
Go ahead and tell me.

134
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,550
Madam, there is a brand in China
called Pineapple Xpress.

135
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,960
Their entire design team

136
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,140
is based in Italy right now.

137
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,260
So, the quality of the
outfits are quite good.

138
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,480
Besides, their main target audience is

139
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,750
mostly young ladies.

140
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,360
I think it is quite
suitable for Yang Yang.

141
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,770
Their boss happens
to like him a lot

142
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,040
and wishes to have him
as their spokesperson.

143
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,100
He's approached me

144
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,210
and offered quite attractive terms.

145
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,870
I talked to Yang Yang about it.

146
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,420
And Ouyang, probably thinking
it is a small brand,

147
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,180
turned it down.

148
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,480
Did such a thing happen?

149
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,170
Ouyang never mentioned it before.

150
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
None of us are aware.

151
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,420
Ouyang probably thinks
this brand is too small

152
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,840
to be worth mentioning.

153
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,700
Say...

154
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,650
Nonetheless, as the manager,

155
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,490
she should have at least told us, right?

156
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,530
-True.
-Seriously.

157
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,710
So, since you are familiar
with that enterprise,

158
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,980
can we turn the situation around?

159
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,140
I really am not sure.

160
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,290
I cannot guarantee

161
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,520
because some time ago,

162
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,630
they kept chasing Yang Yang for an answer

163
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,960
but he did not reply.

164
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,710
As you know, they could
not keep chasing either.

165
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,930
Madam, if Yang Yang is interested,

166
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,850
I'm familiar with the boss.

167
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,510
I'll do an introduction
for their partnership.

168
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,190
I don't think it is an issue.

169
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,300
Yes, we are interested.

170
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,050
I can decide for Yang Yang.

171
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,610
However, this Pineapple brand...

172
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,080
Pineapple Xpress.

173
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,929
You do the PR for this
Pineapple Xpress brand.

174
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,340
Sure, I'll do that, madam.

175
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,390
I'm willing to help you.

176
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,380
Great.

177
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,640
Also, I have something to tell you.

178
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,490
If in the future, Chen Lang

179
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,799
talks to you about Yang Yang,

180
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,220
tell him Yang Yang's endorsement matters

181
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,750
are handled by me, Duan Ran.

182
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,910
Because I'm afraid we might
not reach agreement later.

183
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,130
I understand, yes. It's a deal.

184
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,270
-Sure.
-Deal.

185
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,660
I'm so glad, madam.

186
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,090
-Great.
-By the way, madam.

187
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,020
As for all these,

188
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,980
I'll have them brought to your car.

189
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,730
Are all these for me?

190
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,450
It's a pleasure

191
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,880
having you in our mall.

192
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,700
No, I can't.

193
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,890
I don't deserve this.

194
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,300
I can't, it is too much.

195
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,310
Madam,

196
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,480
you will be given VVIP
treatment in future.

197
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,210
Take a look at this.

198
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,410
In that case, thank you.

199
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,580
You are welcome, madam.

200
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,690
Here, let's have a toast
with coffee instead.

201
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,880
Sure, let's.

202
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,420
-Again, thank you.
-No problem.

203
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,540
Thank you, madam.

204
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,620
[Shapowei Art Zone]

205
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,390
Why didn't I know this earlier?

206
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,510
Yuan Bao does not have the characteristics
of a rich man's daughter.

207
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,770
It is understandable.

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,870
No, that's not what I meant.

209
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,340
I mean, after so many years,

210
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,570
why didn't I know the fact
that she is rebellious?

211
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,500
When she rented our house,

212
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,440
I thought she was just a
girl-next-door at most.

213
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,130
Yuan Bao looks adorable.

214
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,600
She may not look like
a rich man's daughter,

215
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,020
but she certainly doesn't look
like a train wreck.

216
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,700
She didn't run away from her home.

217
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,130
She might've had a fight with her family
and moved out, at most.

218
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,000
Look at her and her father.

219
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,790
This father and daughter,

220
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,420
the tense atmosphere between them
as if they will argue anytime.

221
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,800
In my opinion, something
must have happened.

222
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,720
Do you enjoy competing against
your own family?

223
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,230
-No, Father.
-You sold my patented coffee

224
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,130
and even hired a star to endorse it.

225
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,580
I disagree with you.

226
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,310
That coffee is my invention,

227
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,000
my patent,

228
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,090
as well as the result of my labour.

229
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,640
The result of your labour?

230
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,870
You created it when you were
an intern at my company

231
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,160
and lied that it is for
a final year project.

232
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,640
You left after being an intern
for less than two weeks

233
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,500
and came here to be an influencer.

234
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,930
I did not become an influencer.

235
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,730
Let me put it this way.

236
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,110
I did some research.

237
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,590
I think live streaming

238
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,350
has good prospects.

239
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,530
It's most effective

240
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,330
in conveying a user experience.

241
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,690
It is especially suitable for my coffee.

242
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,360
Your coffee?

243
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,870
Bai Si Yu, don't forget.

244
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,610
I only have to file a claim

245
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,630
to take you and your streaming company

246
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,020
to court.

247
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,270
You still dare to stare at me?

248
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,040
Sue me.

249
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,870
Send your daughter to prison
with your own two hands.

250
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,920
You...

251
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,590
No wonder

252
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,140
Yuan Bao took care of
trademark registration and

253
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,940
bulk manufacturing so quickly.

254
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,350
So, it turns out Axis Coffee
is her family business.

255
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,790
Why is her father here?

256
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,520
Since I were little, you've always
made me follow your plans.

257
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,060
I said I didn't want to join the company

258
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,690
but you still told me to study

259
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,190
business, management and whatnot.

260
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,210
I have my own ambition too, okay?

261
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,230
You were always bossing me around.

262
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,400
Anyway, what I'm doing now

263
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,260
is going on a silent protest.

264
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,460
Silent?

265
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,810
Do you think you did not
create a big enough hassle?

266
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,970
Well, I wanted to create a
hit product to prove myself.

267
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,710
It was because you kept
treating me like a child.

268
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,680
In that case,
tell me about your career plans.

269
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,590
He is not here to get her back to
inherit their family business, is he?

270
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,050
He'd better not.

271
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,980
I especially like to watch
Yuan Bao's mukbang shows.

272
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,510
Besides, she's attracted
quite a following.

273
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,130
The three of us should stop guessing.

274
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,020
Let's ask her when she comes out later.

275
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,660
You two are only eating fruits?

276
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,680
That...

277
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,670
Didn't you say you don't want to eat?
Why did you order two servings?

278
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,820
Yuan Bao said, in our
company's nearby area,

279
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,420
this is the only restaurant with good
takeaway. It must be tasty.

280
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,490
This one's for her.

281
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,200
If Yuan Bao leaves with her father later,

282
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,560
this takeaway will be wasted.

283
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,160
It won't be.

284
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,900
I'll eat it if she doesn't.

285
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,840
I'll bring it home and
microwave it for dinner.

286
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,460
Xi Xi, you are truly the

287
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,730
most frugal CEO I have ever seen.

288
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,720
It is a good habit.

289
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,950
Anyway, I really hope

290
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,240
Yuan Bao will make it through this time.

291
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,170
It is not easy to be the
child of rich people.

292
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,540
Listen to you.

293
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,900
So, it is easy to be
a poor family's daughter

294
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,050
who eats reheated
takeaway food as dinner?

295
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,440
Back up.

296
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,420
What's wrong with that?

297
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,400
Anyway, for the past few years,
I have been living as if

298
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,790
I have no father.

299
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,200
He neither did his duty as a father

300
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,840
nor gave me the opportunity to
be a filial daughter.

301
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,370
It saved us a lot of trouble.

302
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,390
Xi Xi,

303
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,690
I didn't know your father is still alive.

304
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,860
Him?

305
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,740
Whether he is alive or not
makes no difference to me.

306
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,540
I'm more willing to treat
Duan Ran's parents well.

307
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,010
You mean treating your in-laws well.

308
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,500
What are you talking about?

309
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,330
They finally came out.

310
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,160
That was quick.

311
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,500
Mr Bai!

312
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,680
Mr Bai, leaving already?

313
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,330
Ms Qian,
we borrowed your office for so long.

314
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,250
Sorry.

315
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,460
Not at all.

316
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,590
You can use it anytime.

317
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,770
Come to our office again next time.

318
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,690
This way, you can meet Yuan Bao

319
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,010
and I can properly introduce

320
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,740
our businesses to you.

321
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,590
You kids are still young.
You can go for it.

322
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,030
Who knows, you might achieve something.

323
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,400
Please look after her from now on.

324
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,760
Yuan Bao is outstanding as she is.

325
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,460
Also, don't worry. I'll take care of her.

326
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,240
All right, I'll get going.

327
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,470
Mr Bai, visit our office again anytime.

328
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,710
Yuan Bao,

329
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,620
I bought your favorite takeaway.

330
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,850
Xi Xi, I'm sorry.

331
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,550
The name and recipe
of the bulletproof coffee

332
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,960
were both registered when
I was an intern at Axis Coffee.

333
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,930
They're considered Axis' patent.

334
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,160
Don't worry.

335
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,040
Axis Coffee is your family business.

336
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,580
We will sign a new contract
with them, don't worry.

337
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,720
My father disagreed.

338
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,700
He said he wants to teach me a lesson.

339
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,070
He said, in future, before I do anything,

340
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,410
I must think carefully.

341
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,930
Then it can't be helped.

342
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,110
This also taught us a lesson.

343
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,880
In the future, we must do due diligence
before acquiring a brand.

344
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,110
Did you hear me?

345
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,720
Don't worry, Yuan Bao.

346
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,420
We can still sell other products
if we can't sell coffee.

347
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,580
As long as you are still with our company.

348
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,770
I talked to my father.

349
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,950
Both of us discussed it.

350
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,860
I'll remain with the company,
doing live streams

351
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,890
while feeling my way through
this e-commerce thing.

352
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,040
Feel your way?

353
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,180
Feel my way.

354
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,050
Why did you leave Axis Coffee

355
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,760
and start your own business?

356
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,089
My father and I are too different.

357
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,440
Mr Duan, am I right?

358
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,290
People their age prefer

359
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,829
a more old-fashioned

360
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,930
work style.

361
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,950
However, for me,

362
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,140
what I want to create are products
for youngsters

363
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,900
with its own marketing strategy.

364
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,400
It is too tiring to stay at home.

365
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,069
Which is why I might as well
start my own business.

366
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,470
It is much easier, right?

367
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,180
I did not know

368
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,910
that we are the same type of people.

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,950
We are a bunch of
youngsters who work hard,

370
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,770
chasing after our dreams.

371
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,480
For the sake of our ambitions,

372
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,580
we refused mediocrity

373
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,980
and cast away our silver spoons.

374
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,660
With steely determination,

375
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,990
we forge our own path.

376
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,560
It is not easy.

377
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,950
I agree.

378
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,150
It is not easy at all.

379
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,890
Duan Ran, try feeling your neck.

380
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,000
Does the back of your neck hurt?

381
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,330
Why would my neck hurt?

382
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,420
Flattering yourself like this,

383
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,700
don't you feel bad at all?

384
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,330
Did I say anything wrong?

385
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,910
Tell you what, I have not told you
about the good news yet.

386
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,780
Go ahead and say it.

387
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,990
Yuan Bao,

388
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,870
it does not matter
that the coffee is lost.

389
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,040
The coffee is gone,
but Pineapple Xpress came.

390
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,730
It is an opportunity for us to
return to our main business, right?

391
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,340
You convinced Jiang Zhe Yang?

392
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,630
To be exact,

393
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,270
I convinced Jiang Zhe Yang's mother.

394
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,070
This deal, I feel,

395
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,700
will be closed

396
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,910
in a few days' time.

397
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,740
Everyone, cheer up.

398
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,800
Wait, Mr Duan.

399
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,690
Did you mean Jiang Zhe Yang?

400
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,710
Jiang Zhe Yang.

401
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,100
Take a deep breath.

402
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,210
Breathe.

403
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,610
Don't get overexcited again.

404
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,970
Wait, what you are saying is,

405
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,550
you convinced his mother?

406
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,780
Gosh, Xi Xi. Being classmates
since primary school, your relationship

407
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,180
is indeed different.
You two are so close.

408
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,180
Don't get overjoyed
or overexcited. Stop.

409
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,200
A few days ago, you hosted that

410
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,690
"Coffee and Class Reunion."

411
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,950
You almost got sued.

412
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,040
This time, it is my personal matter.

413
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,620
That's right, a personal matter.

414
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,730
Yuan Bao, do you know what
"personal matter" refers to?

415
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,610
-What?
-Mr Duan's international love affair.

416
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,060
I prefer the term, "foreign fling".

417
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,080
Did you hear that? Foreign fling.

418
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,510
An ex-girlfriend?

419
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,320
In my struggle to accomplish my dreams,

420
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,650
on my path to greatness,

421
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,400
my ex-girlfriend volunteered

422
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,740
to pull strings for me without hesitation.

423
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,780
Do you think it is easy for me to

424
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,240
be friends with
Jiang Zhe Yang's mother?

425
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,270
No.

426
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,190
It was not easy at all.

427
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,260
You did great.

428
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,260
All right, enough. That will do.

429
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,960
Why must you move back home?

430
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,410
My father told me to. He said

431
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,950
I can work in the company,

432
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,430
but I must move back home.

433
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,820
Seeing me everyday
makes him feel secure.

434
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,110
Aren't you afraid he'll
try to control you again?

435
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,540
I discussed it with him.

436
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,550
He said as long as I move back home,

437
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,550
I can do things according
to my own pace.

438
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,510
I suddenly feel you and
Duan Ran are so alike.

439
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,070
You're both from rich families

440
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,630
and are both outstanding.

441
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,010
I mean, you can choose to

442
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,240
live a very comfortable life,

443
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,760
but instead, chose to

444
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,540
go off the beaten track.

445
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,560
Xi Xi, do you really think

446
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,410
following the mould,

447
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,980
studying MBA abroad

448
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,030
and coming back to
inherit the family business

449
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,590
is that easy?

450
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,110
I've thought about this long ago.

451
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,610
I have my own ambitions

452
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,810
as well as responsibilities.

453
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,080
What I'm able to do now

454
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,100
is to combine them together.

455
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,360
So, you studied food engineering

456
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,940
and taught yourself to invent products

457
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,700
and develop different sales channels?

458
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,930
That's right. This way,

459
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,080
I could improve myself

460
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,170
while adding value to our company.

461
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,170
I'm sure Duan Ran
also thinks the same.

462
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,620
But knowing him,
he'd refuse to admit it.

463
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,630
Let's not talk about Duan Ran.

464
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,190
You are the same.

465
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,780
Me?

466
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,110
-Am I?
-Yes.

467
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,480
Hello, I'm from the movers' company.

468
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,020
Coming! They are finally here.

469
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,970
I did not call the movers.

470
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,340
It was me.

471
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,520
The three of you,

472
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,580
take these boxes, luggage

473
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,470
and packaged items downstairs.

474
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,910
Come on, this way.

475
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,540
Remember to carry this box
when you come upstairs.

476
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,640
Xi Xi,

477
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,060
why are you bringing
the cabinet with you?

478
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,480
I want to clear out all the

479
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,750
unused items in this house.

480
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,430
Why do you want to do that?

481
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,330
Yuan Bao,

482
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,950
when my mother passed away,

483
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,040
I was adopted by Duan Ran's family.

484
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,290
Before I knew it, ten-odd years
have passed.

485
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,570
Now that I'm an earning adult

486
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,140
with my own job,

487
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,040
I cannot keep staying there.

488
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,690
So you wish to get this place
renovated and move back here?

489
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,000
I have not thought about it yet.

490
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,280
Sure.

491
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,360
Yuan Bao, come over.

492
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,390
Take a look at this painting.

493
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,100
My mother lied to me
when I was little,

494
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,900
telling me once I grow to 140 cm tall,

495
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,880
to this height,
my father will come home.

496
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,020
Since then,

497
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,400
Duan Ran and I have been
comparing heights.

[Qian Xi Xi, why do you stop growing]

-[at 125 cm?]
-[Says who?]

[Now, I'm drinking
so much milk everyday.]

501
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,050
-[I'll catch up with you sooner or later.]
-[No way.]

502
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,640
[I'm already 137 cm tall.]

503

[You will never catch up with me.]

504
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,510
[Believe it or not,
either way, I'll grow taller]

505
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,690
[and my father will come home.]

506
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,420
Xi Xi, so where is your father?

507
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,570
This is my mother, and that is me.

508
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,010
What about this one?

509
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,490
That is it!

510
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,980
So it fell behind the cabinet.

511
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,220
No wonder I could not find it.

512
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,950
What's wrong with chewing gum?

513
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,650
That's right. This is just
normal chewing gum.

514
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,350
-This...
-Isn't it fun?

515
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,480
-Have you played with this before?
-Yes.

516
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,900
Wasn't this used to scare
people when we were little?

517
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,580
I even used it to scare others once.

518
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,730
No, this is no regular chewing gum,

519
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,430
nor is it a regular gag.

520
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,580
This little cockroach

521
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,790

bullying Duan Ran.

Duan Ran?

523
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,760
Duan Ran was bullied by you?

[After lunch, let's go out]

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,450
[We have to catch them
with our bare hands.]

527
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,950
[Duan Ran, you are so disgusting.]

528
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,020
[You know I'm afraid of insects.]

529

[I'm doing this to help you overcome]

[your fear for insects.]

[How about I treat you
to some chewing gum?]

532
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,150
[That is more like it.]

533
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,720
[This is the last piece. Here, eat it.]

534
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,330
Who knew you were the one who bullied
him, instead of the other way round?

535
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,460
He did always bully me,

536
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,720
but sometimes I get the better of him.

537

No. I have some good

Are you talking about the next
season's endorsement?

You might not know this,

contract with Niu Jun Feng.

Mr Duan, you did not
make an appointment.

got no principles at all?

Mr Wu, what is going on?

559
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Shouldn't you call security on him?

560
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,500
Mr Duan, calm down. Let me explain.

561
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,790
Sit down and talk.

562
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,710
Explain to me.

563
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,580
How are you going to explain?

564
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,300
We agreed to sign a contract
with Jiang Zhe Yang, right?

565
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,710
What is the meaning of all this?

566
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,810
Here is what happened.

567
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,750
At the beginning, we approached him,

568
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,040
but he turned us down.

569
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,350
Our board of directors
had another meeting

570
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,690
and felt Jiang's image
is too internationalised

571
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,140
while we are a local brand.

572
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,720
So, it is better to hire someone

573
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,300
who is more relatable
as our spokesperson.

574
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,180
Are you betraying me?

575
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,440
Of course he is.

576
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,890
You watched me persuade Mrs Jiang everyday

577

while you yourself introduced
another star to Mr Wu?

578

You are a piece of work.

579
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,500
Mr Duan, you were pretty quick
to realise it.

580

When it comes to hindsight,
you take the cake.

00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,320
What invitation is this?

663
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,410
Perfect Blue's inviting you

664
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,830
to their Mid-Autumn Festival celebration.

665
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,380
They said it is held in conjunction with
their late Mr Mu Sr's memorial service.

666
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,580
Didn't you say
you have no time to attend?

667
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,050
How could I forget?

668
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,220
Perfect Blue.

669
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,920
They are looking for a spokesperson.

670
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,320
This deal is ours!

671
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,720
Let's go!

672
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,800
Are you in the office?

673
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,800
Send me Perfect Blue's information

674
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,050
right now.

675
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,570
Perfect Blue?

676
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,530
Wu Zhong Quan is undependable.

677
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,750
Besides, they only have a clothing line.

678
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,160
Perfect Blue has more products.

679
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,300
We will partner with them.

680
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,160
I'm familiar with Mr Mu Jr as well.

681
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,270
Duan Ran, you called
others unreliable just now.

682
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,450
Can you be more reliable yourself?

683
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,620
Now, the company is waiting for
Pineapple Xpress' contract.

684
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,130
And you are telling me that we
are switching to Perfect Blue.

685
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,780
Isn't it already decided? Why are
we suddenly switching partners?

686
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,130
Fine, you want to
switch to Perfect Blue.

687
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,520
When will you close this deal?

688
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,380
Stop worrying over it.

689
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,230
Yu Shi and I are going
to talk to Mr Mu Jr.

690
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,510
Don't worry about the rest,
I'll take care of it.

691
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,170
What is going on?

692
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,949
What is going on?

693
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,469
I have no idea.

694
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,060
Hopefully Perfect Blue's businesses
will be smooth sailing once again

695
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,659
so my late father can rest in peace.

696
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,909
Thank you.

697
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,510
He finished talking. He is done.

698
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,960
I'll go and have a chat with him.

699
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,790
Mr Mu Jr.

700
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,380
You are here.

701
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,950
That was a great speech.

702
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,540
What you said just now

703
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,610
got me emotional.

704
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,590
You know, on every Mid-Autumn Festival,

705
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,270
my dad would celebrate

706
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,110
with all the employees with games.

707
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,070
Hopefully, my father is able to see

708
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,340
what we are doing today from heaven.

709
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,490
All of us miss him so much.

710
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,840
I'm sure he will see it.

711
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,110
In fact, the employees

712
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,750
assume it is just another
Mid-Autumn Festival contest.

713
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,750
They don't even know what my wish is.

714
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,460
You put in so much effort.
Your father must be very proud.

715
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,720
Right, buddy?

716
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,870
Thank you.

717
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,370
Duan Ran,

718
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,590
I know you want something.

719
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,060
Just get to the point.

720
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,920
It's just that I suddenly felt

721
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,070
today is a great opportunity
to talk about this matter.

722
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,990
Look, back when Mr Mu Sr
was still around,

723
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,140
we had a verbal agreement

724
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,060
in front of the old man.

725
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,070
I sent you the contract, remember?

726
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,520
I waited and waited,
yet you never replied.

727
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,650
Just to remind you,

728
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,270
if there are no issues,

729
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,620
we should really get the project moving.

730
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,110
Pineapple Xpress has
turned to e-commerce.

731
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,580
Perfect Blue should not
lag behind in this area.

732
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,310
Also, I have another good news.

733
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,410
I have the famous star, Jiang Zhe Yang,
at my disposal.

734
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,920
If we cooperate,

735
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,330
Jiang will be Perfect Blue's
spokesperson right away.

736
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,550
I heard that discussion
you had with my father.

737
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,530
You did paint

738
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,090
a beautiful picture.

739
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,360
However, it is not a good fit
for Perfect Blue.

740
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,450
Think about it.

741
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,170
We've been competing against
Pineapple Xpress for years,

742
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,300
and we were always suppressed by them.

743
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,000
Besides,

744
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,280
my father spent years

745
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,130
on research and development

746
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,840
before coming up with a clothing line

747
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,700
that's both flattering
and comfortable for women.

748
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,930
But look at Pineapple Xpress.

749
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,310
For the past 20-odd years,

750
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,960
all they did was advertise.

751
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,710
They never put in the effort

752
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,730
to improve their product quality.

753
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,150
Now, you are telling me
they're going into e-commerce.

754
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,450
That is their choice.

755
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,150
It has nothing to do with us.

756
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,840
We will not follow suit.

757
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,330
In my opinion, good product quality

758
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,310
is the best advertisement.

759
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,510
Therefore, that Jiang Zhe Yang
you were talking about,

760
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,070
I don't think we need him.

761
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,190
When you talk about product quality,

762
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,970
-that is of course a good thing.
-That's right.

763
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,620
However, Mr Mu Jr,
times have changed, right?

764
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,560
What era are we in?

765
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,890
The era of influencer economy.

766
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,430
Of social media economy.

767
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,450
-Yes, that's right.
-We'll promote your quality products

768
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,680
directly to people

769
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,080
-who need them most.
-Duan Ran.

770
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,830
I see you as a good friend,

771
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,440
so I invited you over.

772
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,280
Look at this occasion today.

773
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,610
Is this the right time
to be discussing such a thing?

774
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,260
I have many other friends here.

775
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,260
I have neither the time

776
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,640
nor the energy to talk
about this with you.

777
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,070
I understand, sure.

778
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,280
Enjoy yourself.

779
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,860
-We won't bother you.
-Enjoy the moon-viewing.

780
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,120
All right, no problem.

781
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,270
He does not want Jiang
to be his spokesperson?

782
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,860
We are talking about
Jiang Zhe Yang here.

783
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,890
I think

784
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,220
he might have other plans himself.

785
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,290
I have been waiting for so long.
Where did you go?

786
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,310
A friend of mine came. He
scored Jiang Zhe Yang for me.

787
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,980
Come on, cheers.

788
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,060
Let's go.

789
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,910
Let's go.

790
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,120
Mu Mu, you are leaving?

791
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,470
Just now, I gave it
some consideration.

792
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,750
You are right to focus on quality.
No problem with that.

793
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,480
However, I feel that
signing a popular celebrity

794
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,770
does not contradict that. Why?

795
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,190
People have to know your dedication
to quality, don't they?

796
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,420
How will they know?

797
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,840
You cannot rely on word-of-mouth.
That is too slow.

798
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,480
An internet celebrity is the best option,
isn't it?

799
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,280
We'll convert his fans to ours.

800
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,040
That is how you do fan economy.

801
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,010
Understand?

802
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,900
I even thought about
how we will do it.

803
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,140
Get Jiang Zhe Yang

804
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,590
to do an interactive live stream with us.

805
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,390
No one has done this before.
We will be the first.

806
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,800
We will set an example for others.

807
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,910
Which means, we will
monopolise, understand?

808
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,970
Once the ball's in our court,

809
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,480
everything will work out.

810
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,210
Think about it and give me a reply.

811
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,120
Duan Ran,

812
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,430
that's all for today.
Let's talk again another day.

813
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,320
But it's so hard to reach you.

814
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,860
Let me finish what I have to say.

815
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,060
Give me a few minutes.

816
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,380
Once we get this off the ground,

817
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,610
I guarantee you

818
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,760
I'll get it done one month in advance.

819
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,430
I'll put it down in our contract.
What do you say?

820
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,500
Let's go.

821
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,480
Mu Mu.

822
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,450
-Talk to you later.
-Mu Mu.

823
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,250
Let's firm this up right now.

824
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,580
It really cannot wait.
Now is the time to do it.

825
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
-Now is the best chance.
-Don't go!

826
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,800
Mu Mu,

827
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,220
I really want to help.

828
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,180
However, you have to help me too.

829
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,120
I just started my own business.

830
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,610
This project is very important to me.

831
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,860
But believe me, although
I'm just starting out,

832
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,280
what I'm doing is definitely
in Perfect Blue's interest.

833
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,410
It can only be beneficial for you.

834
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,970
We grew up together.

835
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,160
You know you can trust me,

836
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,080
don't you?

837
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,360
Give me a chance.

838
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,460
Just one chance.

839
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,080
Let's cooperate this once.

840
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,500
Give it a shot,

841
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,780
and if there is an issue, you can stop
talking to me in future.

842
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,590
Just give me a chance. Trust me.

843
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,700
My ideas and proposal
will definitely work.

844
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,480
All right?

845
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:13,170
Here is the deal.
Are you sure Jiang Zhe Yang

846
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,190
will be the spokesperson for Perfect Blue?

847
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,610
I got him on board, 100 percent.

848
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,970
Just one word, and he'll be there.

849
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,530
Right. I read the contract
you sent me last time.

850
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,580
-You want a 20 percent cut, right?
-Yes, that's right.

851
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,970
I can only give you 10 percent.

852
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,910
If you think that is okay,

853
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,320
we will sign a new contract later.

854
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,710
Including the rights to live stream

855
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,420
our latest beauty products.

856
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,450
No problem.
Let's make money together.

857
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,220
I, Duan Ran, am willing to
share profits with my buddy.

858
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,930
All right. So it's settled.

859
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,230
Thank you.

860
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,470
Thank you.

861
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,810
Thank you, Mu Mu.

862
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,350
Let's go.

863
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,220
Thank you, Mu Mu.

864
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,650
See you.

865
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,710
We won't have to stand before
another car again.
