[Episode 28]

4
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,840
If, with his help,
you decide to snatch away

5
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,370
Pineapple Xpress' specials
from my company,

6
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,080
I will experience great
losses, isn't that right?

7
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,240
I will be devastated, won't I?

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,820
You already guessed that

9
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,060
I'm actually after Pineapple Xpress?

10
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,720
Jia Yun.

11
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,259
The circle is only this big.

12
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,039
Furthermore,

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,410
I was with Rui for a long time.

14
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:41,200
I know the company inside out.

15
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,960
And I know very well

16
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,240
that you don't have much choice.

17
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,800
In this case,

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,229
would you let me

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
be part of Pineapple Xpress?

20
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,240
With pleasure.

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,570
Since we're talking business,

22
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,350
there are rules to follow.

23
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,320
So we're not going anywhere after all.

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,550
I should be leaving then.

25
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,470
Jia Yun.

26
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,120
Let me finish, okay?

27
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,240
Have patience with me.

28
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,770
Please sit down.

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,780
Look,

30
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,180
Rui is now on the brink of collapse.

31
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,480
Whoever at the helm

32
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,200
could never turn the tide.

33
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,340
My advice is for you

34
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,890
to join us at Cloud.

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,180
Ever wonder why we're called Cloud Live

36
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,520
and not Lang Live? ('Yun' means cloud)

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
We'll make you
our head broadcaster if you join us.

38
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,950
Let's make the company great.

39
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,810
Of course,

40
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,270
if you really wanted

41
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,350
to become the wife of the boss,

42
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,210
I'll agree to it.

43
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,360
All your ideas

44
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,990
are just wishful thinking.

45
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,740
Are they?

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,890
I just want

47
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,660
the best for you.

48
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,530
You know

49
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,280
what's scary about this?

50
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,030
You've been thinking you're doing me good,

51
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,829
but I think otherwise.

52
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,940
Waiter.

53
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,200
He'll pay.

54
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,030
You've really signed it.

55
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,110
Cola was right.

56
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,050
Between hard work and future,

57
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,710
our future is more important.

58
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,090
I say,

59
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,830
we should all go over to Cloud Live.

60
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,620
We can still be together over there.

61
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,230
I'm just saying,

62
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,680
I think

63
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,140
we shouldn't do this to Xi Xi.

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,970
I know I can't.

65
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,350
She was the only one who supported
me when I first started my business.

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,690
If I leave her,

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,940
I'll be someone without a conscience.

68
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,190
Cloud Live promised me

69
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,940
a 30% increment in salary.

70
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,290
This is a golden opportunity for us.

71
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,630
Whether Jia Yun's promise
can be fulfilled or not,

72
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,830
we have no way to know.

73
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,280
We must seize this opportunity.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,400
We've been working
together for a long time.

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,930
I just hope the best for you.

76
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,920
If you've made up your mind,

77
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,620
you can sign your contract here

78
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,820
and I'll submit them.

79
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,370
I'm out. Take this back.

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,820
I'd lose a lot of weight

81
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,610
if I ever go over to Cloud Live.

82
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,440
I'm going.

83
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,900
I'll take it.

84
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,260
I'm going, too.

85
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,320
-Me, too.
-Me, too.

86
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,390
Good.

[Rui Live Broadcaster's
Termination Contract]

88
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,610
You are...

89
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,650
I'm sorry, Ms Zhang.

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,120
We all know

91
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,240
that this is not the best time to leave.

92
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,900
But

93
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,630
we have our futures to think about.

94
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,190
Hope you'll understand.

95
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,440
Thinking for yourselves.

96
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,380
I can understand.

97
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,710
If there's a lack of personal
development and progress,

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,940
there's no growth in the company.

99
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,720
I'll accept your termination contracts.

100
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,620
I hope everyone

101
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,740
would give me some time.

102
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,480
Then we...

[Employee Share Scheme Plan]

104
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,850
Employee share scheme?

105
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,760
Zhang Jia Yun.

106
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,770
Distributing the
holding company's shares

107
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,320
to the founders and employees.

108
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,120
This certainly sounds fantastic,

109
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,440
but whose idea is this?

110
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,770
Please allow me to explain.

111
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,170
The plan is for Rui to purchase
the holding company's shares.

112
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,630
What if we don't agree?

113
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,030
I've always had this idea.

114
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,090
It just that

115
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,950
the current situation doesn't allow it.

116
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,590
I think Rui's biggest
problem all this while,

117
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,480
is that the founders and
employees have no shares.

118
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,820
So the founder has no say.

119
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,710
We couldn't retain good people.

120
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,840
The instability is always causing Rui

121
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,670
to be on the brink of crisis.

122
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,080
My solution

123
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,110
is giving shares to the employees.

124
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,460
I think you better improve your management

125
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,980
before anything else.

126
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,490
Try solving the basic problems.

127
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,650
Don't ever think of
shirking your responsibility.

128
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,790
We'll improve our way of management.

129
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,810
Rui is now rotten to its core

130
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,360
and we must solve its
fundamental problems.

131
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,530
QE Group acquired 80% off Rui's shares

132
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,870
at the most critical moment.

133
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,850
That was simply unreasonable.

134
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,350
Chen Lang left Rui because of this.

135
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,420
Xi Xi and Yuan Yuan, our
two senior broadcasters,

136
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,740
left just like that.

137
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,950
The live streaming
industry is people-oriented.

138
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,190
If we can't even
keep our best employees,

139
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,190
what's the use of a good management?

140
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,910
Zhang Jia Yun.

141
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,770
I really admire

142
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,240
your courage and sense of responsibility.

143
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,530
That's why you were assigned as the CEO.

144
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,500
Yes?

145
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,940
The current crisis is not resolved,

146
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,770
yet you're making a demand.

147
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,880
I'm rejecting your proposal.

148
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,220
We don't have to go to the board.

149
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,950
Further talks are just in vain.

150
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,570
If there's nothing else,

151
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,040
you may leave.

152
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,290
The vinegar meat is Xi Xi's favourite.

153
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,080
It's cooked with the best
ingredients that I bought today.

154
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,390
Cook it for her when she's back.

155
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,400
One day,

156
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,380
Xi Xi and you will get married.

157
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,650
The two of you will have your own place.

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,910
And I'll be alone

159
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,200
in this house.

160
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,000
The dish shall be mine.

161
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,410
I won't cook it for you.

162
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,100
I won't move out

163
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,690
even if I get married.

164
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,180
Yes?

165
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,110
Otherwise, just forget it.

166
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,870
Marriage can wait.

167
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,160
As a man,

168
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,940
career's first, okay?

169
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,360
Don't mention about marriage

170
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,560
until Rui's problem is resolved, okay?

171
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,390
You're right.

172
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,640
Dad.

173
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,400
What do you think

174
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,910
is Rui’s problem now?

175
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,090
You're an employee of Rui,

176
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,160
I want to hear it from you.

177
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,790
I think the problem
lies in people management.

178
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,000
We didn't put

179
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,640
the right person

180
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,930
in the right place.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,980
-I agree.
-We were unable

182
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,610
to retain good people.

183
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,490
This has bothered me for long.

184
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,740
So I recently came up with a way.

185
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,940
Employee shares.

186
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,900
Hasn't Zhang Jia Yun
mentioned it to your Uncle Shen?

187
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,530
You're waiting until
now to tell me about this.

188
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,530
You already knew.

189
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,470
Of course.

190
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,550
Your dad knows everything.

191
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,090
My dad is a shrewd guy.

192
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,970
We can't hide anything from him.

193
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,800
When we have a chat,

194
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,080
all's clear and open.

195
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,990
There'll be no ambiguity.

196
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,820
I think Uncle Shen is a tad too much.

197
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,770
We've spent much time on our plan.

198
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,800
And he rejected us altogether.

199
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,990
Really?

200
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,570
I'll take a look at it.

201
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,710
Sure.

202
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,970
I'll bring it in a moment.

203
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,970
Save it for later.

[Pineapple Xpress]

205
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,690
I bought a skirt from you yesterday.

206
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,150
It didn't fit me

207
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,080
when I tried it on at home.

208
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,860
I want to return it.

209
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,200
Sure, miss.

210
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,500
Can you show me your shopping receipt?

211
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,850
It's RMB2,699.

212
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,700
There seems to be a problem.

213
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,850
This logo

214
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,480
is perhaps different
from the one in our shop.

215
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,990
What's wrong with it?

216
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,480
Didn't I buy it from here?

217
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,290
Didn't you serve me?

218
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,560
-Yes.
-I'm just an ordinary consumer.

219
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

220
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,600
Well,

221
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,900
I know full well about our items.

222
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,020
This logo is quite different from ours.

223
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,300

Miss.

225
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,850
This is a high imitation skirt, right?

226
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,130
What are you talking about?

227
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,740
Ms Zhang.

228
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,750
Mr Mu is in a meeting.

229
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,390
He's really in a meeting.

230
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,370
Why don't you make an appointment?

231
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,770
He wasn't answering my call at all.

232
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,420
I'm sorry, Mr Mu.

233
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,910
I've told her that
you're having a meeting.

234
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,360
Zhang Jia Yun.

235
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,310
Do you remember me?

236
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,850
Yes.

237
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,550
You were with
Jiang Zhe Yang during the live.

238
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,050
I've taken over Qian Xi Xi's job.

239
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm Rui's current CEO.

240
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,600
Isn't Mr Duan Jr taking over?

241
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,230
After our discussion,

242
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,650
perhaps you'll know why
I'm the CEO now.

243
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,190
You may leave us.

244
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,900
I'll have a word with her.

245
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,150
Sure.

246
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,550
Take a look for yourself.

247
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,790
This is the genuine product.

248
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,840
The trademark is this colour.

249
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,350
Let's look at yours

250
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,720
Yours is yellow.

251
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,920
Internally, yours is white.

252
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,270
Whereas the genuine one is black.

253
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,330
And the logo.

254
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,340
The genuine one is made
of multi-layer silk thread.

255
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,950
Yours is single-layer silk thread.

256
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,620
Obviously,

257
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,980
-it's imitation.
-No.

258
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,840
Miss.

259
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,780
What she said is correct.

260
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,120
Please think again.

261
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,960
Who got you the wrong one?

262
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,440
How about you take it home and confirm?

263
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,850
You can come back later.

264
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,450
What's this?

265
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,950
The investigation result on Fei Fei's case

266
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,280
show that she did use
the Perfect Blue product

267
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,010
that caused her to grow a beard.

268
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,710
The authority has done
a test on the product.

269
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,970
The abnormalities found in the test

270
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,820
and those found in her report

271
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,350
are similar.

272
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,980
Anyway, we have submitted
the evidence to the authority.

273
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,690
I guess the authority

274
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,780
is now sampling your
products from various channels.

275
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,380
When the results are out,

276
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,280
you'll know your fate, Mr Mu.

277
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,720
Remember to answer the phone next time.

279
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,600
When I was working at QE,

280
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,000
I used to come to the
milk tea shop and this floor

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,980
to have my meal.

282
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,420
It felt so good.

Yes.

Of course the head.

Who'd eat the tail?

Let's eat the middle.

307
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,800
The middle is too hard.

308
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,940
It's quite big.

Basically we've resolved

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,530
the matter on the Perfect Blue.

312
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,780
And the employee share scheme

00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,460
is almost settled.

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,570
Were the two of you putting up a show?

323
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,020
What a good act.

324
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,050
And what's with the shadow CEO?

325
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,750
Frankly, was it him?

326
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,060
Were you afraid, Duan Ran?

327
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,690
What do you mean?

328
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,040
I was really afraid.

329
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,770
We have to do the right
thing at the right time, right?

330
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,270
That was wise and courageous of me.

331

It was difficult and
Jia Yun was at the forefront.

All eyes were focused on her.

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,610
Are you all right?

342
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,170
I was not bragging.

343
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,810
I did it all for you.

344
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,170
You couldn't handle the stress

345
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,740
and abandoned us.

346
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,420
Now you're going to be
a salesperson at QE mall.

347
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,480
It's my call.

348
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,100
As long as you like it.

349
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,240
I just like it.

350
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,180
Enough, the two of you.

351
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,390
The two of you are now together.

352
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,280
But you didn't even want to tell me.

353
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,900
Qian Xi Xi, I always wished
for you two to date.

354
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,790
And you both got together
without even telling me.

355
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,340
It was all because of you.

356
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,580
Why blame me for that?

357
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,880
-It was you.
-Not me.

358
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,140
She guessed it.

359
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,480
I thought we're best friends.

360
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,360
You didn't tell me such big news.

361
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,990
You should know, Jia Yun.

362
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,830
How could I say anything

363
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,330
at that time?

364
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,450
Am I the first one to know?

365
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,650
Of course.

366
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,530
Keep it a secret.

367
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,690
You're the first one and the only one.

368
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,150
Absolutely.

369
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,200
Hey,

370
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,940
Duan Ran.

371
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,810
Now Xi Xi and you are together.

372
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,620
You need to adhere to our sisterly rules.

373
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,860
What rules are there?

374
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,450
You aren't forcing me to
do something weird, right?

375
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,070
-Are you afraid?
-Yes.

376
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,320
Extremely afraid?

377
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,120
-Extremely afraid.
-It's fine.

378
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,120
Don't be afraid, I'll protect you.

379
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,920
That's enough.

380
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,370
Stop flirting in front of me.

381
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,890
Let go of my hair.

382
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,580
This hairstyle is not bad.

383
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,730
Not too bad.

384
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,430
-Let's have a toast.
-Thanks, Jia Yun.

385
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,580
Thanks, Mr Duan.

386
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
-Let's drink to it.
-Here's for us.

387
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,520
-Thanks, Mr Duan.
-For us.

388
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,680
Okay, thanks.

389
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,250
Here's to our future.

390
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,720
[Hilton]

391
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,780
Is this really our shop?

392
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,530
Aren't you early today?

393
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,510
Boss.

394
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,130
I came here early to clean up the shop.

395
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,530
Not only that.

396
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,420
I think you basically

397
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,980
revamped the whole place.

398
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,650
Do you have
obsessive-compulsive disorder?

399
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,850
The clean up and item placement

400
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,200
is done to enhance
the shopping experience

401
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,470
of our customers.

402
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,700
Every customer

403
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,900
has a psychological demand inside them.

404
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,050
They can now shop easily.

405
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,780
I just knew you're awesome.

406
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,930
Everyone,

407
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,010
at this meeting today,

408
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,390
I have some good news for you.

409
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,160
Yu Shi and Su Su,

410
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,160
Xi Xi and Mr Duan who are still absent,

411
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,910
and I as well, have worked hard

412
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,810
and managed to pull the
company out of the fire.

413
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,390
The authority has now
allowed our operations

414
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,750
to resume.

415
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,090
That's great.

416
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,420
Jia Yun.

417
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,490
Ms Zhang.

418
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,440
It's our responsibility
to help the company.

419
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,880
What about Xi Xi?

420
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,450
Now we're back to normal,

421
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,840
is Xi Xi coming back?

422
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,720
She won't be back soon.

423
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,430
The authority

424
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,070
may have lifted the ban on our company.

425
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,650
But the board

426
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,860
is still holding a few of us
responsible for the problem.

427
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,710
Let's have some patience.

428
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,720
Don't get so dejected.

429
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,550
I have another good news.

430
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,810
I've proposed to the board
the employee share scheme.

431
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,340
It's been approved.

432
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,040
What shares?

433
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,910
-What's that?
-Really?

434
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,570
What is that about? How does it work?

435
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,600
Every employee can
buy the company's shares

436
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,540
with a low price.

437
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,990
In other words,

438
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,900
we have a chance to be
Rui's bosses or shareholders.

439
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,370
Everyone can get a share

440
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,810
on the company's profit.

441
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,120
-That's sounds fantastic.
-We earn from the profit.

442
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,480
How do we buy the shares?

443
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,540
How much?

444
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,990
My effort is not in vain.

445
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,090
Can we make money?

446
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,830
If you sold it for RMB1,

447
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,930
you'll earn a lot.

448
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,130
You're allowed to buy
the company's shares

449
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,110
with a very low price.

450
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,180
Next, our company

451
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,170
is going to hold the
most important sales event.

452
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,120
The Singles' Day is coming.

453
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,360
I hope everyone works hard together

454
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,620
to achieve our goal, okay?

455
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,200
We must do well on the Singles' Day.

456
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,870
I've designed a a lot of clothes.

457
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,630
I'll distribute them to you.

458
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,650
-I've an idea.
-Let me...

459
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,150
One last announcement.

460
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,880
These are the termination
contracts you gave me.

461
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,160
I've been keeping them.

462
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,580
I don't wish anyone of you to leave us.

463
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,030
But

464
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,890
if you insist to go,

465
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,480
-I won't stop you.
-Don't go.

466
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,040
Nobody is leaving.

467
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,330
This is our home.

468
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,660
Where else can we go?

469
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,630
Am I right?

470
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,610
I'm staying anyway. Same to everyone.

471
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,020
Nobody shall leave.

472
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,680
We can't leave.

473
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,020
Why leave when there's money to make?

474
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,730
Jia Yun, about the employee share scheme,

475
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,930
how does it work?

476
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,090
How do I buy?

477
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,240
How much can a person buy?

478
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,980
Yu Shi, tell me more about the shares.

479
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,330
It's easy. You can buy

480
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,500
at the issue price.

481
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,730
It's cheaper than the market price.

482
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,250
Say the market price is RMB1.

483
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,710
You can just buy at RMB0.10.

484
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,230
-Sounds good.
-You can hold it.

485
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,300
You can sell it any time.

486
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,150
You could get several times profit.

487
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,720
Anyway, it's a big profit.

488
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,000
Did you hear that?

489
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,710
Cola.

490
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,600
What's up?

491
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,960
I'm not well.

492
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,520
Thought of leaving early.

493
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,510
Not well?

494
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,220
What's going on?

495
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,210
What's wrong exactly?

496
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,290
I've been sneezing the whole evening.

497
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,970
I'll go back and rest.

498
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,330
You're sneezing.

499
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,180
There are two possibilities

500
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,520
why that is.

501
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,780
Either someone misses you

502
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,370
or someone scolds you.

503
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,670
Guess which one?

504
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,170
I...

505
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,240
Let's have a word.

506
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,400
I'll get straight to the point.

507
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,460
Well,

508
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,180
Chen Lang and I are rivals.

509
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,580
I want to ask you.

510
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,700
Why did you become his informant?

511
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,990
What has he given you?

512
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,850
I don't understand what
you're saying, Mr Duan.

513
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,820
Stop pretending.

514
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,650
Chen Lang and I have always been rivals.

515
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,180
I've been on guard against him.

516
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,870
I've suspected long time ago

517
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,470
that he might have an
informant in the company.

518
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,690
So you're suspecting me?

519
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,160
What should I say?

520
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,520
From the interactive
live streaming then,

521
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,390
till Yuan Yuan's final live,

522
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,920
whenever something happened
at our company,

523
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,940
someone would cause trouble.

524
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,100
When Yuan Yuan left us,

525
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,080
Ouyang introduced me to
some good broadcasters.

526
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,900
The deals were confirmed.

527
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,290
There was suddenly an intervention.

528
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,840
And they went elsewhere.

529
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,490
I was thinking then.

530
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,760
Not many people knew
about the broadcasters.

531
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,240
So I began to suspect

532
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,100
that the informant was within us.

533
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,260
Then the beard incident happened.

534
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,270
I stopped tracking it
and it was never resumed.

535
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,330
And then?

536
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,810
-Then...
-Let me tell you what happened next.

537
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,460
I'm actually entrusted by Mr Duan

538
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,400
to be the temporary CEO.

539
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,070
I was informed all about the informant.

540
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,790
So we both

541
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,550
thought of using my
relationship with Chen Lang

542
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,840
to set up a trap.

543
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,730
I talked to each of you individually.

544
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,850
We talked on Rui's new plan and strategy.

545
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,430
From the information
that Chen Lang obtained,

546
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,330
the informant is revealed.

547
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,030
Now we're ushering

548
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,580
Cola's time.

549
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,800
Pineapple Xpress

550
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,950
is my bargaining chip with Chen Lang.

551
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,600
You must keep this a secret.

552
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,260
Jia Yun.

553
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,010
If you wanted to seize from me

554
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,410
the Pineapple Xpress Special
through him,

555
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,130
don't you think I'll be sad?

556
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
Since you already knew,

557
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,220
why only come to me now?

558
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,990
You have to compliment
Mr Duan for being smart.

559
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,070
Actually, this time,

560
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,870
you did help us.

561
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,370
If you didn’t encourage everyone to leave,

562
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,970
I won't have the excuse to propose

563
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,590
the employee share scheme.

564
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,940
Since you've said these,

565
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,700
I have nothing more to say.

566
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,970
This is nothing more than
the intention to humiliate me

567
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,420
then kick me out, right?

568
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,520
We didn't mean that at all.

569
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,780
I'm talking to you today

570
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,760
just for one thing.

571
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,300
Why did you become Chen Lang informant?

572
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,450
Is this important?

573
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,140
Yes.

574
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,280
I'm just a helpless person.

575
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,970
If I don’t seize the
opportunities that come to me,

576
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,150
I'll always be just an
insignificant broadcaster.

577
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,600
You...

578
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,060
Why do you feel

579
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,680
you're helpless?

580
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,780
We're actually a big family here.

581
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,720
You're one of us.

582
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,530
If you need help,

583
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,340
everyone would have helped

584
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,200
if you just ask.

585
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,350
Also, you're not

586
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,720
an insignificant broadcaster.

587
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,810
You're Cola.

588
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,220
And you're a graduate in performance.

589
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,890
Do you still remember

590
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,640
during the first interview
the things you said?

591
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,950
I

592
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,420
don't resemble anyone.

593
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,340
I don't endorse anything.

594
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,540
I'm just me.

595
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,550
Do you know that I was
moved by your enthusiasm?

596
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,740
You remember the words I said,

597
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,480
but it doesn't mean you know me.

598
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,650
I really don't know you.

599
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,460
In many things,

600
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,300
I have no way to empathize with you.

601
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,830
Because we aren't the same.

602
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,710
We're different individuals.

603
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,570
You think the world is unfair.

604
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,980
But it is not fair to everyone.

605
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,300
You want to get rid of this injustice,

606
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,850
then you have to work harder.

607
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,780
But Cola,

608
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,440
hard work isn't betrayal.

609
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,840
At this point,

610
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,820
there's no turning back for me.

611
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,760
Ke Ke.

612
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,580
I've discussed with Mr Duan.

613
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,610
If you're willing to come back,

614
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,530
we can give you another chance.

615
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,240
If I go over to Chen Lang now,
I'll be a hero.

616
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,820
If I stay with the company,

617
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,430
I'll have to endure a guilty conscience.

618
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,040
You shouldn't think this way.

619
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,150
I've decided, Jia Yun.

620
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,690
Since

621
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,030
you're decided,

622
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,470
there's nothing more for us to say.

623
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,790
Since you want to go,

624
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,560
then we'll let you go.

625
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,690
We won't hold you accountable.

626
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,380
But I hope that after you've gone,

627
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,120
you can really become better.

628
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,380
You must find

629
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,110
your own path.

630
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,120
Okay?

631
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,750
Thanks.

632
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,670
What a pity.

633
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,840
Ke Ke.

634
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,940
Are you really going?

635
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,020
Do you think the employee share scheme

636
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,250
would really help us who's inexperienced

637
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,740
and lack of resources?

638
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,150
You're so naive.

639
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,340
But everyone who signed the termination
agreement then has given up now.

640
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,570
Except you.

641
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,820
Little Duckling.

642
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,580
You need to have a mind of your own.

643
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,300
You shouldn't drift with the tide.

644
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,490
You'll achieve nothing.

645
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,620
Do you realise that?

646
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,740
I...

647
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,850
She's gone after all.

648
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,240
You also guessed it, right?

649
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,550
Forget it.

650
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,300
Now I just want some snacks.

651
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,100
A woman's mind is hard to fathom indeed.

652
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,310
Don't even try to guess it.

653
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,390
Jia Yun.

654
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,120
If you could talk to me nicely,

655
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,650
we can still be friends.

656
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,540
Okay. Let's talk business, Mr Duan.

657
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:11,980
Look.

658
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,440
Now,

659
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:17,909
we're cleared by the authority.

660
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,940
And there's no way for us
to work with Perfect Blue.

661
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,040
So now our company

662
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,400
doesn't have good broadcasters
and brands to work with.

663
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,940
Challenging the sales mission
on the Singles' Day

664
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,320
is almost impossible.

665
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,630
The brands are not a problem.

666
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,370
I'll look them up

667
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,650
and try to negotiate as many as we can.

668
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,620
As for broadcasters, we still have you.

669
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,880
Yuanbao and Little Duckling, too.

670
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,530
They've matured.

671
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,429
They should be okay.

672
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:56,130
Little Duckling hasn't given me

673
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,740
her termination contract.

674
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,130
Will she go with Cola?

675
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,140
She first came here with Cola.

676
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,410
They're close with each other.

677
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,360
If Cola leaves,

678
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,290
Little Duckling may do the same.

679
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,190
Aren't we giving Chen Lang

680
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,120
another capable staff?

681
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,490
I’m sorry,
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

682
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,460
I'm sorry.

683
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,450
Ke Ke.

684
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,830
We both joined the
company on the same day.

685
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,290
Doing live streaming on the same day.

686
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,810
We've gone through all the difficulties.

687
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,920
I don’t want you to go.

688
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,400
I have feelings for you

689
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,200
and this place.

690
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,400
I know.

691
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,470
It's a pity.

692
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,580
We have different thoughts.

693
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,090
I'm just tired.

694
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,850
Here,

695
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,890
I'll always be Yuan Yuan's shadow.

696
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,460
I couldn't get rid of it
when she was here.

697
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,780
Now she's gone.

698
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,960
I don't even know who I am.

699
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,990
I just want to start over at a new place.

700
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,280
You can start over here, too.

701
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,900
Ke Ke.

702
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,000
Did you have an altercation with someone?

703
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,110
Ke Ke.

704
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,270
I want to go with you, too.

705
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,360
However,

706
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,260
Yuanbao, Mr Five,

707
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,730
Xi Xi, Jia Yun,

708
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,410
Mr Duan, Yu Shi and Su Su

709
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,190
are all here.

710
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,910
I can't bear to leave them.

711
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,430
I know it's hard for you.

712
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,930
I won't force you.

713
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,270
If...

714
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,140
If I succeed one day,

715
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,590
I'll surely be there

716
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,390
whenever you need my help.

717
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,900
Recently, my eyelid has been twitching.

718
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,350
It must be a bad omen

719
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,840
Don't be superstitious.

720
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,480
Tell me, only if it's something good.

721
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,680
Zhang Jia Yun.

722
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,530
Is this what you usually
sell through live streaming?

723
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,960
Seems like bad quality stuff.

724
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,420
I bought it from the night market.

725
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,380
These are not man-made snacks

726
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,080
and are purely natural.

727
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,100
I don't care about it.

728
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,920
I just lost my tooth.

729
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,930
What kind of quality is this?

730
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,150
But...

731
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,350
But I also ate it and I was fine.

732
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,260
I'm just saying, Mr Duan.

733
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,510
Don't you think you need more calcium?

734
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,030
A tiny stone breaking the tooth.

735
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,270
Is that possible?

736
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,410
Put it back.

737
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,680
Try this one, miss.

738
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,000
I think this dress is suitable for you.

739
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,730
It's kind of showy.

740
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,300
Not at all.

741
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,940
This is the most popular
polka dot style right now.

742
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,790
Your body proportions are so good.

743
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,420
It'll look good on you.

744
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,010
You'll look wonderful

745
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,610
wearing this skirt with
a pair of casual shoes.

746
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,960
I  think

747
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,290
this is too young for me.

748
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,850
Perhaps my daughter will like it.

749
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,130
-Morning, Mr Duan.
-Morning.

750
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,350
-Hello, Mr Duan.
-Hello.

751
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,390
It looks really nice by matching this way.

752
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,810
-Really?
-This dress

753
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,790
will make your body look just perfect.

754
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,120
Okay, I'll take this one.

755
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,880
-I'm coming.
-Lu Hui.

756
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,740
-Wrap it.
-Sure.

757
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,370
-This way please.
-Okay.

758
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,630
Xi Xi.

759
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,160
-Thanks.
-Enjoy your meal.

760
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,910
Listen here, Duan Ran.

761
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,920
You'll be on a special diet from now on.

762
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,760
I'm expecting a decent meal

763
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,160
but I get porridge instead.

764
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,210
Eat some pickles.

765
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,680
Didn't you lose your tooth?

766
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,170
You can only eat this now.

767
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,780
Go see a dentist the soonest you can.

768
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,110
I don't want to have porridge, too.

769
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,450
I'm not old yet and
you're already giving me

770
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,880
the cold shoulder.

771
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,190
What happens when I get old?

772
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,550
Let me remind you.

773
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,680
Don't eat this.

774
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,930
It's too hard for you.

775
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,760
Xi Xi.

776
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,070
When are you going back to work?

777
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,890
Every morning at 8.30am.

778
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,580
It's always at this time.

779
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,820
I meant Rui.

780
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,430
Rui?

781
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,260
We'll see about it.

782
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,600
Are you thinking of not going back there?

783
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,300
Can't I?

784
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,420
It was you who brought me
into the company.

785
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,760
Now Rui has just lost Perfect Blue.

786
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,690
The Singles' Day is coming soon.

787
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,240
I'm always on the move for business.

788
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,780
I can't do all these alone.

789
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,950
Aren't you working well with Jia Yun?

790
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,390
You found the black sheep.

791
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,930
And you got the approval

792
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,750
for the employee share scheme.

793
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,800
This shows that Jia Yun
can actually help you better.

794
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,140
That's nothing at all.

795
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,640
You were the one who rescued Rui.

796
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,180
You have feelings for Rui.

797
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,290
Let me tell you something.

798
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,590
Today I was so happy in my new job.

799
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,140
I helped picked the clothes
which fit my customers well.

800
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,360
When I saw their smiles and satisfaction,

801
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,110
I think I'm doing something meaningful.

802
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,500
I'm so happy.

803
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,010
I think my mum had the same feelings

804
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,460
when she opened her shop.

805
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,800
Satisfaction.

806
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,560
I also wanted you

807
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,050
to do a meaningful job

808
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,320
and be happy.

809
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,910
But the company needs you now.

810
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,060
I was just ordinary

811
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,420
when I was a broadcaster,

812
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,720
not to mention being a CEO.

813
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,470
I caused the company so much trouble.

814
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,200
Actually, I really think

815
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,690
that Rui doesn't need me.

816
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,370
It's time for me to move on.

817
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,520
Look at this, Duan Ran.

818
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,320
This is Fei Fei.

819
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,130
She posted this on Moments.

820
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,780
Look at her happy smile.

821
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,400
I'll give her a 'Like'.
