[Episode 4]

4
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,050
What happened in Sanya
is definitely not a coincidence.

5
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,190
Chen Lang has been planning this
for a long time.

6
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,380
Didn't Duan Ran push him too hard?

7
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,390
What does it have to do with me?

8
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,590
I went to your office
to ask you out for lunch.

9
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,090
But he told me to check out the company.

10
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,200
So I did for a while.
What does it have to do with me?

11
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Then why did it happen when you came?

12
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,539
It never happened before.

13
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:42,860
Who knows?

14
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,120
Regarding Sanya,

15
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,870
what Chen Lang did was a red herring.

16
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,680
Red herring?

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,140
So you mean,

18
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,550
him threatening you

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,789
and naming the conditions were fake?

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,020
It's called a feint shot.

21
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,690
He diverted our attention

22
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,150
to Pineapple Xpress' live broadcast

23
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,430
and transferred you to Sanya.

24
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,880
Then he took the opportunity
to take all the broadcasters, employees

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,910
and those clients

26
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,550
to his new place.

27
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,270
It's not surprising
that Chen Lang is ambitious,

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,020
but he's not that capable yet.

29
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,470
I believe

30
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,740
an expert must have given him advice.

31
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,360
I did some secret investigations.

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,020
Chen Lang found new investors.

33
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,890
He established a new company

34
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,690
called Cloud Live behind our back.

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,940
Remember what I told you?

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,510
What is Chen Lang trying to do?

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,960
There's Rui Live, and now Cloud Live,

38
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,240
is he trying to compete with us?

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,220
Is he trying to swallow QE up?

40
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,110
I was tied up all day today.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,890
I didn't even have time
for a toilet break.

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,400
Yuan Yuan,

43
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,530
today is our office's opening day,

44
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,540
but you didn't come.

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,070
You made me look really bad.

46
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,550
Mr Chen, I'm really sorry.

47
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,010
But my hands were full.

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,370
I drank too much just now.
I can't drink any more.

49
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,430
Alright, alright.

50
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,130
In fact, these are not important.

51
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,720
We'll sign the contract sooner or later.

52
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,390
The most important thing

53
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,550
is that you need to return
to our team soon.

54
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,050
Cloud Live needs you.

55
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,610
Yuan Yuan, don't play around with me.

56
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,110
What do you mean?

57
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,960
Mr Chen, I'm doing this for your own good.

58
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,850
If I’m not mistaken,

59
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,709
my termination fee with Rui

60
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,709
should be the highest among others.

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,410
Yuan Yuan,

62
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,920
when we were in Rui,

63
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,500
you were the superstar.

64
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,790
If you don't sign the contract,

65
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,460
I can never be at ease.

66
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,110
Just like what I said,

67
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,490
I'll take care of the money issue.

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
We have investors backing us up now.

69
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,020
It will not be a problem.

70
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,220
You just need to sign this contact.

71
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,390
Speaking of which,
I've brought a pen for you.

72
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,590
Look. It's brand new.

73
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,100
Come on. Just sign it.

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,820
Mr Chen, if you fork out the money for me,

75
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,020
you will only benefit QE and Rui.

76
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,710
My contract will expire
in more than a month.

77
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,320
Be patient.

78
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,290
Why not save some money?

79
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,370
You're indeed a part of our family.

80
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,040
You're taking our side.

81
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,500
Yeah.

82
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,430
That's so kind of you.

83
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Fine. You don't have to sign it now,

84
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,400
but we must make a verbal agreement.

85
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,770
If you terminate your contract with Rui,

86
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,500
you mustn't sign contract
with other companies.

87
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,360
I went through the checklist just now.

88
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,680
Chen Lang terminated
all the live broadcast contracts

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,040
on behalf of Cloud Live

90
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,500
and took all the clients away.

91
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,670
He followed the legal procedure
very diligently,

92
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,190
but he did not take

93
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,170
the equipment and obsolete inventory,

94
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,050
which means

95
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,350
he did not take the asset of Rui Live.

96
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,500
What's the use of this stuff?

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,080
Who else can broadcast live?

98
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,240
Dad, QE

99
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,860
is a major shareholder in Rui,
holding 80 percent of the shares.

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,060
Before Chen Lang makes any decision,

101
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,030
he needs our consent

102
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,610
and approval,

103
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,250
only then can he take action.

104
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,610
Look at what he's done.

105
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,510
Without our knowledge,

106
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,410
he recruited
all the broadcasters and clients.

107
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,650
We must file a lawsuit against him.

108
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,790
A lawsuit will be pointless.

109
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,710
Even if you win,

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,210
it will take several years to execute.

111
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,530
Rui Live is finished,

112
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,730
what's the point of winning the lawsuit?

113
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,490
But we can't just let him off.

114
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,170
Ran Ran,

115
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,700
remember what I told you yesterday?

116
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,750
Forgive and forget.

117
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,480
Before we finalise anything,

118
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,460
we can't act rashly, get it?

119
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,040
Dad, don't be too soft-hearted.

120
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,120
Forgive and forget?

121
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,010
He has gone too far,

122
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,330
how can you forgive him?

123
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,650
Calm down first.

124
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,460
Xi Xi, what's your opinion?

125
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,020
Uncle Duan,

126
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,890
I think threatening you
by cancelling live broadcasting

127
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,300
is his long-time plan.

128
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,720
Otherwise, he wouldn't act so quickly.

129
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,520
He had been planning
for such a long time,

130
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,710
yet he only took action
after Duan Ran showed up.

131
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,700
No, I mean,

132
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,330
Chen Lang might've thought

133
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,060
that he was about
to lose his position in Rui Live,

134
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,760
that's why he had no choice
but to find another way out.

135
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,250
Ran Ran,
I think Xi Xi’s analysis is correct.

136
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,580
You have been very obtrusive.

137
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,830
In addition to our relationship

138
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,290
and our status,

139
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,909
if you make any careless mistake,

140
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:49,250
Chen Lang would misunderstand.

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,430
I swear I wasn't obtrusive.

142
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,770
I went to their company

143
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,550
just to have lunch with Xi Xi.

144
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,440
Right? You saw me too.

145
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,890
I didn't even do anything,

146
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,390
he took me around the company.

147
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,180
When I saw Xi Xi

148
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,000
I sent her home right away.

149
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,680
It can only mean

150
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,920
that he's narrow-minded and short-sighted.

151
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,380
Why would I provoke him?

152
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,580
What does that have to do with me?

153
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,860
No matter what, you triggered him.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,490
How did I trigger him?

155
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,740
Then why today?

156
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,430
Fine, think whatever you want.

157
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,220
Enough.
This is not the time to blame each other.

158
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,890
Business is always

159
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,790
about rationality and reality.

160
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,980
Understand?

161
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,150
If Chen Lang did that
because he had no choice,

162
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,510
that's better.

163
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,059
We can try to persuade him.

164
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,230
He's more familiar
with e-commerce live broadcast after all.

165
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,460
Besides, QE

166
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,340
is now in an important stage
of transformation.

167
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,830
We can't make bricks without straw.

168
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,770
We need someone to do the job.

169
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,820
Without them,

170
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,600
in addition to QE's
current financial status,

171
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,760
eighty percent of the board of directors
will stop investing in Rui.

172
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,330
I'll talk to Chen Lang as soon as I can.

173
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,540
Before it's finalised,

174
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,040
Xi Xi needs to go back to QE.

175
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,920
[Shapower Art Zone. Art, Life, Live]

176
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,020
Little flower, oh, little flower.

177
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,980
Tell me, what kind of person I am?

178
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,400
Am I sentimental

179
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,290
or rational?

180
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,700
Am I pessimistic or optimistic?

181
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,830
Am I conservative

182
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,950
or am I a self-motivated person

183
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,030
who's willing to improve with time?

184
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,850
Stop mumbling.
Hurry up and pack the stuff.

185
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,570
Mr Duan, Xi Xi,

186
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,150
why did you come here?

187
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,070
I came with her,
she said she's going to move.

188
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,680
Move?

189
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,950
Mr Duan said,

190
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,240
before he settles the issue
with Chen Lang,

191
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,570
the company will be closed down
indefinitely.

192
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,380
Pack up your stuff.

193
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,850
Got it.

194
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,150
It means we'll go back to our own home.

195
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,540
As for me, I'll go back to QE

196
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,210
and do my accounts.

197
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,550
Both of you are from QE,
you can still go back to QE.

198
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,740
But what can I do?

199
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,610
Should I go and see Chen Lang?

200
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,910
Chen Lang?

201
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,330
Don't be such a loser.

202
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,960
QE is such a big company,

203
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,980
of course we'll have a job for you.

204
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,650
Come work with me.
You'll have a promising future.

205
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,970
Will you be a sales assistant again?

206
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,090
Pack your stuff.

207
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,420
I don't need this any more. Take it.

208
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,050
It can't fit.

209
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,300
This stuff is too heavy.

210
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,310
What will you do with these documents?

211
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,990
This is all the information of Rui
since the beginning.

212
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,210
Oh, God. Look at your stuff.

213
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,470
Why are you standing there?

214
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,620
Let's go.

215
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,070
Su Su,

216
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,020
do you really want to go to QE?

217
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,060
Yu Shi, what about you?

218
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,930
Do you really wish
to return to that basement in QE,

219
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,660
facing those twenty-year-old accounts
every single day,

220
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,290
reading those balance sheets,
income statements

221
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,220
and flow statements
that you will never understand?

222
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,070
What else can I do?

223
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,340
Duan Ran, what about you?

224
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,440
Uncle Duan has planned everything.

225
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,340
After you go back,
you'll start as a floor manager.

226
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,720
Everyday, you will inspect the stores,
attend morning meeting

227
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,730
cheer them up

228
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,140
and checking hygiene.

229
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,630
Is this what you want?

230
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,040
What are you trying to say?

231
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,440
What I'm trying to say is

232
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,260
here, we can sell
over thousand pieces of clothes

233
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,800
every hour.

234
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,560
If we go back to QE,

235
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,790
I might not even sell a piece in one day.

236
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,630
I get to communicate
with thousands of people over here.

237
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,550
But at QE,

238
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,500
I might not even meet a customer
the entire morning.

239
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,140
In Rui, I'm living a different life,

240
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,570
doing different stuff.

241
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,440
In QE, every day I repeat the things

242
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,900
that I've done yesterday.

243
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,610
One year ago,

244
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,300
I left QE and came to Rui.

245
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,010
I went from offline to online business.

246
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,460
From a traditional retailer,

247
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,320
I made it to the top of e-commerce.

248
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,390
Rui has changed me.

249
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,200
I'm not who I used to be.

250
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,650
I don't want to go back to the past.

251
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,720
I don't want to go back to my old job.

252
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,400
I want to stay in Rui,

253
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,330
I'm going to spend my youth here.

254
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,030
Now that Rui has met a dead end,

255
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,460
you can leave.

256
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,060
You guys will be fine,

257
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,080
but this will be the end of Rui.

258
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,230
If Rui is gone,

259
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,330
everything will be gone.

260
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,510
That's why I need to ask you,

261
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,850
do you wish to go back to QE?

262
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,780
Are you giving up on Rui just like that?

263
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,770
Duan Ran.

264
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,060
I know,

265
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,350
the life or death of Rui

266
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,190
doesn't mean a thing to you.

267
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,070
But based on what I know about you,

268
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,430
QE can never fulfil your desire

269
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,010
and your ambition.

270
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,030
Rui can showcase your talent and ambition.

271
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,030
It can give you everything you want.

272
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,170
Rui is a place
where you can live up to your ideals.

273
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,680
Do you work in Rui?

274
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,870
Yes.

275
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,500
Where's your boss?

276
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,560
-Who is this?
-Boss?

277
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,710
He might not be the boss any more.

278
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,300
What do you mean?

279
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,990
I have no idea.

280
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,730
I work in Rui. What's the matter?

281
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,980
Finally I found you!

282
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,590
Your company has owed me rent
for over a month.

283
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,160
What on earth is happening?

284
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,220
I called your contact person
but he never answered!

285
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,320
Wait, ma'am.

286
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,260
What is happening, Yu Shi?

287
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,120
What's with the one month's rent?

288
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,320
Didn't Chen Lang say
he wanted to change the address?

289
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,170
So he took his sweet time
and hadn't renewed the contract.

290
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,170
That's why the rent has been on hold.

291
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,970
Why didn't you say anything?

292
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,360
Ma'am, listen.

293
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,650
Right now, our company
is facing some difficulties...

294
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,280
I don't care what happened to you,

295
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,900
you have to pay if you want to rent it.

296
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,870
We will rent it!

297
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,320
We'll renew the contract.

298
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,640
Pay me if you want to rent it.

299
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,840
-Otherwise, pay what you owe me.
-We'll definitely pay you the rent.

300
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,080
This is the case. I hope you understand.

301
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,480
Our company is having some issues,

302
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,740
just give me some time.

303
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,810
I'll pay you within a week, okay?

304
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,150
You're the landlord, aren't you?

305
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,030
I am.

306
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,100
You do give off a different aura.

307
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,470
Tell me what you need.
They can't do anything.

308
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,700
Who are you?

309
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,120
It doesn't matter.
I can take care of this.

310
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,380
I come here to ask for the rent.

311
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,450
You want the rent, right?

312
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,180
No problem. It's a small issue.

313
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,630
Why don't we go upstairs and talk?

314
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,390
It's too hot here, okay?

315
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,670
Do you need any drink?

316
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,910
Let's talk upstairs.

317
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,670
Oh, dear.
You've owed over a month of rent.

318
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,850
You haven't even paid me yet.

319
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,260
Yes, you're right. We're wrong.

320
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,530
After I go back, I'll take care of them.

321
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,950
Didn't even answer his call.

322
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,630
Come on.
I've never seen this kind of company!

323
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,680
Yu Shi, Su Su,

324
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,450
give me another chance.

325
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,970
I'm going to fulfil a promise that I made.

326
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,670
Wait for me.

327
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,160
It's too heavy.

328
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,570
Hurry up, Yu Shi. This is very heavy.

329
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,960
Duan, Duan.

330
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,330
How could Chen Lang do that?

331
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,960
He founded Rui.

332
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,380
Even a vicious tiger
will not eat its cubs.

333
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,470
Chen Lang is very ambitious.

334
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,510
-Back then, I underestimated him.
-Back then.

335
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,050
Back then we invested in Rui

336
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,319
because the growth of a physical mall
had stagnated.

337
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,910
We also missed
the golden period of e-commerce.

338
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,690
That's why we tried
e-commerce live broadcasting.

339
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,890
It's been over a year,

340
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,069
QE never stopped injecting money into it.

341
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,010
And now Rui has been drained.

342
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,530
We should cut the loss now.

343
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,660
Shen,

344
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,970
are you planning to sell Rui?

345
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,540
I'm not the only who want to do this.

346
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,530
I think

347
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,920
all shareholders do not wish
to waste their money any more.

348
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,600
If we give up on Rui,

349
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,500
this means

350
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,410
we will completely give up
our entire online business.

351
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,960
This isn't just about cutting loss,

352
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,320
it is about strategic retreat.

353
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,240
Shen,

354
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,680
we need to think carefully.

355
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,030
Go on.

356
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,400
Over there, over there.

357
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,330
-Right there.
-Yes, come forward.

358
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,870
Okay.

359
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,020
[Duan Sheng Yun]

360
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,170
If you have work to do in the office,

361
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,330
don't waste your time with me here.

362
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,010
Why do I think

363
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,600
grabbing dolls with you here

364
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,220
is more important?

365
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,880
Chen Lang, oh, Chen Lang,

366
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,800
when will you ever tell me
what you really think?

367
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,650
If staying here with me is important,

368
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,270
I'm sure you're not here
to grab dolls with me.

369
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,990
You have another intention, right?

370
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,980
Jia Yun, oh, Jia Yun.

371
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,840
You always seem so carefree

372
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,250
and goof around,

373
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,850
but you know me best since I was a kid.

374
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,990
Tell me. What brings you here?

375
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,350
Fine.

376
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,450
I watched the live broadcast
of Pineapple Xpress.

377
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,500
Your live broadcast

378
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,630
for those three Nishiyama Yohji
limited edition items had a great result.

379
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,230
Qian Xi Xi hired you, didn't she?

380
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,020
I was just doing Xi Xi a favour.

381
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,850
I heard, that day,

382
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,400
you transferred all the employees
to Sanya.

383
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,920
I transferred them to Sanya

384
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,590
for business purpose.

385
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,570
What should I tell you?

386
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,400
You don't have to tell me.

387
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,760
Whether you're forcing my confession,
betrayed them,

388
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,510
trying to uphold justice
or resist oppression,

389
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,240
they have nothing to do with me.

390
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,240
Good job!

391
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,530
Jia Yun.

392
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,690
You're great at live broadcasting.

393
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,150
It's such a waste
that you don't do it any more.

394
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,020
Besides, this is what I do.

395
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,820
I can't bear seeing such a great gemstone
around me

396
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,270
not getting polished.

397
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,980
So, are you trying to polish me?

398
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,650
Zhang Jia Yun.

399
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,640
Cloud Live.

400
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,670
Isn't it a great coincidence that my
company's name is similar to yours?

401
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,340
Stop flattering me.

402
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,390
I'll be honest with you.

403
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,360
Xi Xi talked to me way before you,

404
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,960
and not only once.

405
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,560
I've rejected her,

406
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,650
do you think I'll accept your offer?

407
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,240
You're very close with Xi Xi,

408
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,690
yet you rejected her.

409
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,350
I'll be even more hopeless.

410
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,250
You're amazing!

411
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,690
Genius!

412
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,540
Ma'am, how many cubes of sugar
do you usually add to your coffee?

413
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,950
Two cubes.

414
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,400
Two cubes.

415
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,780
Let's just add one cube today.

416
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,770
Too much sugar is bad for health.

417
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,380
Try this coffee
with only one cube of sugar.

418
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,900
Please don't be angry.

419
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,200
As long as I'm here,
you will definitely get your rent.

420
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,700
But please give us a few days' time,
will you?

421
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,690
I happen to have

422
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,110
a QE membership card with me now.

423
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,380
With this card,

424
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,980
you can get 25 percent discount
in all the stores in QE.

425
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,260
Look.

426
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,630
Are you sure?

427
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,690
Of course.

428
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,010
Our company

429
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,730
is a subsidiary of QE.

430
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,090
I bet you didn't know.

431
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,100
Fine, I'll wait for another two days.

432
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,420
Thank you.

433
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,350
Don't you stand me up.

434
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,470
I won't. Don't worry, ma'am.

435
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,180
Here.

436
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,100
Will you continue renting this place?

437
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,060
I'll discuss with them

438
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,680
and give you the answer
within two days, okay?

439
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,970
Thank you.

440
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,050
Yu Shi.

441
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,170
Where's Qian Xi Xi?

442
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,670
She's gone to Pineapple Xpress to settle

443
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,010
the final payment
for the last special session with Mr Wu.

444
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,410
Why does she have
to ask for the payment herself?

445
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,480
Shouldn't they transfer the money
when it's time?

446
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,240
I think she promised Mr Wu something,

447
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,900
I guess she's going there
to fulfil her promise.

448
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,010
Why is she still doing this?

449
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,850
Mr Duan, where are you going?

450
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,440
I'll go find Qian Xi Xi.

451
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,420
What should we do?

452
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,470
I have no idea.

453
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,060
Excuse me.

454
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,600
Where is the men's toilet?

455
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,000
Go straight and turn left.

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,020
Thanks.

457
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,190
Qian Xi Xi.

458
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,260
With everything that happened,

459
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,190
why are you still cleaning toilet?

460
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,220
I honour my bet.

461
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,460
Since I've promised Mr Wu,

462
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,370
I'll do what I'm supposed to do.

463
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,390
You talked big to me this morning,

464
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,930
but now you're cleaning toilets.

465
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,510
-Does this make any sense?
-Let me brush it. Let go!

466
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,400
-Let go of it.
-Let go!

467
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,950
Listen. These are two different things.

468
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,700
This is not a good timing.

469
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,120
Yu Shi and Su Su are waiting for you
in the office,

470
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,220
not knowing what to do.

471
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,710
And we don't know what will happen to Rui.

472
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,000
Stop cleaning it!

473
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
Does cleaning it now make any sense?

474
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,910
It does.

475
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,210
-I said, it makes sense.
-Stop it.

476
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,220
Listen. I'll tell you what I think.

477
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,210
-I, I...
-You're frustrating me.

478
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,560
I don't think Rui will end just like this!

479
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,190
What. What are you guys doing here?

480
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,750
I was cleaning the toilet.

481
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,180
Should I excuse myself?

482
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,760
No. There's no need.

483
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,380
Are Su Su and Yu Shi
waiting for me in the office?

484
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,270
They're waiting for you.
I was dealing with the landlord,

485
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,460
but then you disappeared.

486
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,990
-How could you clean toilets here?
-This is quite comfortable.

487
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,340
Mr Chen.

488
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,290
I am Mr Duan's secretary.

489
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,250
Mr Duan asked me to pick you up
because he has something to say.

490
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,890
Now?

491
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,210
I'm really sorry. You must be tired.

492
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,630
I didn't know that you'd really come here.

493
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,390
That was nothing.

494
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,030
Keeping promises is the most
important thing in business.

495
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,560
Speaking of keeping promise,

496
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,240
I have to thank you.

497
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,950
What for?

498
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,950
I promised that I'd achieve 5.2 million,

499
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,200
but I only got 5.09 million.

500
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,150
I'll be honest with you.

501
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,470
Our expected sales was 3.2 million,

502
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,870
not 5.2 million.

503
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,770
I told you
that you didn't have to clean toilets,

504
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,310
but you didn't trust me.

505
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,200
But, Mr Wu,

506
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,700
it's wrong for you to do that.

507
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,550
You set me up.

508
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,270
I was motivating you.

509
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,940
How else can you sell so well?

510
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,700
Thank you.

511
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:57,810
This time,

512
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,280
Chen Lang was trying to lure us
from our position,

513
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,080
he wanted to give up our session.

514
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,070
If it weren't for you,
I would've been doomed.

515
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,690
Mr Chen, please.

516
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,530
Mr Chen, this way please.

517
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,520
[Chen Lang,]

518
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,940
[our cooperation with the clients]

519
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,000
[should not be affected
by internal company affairs.]

520
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,480
-[This is basic.]
-Mr Chen.

521
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,720
That is Mr Shen's office.

522
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,540
Mr Duan's office is right here.

523
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,390
-[Fishing in troubled waters is shameful.]
-This way, please.

524
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,250
[Duan Sheng Yun,
what do you have up your sleeve?]

525
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,610
[You said you wanted to take control,]

526
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,850
[but it's not up to me to decide.]

527
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,380
[It has to be discussed
in the board meeting.]

528
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,970
Mr Chen, this way please.

529
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,140
[You're an experienced old fox.]

530
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,920
Mr Duan is waiting for you inside.

531
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,940
Mr Duan.

532
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,040
Mr Chen.

533
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,120
What kind of advice
will you give me today?

534
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,880
It's not an advice.

535
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,990
I invited you for a drink.

536
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,240
Take a seat.

537
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,060
It wasn't decanted long enough.

538
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,470
It's a little dry.

539
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,470
I don't really drink wine.
So I don't know much about it.

540
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,370
When I was at your age,

541
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,960
I didn't have this as well.

542
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,560
Before I came here,

543
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,800
I had thought it was nice
sitting in my office.

544
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,530
After I got here,

545
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,300
I finally know what real good stuff is.

546
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,200
These are just like floating clouds.

547
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,700
To many people,

548
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,730
the floating clouds you mentioned

549
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,270
are their dream.

550
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,580
People who own it don't care about it.

551
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,640
Those who don't have it
spend their entire lives pursuing it.

552
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,930
You and Duan Ran don't care about it.

553
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,820
But for people like me,

554
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,800
we care about it.

555
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,310
But today I'm moved, Xi Xi.

556
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,510
You still remember
the 110,000 difference.

557
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,230
I really admire you.

558
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,810
Look at you.

559
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,190
You came to me four times
in the beginning

560
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,670
and blocked me in the men's toilet.

561
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,000
Then you told me
about return on investment.

562
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,250
And then, you planned a live broadcast
for Pineapple Xpress.

563
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,080
It was so chaotic,

564
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,900
yet you managed to exceed the task.

565
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,440
You have my respect.

566
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,030
So,

567
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,270
I am really confident
in your future career planning

568
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,590
and development.

569
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,400
There's nothing much I need to say.

570
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,720
Next time, when I have the opportunity,

571
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,780
I will repay you.

572
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,370
And Zhang Jia Yun.

573
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,960
She sold all the Nishiyama Yohji
collaboration products.

574
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,720
The bosses laughed from ear to ear.

575
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,320
It's such a waste
that she's not a broadcaster.

576
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,310
How about this?

577
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,380
Pay us the amount

578
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,800
according to the ratio of completed task.

579
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,940
That's not possible,

580
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,220
we signed the contract already.

581
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,800
How can we change it as we please?

582
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,220
Then what's the point
of signing a contract?

583
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,590
Why are you laughing?

584
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,400
No, Mr Wu is a businessman.

585
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,730
I can't make it up for you this time,

586
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,790
but

587
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,650
you have to revive Rui Live now

588
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,510
so that I can engage you
in other projects.

589
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,120
When I acquired Rui,

590
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,620
I had promised you

591
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,900
that you'll be
the leader and decision maker.

592
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,360
It has never changed.

593
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,510
Hence,

594
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,060
when you set conditions with me in Sanya,

595
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,260
I agreed without hesitation

596
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,630
to let you reclaim the shares
at the original price

597
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,170
and Duan Ran will not interfere
in any affairs concerning Rui.

598
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,190
Right now,

599
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,140
the biggest concession we can make

600
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,200
is to increase your shares to 49 percent.

601
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,030
This means
QE is no longer the largest shareholder.

602
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,240
It will give you greater power.

603
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,890
Mr Duan.

604
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,950
No matter what,

605
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,410
I'm still very grateful

606
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,750
that you rescued Rui from despair.

607
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,860
But I've decided

608
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,960
to go on a separate path from QE.

609
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,300
Got it.

610
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,040
Come.

611
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,580
That's great.

612
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,150
All good things must come to an end.

613
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,290
Chen Lang,

614
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,820
you will be a successful businessman,

615
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,900
but you might not be the best one.

616
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,190
One day, you'll know what I mean.

617
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,690
Mr Duan, I'm very thankful

618
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,110
for your invitation today

619
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,310
and having this conversation with you.

620
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,820
Chen Lang is really calculative.

621
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,710
He even skimped on rent.

622
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,639
He had been using free office
for such a long time,

623
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,750
and now we have to clean up his mess.

624
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,210
He's really calculating.

625
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,380
He took everything that he could,

626
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,510
including broadcasters and clients.

627
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,520
Things that he couldn't take
were like equipment and stock.

628
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,180
But we can't do anything
without broadcasters.

629
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,300
After all that he has done,

630
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,950
he dares say that Rui is like his own son.

631
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,720
Who would do this to their own son?

632
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,610
I think he doesn't care about Rui

633
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,580
as much as you do.

634
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,410
Do you know how I got into Rui?

635
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,670
Do you want to know?

636
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,560
How did you get in?

637
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,800
Back then,

638
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,880
Uncle Duan wanted

639
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,950
to buy 80 percent of Chen Lang's shares.

640
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,620
A majority of the board of directors in QE

641
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,220
were against this idea.

642
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,760
I was really curious. I was thinking

643
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,060
how Uncle Dan could be so sure

644
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,730
that Rui had a bright future.

645
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,970
I resigned as the floor manager of QE

646
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,560
and interviewed
for a broadcaster position in Rui.

647
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,550
The price you paid for your curiosity
is quite high.

648
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,600
I think I'm doing fine.

649
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,430
When I went for the interview,

650
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,290
an accident occured.

651
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,220
What happened?

652
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,570
I almost caused that accident to happen.

653
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,960
Tell me quick.

654
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,310
This is the story.

655
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,240
The first time I went to Rui
for an interview,

656
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,780
it was really crowded.

657
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,410
It was full of people.

658
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,530
Rui was a big company,

659
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,990
so many young girls went there.

660
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,010
[I waited for so long.]

661
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,130
Now, Yuan Yuan will introduce to you...

662
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,370
They have all kinds of clothes.

663
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,510
It is made of PU material.

664
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,920
A beautiful pair of shorts

665
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,250
with A-line high waist.

666
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,020
The high waist design
can modify your figure.

667
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,520
Check out the deep V shirt

668
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,980
that I'm wearing now.

669
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,050
It's a short sleeve white shirt.

670
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,160
It's really beautiful. It actually has

671
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,110
two button which secure
the shirt. So girls,

672
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,290
don't worry about it opening up.

673
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,730
Then, there's a black camisole
inside the shirt.

674
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,460
I will give this camisole
to you for free.

675
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:09,140
This white shirt costs only 238 yuan.

676
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,530
This is a very good deal.

677
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,850
It is a two-piece set.

678
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,990
So girls, wait for me.

679
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,120
I'll get changed now

680
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,510
and I'll come back to you

681
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,660
with some cute clothes.

682
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,060
Wait for me.

683
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,510
She's amazing.

684
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,990
What are you doing here?
Hurry up and entertain the viewers.

685
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,380
Why did you push me?

686
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,050
Speak, speak.

687
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,490
No, it's live broadcast.
You're on live. Speak!

688
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,420
It's live.

689
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,000
You're on live!

690
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,270
Why am I in there?

691
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,910
It's live. Say something.

692
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,540
What should I say?

693
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,560
Your dress. Show them!

694
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,030
Is this an interview?

695
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,390
It's live!

696
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,380
Your dress! Dress!

697
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,400
Speak, speak.

698
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,000
Whether you're from the South, North,

699
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,350
Xiamen or even Gulangyu,

700
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,100
you mustn't miss this chance.

701
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,350
It's now or never!

702
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,730
-Is this okay?
-Okay.

703
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,390
It's okay.

704
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,850
What okay?

705
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,530
Go on, keep talking.

706
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,290
What? The dress?

707
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,070
Hold on a second.

708
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,470
Alright, hurry up.

709
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,950
Rui is a popular brand,

710
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,200
so don't be afraid to tear it hard.

711
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,690
Look at this material.
It's very stretchy.

712
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,160
It stays in shape
no matter how you pull it.

713
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,530
You'll have an s-curve if you put it on.

714
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,040
Don't hesitate, don't tremble.

715
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,710
If you want it,
just listen to your heart.

716
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,910
Don't think about it.

717
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,130
Our clothes are simply the best.

718
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,260
They said I'm cute.

719
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,040
And I'm not bad.

720
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,930
Go on. Introduce it.

721
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,950
It doesn't matter what I say,

722
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,370
because you're the one with great taste.

723
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,260
Pull it here, pull it there,

724
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,090
Rui has the best clothing!

725
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,860
Does it make you feel hot?

726
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,090
What's wrong? Who is this?

727
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,470
Of course not.
It's cooling if you put it on.

728
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,700
Check out its material.

729
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,980
Do you know what it is?

730
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,960
It's 100 percent high quality cotton.

731
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,620
It's breathable and stylish.

732
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,240
Even if you rub it, it won't be torn.

733
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,470
The price?

734
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,460
I knew you'd ask me about the price.

735
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,350
With this quality and workmanship,

736
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,950
it must be expensive, right?

737
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,050
You'll max out your credit card, right?

738
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,550
But I'm telling you today,

739
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,530
you won't.

740
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,150
That's because, here in Rui,

741
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,880
we advocate is small profits
but quick turnover.

742
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,040
Let me show you another dress.

743
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,280
Look at the elegant style.

744
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,010
Judging from the workmanship and design,

745
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,440
[it should cost at least 3,000
to 4,000 yuan in the store, right?

746
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,630
But today, I'm telling you,

747
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,210
it's neither 3,000 nor 4,000.

748
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,930
It's neither 1,999

749
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,890
nor 999!

750
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,960
It's...

751
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,900
Six hundred.

752
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,790
Sixty.

753
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,920
It's only 60 yuan today.

754
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,160
It's a cut-throat price! This one.

755
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,340
It's only 60 yuan!

756
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,710
Hurry and order it now!

757
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,840
It's not 60 yuan!

758
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,710
Listen.

759
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,070
You've got a good deal today.

760
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,260
It's neither 60

761
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,710
nor 59 yuan.

762
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,820
It's only 50 yuan today!

763
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,230
With only 50 yuan,

764
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,180
you'll get this beautiful dress!

765
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,720
Only 50 yuan.

766
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,230
[I was pushed there all of a sudden.]

767
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,990
I also quoted the wrong price,

768
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:49,730
almost causing a great loss.

769
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,220
Chen Lang is very stingy.

770
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,120
Didn't he get back at you?

771
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,240
Of course he did.

772
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,990
After that happened,

773
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,850
he yelled in the company.

774
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,130
He said,

775
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,860
who hired a night market vendor?

776
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,790
How could you simply hire anyone?

777
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,550
Our company is not a charity.

778
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,530
She quoted the wrong price,

779
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,340
it will cause at least 30 percent
of sales loss

780
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,020
for the rest of the clothes.

781
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,680
Who will make up for this loss?

782
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,280
Anyway, he gave us an earful.

783
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,960
You had caused him such a big loss

784
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,690
but they still hired you.
That's really amazing.

785
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,590
Back then, I thought,

786
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,410
it's over.
I lost my chance in live broadcasting.

787
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,900
And then?

788
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,130
Something fun happened again.

789
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,800
-Something fun again?
-Do you want to know?

790
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,070
I'd love to know.

791
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,410
During the 15 minutes
I was live broadcasting,

792
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,610
my followers increased by 3,000.

793
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,690
Among all the broadcasters in Rui,

794
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,140
this had never happened before.

795
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,150
That was the first time.

796
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,030
What?

797
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,320
So this means he took advantage of you.

798
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,090
You shouldn't say that.

799
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,190
At least,

800
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,140
I think Chen Lang
has a strong vision in this.

801
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,380
Anyway, during the year and a half in Rui,

802
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,210
I had gone through a lot.

803
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,100
I watched it

804
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,730
grow from a little baby

805
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,530
into a teenage.

806
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,290
It might not be mature or the best,

807
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,950
but it was only the beginning.

808
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,190
I can't bear

809
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,130
watching it die before my eyes.

810
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,640
I really just can't accept it.

811
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,530
Don't worry.

812
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,000
While I'm here, this will never happen.

813
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,180
Really?

814
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,810
Yes.

815
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,530
Didn't you say

816
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,520
that Rui can fulfil all my desires?

817
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,450
How can I give up on it?

818
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,760
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

819
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,270
Save the world! Let's go!

820
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,600
Where are you going to save the world?

821
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,480
Right there.

822
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,460
We are brothers for life!

823
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,910
Brothers!

824
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,580
Brothers!

825
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,030
For our whole life!

826
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,760
Save Rui! Save the future of Rui!

827
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,490
Save the world!
