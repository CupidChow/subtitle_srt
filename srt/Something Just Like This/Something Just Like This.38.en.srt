4
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,980
These are sketches from

5
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,850
a genius designer in Europe,

6
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,900
Professor Strange.

7
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,470
Professor Strange graduated

8
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,530
from Central Saint Martins College.

9
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,150
He later founded his own label.

10
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,170
He even stole the spotlight

11
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,670
at Milan Fashion Week this year.

12
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,350
I had a hard time contacting him.

13
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,810
But he is now willing to collaborate
with us.

14
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,300
Do you know the consumer range

15
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,850
of his designs?

16
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,820
Ms Ouyang, the style in Rui
is grassroots oriented and affordable.

17
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,550
I don't think it suits our positioning
right now.

18
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,970
Well, regarding our positioning...

19
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,700
A clear positioning is indeed important.

20
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,050
That, I agree.

21
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,580
But these designs are really good.

22
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,490
They captivate the eyes.

23
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,860
I understand what Director Qian means.

24
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,220
But this is the first time

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,960
Rui is creating its own label.

26
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,449
We shouldn't limit our options too soon.

27
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,650
I engaged Professor Strange

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,910
because of his popularity

29
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,260
and his influence.

30
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,870
Since we're launching a new brand,

31
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,130
he could help us boost sales

32
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,260
and traffic.

33
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,490
That's all.

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,740
What do you think, Mr Duan Jr?

35
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,730
You have a point.

36
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,260
I disagree.

37
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,210
Look at this.

38
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,620
The fabric,

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,950
its tailoring and craftsmanship
are too complicated.

40
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,660
They exceed our budget by a lot.

41
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,150
According to my knowledge of Rui,

42
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,740
we should focus on making a brand

43
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,100
that exudes the strength of our company.

44
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,310
We should go for a mid-range brand
and pursue cost performance.

45
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,370
The budget should be determined

46
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,430
according to the designer's stature.

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,340
No.

48
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,650
I may be different from

49
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,620
those filthy rich bosses you worked with.

50
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,930
But I do know what is right for Rui.

51
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,700
That is just your own preconception.

52
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,300
If we want to create our original label,

53
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,340
we should take the long view

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,940
and think big.

55
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,370
Is there a bigger market out there
for Rui?

56
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,380
What I show you today are just sketches.

57
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,450
There will be further refinements

58
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,260
between the sketch and the final product.

59
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,990
We shouldn't judge them too early.

60
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,890
Moreover, we're building Jiang Zhe Yang's
fashion brand.

61
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,820
Don't these designs suit Jiang Zhe Yang?

62
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,230
Refinements, you say?

63
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,540
That takes time.

64
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,090
We need instant designs.

65
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,150
Didn't your designs undergo revision

66
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,310
before they are produced?

67
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,310
No, we went straight into branding.

68
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,740
That's how we do things here.

69
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,900
You also mentioned Jiang Zhe Yang,
didn't you?

70
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,950
Does Jiang Zhe Yang mean everyone?

71
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,870
What suits him doesn't necessarily
suit everyone.

72
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,870
Aren't we creating a brand

73
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,070
under Jiang Zhe Yang's name?

74
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,370
Shouldn't it match his style?

75
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,350
-That is how we do things.
-Well, these sketches...

76
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,780
And, about Jiang Zhe Yang...

77
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,130
Well, I think regarding this thing
about Jiang Zhe Yang...

78
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,900
I...

79
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,180
I think you both have a point.

80
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,370
But

81
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,900
in our current phase,

82
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,540
we do need a clear positioning.

83
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,180
Once we decide on our positioning,

84
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,180
everything else will follow.

85
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,340
But I do really like these designs.

86
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,540
The designs are really amazing.

87
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,630
I don't rule out the possibility
of using this.

88
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,570
But to Rui at this stage,

89
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,770
the styles are indeed challenging.

90
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,820
But nothing is absolute.

91
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,260
Am I right?

92
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,170
But we do have to solve our disagreements.

93
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,110
So I think we should all go back

94
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,540
and sleep on this.

95
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,540
We'll try to meet halfway

96
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,580
in the best interest of our brand.

97
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,650
What do you think?

98
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,920
We can do that.

99
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,370
Alright.

100
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,860
We'll give this a good thought

101
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,290
and meet next time.

102
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,730
Meeting is dismissed.

103
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,980
Xi Xi.

104
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,050
Wait for me.

105
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,100
That was a company management meeting.

106
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,630
Why did you act up like that?

107
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,570
I did not.

108
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,320
It was obviously her problem.

109
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,830
And you,

110
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,260
you were on the fence the whole time.

111
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,230
What do you mean "on the fence"?

112
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,930
As a company shareholder,

113
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,980
I have to be neutral

114
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,700
during the management meeting.
Am I right?

115
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,820
I have to look at everything
in the interest

116
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,020
of the company.
Don't you think so?

117
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,540
Why are you being so patronising?

118
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,980
What do you mean?

119
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,810
I'm just stating the facts.

120
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,540
Besides, I'll never act

121
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,170
against your wishes.

122
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,590
That person has been helping you
with this and that.

123
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,780
Including renovating the lavatory,
despite my objection.

124
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,380
You'll be ungrateful
if you don't side with her.

125
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,420
You can't see it that way.

126
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,090
As a company leader,

127
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,930
personal feelings cannot
outweigh duty, isn't that right?

128
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,900
Right.

129
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,710
You must remember what I say then.

130
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,940
You must never side with her.

131
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,380
And also her proposal of
that Professor Strange...

132
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,030
They were ugly and expensive.

133
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,190
They were not as good as Mr Five's, right?

134
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,780
Speaking of Mr Five,

135
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,870
why doesn't Ms Ouyang approach her?

136
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,980
She has talent.

137
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,159
Don't you think so?

138
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,060
Talented people are broad-minded.

139
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,050
-Really?
-I am such a person.

140
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,270
That's true.
Talented people are broad-minded.

141
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,740
It does make sense.

142
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,140
That's very philosophical.

143
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,590
You made me angry just now.
You owe me a kiss.

144
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,300
Here's your kiss.

145
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,930
Don't be angry.

146
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,140
-All good?
-All good.

147
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,210
My dear Mr Five.

148
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,100
I really need a favour.

149
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,660
You really need a favour?

150
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,210
Just pour it out.

151
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,150
Well, I'll be going to Shanghai
in two days

152
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,870
for a really important interview.

153
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,650
Last night, I found a skirt
I really want to wear.

154
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,260
But when I tried it on, it didn't fit.

155
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,820
Can you help me?

156
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,660
Sure. I have your measurements.

157
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,010
I'll modify it for you.

158
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,130
But I've been working out
very hard lately.

159
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,540
I think I'm slimmer now.

160
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,300
Can you measure me again?

161
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,760
Alright. Let's go to the workshop
to get your measurements.

162
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,409
-I'll hold it for you.
-I'm good.

163
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,730
Let's go.

164
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,990
Why are you always away
from the workshop these days?

165
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,590
I couldn't find you just now.

166
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,820
I've been busy lately.

167
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,970
Just go to the live stream room
if you're looking for me.

168
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,050
I heard Ms Ouyang is looking
for a designer big time.

169
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,120
Why don't you give it a shot?

170
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,290
I've given up on that.

171
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,900
I think I'm content

172
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,450
helping out the girls

173
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,540
at Cat Street with Mao.

174
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,210
You've given up?

175
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,050
You're content?

176
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,220
Are you sure?

177
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,590
You're content with this?

178
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,900
No, I'm not.

179
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,500
I'm not modifying this for you.

180
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
You can't do that.

181
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,260
You must help me with this.

182
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,460
Let's go.

183
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,030
I've been skipping supper.

184
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,550
My waist is slim now.

185
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,870
You must measure me again.

186
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,570
I'm in really good shape now.

187
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,250
Your delivery is here.

188
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,049
You're too handsome for a delivery guy.

189
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,890
Drink some kumquat lemonade.

190
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,010
Someone is being nice today.

191
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,890
Ms Ouyang, my beautiful manager,

192
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,340
I see you've been working too hard lately.

193
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,570
So I purposely came by

194
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,890
to visit you.

195
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,540
You must be drinking a lot of this.

196
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,420
You're such a smooth-talker now.

197
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,190
Stop making fun of me.

198
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,450
Let's talk about work.

199
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,780
About that Professor Strange...

200
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,530
What did they think about him?

201
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,060
They think he's too expensive.
The proposal is rejected.

202
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,050
I knew it.

203
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,610
So what do you have in mind

204
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,220
for your own private label?

205
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,920
I haven't actually given it

206
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,330
too much thought.

207
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,570
But I know what I don't want.

208
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,570
What is that?

209
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,740
I don't want anything too over the top

210
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,210
or too avant-garde.

211
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,890
Professor Strange's designs

212
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,510
are a little out there.

213
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,500
They're not really for me.

214
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,250
But don't you think

215
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,180
his designs are very chic?

216
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,330
It matches your persona.

217
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,540
But my persona

218
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,300
was set by you.

219
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,940
But you know

220
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,390
I actually don't like to be pretentious.

221
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,570
I actually like it simple,

222
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,940
bold and honest.

223
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,450
Moreover, if you think about it,

224
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,250
his style is different from Rui's.

225
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,540
It's difficult for Rui to collaborate.

226
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,540
Give me a Scotch.

227
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,010
When did you come back?

228
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,810
I've long been back.

229
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,330
I was just too busy to see you.

230
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,220
I thought you wanted to be
a good businessman.

231
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,880
Don't you have work tomorrow?

232
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,870
Why are you still drinking?

233
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,420
I actually didn't want to give you
another chance.

234
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,100
But after some serious thought,

235
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,450
I felt I should see you.

236
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,550
I know the girl you like

237
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,130
is going overseas soon.

238
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,810
So I thought maybe you can still be saved.

239
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,450
Nothing can be hidden from you.

240
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,330
You know everything.

241
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,930
If I only depend on you and Zhu Wan,

242
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,450
I'd be dead by now.

243
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,060
Look at you.

244
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,850
All of this because of a woman?

245
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,130
No wonder she left you.

246
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,770
You said you wanted to destroy Rui.

247
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,210
Do you want to know how?

248
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,010
Private label.

249
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,770
I've suggested to Jia Yun

250
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,900
to create a private label

251
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,180
with their in-house designer, Mr Five.

252
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,330
But they didn't do it.

253
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,770
Now,

254
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,650
I want to do it.

255
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,810
This sounds like a great idea.

256
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
But that's so sly of you.

257
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,900
You gave your competitor ideas

258
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,930
because of a girl you like.

259
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,210
Am I right?

260
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,890
Mr Five.

261
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,420
I'm sorry, Ms Ouyang.

262
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,990
Do you have a power bank?

263
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,480
My phone is out of battery.

264
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,770
Yes, I do.

265
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,210
Sit down.

266
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,870
It's fine.
I'll leave my phone here.

267
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,500
I come back for it later.

268
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,230
Why are you in a hurry?
Just sit down for a while.

269
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,540
I don't want to interrupt your work.

270
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,250
Sit down.
Let's have a chat.

271
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,570
Why do I feel you're avoiding me?

272
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,770
No, it's not that.

273
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,100
I've been wanting to talk to you.

274
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,010
Everybody was talking about
how great you are

275
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,070
for inviting Professor Strange
into the company.

276
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,980
Do you like Professor Strange's designs?

277
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,250
My honest opinion?

278
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,890
Yes, of course.

279
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,120
I don't.

280
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,690
Why?

281
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,770
They're too over the top
and too avant-garde.

282
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,650
The description sounds familiar.

283
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,330
No wonder he wants to
collaborate with you.

284
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,860
I've used her name to register a company.

285
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,100
And now,

286
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,860
I have to use her name
to register a new label.

287
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,620
Does it concern you who I like?

288
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,130
Whoever you like

289
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,060
indeed doesn't concern me.

290
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,210
But I am definitely creating
a private label.

291
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,740
Tell me what you need.

292
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,100
Network, capital and resources.

293
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,890
I can give you anything.

294
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,020
I don't need your network
or your resources.

295
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,770
Just give me money.

296
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,420
Alright.

297
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,740
As long as I can destroy Duan Ran,

298
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,790
I don't mind spending money.

299
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,020
Oh, no.
It's going to spill.

300
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,180
-Here you go.
-What's gotten into you today?

301
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,060
It's all because of you.

302
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,610
What do you think?

303
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,070
Looks delicious.

304
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,420
What congee is this?

305
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,880
Once upon a time, there lived a genius.

306
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,790
He was so poor,

307
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,020
he couldn't afford any food.

308
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,750
One day, he met

309
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,990
a very kind congee seller.

310
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,340
Every day, the seller used his leftovers

311
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,100
to cook a bowl of congee like this one.

312
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,460
The seller fed the genius for free.

313
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
After that, the genius

314
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,310
became the top scholar of the country.

315
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,390
When he returned home,

316
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,990
he visited the congee seller

317
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,810
and was very grateful to the seller.

318
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,810
He gave the congee

319
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,420
a very famous name,

320
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,330
Top Scholar Congee.

321
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,860
-This is the one.
-Alright. I understand now.

322
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,100
You told me this long story

323
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,390
to remind me that
I should be grateful to you

324
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,810
upon my return.

325
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,810
That's right.

326
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,450
If you successfully enter Cambridge,

327
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,830
you'll be above Duan Ran

328
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,250
and Ms Ouyang.

329
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,250
And I won't have to put up

330
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,460
with her holier-than-thou attitude.

331
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,930
If you don't like them,

332
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,880
you should give Cambridge a shot.

333
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
That's not for me.

334
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,810
I'm not the studious type.

335
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,500
I'll let you achieve this dream for me.

336
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,810
Since this is our dream,

337
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,340

00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,100
Mr Five's design drafts.

677
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,760
Do we have his insiders in our company?

678
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,910
For now we can't be sure

679
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,930
if there're spies in the company.

680
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,540
But I think we have to

681
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,300
do something quickly.

682
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,750
We have to gather evidence

683
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,290
and proceed with the legal channel.

684
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,730
We have to go through legal means.

685
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,090
But the process takes a long time.

686
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,380
I think what we need to do first

687
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,780
is to address our public relation crisis.

688
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,020
I'll do it.

689
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,420
I'll go back to the live stream

690
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,700
to explain to the fans.

691
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,910
I think we should be able

692
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,440
to reason with some of them.

693
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,170
I'll go now.

694
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,100
Wait.

695
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,060
I'm worried if you rush
to clarify it now,

696
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,010
you'll be attacked by anti-fans.

697
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,530
But I'm with Yang Yang on this

698
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,300
because our conscience is clear.

699
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,010
If we don't explain ourselves
in time,

700
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,150
they will really think we copied them.

701
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,140
That's right.

702
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,710
We'll do it together.

703
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,300
Alright. I'll get the lawyers.

704
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,530
I'll do that.

705
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,600
You two get on with it immediately.

706
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,170
Let's go.

707
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,620
Hello everyone.

708
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,940
Due to an emergency just now,

709
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,270
[we had to leave the live stream.]

710
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,800
[We're grateful to those
who are still here.]

711
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,950
[I hope you will continue to stay on.]

712
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,860
[Vine]

713
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,540
We have an important announcement

714
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,770
to make.

715
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,340
I'm Ouyang Mei Xuan,

716
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,280
founder and operating officer of Vine.

717
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,070
I'm sorry that

718
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,670
we are meeting for the first time

719
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,850
to address an emergency like this.

720
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,910
But I think

721
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,380
we have a little misunderstanding today.

722
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,860
We treasure your expectation towards Vine.

723
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,300
Hence we want to

724
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,390
make a proper statement about this.

725
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,830
[Is this plagiarism?]

726
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,800
[Unbelievable.]

727
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,780
[Heartbroken.]

728
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,860
I really understand

729
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,860
[Where is Mr Five?]

730
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,820
[Lay off her.]

731
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,790
[The designs are exactly the same.]

732
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,420
the emotions

733
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,840
of all our fans out there

734
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,060
and everyone in the live stream.

735
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,780
But I hope you can recall

736
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,130
that in previous live streams,

737
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,370
you must have seen

738
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,130
similar mixed denim designs
from Mr Five.

739
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,300
That's right.
If you follow

740
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,220
the works of Mr Five,

741
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,390
you'll realise that

742
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,250
what we're selling today

743
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,780
is in line with the design styles

744
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,330
of Mr Five.

745
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,940
Hence I hope everyone

746
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,380
can give Mr Five some time

747
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,330
to show you more of

748
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,420
her other designs.

749
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,850
We can then know

750
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,260
whether the designs today

751
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,810
are from Mr Five.

752
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,330
Xiao Wu.

753
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,330
Xiao Wu.

754
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,420
What happened, Xiao Wu?

755
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,840
About the live stream today...

756
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,380
What about it?

757
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,290
Did you steal my designs

758
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,810
for Chen Lang?

759
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,699
Steal your designs for Chen Lang?

760
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,489
That is absurd.

761
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,770
What are you talking about?

762
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,810
But you're the only

763
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,730
likely to do this.

764
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,250
What do you mean?

765
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,310
Of all the people in the company,

766
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,730
you're suspecting me?

767
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,770
I'm your boyfriend.

768
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,180
Those precious designs

769
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,530
aren't just my own sweat and blood.

770
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,510
They are also Ms Ouyang, Jiang Zhe Yang,

771
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,710
Mr Duan Jr and Xi Xi's.

772
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,810
It involves millions in investment.

773
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,150
So you're now suspecting me?

774
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,140
Of course you suspect me.

775
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,100
Sure, I'm a hooligan

776
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,500
who's been to jail

777
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,940
for fighting and whatnot.

778
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,320
But I can tell you this.

779
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,330
I'll never betray my girl.

780
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,030
We already have the end product.

781
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,060
We presented them

782
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,290
in the live stream.

783
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,830
But theirs are exactly the same as ours.

784
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,380
That was mean, don't you think?

785
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,610
Hence I'm thinking

786
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,310
we should get people talking online.

787
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,570
Get it trending

788
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
so that people know what is going on.

789
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,660
[Ms Ouyang, it doesn't look good.]

790
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,790
[If they merely registered it]

791
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,330
[without the end product,]

792
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,120
[we'd still have a chance.]

793
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,050
[But it's not looking good now.]

794
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,450
What should we do then?

795
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,700
[This isn't about money.]

796
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,770
[I'll be frank with you.]

797
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,420
[If you make a big stink,]

798
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,260
[it'll only make you look bad.]

799
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,320
[It's going to backfire.]

800
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,700
[I suggest you focus on]

801
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,420
[gathering more proof
of the design process]

802
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,370
[and talk to the lawyers.]

803
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,580
[That is a better option.]

804
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,610
Alright. I'll talk to the lawyers first.

805
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,860
Talk to you later.

806
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,140
Mr Five.

807
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,100
Wait up.

808
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,140
What is with that face?

809
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,570
Come here.

810
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,900
Listen.

811
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,420
This is on them.

812
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,310
It has nothing to do with us.

813
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,540
We have done nothing wrong.

814
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,570
Xi Xi.

815
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,220
Mao said it's not him.

816
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,100
That's great then.

817
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,120
Since Mao said he didn't do it,

818
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,380
we'll believe him.

819
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,010
Come sit here.

820
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,530
But he has a motive.

821
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,270
His mother is ill.

822
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,340
He needs money.

823
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,860
Moreover with that brain of his,

824
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,320
anyone can easily use him.

825
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,900
I'm just afraid.

826
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,550
If other people did it,

827
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,810
I could still take it.

828
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,860
But if he is the one...

829
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,330
Stop imagining the worst.

830
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,780
You know.

831
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,290
You're just too tall.

832
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,180
-Come here.
-It's hard for me to fold this with you.

833
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,570
Listen. I'm really losing it now.

834
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,610
Mr Five keeps suspecting Mao.

835
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,810
She said he was coerced by Chen Lang.

836
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,380
What do you think?

837
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,220
What do I think?

838
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,420
I think

839
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,620
Chen Lang has planted

840
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,180
another rat in our company.

841
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,410
Am I right?

842
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,810
What should we do now?

843
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,290
I don't know.

844
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,220
It took so much effort to catch Cola
back then.

845
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,230
We can't rush this.

846
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,070
We'll wait for them to
give themselves away.

847
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,380
It's hard for us to investigate.

848
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,370
Put this away.

849
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,580
I just think Mao isn't a likely culprit.

850
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,570
Really.

851
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,730
Things do not happen

852
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,660
according to how you feel.

853
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,260
No, just think about it.

854
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,530
With his character,

855
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,770
I just don't think it's him.

856
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,770
My father's legal team

857
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,290
is quite effective.

858
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,900
Mr Five's design drafts

859
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,770
have been sent.

860
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,940
We'll now submit these materials

861
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,940
to the Patent Office to proceed
with patent opposition

862
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,220
and prove that Mr Five's designs

863
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,900
have been presented within our company,

864
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,270
which means Chen Lang's design

865
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,900
has violated... What do you call it?

866
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,620
-Nobility?
-Novelty.

867
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,940
That's right. It violates novelty.

868
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,100
-Right?
-It lacks novelty.

869
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,180
Yes, that's what I mean.

870
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,940
It means Cloud Live's product

871
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,100
is dubious.

872
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,460
What we must do now

873
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,940
is to sue Cloud Live

874
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,900
for copyright infringement.

875
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,490
The lawsuit will take a long time.

876
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,460
During this period,

877
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,700
we can't sell anything.

878
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,500
This is a big problem.

879
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,240
It's going to take a long time.

880
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,270
During that time, our stock

881
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,810
will be seized for evaluation.

882
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,110
Our sales will be greatly affected.

883
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,500
But we still have to bring this to court.

884
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,700
We can't let Chen Lang

885
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,520
get away with this.

886
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,130
Jia Yun thinks so too.

887
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,220
She won't let him get away with this.

888
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,550
What did Jia Yun say?

889
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,050
What did I say?

890
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,620
Jia Yun.

891
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,010
Help me, quick.

892
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,330
I'll hold this for you.

893
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,660
You look like a delivery girl.

894
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,720
Where did you get that woven bag from?

895
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,410
-Don't start it.
-A big red woven bag?

896
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,810
My cakes.

897
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,140
My soul food.

898
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,660
Are you happy?

899
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,860
This is really tasty.

900
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,110
You bought one bag for me too?

901
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,100
No.

902
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,620
That's for our colleagues.

903
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,750
I'll bring them to the office tomorrow.

904
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,250
What about me?

905
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,300
You...

906
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,350
Jia Yun, you went to Shanghai

907
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,450
and bought two bags
but none for me.

908
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,490
We share a bag.

909
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,260
We'll share it.

910
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,100
-Let's share it.
-Whatever.

911
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,560
What do you think about Chen Lang?

912
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,130
Well, I actually found evidence

913
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,030
of him supplying us with imitation goods.

914
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,860
During the fight at the fashion emporium,

915
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,460
Chen Lang supplied Cloud's goods to us.

916
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,290
I'm just thinking

917
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,530
how to teach Chen Lang

918
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,810
a good lesson.

919
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,650
You really want to report him?

920
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,940
Have you thought through it?

921
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,000
The punishment is severe.

922
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,740
If you report Chen Lang,

923
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,490
it'll be the end of Cloud Live.

924
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,970
What do you mean?

925
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,570
Whose side are you on?

926
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,070
Why are you worried about Chen Lang?

927
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,420
I'm just afraid he can't take it.

928
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,330
He can't take it?
But you can?

929
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,870
Put yourself in his shoes.

930
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,770
He deserves it for what he has done.

931
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,900
Stop it you two.

932
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,860
You're arguing so much.

933
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,620
No matter what,

934
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,170
I'll meet him

935
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,290
tomorrow.

936
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,010
I'll call it a day.

937
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,900
Goodnight, delivery girl.

938
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,810
My cakes.

939
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,100
Leave them there.
I won't eat it.

940
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,490
You're so stingy.

941
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,480
The bag is quite heavy.

942
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,680
My mother got you to bring me all these?

943
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,490
Thanks. It must be a burden.

944
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,840
No, it's fine.

945
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,810
But why did you tell her

946
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,800
that I'm working with you?

947
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,370
Don't get it wrong.

948
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,620
It's just that you're the

949
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,420
only acquaintance my mum knows.

950
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,990
It's the only way

951
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,220
to keep her from worrying too much.

952
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,180
Why did you suddenly go back?

953
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,990
I had an interview in Shanghai,

954
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,730
so I just stopped by on the way.

955
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,130
Chen Lang, the reason I want to see you

956
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,010
is to clarify something with you.

957
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,660
Is it about Mr Five?

958
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,620
I'll be frank with you.

959
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,460
I have rock solid evidence

960
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,180
that you supplied imitation goods to us
on Singles' Day

961
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,940
in order to defame us.

962
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,220
The evidence is with me now.

963
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,850
What do you think

964
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,700
I should do?

965
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,700
Just do whatever you think

966
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,970
is right.

967
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,420
But I've explained this to you before.

968
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,420
I really didn't make Zhu Wan do it.

969
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,010
Zhu Wan is one of you.

970
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,770
Chen Lang,

971
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,970
why do you keep opposing us?

972
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,140
Anti-fans, spies, imitation goods,
account suspension

973
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,440
and now the stealing of Mr Five's design.

974
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,610
Just how low

975
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,040
can you stoop?
