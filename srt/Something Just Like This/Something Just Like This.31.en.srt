4
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,730
Isn't the negotiation tomorrow?

5
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,750
His father

6
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,920
is the chairman of Entity Alliance.

7
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,380
I'm negotiating with them.

8
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,240
Let's see what's up their sleeve.

9
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,030
I didn't know about it.

10
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,110
I only knew about it yesterday.

11
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,180
I don't wish to sell at a loss.

12
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,740
Suffering a loss

13
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,230
while allying with them.

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,300
Duan Ran isn't that bad.

15
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,640
I know he isn't.

16
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,480
Not sure about his father.

17
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,680
After all, I got deceived previously.

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,740
Speaking of which,

19
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,100
Rui was founded by you.

20
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,660
Yes.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,740
It's been a while since I looked
at the office from here.

22
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,940
I kind of miss it.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,530
Let's go to my office.

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,720
Sure.

25
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,910
There hasn't been much changes here.

26
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,079
Xi Xi wanted to keep it this way.

27
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,890
Thanks.

28
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,140
I'm also nostalgic.

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,380
I love everything that's old.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,450
Old things are valuable.

31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,560
Don't even think about it.

32
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,670
Rui and I are impossible.

33
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,329
Why are you so attractive?

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,470
We're not the same.

35
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,540
Don’t you think the same kind
of people can’t be together?

36
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,370
Only complementary people can.

37
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,130
Chen Lang.

38
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,510
Actually, I really admire
your business prowess.

39
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,580
But

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,500
why are you always doing nasty things?

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
Am I?

42
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,260
I may be a bit straightforward.

43
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,829
I don't really care how people look at me.

44
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,390
I don't care at all.

45
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,050
You should know what I think.

46
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,480
I remember what I've said to you.

47
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,260
I don't want to be like my folks.

48
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,360
Toiling away their whole lives

49
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,610
with nothing to show for it.

50
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,000
That's not the kind of life I want.

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,050
What a coincidence.

52
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,690
I want that kind of life.

53
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,110
And to live a good life.

54
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,430
What does it mean?

55
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,800
Stop thinking too much.

56
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,030
We're just ordinary friends.

57
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,410
It has nothing to do with you.

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,100
Since Mr Duan isn't here, I'm leaving.

59
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,290
Thanks for the water.

60
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,800
Thanks for coming.

61
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,810
By the way, Jia Yun,

62
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,030
there's something

63
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,820
I want to remind you about.

64
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,510
What is it?

65
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,900
I know you're now the
interim CEO of Rui.

66
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,250
But you can't make bricks without straw.

67
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,870
Think.

68
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,820
When Xi Xi first took over,

69
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,070
what did she do?

70
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,760
There's treasure right
under your nose.

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,070

72

Yes.

Mr Five.

74
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,010
This person, Song Er Jiang,

75
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,830
has a commanding presence.

76
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,050
He's always stern.

77
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,270
He speaks well, too.

78
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,010
So we need to get
ourselves mentally prepared

79
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,700
for tomorrow's negotiation.

80
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,350
We have to maintain our edge.

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,030
Are you saying

82
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,500
we're betting all our chips

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,330
on tomorrow's negotiation?

84
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,440
It's too risky, Uncle Shen.

85
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,220
We shouldn't do that.

86
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,480
About this matter, Uncle Shen,

87
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,430
neither you nor QE Group

88
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,860
should be directly involved.

89
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,659
But you could introduce me

90
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,470
to a few of the outlet brands' OEMs

91
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,720

Why?

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,910
Can't you see?

96
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,800
Personally or professionally,

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,200
your dad and I can't be directly
involved in the negotiation.

98
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,470
Fine.

99
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,890
I'm here...

100
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm here just to try my luck.

101

If you're not helping,
then just forget it.

102
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,910
I'll look for other ways.

103

Your dad and I think

104
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,050
that e-commerce is the future trend.

105
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,580
Entrepreneurship has its challenges.

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,150
Take it as an experience.

107
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,590
Keep it up.

108
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,760
Experience?

109
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,380
What an experience.

110
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,680
See you, Uncle Shen.

111
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,480
I need to talk with you, Mr Five.

Have you come up with something?

114
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,880
It's not entirely my idea.

115
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,100
I was advised to learn from Xi Xi.

116
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,250
Like that time she reached out to you.

117
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,280
How about doing something great together?

118
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,490
You want me to do
clothing alterations?

119
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,200
You're capable.

120
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,400
And I think you're full of ambition

121
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,800
and ideas.

122
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,200
You just never had

worrying about the future,

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,180
I think the idea is great.

130

If you don't want to go out of business

after the negotiation,

141
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,520
then you should consider it.

142
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,760
You're clever indeed.

143
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,030
But aren't you

144
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,040
using subsidies to turn us
against each other?

145

No.

This is not going to save us.

You are killing us.

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,610
You're still angry with me.

175
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,210
It's my treat.

176
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,570
No, thanks.

177
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,810
I dare not have anything to do with you.

178
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,690
We're leaving.

179
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,380
Just don't go yet, Mr Duan.

180
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,850
I've something to tell you.

181
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,390
-What is it?
-Can I speak for the Apparel Alliance?

182
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,250
Online businesses are flourishing
while physical stores are dying

183
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,850
because times have changed.

184
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,840
What has this got to do with us?

185
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Aren't you being a little personal?

186
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,740
Now I understand, Mr Song.

187
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,270
You want to teach us a
lesson at this critical moment.

188
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,480
Consider it your tuition fee.

189
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,350
I can pay for my own lessons.

190
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,450
I can even pay for my friends'.

191
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,040
But this is too much.

192
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,570
It's not fair.

193
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,340
This is for your own good.

194
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,450
The Apparel Alliance is forced

195
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,400
to work with the Entity Alliance.

196
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Everyone loves to make a profit.

197
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,050
-Do you agree, Mr Duan?
-What are you trying to say?

198
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,880
I guess you haven't realised.

199
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,110
Since we're meeting today,

200
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,400
let me just tell you.

201
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,950
The Entity Alliance is up to something.

202
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,090
They want to use subsidies to
break the Live Streaming Alliance apart.

203
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,940
Young man.

204
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,540
Have you been

205
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,970
doing nothing

206
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,700
the whole day

207
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,240
but just idling around?

208
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,880
The platform supply
chain of the online stores

209
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,930
will be idle.

210
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,580
At this time,

211
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,830
they'll be having their busiest moments.

212
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,490
The sales figures these few days

213
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,400
may account for half
of their yearly sales.

214
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,720
Am I right?

215
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I know how much

216
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,920
a business disruption will affect you.

217
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,030
Your company needs revenue to stay afloat.

218
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,590
Every second, you'll be losing
tons and tons of cash.

219
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,650
But once you sign this agreement,

220
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,480
I promise you that

221
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,170
the Apparel Alliance will not only
supply you with stock at once,

222
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,640
but also rebates to make it up to you.

223
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,210
Now's your chance to get ahead
of your competitors

224
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,690
who're less willing to cooperate.

225
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,850
So even before the negotiation starts,

226
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,980
your so-called friends would be long gone.

227
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,340
Mr Mu Jr.

228
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,600
Is it true what you're saying?

229
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,570
Yes.

230
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,090
Go ask them.

231
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,710
As your buddy.

232
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,250
I've told you everything.

233
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,270
It was my fault previously.

234
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,870
Please accept my apologies.

235
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,190
Thanks so much, Mr Mu.

236
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,340
You're a smart guy.

237
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,900
Just think about it.

238
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,270
I have to go.

239
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,530
I heard

240
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,140
that recently,

241
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,760
you're in close contact with Mr Duan Jr.

242
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,250
I can only remind you

243
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,350
that you and him aren't
from the same world.

244
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,820
Be careful. Don't hurt yourself.

245
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,230
I'm fine.

246
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,760
I used to do this in my previous company.

247
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,240
It's no big deal.

248
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,900
Where's Lu Hui?

249
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,080
She went out. Won't be long.

250
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,480
How I wish Lu Hui is like you.

251
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,120
She doesn't have the initiative to learn.

252
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,220
She's lazy.

253
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,820
We can't let her hear these words.

254
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,790
I said it for her own good.

255
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,580
You're different.

256
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,310
You're serious and hard working,

257
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,000
and full of compassion, too.

258
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,740
I'm just glad to have

259
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,260
a staff like you.

260
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,670
I'm glad to have such a good manager, too.

261
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,110
Well,

262
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,410
I'm curious.

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,510
How do we deal

264
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,210
with all this leftover stock?

265
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,310
These items

266
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,000
will be cleared from
the warehouse every week.

267
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,260
Where are they taken?

268
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,100
Why are you so interested ?

269
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,580
My previous company was
selling leftover stock, too.

270
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,670
I see them in a different light.

271
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,650
The company handles this.

272
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,600
I have to ensure they're cleared.

273
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,590
I don't know anything beyond that.

274
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,990
Where do you think you're sitting?

275
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,290
Hey.

276
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,970
Didn't you say I could sit anywhere?

277
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,370
Let's be serious.

278
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,230
The Entity Alliance

279
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,410
is trying to drive a wedge between us.

280
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,650
Do you know that?

281
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,230
I heard.

282
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,970
The current situation is tense.

283
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,190
I'm worried about the negotiation.

284
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,520
Even if the negotiation fails,

285
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,810
we can't just be sitting ducks.

286
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,330
We need to be proactive.

287
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,290
We could just stop buying their apparels.

288
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,270
If we don't buy from the
Apparel Alliance, then where?

289
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,920
The wholesale market?

290
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,860
Then we'll be back to square one.

291
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,050
We can’t sell these on Singles' Day.

292
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,740
No, Chen Lang.

293
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,680
What do you mean?

294
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,720
Are we going to get slaughtered?

295
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,120
I didn't say that.

296
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,860
I think now isn't the right time.

297
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,810
Let's change our mindsets.

298
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,150
Let them standardise the price.

299
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,010
Let us weather the storm
through the Singles' Day.

300
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,390
We'll strike back later.

301
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,599
There's still time.

302
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,630
The negotiation is tomorrow.

303
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,450
What kind of attitude is that?

304
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,750
You're simply indecisive.

305
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,880
I hope you don't disappoint
me at the critical moment.

306
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,109
I did nothing wrong.

307
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,130
I just wanted to share my thoughts.

308
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,650
But it seems we don't speak
the same language.

309
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,990
There's always differences

310
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,220
between people.

311
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,870
We now have a common goal.

312
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,410
We have a common belief,
so we can cooperate.

313
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,850
Just look at yourself.

314
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,870
No wonder Jia Yun doesn't like you.

315
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,320
You...

316
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,870
What's going on?

317
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,060
Xiao Xiao is on strike.

318
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,150
About the lack of products.

319
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,840
She said she'd rather go home.

320
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,670
Nonsense. Where's she?

321
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,820
There she is.

322
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,410
Is that okay?

323
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,200
Eat more vegetables during dinner.

324

[Cloud Live]

325
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,010
Mum needs to get back to work now.

326
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,940
Give me a kiss.

327
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,960
Xiao Xiao.

328
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,200
Are you done calling your son?

329
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,680
My dear.

330
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,340
Please don't scare me like this.

331
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,170
I'm timid.

332
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,670
You can't just sit there and not work.

333
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,860
You're our top broadcaster.

334
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,970
You're the life of our company.

335
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,620
We're relying on you.

336
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,930
Are you kidding?

337
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,220
No one is indispensable in this world.

338
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,910
I'm not trying to scare you, Mr Chen.

339
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,610
I can tolerate selling cheap stuff.

340
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,020
I can also tolerate selling diapers.

341
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,550
But isn't a Diaper Special
a little too much?

342
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,840
I just can't do it.

343
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,310
Look, there's a baby here.

344
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,400
He won't feel uncomfortable
wearing it the whole day.

345
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,430
I just can't do it.

346
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,790
Isn't it good?

347
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,440
Xiao Xiao.

348
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,580
We're here to make money.

349
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,670
Not here to show our faces.

350
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,290
If this continues,

351
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,600
my fans are going to have babies.

352
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,330
That isn't my idea of circular economy.

353
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,680
I had enough.

What are you thinking?

356
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,500
Why do you order onions
when you know I dislike it?

357
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,550
The smell invigorates me.

358
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,120
Stay away from me.

359
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,950
I will.

You're being emotional.

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,920
Tell me.

362
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,590
Who made you angry?

363
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,460
I'm calm.

364
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,300
-I'm just happy.
-You're emotional.

365
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,670
Tell me the truth.

366
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,290
Is the company in trouble?

367
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,770
Any problem with the
upcoming Singles' Day?

368
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm just scared.

369
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,210
We've put in effort

370
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,210
and worked hard

371
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,160
for Singles' Day.

372
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,080
If we fail,

373
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,590
what will we do?

374
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,420
Give me your hand.

375
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,880
Put it on top of my hand.

376
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,300
Let's live in seclusion.

You plow the fields and I weave.

378
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,740
Our life will be like a fairy tale.

379
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,800
Really?

380
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,960
Yes.

381
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,760
No.

382
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,000
It can't be real.

383
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,270
Perhaps you don't know

384
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,280
how expensive rural land is now.

385
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,050
This is a dream, a fairy tale.

386

It's not real.

It's nothing, really.

391
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,370
I won't force you if
you don't want to tell me.

392
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,750
There's something you must know.

393
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,590
No matter how the company is doing,

394
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,200
no matter what problems you have,

395
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,290
I'll always be by your side.

396
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,620
It's true.

397
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't tell your truths
from your lies anymore.

398
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,370
I'll always be with you.

399
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,620
I'll take that as a truth.

400
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,460
Since you say it's true,

401
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,910
prove it to me.

402
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,020
I'll do anything to prove myself
except eating onions.

403
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,680
If you do that,
then I'll really believe you.

Feed me.

405
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,710
Before this, I suddenly
thought of something.

406
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,590
This time, I'm serious.

407
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,670
When I'm working at the store,

408
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,270
I found out Pineapple Xpress
has been sending leftover stock

409
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,120
to the head office recently.

410
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,500
They aren't for sale.

411
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,090
Then what are they for?

412
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,060
I'm perplexed, too.

413
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,560
We should look into it.

414
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,100
See what they do with them.

Let's start.

419
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,340
The meeting today isn't meant

420
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,880
to threaten anyone.

421
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,310
Now there's a phenomenon.

422
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,920
Over the past year,

423
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,030
I've been seeing customers

424
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,180
trying on clothes and
shoes at the outlets,

425
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,830
only to leave the store without buying.

426
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,450
Do you know where they eventually go?

427
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,820
Online.

428

[They're so shiny.]

431
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,240
That is the threat

432
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,870
and pressure that physical outlets
are facing.

433
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,160
Live streaming companies
give out discounts

434
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,850
and issue coupons at will,

435
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,110
costing the physical stores
tons of business.

436
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,040
So, in today's negotiation,

437
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,580
we have one simple request.

438
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,170
We want to standardise the retail prices.

Our outlet's half-yearly sales

isn't even what the

make in an hour.

written off in the system?

448
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,620
Shouldn't it be returned?

Why are you so obsessed with
the leftover stock, Xi Xi?

450

You're still harping on it.

Since day one,

452
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,560
I was instructed to do it this way.

453
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,120
This is the rule.

Yes.

Although e-commerce

457
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,930
is the trendsetter in shopping,

I want to say a few words, Mr Song.

469
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,080
I agree with what you said.

470
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,170
But you missed a point.

471
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,600
I did a survey.

472
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,000
For the physical outlets,

473
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,750
basically every year,
even every half year or quarter,

474
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,700
there'll be promotional events.

475
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,110
Lots of discounts and
coupons will be given out.

476
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,170
50 percent or even 70 percent
discounts are common.

477
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,280
Furthermore, many brands are offering
special membership deals.

478
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,030
If you join as a member,

479
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,000
basically, all products

480
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,320
will have a 10 percent
to 20 percent discount.

481
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,930
E-commerce has many festivals

482
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,340
such as Singles' Day,
Double 12 and 618 Shopping Festival.

483
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,630
The physical outlets copy us

484
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,870
by having sales and events.

485
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,700
All things considered, we found that

486
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,650
the physical outlets discount their prices
just as much as us.

487
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,520
The physical outlets are having events

488
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,920
in order to survive.

489
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,390
When you give out discounts aggressively,

490
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,640
it's only natural that we ramp up
our promotions.

491
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,180
We're businessmen,

492
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,060
not philanthropists.

493
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,710
Our purpose is to make a profit.

494
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,900
All of you are new entrepreneurs.

495

You're all young men.

496

I used to be young like you.

497
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,390
You may see the present,

498
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,600
but not the future.

499
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,600
I've proposed standardised market prices

500

501
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,520
I hope everyone can be rational

502
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,790
and give this a serious consideration.

You're finally able to dress neatly.

Of course, you've reminded me about this.

I won't make the same mistake again.

Didn't expect you to
be so rule-abiding.

00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,050
just to make money.

510
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,940
Thanks to you, the poor girl

511
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,560
actually grew facial hair.

512
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,820
Not all online rumours are true.

513
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,960
If you're really innocent,

514
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,240
then you won't be working here.

515
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,440
I'm here because I like this job.

516
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,130
I came here on my own accord.

517
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,520
It has nothing to do with my old company.

518
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,780
The fashion outlet
next door is lacking staff.

519
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,510
Since we're on the same floor,

520
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,850
go help them iron the clothes

521
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,070
and arrange the decorations.

522
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,620
You see,

523
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,130
today we hardly have any customers.

524
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,570
Let me and Xi Xi go together.

525
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,570
I can go there alone.

526
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,740
I'm sorry.

527
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,850
I think

528
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,120
nobody should go now.

529
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,350
Today, the Area Manager will
be here for an inspection.

530
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,720
If they go,

531
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,450
I'll be here alone.

532
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,200
It doesn't look good at all.

533
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,990
You mean you're not helping?

534
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,670
I hope you can understand.

535
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,020
If you anger the manager,

536
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,210
who will take the responsibility?

537
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,380
I'm so sorry.

538
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,880
I'm a staff member of Pineapple Xpress.

539
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,060
So my priority is my outlet.

540
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,220
I'm sorry.

541
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,400
Thanks for coming.

542
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,670
She looks really annoyed.

543
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,520
You both were simply awesome.

544
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,570
Mr Song.

545
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,930
I totally agree with one of your points.

546
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,880
Mutual benefits.

547
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,740
Today's negotiation

548
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,860
is all about mutual benefits.

549
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,150
Only if there're mutual cooperation

550
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,950
and mutual compromises,

551
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,520
there shall also be mutual profits.

552
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,970
We could make a compromise.

553
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,590
Standardising the prices,

554
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,640
that I can agree to.

555
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,020
But there must be a time limit to it.

556
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,000
What's the time limit?

557
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,350
One week for newly launched products,

558
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,450
or maybe 10 or 15 days
which we can negotiate later.

559
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,950
Within this period,

560
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,710
we'll use the standardised prices.

561
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,090
Let us give out coupons

562
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,840
10 days after a product is launched.

563
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,980
Allow the customers to use the coupons

564
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,030
beyond this period

565
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,560
and on all off-season products.

566
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,100
Mr Duan Jr.

567
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,240
You're not very sincere.

568
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,560
Nowadays, consumers are smart.

569
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,280
If we do as you said,

570
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,560
I can guarantee that within three months

571
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,830
the sales volume of products going online

572
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,400
will decrease by 50 percent
in the first week.

573
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,580
Knowing that there will be discounts,

574
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,440
nobody will buy in the first week.

575
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,260
They'll just add the items
to their carts and wait.

576
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,260
You should know very well, Mr Song.

577
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,790
Most of the members in the Entity Alliance

578
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,390
are high-end outlets.

579
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,700
The consumers who only
go for discounted products

580
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,660
aren't their target audience.

581
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,140
They don't have high purchasing power.

582
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,690
Today we're here for a negotiation.

583
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,450
We want to survive in business.

584
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,940
This is our biggest compromise.

585
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,680
I think you're not sincere.

586
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,910
How come the other members

587
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,910
of the alliance

588
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,500
can accept the condition,

589
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,260
but not you?

590
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,900
It's impossible.

591
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,290
As of now, the Live Streaming Alliance

592
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,560
has yet to give our stance on the issue.

593
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Isn't that right?

594
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,200
Did you accept it?

595
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,790
What about you guys?

596
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,670
Mr Duan.

597
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,520
Maybe we should reconsider

598
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,810
the matter from the Entity Alliance's

599
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,110
perspective.

600
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,110
Since when are you able to
put yourself in other people's shoes?

601
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,510
Your dad hasn't said anything yet.

602
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,929
Are you going back on your word?

603
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,260
It's lunch time.

604
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,940
Why don't we

605
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:26,050
have a lunch break?

606
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:31,449
Let us think about the agendas.

607
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,980
We'll resume the meeting in the evening.

608
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,500
Do you agree?

609
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,420
Okay.

610
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,610
After moving this box,

611
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,389
carry this, too.

612
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,440
There are so many of them.

613
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,929
Excuse me.

614
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,900
Are these leftover stocks to be
delivered back to Pineapple Xpress?

615
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,760
No.

616
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,100
Wait.

617
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,790
Where then?

618
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,570
-Out of the city.
-Xi Xi.

619
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,940
Are you that curious?

620
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,210
Why so many questions?

621
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,840
Manager, the driver told me

622
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,220
the leftover stocks are
delivered out of the city.

623
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,560
Why out of the city?

624
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,380
You should find out.

625
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,470
The sales of leftover stock
must come with discounts.

626
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,090
It'll affect our pricing system.

627
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,840
And even damage our brand image.

628
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,140
But they're not delivered
back to the head office.

629
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,100
Didn't I say?

630
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,050
We shouldn't get mixed up in this.

631
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,350
Go carry the boxes.

632
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,550
I'm over here.

633
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,000
What's that supposed to mean?

634
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,770
Chen Lang, why were you silent

635
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,570
during the negotiation?

636
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,220
You're siding with the Entity Alliance.

637
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,520
Are you kidding?

638
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,370
Can't you be more mature, Duan Ran?

639
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,840
This is a negotiation.

640
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,880
I'm not mature?

641
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,200
Look who's talking. You said
nothing during the negotiation.

642
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,880
Stop pretending in front of me, Chen Lang.

643
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,050
Tell me honestly.

644
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,000
What perks have the
Entity Alliance given you?

645
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,140
They were only making a proposal.

646
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,110
They're no different from you and me.

647
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,590
What's going on with you?

648
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,100
You suddenly changed.

649
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,100
Are you just going to stand
on the sidelines?

650
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,590
I would have accepted it
if you said it earlier.

651
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,970
We're already here.

652
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,800
The negotiation has started.

653
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,670
You wanted me to represent us.

654
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,110
What was the intention?

655
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,330
We're just a small business, Duan Ran.

656
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,050
We can't last any longer.

657
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,270
Once the Entity Alliance takes action,

658
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,620
everyone will be in trouble.

659
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,570
We both know that.

660
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,960
But our situations are different.

661
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,490
There're lots of people depending on us.

662
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,320
They're waiting to be fed.

663
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,800
They want a better life.

664
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,560
Who doesn't want that?

665
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,270
Everyone wants that.

666
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,380
You think you're the only one
with employees to feed?

667
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,640
We're trying to survive too.

668
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,920
You

669
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,170
and the other live streaming companies

670
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,740
have put your trusts in me.

671
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,320
It's my responsibility

672
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,410
to carry the burden on my shoulders.

673
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,950
I'm hanging on.

674
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,660
But when I needed you the most,
you kept quiet.

675
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,050
Who among us isn't struggling right now?

676
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,890
We're not the same, Duan Ran.

677
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,560
When we go bust, that's it.

678
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,660
We'll be gone with the wind.

679
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,950
But you're different. You have your dad.

680
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,170
And the entire QE Group is behind you.

681
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,560
What do we have?

682
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,190
Can we do anything?

683
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,710
How am I different?

684
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,460
Today we were both sitting
at the negotiation table.

685
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,150
What difference is there?

686
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,400
We're in the same situation.

687
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,360
My dad was there.

688
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,710
What's the use?

689
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,980
Did he say anything for me?

690
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,770
Did he?

691
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,150
I think

692
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,850
when we go against the Apparel Alliance,

693
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,880
it's like an impossible mission.

694
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,170
No matter what, you still have your dad.

695
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,130
What do I have?

696
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,610
I have nothing.

697
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,260
I'm fragile.

698
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,150
Instead of having an argument with you,

699
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,300
I'd rather go to the market

700
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,080
and source for new products.

701
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,490
Chen Lang.

702
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,520
Buddy.

703
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,280
We shouldn't argue right now.

704
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,160
If we don't stand together,

705
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,330
that's the end for us.

706
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,360
Everyone in the company is gone.

707
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,160
Think about it.

708
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,510
Why don't we get back in there,
work as a team,

709
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,610
thrash it out,

710
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,490
and take what's rightfully ours?

711
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,010
We deserve to win!

712
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,750
Buddy.

713
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,720
Duan Ran.

714
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,920
Forget about the meal,

715
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,510
and the meeting as well.

716
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,920
Is everyone here?

717
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,700
Let's begin.

718
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,520
Let us not waste

719
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,170
any more time.

720
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,340
As usual,

721
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,360
the majority will get to decide.

722
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,750
Is that okay?

723
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,810
I have a few words.

724
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,640
Lu Hui,

725
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,560
the strawberry flavoured doughnuts
are sold out.

726
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,610
I bought the vanilla instead.

727
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,880
It's as delicious as the one I ordered.

728
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,220
Just a moment. I'll be there.

729
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,150
Your drink.

730
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,280
Thanks.

731
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,340
Xi Xi.

732
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,150
Why are you working here?

733
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,980
Isn't the facial hair incident resolved?

734
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,950
It was resolved

735
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,740
but I don't wish to go back.

736
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,420
Now that I'm no longer a CEO,
I don't have to worry about

737
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,710
cash flow, inventory,
supply chain, and whatnot.

738
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,680
I'm actually enjoying
the bliss and tranquility.

739
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,290
Yet you're still working.

740
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,690
I guess that's your fate.

741
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,560
It can't be helped.

742
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,930
I'd feel funny if I don't work.

743
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,260
What's going on with you?

744
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,770
You're a busy queen.

745
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,080
Why would you have the mood to shop here?

746
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,950
I've resigned.

747
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,550
I bet you didn't know.

748
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,660
What's going on?

749
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,500
I had an argument

750
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,550
with Yang Yang's mother

751
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,120
on managing his affairs.

752
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,740
We had different opinions.

753
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,540
Nevertheless, since Yang Yang

754
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,200
got hurt because of you,

755
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,660
I won't blame him for
going back to his mum.

756
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,380
What's it got to do with me?

757
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,670
In all the years I've known him,

758
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:26,100
you're the first girl who's
tugged at his heartstrings.
