[We Are Young]

00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,430
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,710
Was that your plan?

5
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,670
I wondered what it was.

6
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,400
You were acting mysteriously.

7
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,430
We've to do things subtly.

8
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,900
Do not disclose this to anyone.

9
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,730
What's wrong?

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,110
I've a feeling someone's
sabotaging us in secret.

11
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,830
Are you referring to Chen Lang?

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,750
Just relax and do
your job as the CEO.

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,820
Leave the rest of the troubles to me.

14
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Pass me the bowl.

15
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,810
Don't burn yourself.

16
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't forget green onions.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,410
Are you going to eat all of that?

18
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,950
You think my cooking is hideous.

19
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,500
When we first took over Rui Live,

20
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,700
all we had in mind were
the cash flow and broadcasting.

21
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,900
I realized those are basic matters.

22
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,150
We've the money now.

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,880
In order to improve
and expand the company,

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,280
what do we need right now?

25
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,540
We need to increase
engagement and popularity.

26
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,840
Is that why you're leeching off
Jiang Zhe Yang's popularity?

27
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,079
What do you mean leeching?

28
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,090
We're helping each other out.

29
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,790
Besides, nothing beats

30
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,950
the popularity of
first-class celebrities like him.

31
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,630
After we grow in popularity,

32
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,780
engagement will increase naturally.

33
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,210
With engagement,

34
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,370
even a commoner
could rise as a broadcaster.

35
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,290
Am I right?

36
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,780
Once we find a
representative broadcaster,

37
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,530
we will be calling the
shots with our suppliers.

38
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,500
Am I right?

39
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,370
Well, what you said make sense.

40
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,820
Highly popular celebrities
like Jiang Zhe Yang

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,180
are likeable in
all platforms.

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,950
They also create a
spike in online sales.

43
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,670
They can't be easily
outmatched by anyone.

44
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,350
I'm glad you understand.

45
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,230
Have you eaten dinner?

46
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,380
I said I was hungry just now.

47
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,070
Here, eat mine.

48
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,260
There you go.

49
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,310
Remember, in this vast world,

50
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,140
the only one who
truly cares and loves you

51
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,660
is me, your brother.

52
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,580
I figured out

53
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,070
a way to help Yuanbao
with the coffee sales.

54
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,220
What is it?

55
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,630
Don't bother.

56
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,340
I've personal connections too.

57
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,510
Are you playing hard to get?

58
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,050
Let me eat my noodles.

59
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,380
Finish your food.

60
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,140
I don't need a first class ticket.

61
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,580
Xi Xi, are you sure about this?

62
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,990
Yuanbao.

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,470
In the age of the Internet,
do you know

64
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,130
what's the most
important marketing strategy?

65
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,710
I don't know.

66
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,290
It's interaction, Yuanbao.

67
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,990
Interaction?

68
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,320
Although Jiang Zhe Yang
was my primary schoolmate,

69
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,000
he is also a huge star.

70
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,910
If we would like him to
help us sell coffee,

71
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,470
but we cannot afford
to endorse him,

72
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,420
or host events,

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,780
what should we do?

74
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,090
We need to employ
interesting, new, different

75
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,570
even unconventional
ways of interaction.

76
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,830
We should attract him
to join us instead.

77
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,590
Hello, Jiang Zhe Yang.
I'm Qian Xi Xi.

78
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,770
Do you still remember me?

79
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,460
Do I look familiar?

80
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,610
[I've so much to tell you.]

81
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,030
[Are you looking forward to see me?]

82
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,380
[By the way, this is very important.]

83
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,980
Have you had your coffee today?

84
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,630
Is that how we're supposed to

85
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,490
interact with Yang Yang
this way?

86
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Yes.

87
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,380
Hello, Jiang Zhe Yang.

88
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,850
It's me, your primary
school mate, Qian Xi Xi.

89
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,910
Do you still remember me?

90
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,500
You used to steal my
snacks all the time.

91
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,150
At 12 p.m. this Saturday,

92
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,240
would you like to have
a cup of coffee with me?

93
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll be waiting. See you there.

94
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,220
What is this?

95
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,100
The coffee is burnt.

96
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,240
You should know that
Yang Yang loves his coffee bitter.

97
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,700
To him, coffee is life.

98
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,060
Why is that so?

99
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,030
During his training days,
he's always tired.

100
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,220
He has to keep his figure
at the same time.

101
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,470
He is not allowed to overeat.

102
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,530
Thus, he relies on
bulletproof coffee to pull through.

103
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,190
[Hello, Jiang Zhe Yang.]

104
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,440
[It's still me, your primary
school mate, Qian Xi Xi.]

105
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,310
[I'm jogging with the kids]

106
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,110
[at Central Stadium right now.]

107
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,030
[Jogging is exhausting.]

108
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,050
[Luckily, I've my coffee with me.]

109
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,470
[Have you had your cup
of coffee today?]

110
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,830
Kids.

111
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,420
Say hello to your
beloved Jiang Zhe Yang.

112
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,190
[Have you had your cup
of coffee today?]

113
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,590
Would you give me a thumbs up?

114
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,580
How did I do?

115
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,470
Will this video really reach Yang Yang?

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,130
I engaged a marketing company.

117
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,730
These videos will go viral

118
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,020
across the Internet.

119
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,070
[Have you had your
cup of coffee today?]

120
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,960
[Have Jiang Zhe Yang
had coffee today?]

121
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,409
[Your schoolmate
wants to buy you coffee.]

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,820
[Hello, Jiang Zhe Yang.]

123
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,430
[Have you had a
cup of coffee today?]

124
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,100
[Have you had your cup
of coffee today?]

125
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,430
[It's your primary
schoolmate, Qian Xi Xi.]

126
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,870
[Are you looking forward to meet me?]

127
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,380
[Jiang Zhe Yang, it's me again.
Your primary schoolmate, Qian Xi Xi.]

128
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,500
[Let's drink coffee
together at 12 p.m. this Saturday.]

129
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,150
[Let's do another spin.]

130
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,250
[There's one important thing.]

131
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,470
[Would you like to
drink coffee with me?]

132
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,340
[I'll be waiting. See you there.]

133
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,040
[I'll see you at the Central Stadium
this Saturday at 12 p.m.]

134
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,340
[I'm jogging]

135
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,180
[with the kids at
Central Stadium right now.]

136
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,750
[Jogging is exhausting.]

137
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,060
[Luckily, I've my coffee with me.]

138
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,540
Isn't this Qian Xi Xi?

139
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,290
Do you know her?

140
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,780
Yes, she was my desk mate.

141
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,140
[At 12 p.m. this Saturday.]

142
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,630
[Would you like to
have coffee with me?]

143
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,680
[I'll be waiting. See you there.]

144
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,980
She's leeching off your popularity

145
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,100
to sell coffee.

146
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,159
I think this video
is pretty interesting.

147
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,040
Why are you looking at me?
Do you really want to go?

148
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,870
Yuanbao.

149
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,800
You work and execute tasks very well.

150
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,250
The logo you designed

151
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,700
resembles you a lot.

152
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,430
Well, it is me.

153
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,990
You completed the
trademark registration

154
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,040
and found a manufacturer
for your packaging.

155
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,140
That's impressive.

156
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,550
Have a look.
I designed the packaging

157
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,390
and the logo myself.

158
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,860
Besides that,

159
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,630
I can Photoshop, edit videos,

160
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,790
distribute,

161
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,100
and control reviews.

162
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,310
Distributing and controlling reviews?

163
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,830
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

164
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,490
You don't have to understand.

165
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,780
You just need to focus on

166
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,220
promoting and
marketing the products.

167
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,430
I'll focus on producing them.

-Seal the boxes.
-Okay.

169

After our attempt,

00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,460
I think these videos

171
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,480
will spread virally on the Internet.

172
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,860
Do you think Yang Yang
would head to the Central Stadium

173
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,340
to drink coffee with you?

174

I'm not sure.

175
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,020
Anyway, on Saturday afternoon,

we will wait for him at the stadium.

177

-What is Qian Xi Xi doing?

Mr Duan.

She's waiting for Jiang Zhe Yang.

What?

192
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,690
Mr Duan, you must be unaware.

193
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,500
Xi Xi and Jiang Zhe Yang
were primary schoolmates.

194
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,130
In order to help Yuanbao
sell her coffee,

she invited Jiang Zhe Yang
for some coffee online.

[What's so special
about this coffee?]

199

[Why is this the only
thing I ever talk about?]

200

Why must I invite
Jiang Zhe Yang to try?

201
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,360
I'll have Ms Yuanbao explain it to us.

Ms Yuanbao.

203

The darlings are asking
what's so special about the coffee.

Hello, everyone. I'm Yuanbao.

You might not understand

206
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,750
what bulletproof coffee is all about.

207
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,230
Bulletproof coffee is made from
coffee concentrate,

208
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,700
-Coffee concentrate.
-coconut oil,

209

and butter.

210
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,860
It's an amazing beverage

211
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,050
because in a ketogenic diet,

212
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,940
it is a very important
step in this dietary method.

213
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,700
Is she going to wait for him to show up?

I don't know.

215

327
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,730
[Some showed me love]

328
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,830
[but most of them are fans of yours.]

329
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,550
[You guys are amazing.]

330
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,710
Mr Duan.

331
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,210
It's working out well.

332
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,470
It's amazing.

333
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,270
Is there a change in sales?

334
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,830
Jiang Zhe Yang is impressive.

335
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,940
His presence

336
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,950
caused Xi Xi's views

337
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,460
to multiply by tenfold.

338
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,650
Really?

339
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,020
[Hello, Jiang Zhe Yang.
685472149 views. Follow.]

340
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,530
[You've so many viewers.]

341
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,800
[You're too popular. Look.]

342
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,990
[Boyfriend, you're finally here.]

343
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,310
[Yang Yang really came.]

344
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,690
[I feel like I'm dreaming.]

345
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,220
[You're finally here.]

346
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,280
[This is true.]

347
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,760
I'm sitting here with an old friend,

348
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,020
drinking coffee together.

349
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,150
It's true. While I was
waiting for you,

350
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,970
I didn't feel that way.

351
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,700
While sitting with you here,
it really felt like we were desk mates.

352
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,270
-[Exactly.]
-[Do you remember our classroom?]

353
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,150
[Of course.]

354
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,840
[The wooden desks
and the wooden chairs.]

355
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
[It wasn't that bad.]

356
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,070
The level of engagement is huge.

357
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,400
He's a celebrity.

358
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,510
I brought main meals
to class every morning.

359
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,030
My food was not enough for you.

360
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,560
You'd even steal my snacks.

361
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,350
You wouldn't let me have any.
I'd pull your braids.

362
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,410
Do you remember?

363
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,740
I spent a lot of time
braiding my hair.

364
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,750
I would ask you for some food.

365
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,540
-I wanted you to give me some.
-You stole everything.

366
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,420
Back then,

367
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,750
you would drink
carbonated drinks as well.

368
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,960
All sorts of carbonated drinks.

369
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,480
I stopped you because
you'd gain weight.

370
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,980
[You'd ignore me
and continue drinking them.]

371
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,670
[I think coffee is not enough for you.]

372
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,000
You love food too much.
No one can stop you.

373
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,780
Honestly, Xi Xi,

374
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,270
I'm very thankful for today.

375
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,260
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have the chance

376
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,800
to reminisce my childhood.

377
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,839
If you didn't call me

378
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,819
chubby or Fatty Jiang back then,

379
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,599
I wouldn't be here,

380
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,900
or who I am today.

381
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,260
Am I here as

382
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,650
a motivator today?

383
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,020
[Back then, everyone thought]

384
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,450
[I was as round as a ball.]

385
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,950
[Everyone teased you.]

386
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,230
[Yes, because I was too fat.]

387
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,630
[I was as round as a ball.]

388
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,860
[When I was young...]

389
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,670
This is impressive, Xi Xi.

390
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,930
You guys were really
primary schoolmates.

391
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,990
Of course.

392
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,820
We were in the same class
and we were desk mates.

393
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,620
What's wrong, Yuanbao?

394
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,230
This afternoon

395
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,910
Yang Yang showed up right after I left.

396
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,660
Once he left, I returned.

397
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,310
I'm so unlucky.

398
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
I couldn't meet Yang Yang in the end.

399
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:06,940
That's enough.

400
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,350
Don't be sad.

401
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,860
Look, your idol, Jiang Zhe Yang

402
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,270
is drinking the coffee you made.

403
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,910
-He's so cute.
-He complimented the coffee.

404
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,830
Isn't he good looking?
He said your coffee tastes good.

405
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,590
-Really?
-He was drinking it non-stop.

406
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,790
Did he compliment me?

407
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,700
Did he?

408
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,670
He did.

409
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,750
I'll make a short video for you

410
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,550
-as a gift.
-Okay.

411
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,300
Don't cry.

412
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,030
With Yang Yang's help,

413
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,690
the coffee is selling like hotcakes.

414
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,300
-Really?
-If this goes on,

415
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,450
we should start mass producing them.

416
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,710
Yang Yang is the best.

417
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,150
Would you consider

418
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,460
joining Rui Live officially

419
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,720
to take on the business
of coffee with me?

420
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,530
I think so.

421
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,330
Xi Xi,

422
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,180
I've some savings.

423
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,300
I can rent a place above the office.

424
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,550
I'd be nearer then.

425
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,610
Are you really moving?

426
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,930
If you'd like to move,

427
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,640
I'll find you a renovation company.

428
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,310
I'll move back home.

429
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,170
Are you crazy?

430
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,870
You're moving back to
your old home instead of the fancy one?

431
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,790
I had been thinking
about this for a long time.

432
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,430
Duan Ran is back anyway.

433
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,920
I thought

434
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,230
living with the Duan Family
in the long term isn't right.

435
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,030
I've to move out sooner to later.

436
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,940
Xi Xi.

437
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,380
-Xi Xi.
-You're all here.

438
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,570
-Mr Duan.
-Mr Duan.

439
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,030
-Have a seat.
-Jia Yun.

440
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,290
Have a seat over there.

441
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,800
Congratulations on the coffee sales.

442
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,160
Su Su, Yuanbao, go and
order us food with Yu Shi.

443
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,140
Go on.

444
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,100
-Okay.
-Let's go.

445
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,790
Most importantly,

446
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,150
do not exceed RMB200 per pax.

447
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,180
-RMB200?
-I understand.

448
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,660
-Let's go.
-RMB180 per person.

449
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,540
Come on.

450
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,490
What are they up to?
They are so excited.

451
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,700
Jiang Zhe Yang showed up

452
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,430
and Yuanbao's coffee sold out.

453
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,850
I can sell it all out
without a celebrity's help.

454
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,780
Your live stream was pretty great.

455
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,200
It was very successful.

456
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,540
The results were great.

457
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,850
-Show me.
-It sold...

458
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,540
You want to watch the stream?

459
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,390
Check out our stream this afternoon.

460
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,200
We sold a lot of units of coffee.

461
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,550
We gained many likes as well.

462
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,150
The comments were great too.

463
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,980
-That's a lot of views.
-Yes.

464
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,400
What about you?

465
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,210
I'm almost done.

466
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm close to convincing his mum.

467
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,190
It's nothing major.

468
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,640
You're getting close?

469
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,840
We're getting close.

470
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,700
All right. Today is a great day.

471
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,930
Let's party.

472
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,740
Everything is going well today.

473
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,850
Duan Ran.

474
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,070
Come here.

475
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,150
Why did Xi Xi drink so much?

476
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,250
She's very happy today
so she drank a little.

477
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,590
-Let me check on her.
-She's asleep now.

478
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,840
How's it going with
the favour I asked?

479
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,280
I fixed an appointment
at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

480
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,980
That's great.

481
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,060
It's happening.

482
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,810
Alright, I'll check on Xi Xi.

483
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,510
-What are you doing?
-I'll get her a cup of water.

484
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,770
-I want some water too.
-Get it yourself.

485
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,920
I'll pour myself some water then.

486
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,460
I'll do it myself.

487
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,010
I'll get my own cup of water.

488
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,580
Chen Lang.

489
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,180
This is Rui's special
live stream on bulletproof coffee.

490
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,710
How much sales did it bring?

491
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,600
This is the collected data

492
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,220
and the individual sales
of each broadcaster.

493
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,020
Wow.

494
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,340
Qian Xi Xi alone brought in
20,000 orders.

495
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,440
Yes.

496
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,480
She invited Jiang Zhe Yang
to her live stream.

497
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,870
She's selling an endorsed product.

498
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,270
It sold out immediately.

499
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,540
Most buyers were
Jiang Zhe Yang's fans.

500
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,030
She live streamed with a celebrity.

501
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,990
Impressive.

502
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,510
Well, our industry relies

503
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,420
heavily on engagement.

504
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,910
Engagement is king.

505
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,670
Chen Lang.

506
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,330
Is she violating the
portrait rights of Jiang Zhe Yang?

507
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,120
Can we suppress her
engagement with this?

508
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,600
Who's going to do that?

509
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,660
Did Jiang Zhe Yang say so?

510
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,670
I told you to keep a
look out on their plans.

511
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,670
What did you find?

512
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,060
They still insist on the endorsement
of Jiang Zhe Yang for Pineapple Xpress.

513
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,320
Making Jiang Zhe Yang
the ambassador of Pineapple Xpress.

514
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,540
We shall join them.

515
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,700
Let's see who'd win
Jiang Zhe Yang over.

516
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,390
[Rui Live]

517
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,550
How do I look?

518
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,350
Mine is in the shade of a mango.

519
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,300
-It's here! Look.
-Both of yours look so much better.

520
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,180
Look.

521
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,870
Have a look. What do you think?

522
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,980
Fatty Jiang.

523
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,490
Are we really wearing this to stream?

524
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,860
Yes.

525
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Mr Five made this specially for you.

526
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,040
We should name our project.

527
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,400
The project this time will be titled

528
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,740
The Coffee Sisters.

529
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,200
Sounds good.

530
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,180
-Sure.
-On a serious note.

531
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,910
Yesterday, due to the
presence of Jiang Zhe Yang,

532
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,130
the sales for
bulletproofed coffee

533
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,550
has hit over a million.

534
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,130
-Over a million?
-Over a million?

535
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,580
Thus, I asked all of you here today

536
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,150
because we need to

537
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,360
spend more time
in the live stream rooms.

538
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,220
During the day, all four
of us will handle one session.

539
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,280
We will leave the
sessions at night to

540
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,800
Cola and Little Duckling.

541
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,950
Let's do our best and give our all.

542
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,190
-Okay?
-Okay!

543
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,670
Let's do a cheer. Come on.

544
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,200
Coffee!

545
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,240
The Coffee Sisters! Yay!

546
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,060
What's the relationship between

547
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,700
Madam Liu and Jiang Zhe Yang's mother?

548
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,760
They are very close

549
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,460
so I asked the both of them out.

550
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,820
That's great.

551
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,070
They enjoy singing.

552
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,870
Hello.

553
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,290
Sister Liu, this is my son, Ran Ran.

554
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,160
-You must be Duan Ran.
-Hello, Aunty Liu.

555
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,820
-Yes he is.
-He's so handsome.

556
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,250
Come over here.

557
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,510
-Have a seat.
-Have a seat.

558
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,570
-Come over here.
-Have a seat, aunty.

559
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,030
Look at you.

560
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,060
You're hiding your
handsome son from us.

561
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,700
No, he's just really busy.

562
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,170
Come on.
Have a drink with us.

563
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,460
Don't drink too much.

564
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,820
Come on, we're meeting
for the first time.

565
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,920
These are great.

566
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,510
-Don't worry about it.
-Give Aunty Liu a toast.

567
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,550
-Come on.
-Cheers, Aunty Liu.

568
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,180
-Cheers.
-Just a little.

569
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,600
You're so good looking.

570
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,790
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

571
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
-Thank you.
-Have something to eat.

572
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,700
Aunty Wu.

573
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,770
-Hello.
-Who are you?

574
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,460
Aunty, my name is Duan Ran.

575
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,220
I'd been trying to get
Aunty Liu Xiao Hong to

576
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,300
introduce me to you.

577
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
What a coincidence
to meet you here.

578
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,580
Xiao Hong? She's a good friend.

579
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,250
Hello.

580
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,870
Xiao Duan, right?

581
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,820
Yes.

582
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,700
Hello. Nice to meet you.

583
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,260
Aunty, I helped carry your
luggage on the plane back then.

584
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,340
Oh, I do recall.

585
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,010
Yes, I remember.

586
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,430
My memory is failing me.

587
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,910
Thank you.

588
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,910
Once I got on the plane,
I noticed how

589
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,160
elegant you are.

590
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,380
I dare not speak to you.

591
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,680
Hence, I tried to get to know you
by helping you with the luggage.

592
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,180
You're over-exaggerating.

593
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,810
However, you're not the
first person to tell me

594
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,470
that I resemble the actress,
Wang something.

595
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,350
I'm right then.

596
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,100
Aunty.

597
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,540
You've great taste in fashion.

598
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,490
I heard you shop at
our mall pretty often.

599
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,350
Which one are you talking about?

600
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,480
I'm with QE Group.

601
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,680
I visit the mall every other day.

602
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,560
Am I right?

603
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,790
Yes.

604
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,450
Are you the manager of the mall?

605
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,850
No.

606
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,240
It's my father's business.

607
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,770
It has nothing to do with me.

608
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,230
-Duan Sheng Yun?
-Yes.

609
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,080
-He's your father?
-Yes.

610
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,430
You're Young Master Duan.

611
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,160
Please excuse me.

612
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,360
You're too polite, aunty.
I'm just a regular person.

613
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,480
Those belong to my father.
It has nothing to do with me.

614
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,660
Your father is one of
the leaders of retail.

615
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,630
He's listed even on Forbes.

616
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,140
You're too humble.

617
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,370
Don't say that.

618
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,270
Please excuse me.

619
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,890
Yang Yang.

620
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,940
I told you many times.

621
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,060
-What is it, Mum?
-When you're out in public,

622
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,020
either put on shades or wear a mask.

623
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,000
Choose one.

624
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,900
I can't see anything with shades.

625
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,570
Fine, put on the mask.

626
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,320
I'll put on the mask, alright?

627
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,990
He makes me worry all the time.

628
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,900
I'm busier than a nanny.

629
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,790
-It's not easy being a celebrity.
-You're right.

630
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,600
Besides, cheers to you for

631
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,390
raising such a great son.

632
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,620
Stop it. What about yourself?

633
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,830
I'd met plenty of rich young men.

634
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,420
You're very understanding

635
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,850
and down to earth.

636
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,270
It's my first time meeting
a rich man like you.

637
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,390
You're flattering me.

638
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,580
I've a long way to go
compared to your son.

639
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,300
Look, all parents are the same.

640
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,690
They are pathetic.

641
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,890
-That...
-Aunty, do you enjoy art?

642
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,070
He likes it.

643
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,250
Hello, Madam Wu.

644
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,820
Hello.

645
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,450
Do we know each other?

646
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,120
Duan Ran, introduce us.

647
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,140
Do you know each other?

648
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,380
He's a friend of mine.

649
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,880
I'm Chen Lang.

650
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,600
I'm the CEO of Cloud Live.

651
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,560
The curator of this exhibition

652
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,680
is a friend of mine.

653
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,420
He heard you and
Mr Jiang Zhe Yang came to visit.

654
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,450
He wanted me to
introduce you guys.

655
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,840
This must be fate.

656
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,740
Yang Yang was so
excited when he found out

657
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,190
the exhibition launched.
He insisted me to take him.

658
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,380
-Really?
-He's crazy over the paintings.

659
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,150
He really loves some of the pieces.

660
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,220
I'll show you.

661
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,640
Have a look, over here.

662
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,740
This painting right here.

663
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,880
The business of coffee
is finally on track.

664
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,620
Congratulations to Yuanbao.

665
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,700
A lot of netizens commented that

666
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,720
they enjoy watching
Yuanbao drink coffee.

667
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,890
When they watch you

668
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,460
drink the coffee with
dessert, they'd crave it as well.

669
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,630
I am a glutton.

670
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,590
When I eat, I make the food look good.

671
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,760
That's a talent.

672
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,190
Note it down.

673
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,670
We can consider developing
food broadcasting business.

674
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,330
I completely agree.

675
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,390
After watching her stream,

676
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,320
I couldn't help it and bought
a strawberry cake home.

677
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,010
Really?

678
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,350
Mr Five.

679
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,830
Recently, as we launched
the coffee broadcasting,

680
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,700
you handled the
manufacturers and products.

681
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Thank you for the hard work.

682
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,690
Not at all.

683
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,480
With the boost from bulletproof coffee,

684
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,610
I'm not tired at all.

685
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,950
Su Su, follow up on the
training for new broadcasters.

686
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,130
Sure. All of them are very motivated.

687
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,100
Really? That's great.

688
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,800
Yu Shi.

689
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,740
How is it going with sales?

690
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,620
The situation is great.

691
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,460
Income is rising steadily.

692
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,430
Are you happy?

693
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,140
Very happy.

694
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,470
However, before that,

695
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,040
we need to learn
to be prepared for the worst.

696
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
Keep an eye on

697
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,910
Young Master Duan who
spends unnecessary money.

698
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,590
Don't stress me out, Ms Qian.

699
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,990
I feel pressured.

700
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,300
What is he up to recently?

701
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,300
He's handling the
broadcasting of Pineapple Xpress.

702
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,300
He has been riding solo recently.

703
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,960
He stopped bringing me along.

704
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,440
Be careful when you
put it in. Don't cause a dent.

705
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,320
Xiao Chen.

706
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,900
Please thank the artist for the gift.

707
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,720
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

708
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,940
We shall make a move.

709
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,600
-Bye, Xiao Duan.
-Bye, aunty.

710
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,540
Let's go.

711
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,130
Get on the car. Bye.

712
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,100
Bye, aunty.

713
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,340
Xiamen is a huge city.

714
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,400
Why do I bump into you
everywhere I go?

715
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,150
I'd been wondering if

716
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,990
there is a mole around me.

717
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,070
Every move I make

718
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,370
is blatant to the counterpart.

719
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,360
In my opinion,

720
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,880
I think great minds think alike.

721
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,530
Don't disgust me.

722
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,150
Great minds think alike?

723
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,930
If I'd go on, I would say
that our hearts are connected.

724
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,950
By the way,

725
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,520
I need to tell you something.

726
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,980
Back then when I sold this car,

727
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,460
I requested for a higher price.

728
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,850
I couldn't sell it.

729
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,180
Thanks to you for
connecting me to a foreigner.

730
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,600
That dork

731
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,940
bought the car at that price.

732
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,060
After I returned,

733
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,140
I took the money from selling the car

734
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,960
and resurrected Rui Live.

735
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,990
Does that make any sense to you?

736
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,770
It was my fault back then.

737
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,730
I was too petty.

738
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,530
I said the car was horrible.

739
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,910
Actually, this car

740
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,100
is great.

741
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,100
Enjoy it.

742
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,010
Aunty, I brought you some ham.

743
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,310
I heard this brand is delicious.

744
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
I brought it over specially for you.

745
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,890
Thank you very much.

746
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,230
I'm sorry, Mr Chen.

747
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,430
I...

748
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,180
I've been a vegetarian for years.

749
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,230
I don't eat meat anymore.

750
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,470
You guys should take it instead.

751
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,230
It's alright, aunty.

752
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,940
I invited the chefs of Jingxinlian

753
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,340
over here specially

754
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,160
to make you a meal.

755
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,420
Business is not operating today.

756
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
They came to cook.

757
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,980
-Really?
-Yes.

758
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,810
Come, chefs.

759
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,130
This is such a great surprise.

760
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,340
I'll make an order.

761
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,560
Feel free.

762
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,590
This is amazing.

763
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,050
Fellow chefs.

764
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,850
I would like a bowl of
clear vegetable soup.

765
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,870
Is that alright?

766
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,750
-Sure.
-Sure.

767
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,639
That's amazing.

768
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,820
Don't you think so?

769
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,520
Yes.

770
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,580
Let me be honest with you.

771
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,370
Sometimes, I'm fine
when Yang Yang falls ill.

772
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,230
However, I'm more
concerned about my puppies.

773
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,980
They are getting old.

774
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,770
I'm afraid of losing them one day.

775
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,730
I will not be able to live.

776
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,980
Aunty.

777
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,750
Right next to your house,

778
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,840
there's a pet care centre.

779
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:40,909
My friend owns it.

780
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,360
I talked to them.

781
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,389
You can send both
of your babies there

782
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,630
for free.

783
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,590
They provide many services.

784
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,310
Services like spa, baths,

785
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,020
swimming and sunbathing.

786
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,170
They can play with other dogs too.

787
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,810
-That would be lovely.
-Yes.

788
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,170
I should send them there

789
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,920
to attend social activities.

790
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,860
Yes.

791
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,410
-That's great.
-They should have fun.

792
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,800
You're right. A dog's best
friend isn't human,

793
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,960
it's dogs.

794
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,530
-Yes.
-Your dogs would enjoy it.

795
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,740
They return home happy too.

796
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,110
That would make you
happy in turn.

797
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,440
Let's try the place out.

798
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,860
You're home to see mummy.

799
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,420
My babies, you're home.

800
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,870
Did you have fun?

801
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,200
Did you have fun with Mr Chen?

802
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,080
Come here.

803
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,060
Aunty, when I was walking them,

804
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,670
I realized Zai Zai had
some ear mites.

805
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,970
I spent some time

806
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,360
and took him to the veterinary

807
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,280
to clean it up.

808
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,330
He's fine now.
Look, he's all clean.

809
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,040
Thank you.

810
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,960
No wonder you wouldn't respond

811
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,600
when I call for you.

812
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,100
You're so cute.

813
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,130
Are you happy? Good boy.

814
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,800
I brought some ham today.

815
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,950
I took some out and

816
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,270
fed them as snacks.

817
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,660
They loved it.

818
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,540
What?

819
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,130
You fed them ham?

820
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,940
That's too salty.

821
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,130
They will shed.

822
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,560
I'd never feed such things to my dogs.

823
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,670
Come here, babies.

824
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,670
Come.

825
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,160
-Over here.
-Come here.

826
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,380
Zai Zai, puke it out.

827
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,650
Good boy. Puke it out.

828
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,040
Finish the remaining ham on your own.

829
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,350
-Hurry up.
-Come here.

830
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,900
Get it out of their system.

831
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,230
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

832
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,710
I heard you'd been visiting
Yang Yang's place pretty often.

833
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,490
Back when we met on the plane,

834
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,030
it wasn't a coincidence, right?

835
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,550
I can't keep anything from you.

836
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,980
What do you want with our Yang Yang?

837
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,340
I started a broadcasting
company after I got back.

838
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,780
I want to work with him.

839
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,100
Is that the company who

840
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,780
sells coffee by leeching
off his popularity?

841
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,750
That's the company.

842
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,740
You heard about it.

843
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,670
What a coincidence. My staff, Xi Xi

844
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,330
was a primary schoolmate
of Jiang Zhe Yang.

845
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,550
Does that mean she's
allowed to leech off his popularity?

846
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,830
Don't put it that way.

847
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,200
We helped achieve
another round of sales.

848
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,860
You should know when to stop.

849
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
If you continue to sell coffee using

850
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,820
the image of Yang Yang,

851
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,510
that is violating his portrait rights.

852
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,440
You will hear from our lawyer soon.

853
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,500
Let's not make a
big deal out of this.

854
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,920
Xi Xi had no idea.
Stop trying to scare us.

855
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,540
Duan Ran.

856
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,750
All you do

857
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,630
is talk about your Xi Xi.

858
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,020
You brought her up many times.

859
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,180
-This sounds familiar to me.
-Sure.

860
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,850
Look, if I did not show mercy,

861
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,220
your Xi Xi would have been litigated.

862
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,710
Yes. Thank you for
your mercy, Ms Ouyang.

863
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,670
Xi Xi is ignorant.

864
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,120
I'll teach her a lesson
once I return, alright?

865
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,680
I'll ask her to apologize
to Jiang Zhe Yang face to face.

866
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,690
Is that alright?

867
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,220
Forget it.

868
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,640
As I was saying,

869
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,870
if you'd like to
convince Yang Yang,

870
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,200
why did you approach his mum
instead of me?

871
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,940
Ms Ouyang.

872
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,100
You're a woman of your word.

873
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,840
You rejected our offer.

874
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,730
I couldn't come to you directly.

875
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,000
What did I reject?

876
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,540
It's an endorsement
of a fashion brand.

877
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,430
Have you heard of Pineapple Xpress?

878
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,940
Yes. They came to me.

879
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,250
I did reject them.

880
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,640
I think their stature

881
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,250
does not fit Yang Yang well.

882
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,310
Yes.

883
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,280
However, my company just kicked off.

884
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,960
Pineapple Xpress
is considered a huge client to me.

885
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,290
Cheers.

886
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,460
Do you need help?

887
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,670
No.

888
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,710
I'm a man. I shouldn't
trouble my ex-girlfriend.

889
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,070
Duan Ran, you have not
changed a single bit.

890
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,230
Really?

891
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,580
Fine, you don't need my help.

892
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,560
I've a tiny suggestion.

893
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,260
Yang Yang's mother has a weakness.

894
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,770
Things that I oppose greatly,

895
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,920
she'd be ecstatic

896
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,490
if she manages to accomplish them.

897
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,910
Ms Ouyang.

898
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,270
You've not changed either.

899
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,750
You're the most generous

900
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,680
and understanding woman.

901
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,390
You're right.

902
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,900
Thanks.

903
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,500
You're welcome.

904
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,810
[Shapower Art Zone. Art, Life, Live]

905
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,320
The demand for coffee is slowing down.

906
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,440
Yuanbao told me

907
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,530
that she's developing a new recipe.

908
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,510
I think we will be able to
push it once more tomorrow.

909
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,970
Present the statistics
for tomorrow to me.

910
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,550
Fans wants to see the
try on for number seven.

911
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,550
Number seven is
on Little Duckling right now.

912
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,650
She just finished her livestream.

913
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,910
Where did she place it?

914
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,360
Is this number seven?

915
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,360
Yes.

916
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,880
-There you go.
-Thanks.

917
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,770
-You're the best.
-Work hard.

918
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,940
Inform them

919
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,540
to reserve live stream room
No. 9 for Yuanbao from now onwards.

920
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,420
Okay.

921
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,340
All screens are up.

922
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,630
It feels like the
heyday of broadcasting.

923
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,450
Yes.

924
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,460
However, most of the broadcasters

925
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,790
only talk about coffee.

926
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,620
Only Cola and Little Duckling

927
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
are promoting dresses with Jia Yun.

928
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,820
Are we losing focus
on our main program?

929
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,440
It's a critical period.

930
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,600
Those who are broadcasting
with Yuanbao are amateurs.

931
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,810
We're trying to train them.

932
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,960
The three of them aren't the only ones.

933
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,110
Mr Five is broadcasting too.

934
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,000
She's talking about the designs.

935
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,250
Mr Five only broadcasts
her own designs.

936
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,740
They are purely hand made.

937
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,860
There isn't much in stock.

938
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,100
How do we hit the numbers?

939
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,760
The numbers will accumulate.

940
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,250
Let's take it slow.

941
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,650
I believe it will get better.

942
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,610
I believe it too.

943
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,920
Sir, who are you looking for?

944
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,280
Is Ms Qian around?

945
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,680
May I know who you are?

946
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,730
You're from Hualu Coffee.

947
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,580
They are one of
my favourite brands.

948
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,050
When I started my research on coffee,

949
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,250
I tasted one sip
of your brand of coffee.

950
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,370
It's so rich and fragrant.

951
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,300
It was love at first taste.

952
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,640
Mr Bai, you're here today

953
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,040
to visit our company.

954
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,440
If we lack in any way,

955
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,730
please pardon us.

956
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,740
I'll be frank.

957
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,050
I know one of your shareholders

958
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,980
-is QE Group, right?
-Yes.

959
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,170
I came to discuss an acquisition.

960
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,150
An acquisition?
