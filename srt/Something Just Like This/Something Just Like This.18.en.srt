[Episode 18]

4
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,810
You have a seat.

5
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,830
I have a meeting.

6
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,150
Go after you're done.

7
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,080
It's fine. She's not hungry.
Come on, stop eating.

8
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,130
-I'm eating.
-It's time.

9
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,110
-Let me finish first.
-Hurry up.

10
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,820
-Jia Yun, take care of my dad.
-Sure.

11
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,670
What's going on?

12
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,250
How are you going to reach the top?

13
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,520
What are you going to do?

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,740
Who's going to do it?

15
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,310
Uncle, let's enjoy our food.

16
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,850
Well,

17
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,740
should we wait for them?

18
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,110
Show me around.

19
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,320
-Sure.
-Okay.

20
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,460
I'll clean up.

21
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,920
Don't worry about it.
It's going to work out.

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,660
-I'm going to announce...
-It's not going to work.

23
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,560
With Yuan Yuan's resources
and current situation,

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,690
she can enter the competition easily.

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,690
However, if you'd like to
employ the company's resources

26
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,620
to help her out,

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,940
I will not agree to it.

28
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,250
She may be petite,
and weighs less than 100 pounds,

29
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,570
but she's mentally the strongest

30
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,900
person I know.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,220
That's true.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,500
She has to be strong because
her parents aren't around.

33
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,720
She may seem strong on the outside,

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,850
but she hugs a Pikachu plushy to sleep.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,280
She really loves supper too.

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,130
She is a better drinker than I am.

37
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,100
Really?

38
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,460
Put it this way.

39
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,920
She may be a business woman,

40
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,990
but she's still a child on the inside.

41
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,960
What do you mean?

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,840
Have a look at them yourself.

43
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,630
Both of them never grew up.

44
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,010
Go and check it out online.

45
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,010
Check out how popular the piano trio is.

46
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,530
Why are we hesitating?

47
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,310
-How long should we wait?
-What's the point?

48
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,370
There's less than one week
left to reach the top.

49
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,050
We don't have enough time to prepare.
How are we doing that?

50
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,890
Listen to me, there is time.

51
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,670
There's more than enough time.
Just listen to me.

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,340
You already have a plan.

53
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,050
Our saviour is here.

54
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,020
Hello.

55
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,550
Are you at the entrance?

56
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,030
Okay, I'll head over now.

57
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,920
Who is that?

58
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,190
Why do you care?

59
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,470
For today's meeting minutes,

60
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,560
hand it over to me after you sort it out.

61
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,920
What?

62
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,690
Mr Qian, are you having a tour?

63
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,160
I'm leaving for a bit.

64
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,920
I can't keep you company. Bye.

65
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,010
Give us a second.

66
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,920
Xi Xi.

67
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,340
Where's Mr Duan going?

68
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,829
He said his saviour came.

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
I don't know who it is.

70
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,110
I'm very curious.

71
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,880
Take care of my dad.

72
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,110
Okay.

73
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,160
Ouyang.

74
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,760
What a sweet ride.

75
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,960
Really? Are you working overtime?

76
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,860
What are you looking at?

77
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,900
People are waiting for me in the office.

78
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,230
I'll head inside first.

79
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,090
Uncle, I'll show you around
the live stream rooms.

80
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,980
It's fine. I'll check on Xi Xi.

81
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,180
Okay.

82
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,420
His saviour?

83
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,970
My words are nothing to him.

84
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,040
Only what she says matter.

85
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,420
Xi Xi.

86
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,310
Your days are so occupied.

87
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,720
You're a CEO during the day,

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,660
and a broadcaster at night.

89
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,170
It's too tough.

90
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,000
It's nothing. I'm used to it.

91
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,430
As the CEO, I need to manage the company.

92
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,450
I'm doing what I love at night.

93
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm not tired. It's pretty fulfilling.

94
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,410
I think

95
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,040
there's no need for a
woman to work so hard.

96
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,530
Forget it.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,159
You don't owe me anything.

98
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,170
Dad, Uncle Duan left Rui Live to me

99
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,630
because he acknowledges me.

100
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,270
I don't want to let him down.

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Why didn't he leave it to his own son?

102
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,900
Duan Ran studied in the UK.

103
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,210
Well,

104
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,550
if I explain everything,

105
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,510
it's going to take more than three days.

106
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,700
In simpler terms,

107
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,470
Uncle Duan left Rui Live to my care.

108
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,330
He trusts me and he believes in me.

109
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,050
Uncle Duan is all you care about.

110
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,200
Let me ask you.

111
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,980
How much company shares has he given you?

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,980
What do you mean?

113
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,140
Come on. The company's shares.

114
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,460
Did he not give you any?

115
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,820
No.

116
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,080
Why do I need shares?

117
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,200
Let me put it this way.

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,400
My salary is the highest in the company.

119
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,760
Don't worry.

120
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,390
Little brat.

121
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,910
I ran businesses before.

122
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,250
Normally, for start-ups like these,

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,880
besides the founder,

124
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,030
the CEO

125
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,220
and the management

126
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,550
should own shares of the company.

127
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,409
You're very experienced.

128
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,700
I know you're very knowledgeable.

129
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,070
Look.

130
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,130
Why isn't Duan Ran

131
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,909
treating you right?

132
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,740
He reprimands you during the meeting.

133
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,400
Halfway through the meeting,

134
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,280
he left with the woman in the sports car.

135
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,750
He left without hesitation.

136
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,340
What do you mean?

137
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,900
I saw what happened.

138
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,740
They are different things.

139
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,430
I told you, you can't keep it from me.

140
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,380
It is great to perform the piano triet

141
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,930
on reality TV programs.

142
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,790
-It's a good idea.
-Yes.

143
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,390
There's a reality TV program overseas.

144
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,950
They'd reproduce a particular
scene of a viral video.

145
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,770
They'd dress up exactly
like they did in the videos

146
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,450
and play the same piece.

147
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,590
They'd look exactly like the
performers in the videos.

148
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,600
However, it was an impromptu performance.

149
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,240
Ours is going to work out.

150
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,540
We need to get a music producer

151
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,320
to edit the song.
The response will be great.

152
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,530
Since this is rare among local audiences,

153
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,380
it's going to be interesting.

154
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,700
However,

155
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,400
where are you going to
find that man who played?

156
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,830
It's a huge coincidence.
He's a friend of my father.

157
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,340
What a coincidence.

158
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,560
I met him coincidentally today.

159
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,620
That's how the idea occurred to me.

160
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,020
It will work as long
as you get him on board.

161
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,059
Only one critical problem is left.

162
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,179
What is it?

163
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,789
The problem with Yuan Yuan.

164
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,049
Your exceptional memory

165
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,470
is a curse.

166
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,890
It's an advantage.

167
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,880
I've been in this industry for years.

168
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,280
This is my only strength.

169
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,640
You've to be mindful in this industry.

170
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,410
A minor issue can cause an uproar.

171
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,340
It's impossible for the rumour to be true.

172
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,590
I'm on Yuan Yuan's side. I trust her.

173
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,640
Such rumours and scandals

174
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,140
can't be true.

175
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,420
That's not enough.

176
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,240
You've to convince others
that it isn't true too.

177
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,530
How are you going to do that?

178
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,180
That's why we need a long-term plan.

179
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,140
A long-term plan.

180
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,770
Fine.

181
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,150
Yuan Yuan.

182
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,240
You're indeed the company's pride.

183
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,660
You're always the first to arrive.

184
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,180
You flatter me, Mr Duan.

185
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,590
It's habitual.

186
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,320
I came earlier to prep.

187
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,860
You're pretty early as well, Mr Duan.

188
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,770
I came early on purpose.

189
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,910
The company has a new plan for you.

190
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,020
I would like to discuss it
with you in detail.

191
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,760
You've a new plan again, Mr Duan.

192
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,610
I promised to give you the
interactive project, but it fell through.

193
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,640
I feel bad about it.

194
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,610
Besides, I was the one who signed you.

195
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,210
I've to be responsible.

196
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,660
Okay. I placed my trust on the right guy.

197
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,550
However, you know

198
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,590
that I'm someone with a bad history.

199
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,790
That's not a problem.

200
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,250
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

201
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,540
We will make sufficient preparations

202
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,080
to achieve this goal.

203
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,310
Is that alright?

204
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,170
All right.

205
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,010
Uncle, my mum used to
come here all the time.

206
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,630
Then, she brought me here.
It's pretty great.

207
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,980
Yes it is.

208
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,510
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

209
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,170
Uncle, do you prefer meat

210
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,880
or seafood?

211
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,000
Meat.

212
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,410
Should we get two orders of filet mignon?

213
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,820
-Sure.
-Great.

214
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,230
Two sets of filet mignon

215
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,560
and a bottle of red wine.

216
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay.

217
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,620
Your company is always busy.

218
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,990
It's already 1.30pm,

219
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,420
and you're only having lunch now.

220
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,830
Our business in in the preliminary phase.

221
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,580
That's how it is with start-ups.

222
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,260
Other companies work from 9am to 6pm.

223
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,220
The employees are still unhappy.
Our company operates seven days a week,

224
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,270
we work 14 hours a day,

225
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,080
but our employees are highly motivated.

226
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,220
Your workload

227
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,740
is greater than my job in Africa.

228
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,180
My dad told me

229
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,000
how hard he worked, how tough it was

230
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,670
to start a business when he was young.

231
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,430
I thought, when it is our turn,

232
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,790
we mustn't lose.

233
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,480
We've to work harder than
the generation before.

234
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,530
Thanks.

235
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,060
Are you concerned about Xi Xi?

236
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,020
Don't worry.

237
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,930
Xi Xi is doing great.

238
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,090
She's very capable.

239
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,060
Besides, she loves her current job.

240
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,570
She's driven and

241
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,020
she performs well.

242
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,600
When I work with Xi Xi,

243
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,300
I'm nothing compared to her.

244
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,600
The more I listen to you,

245
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,130
the more worried I am.

246
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,520
Uncle, don't say that.

247
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,940
Xi Xi

248
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,340
likes this job a lot.

249
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,880
Also,

250
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,690
our working environment isn't bad.

251
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,850
Xi Xi and I work together
to manage the company.

252
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,400
It's not easy to be honest.

253
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,520
Xi Xi is a grown-up too.

254
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,090
She gets to decide on her own path.

255
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,940
That's up to her.

256
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,300
That's your opinion.

257
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,100
It's not what I think.

258
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,620
Alright, uncle.

259
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,860
I asked you out for a meal today

260
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,050
because I would like to discuss

261
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,680
business matters with you.

262
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,920
Business matters?

263
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,500
Uncle Qian, you had no idea.

264
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,650
The video of the piano trio

265
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,060
you did previously

266
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,860
went viral on the Internet.

267
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,230
The girl who played with you?

268
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,470
She's with our company.

269
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,410
Right now,

270
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,870
we're planning to bring the piano triet

271
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,760
onto a programme.

272
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,280
It will be broadcasted on TV

273
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,050
so more people can appreciate it.

274
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,930
This is why you're treating me to a meal.

275
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,250
I should have treated
you to a meal long ago.

276
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,050
I would like to discuss
this matter with you

277
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,740
to see if you're interested.

278
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,040
Then...

279
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,020
Actually, for the programme,

280
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,190
we've put in a lot of effort

281
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,860
in order to convince the partners.

282
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,570
The producers have most of the say.

283
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,810
That's why

284
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,410
the commission they offer isn't great.

285
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,570
Like father, like son.

286
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,910
You jump at every business opportunity.

287
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,760
That's not true.

288
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,180
I came to request for your help.

289
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,850
Uncle, let me tell you.

290
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,620
If we reach an agreement,

291
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,760
you will be on TV,

292
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,650
Xi Xi would be very happy for you.

293
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,860
Don't you think so?

294
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,910
Sure.

295
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,230
I will help you out.

296
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
Thank you, uncle.

297
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,310
You're aware of my situation

298
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,460
I don't have much money.

299
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,840
After returning from abroad,

300
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,840
I have not bought a
decent outfit for Xi Xi.

301
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,280
Thus, you have to

302
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,990
pay me at least

303
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,660
for my service.

304
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,000
No matter what happens,

305
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,930
I'll do my best

306
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,660
to negotiate with the producers.

307
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,010
I'll try my best to obtain a deal.

308
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,110
Is that alright?

309
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,250
However, what is your expected range

310
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,840
of the pay?

311
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,080
Give me an idea.

312
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,630
Uncle Qian, the situation is

313
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,480
like I said,

314
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,770
it's not easy to get on this programme.

315
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,760
We spent a lot of effort
in order to reach a deal.

316
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,240
Xi Xi and my company

317
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,430
just kicked off.

318
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,610
We're in the beginning phase.

319
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,070
The RMB30,000 you ask for is pretty...

320
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,390
Wait, hold on.

321
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,410
You missed one more zero.

322
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,490
Do you know why your dad's
last name is Qian?

323
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,990
Because my grandfather's name was Qian.

324
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,140
That's because he's money minded.

325
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,000
What do you mean?

326
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,420
Did my family offend you in any way?

327
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,550
I asked your father to go
on a TV programme

328
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,880
with Jiang Zhe Yang and Yuan Yuan.

329
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,170
He asked for a commission of RMB300,000.

330
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,520
What TV programme is that?

331
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,940
Is that the project you've
been working on with Ouyang?

332
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,040
Don't change the subject.

333
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,050
Listen up.

334
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,430
Preliminary promotion, publicity,

335
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,670
I lowered my pride
and did everything I could.

336
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,210
It's your turn now.

337
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,290
Do you need to do that for your ex?

338
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,320
I'm not going.

339
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,690
It seems like we're
taking advantage of her.

340
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,060
Why not?

341
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,740
I completed the first stage.

342
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,150
He's your father. You should handle this.

343
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,040
I think the RMB300,000 my
dad asked for is too little.

344
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,320
If it was up to me,

345
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,320
I would request for three million.

346
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,560
What kind of a CEO are you?

347
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,380
You should handle your father.

348
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,510
I'm doing well.

349
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,740
I'm a great CEO.

350
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,290
Chen Lang is promoting
his company heavily.

351
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,140
-We mustn't lose.
-I know.

352
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,820
We've to get on the programme.

353
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,970
-It is necessary.
-You've to convince your father.

354
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,830
-It has nothing to do with me.
-He's your father.

355
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,470
Xi Xi, you must persuade your father.

356
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,760
This bag is so heavy.

357
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,710
Let me...

358
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,190
You're here.

359
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,000
Everything is hung up.

360
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,950
It's perfect.

361
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,010
Have a seat over there.

362
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,820
That's enough. Stop working for a bit.

363
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,700
Pass it to me.

364
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,150
I came to talk to you about something.

365
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,010
It's about Duan Ran, isn't it?

366
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,720
It's about the programme, not Duan Ran.

367
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,980
It's true. It's almost time

368
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,180
for the quarterly report with the board.

369
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,890
I'm the company's CEO.

370
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,370
I need to bear the responsibility
of achieving KPI this quarter.

371
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,190
Performance and sales
for the past three months

372
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,510
were mediocre.

373
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,590
Right now, if I'm able to push
our broadcasters up the ranks,

374
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,450
I'll be able to pass this quarter.

375
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,630
You behave like a CEO.

376
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,450
Xi Xi, what do you want?

377
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,750
Duan Ran treated me to a casual meal.

378
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,390
He barely cares and he's loaded.

379
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,520
I'm not asking for a lot.

380
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,890
Why are you trying to save his money?

381
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,600
I think

382
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,260
he overspent by using Aunty Zhou's card,

383
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,580
credit card.

384
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,270
I don't care whose card he uses.

385
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,440
You work very hard

386
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,020
for his company.

387
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,480
I want the full amount.

388
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,860
Not a penny less.

389
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,380
They sent you to persuade me.

390
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,650
That proves that I'm worthy.

391
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,300
Of course you're worthy.

392
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,690
But they did not send me over.

393
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,870
You said,

394
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,410
I work very hard.

395
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,530
His family treats me very well.

396
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,590
Don't grunt.

397
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,620
Look at Duan Ran.

398
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,150
He treated you to a meal a few days ago.

399
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,150
He did the same today.

400
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,250
He treats you well.

401
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,920
He can't possibly buy me with a meal.

402
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,310
Why hasn't Zhou Jie accept
you as her daughter-in-law?

403
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,290
That's too ridiculous.

404
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,580
They are not the same.

405
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,130
Xi Xi, I know what you're thinking.

406
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,690
I also know what they are thinking.

407
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,420
This world

408
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,490
is not as simple as you imagined.

409
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,120
You complicate things.

410
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,920
Stop defending them.

411
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,370
About this,

412
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,060
listen to me, my decision is made.

413
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,570
RMB300,000 and not a penny less.

414
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,160
-There's no space for negotiation?
-No.

415
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,190
-Nothing I say works, right?
-Yes.

416
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,350
I've no idea what's wrong with you.

417
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,950
Forget it. Pretend I never came today.

418
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,650
Don't leave. Let's have a meal first.

419
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,640
This child.

420
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,550
Xi Xi.

421
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,010
You asked me out just to hear you rant.

422
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,790
My father

423
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,780
appeared before me out of nowhere.

424
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,510
Do you think he's here to provide love

425
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,920
or to give me stress?

426
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,350
Love

427
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,250
comes with restrictions.

428
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,540
You know this very well.

429
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,400
Of course I do.

430
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,220
That's why I need you to hear me out

431
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,270
and eat with me.

432
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,900
What's wrong?
I think your father is great.

433
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,070
What?

434
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,580
In what aspect?

435
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,260
He's quite good looking, am I right?

436
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,970
He plays the piano and he sings.

437
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,040
He cooks

438
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,330
and he always surprises you.

439
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,740
He's great.

440
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,540
Listen up, Zhang Jia Yun.

441
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,210
Do not be fooled

442
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,280
by how kind my father looks.

443
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,910
He has never accomplished
anything in life.

444
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,850
That's all he learnt.

445
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,450
Fine. Although your father
is a little stubborn,

446
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,590
rigid...

447
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,600
He's so rigid.

448
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,410
-He's conservative.
-Yes, he is.

449
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,080
Am I right? However,

450
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,530
he does everything

451
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,820
for your sake.

452
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,770
He's fighting for your benefits.

453
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,380
If you put it that way,

454
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,490
I kind of admire you.

455
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,880
Well, it's annoying.

456
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,000
You should eat more.

457
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,520
Come on.

458
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,530
Have some meat.

459
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,950
Should I exchange my parents

460
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,070
and my brother for your dad?

461
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,650
Three for one?

462
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,270
You had too much to drink.

463
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,070
Let's go.

464
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,850
Xi Xi.

465
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,330
I thought you were working overtime.

466
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,840
I didn't expect you to ask me out.

467
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,450
Last night I...

468
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,110
Last night, my best friend wants

469
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,570
to exchange her family members for you.

470
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
I gave it some thought, so forget it.

471
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,110
Let's go. I'll show you around.

472
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,870
Shopping?

473
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,540
Shopping is great.

474
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,710
-I'll shop with you.
-Stop wearing such hideous clothes.

475
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,210
You're so unfashionable.

476
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,100
-It's so ugly.
-Okay.

477
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,680
What kind of pants are those?

478
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,880
-The shoes are awful.
-I wore these for years.

479
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,680
-I wore these for years.
-Can you get a decent pair?

480
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,750
Gosh.

481
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,490
One's hairstyle determines his destiny.

482
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,660
I'm not used to this.

483
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,200
Me neither.

484
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,440
I never had my hair this short.

485
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,240
Xi Xi, I think

486
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,320
it makes me look younger.

487
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,090
What do you think?

488
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,820
Why would you wear it this way?

489
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,140
Is it ugly?

490
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,660
Don't zip it all the way up.

491
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,470
Only oldies wear them this way.

492
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,920
You should flaunt the colours inside.

493
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,420
-Okay.
-You will look younger.

494
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,010
You're right. I'll listen to you.

495
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,830
-You're a grown man.
-As long as you think I look good.

496
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,170
You should get a pair of
formal and casual shoes.

497
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,120
I think they suit your style.

498
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,890
Don't you think it's
similar to what I'm wearing?

499
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,650
I knew you'd say that.

500
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,730
They are similar.
This style suits you pretty well.

501
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,080
This is great, daughter.

502
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,370
-Do you like these?
-Yes, you've taste.

503
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,310
Do you know how to tie your laces?

504
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,260
Hurry up and try them on.

505
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,990
There are more items to look at.

506
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,740
Clothes make the man.

507
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,290
It's true.

508
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,890
After putting on the clothes you bought,

509
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,780
I feel a few years younger.

510
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,190
I'm glad you like them.

511
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,340
I'm a useless father.

512
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,400
I couldn't give you anything.

513
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,800
All I could do is watch how much you work.

514
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,020
However, I'm not money minded.

515
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,610
I just wanted to do something for you.

516
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,580
Dad, you probably think
Duan Ran is a pampered

517
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,160
and irresponsible man.

518
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,400
However, I want to let you know

519
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,820
that those are your presumptions.

520
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,600
Though I understand you,

521
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,630
would you hear me out?

522
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,760
Of course.

523
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,010
Go ahead.

524
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,260
You know

525
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,150
I grew up in our small store.

526
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,170
Every day, I watched mum

527
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,450
run the store with our neighbours.

528
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,000
When I was young, I wanted

529
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,370
to be like mum.

530
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,430
I wanted to run my own business.

531
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,280
Because of this thought,

532
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,350
Duan Ran teased me.

533
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,690
He said I wasn't thinking big enough.

534
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,670
So what can I do?

535
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,310
I can only work and strive harder.

536
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,570
Then, I went to Rui Live for an interview

537
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,070
as a broadcaster.

538
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,270
After I became a broadcaster,

539
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,080
I wanted to be better.

540
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,620
After some ups and downs,

541
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,340
I became the CEO of Rui Live.

542
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,120
After I became CEO,

543
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,020
I've been doing my best
together with my staff.

544
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,570
We went through many hardships.

545
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,330
During the process,

546
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,670
Duan Ran and his family

547
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,950
supported me.

548
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,110
You knew that too.

549
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,930
We sold over thousands of bottled coffee

550
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,640
and signed a contract with Jiang Zhe Yang.

551
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,700
The interactive event was a success.

552
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,390
Honestly,

553
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,630
at least up till this point,

554
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,340
I find a sense of achievement

555
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,530
in what I'm doing.

556
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,920
Xi Xi.

557
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,390
You're amazing.

558
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm very proud of you.

559
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,070
How about this?

560
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,670
I'll participate in your company's event.

561
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,940
I'll do it for free.

562
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,560
-Really?
-Yes, for free.

563
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,640
As I watch you

564
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,470
come all the way over the years,

565
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,100
it's been very tough.

566
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,720
I shouldn't wrangle with Duan Ran

567
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,550
because of my emotions.

568
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,750
I've to help you out

569
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,690
as much as I can.

570
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,350
-Hold on.
-What are you laughing at?

571
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,940
What happened?

572
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,210
Is it the new clothes?

573
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,480
I barely recognize you.

574
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,500
I had a makeover.

575
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,240
I'm hungry.

576
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,990
Let's go get something to eat.

577
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,940
Should we drink?

578
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,300
Yes.

579
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,370
You're not allowed to consume
those weird drinks of yours.

580
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,630
-Fatty Jiang.
-Xi Xi, you're here.

581
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,440
You're early.

582
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,890
Yes.

583
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,540
Who is this?

584
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,030
Old Qian.

585
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,320
Your father?

586
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,750
Uncle.

587
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,290
-What a coincidence.
-Yes.

588
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,610
What a coincidence.

589
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,210
What a fate we share.

590
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,860
What do you mean?
We're primary schoolmates.

591
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,990
Uncle, your hair used to be long.

592
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,580
I couldn't recognize you
after the haircut.

593
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,490
My daughter styled me.

594
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,800
He looked hideous last time.

595
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,030
I couldn't take it anymore.

596
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,070
-Ms Ouyang.
-God, you freaked me out.

597
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,130
Yuan Yuan.

598
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,600
Ms Ouyang.

599
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,700
You're here.

600
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,110
In the finale,

601
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,830
the piano for our piano triet
performance will be here.

602
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,930
-It's over here.
-Okay.

603
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,270
-Uncle, let's practice together later.
-Sure.

604
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,540
By the way,

605
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,430
I'll be over here later.

606
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,190
-The host will be next to me.
-There are so many dishes.

607
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,850
-The rest would be here.
-Yes.

608
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,100
-Family?
-Forget it.

609
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,990
You should brief the flow of the program.

610
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,460
Sure, let's head over there.

611
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,200
It will shoot at you directly.

612
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,680
What?

613
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,320
There's a camera over here.

614
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,240
-The host is over there.
-Yes.

615
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,050
I'll be over there.

616
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,010
Right here.

617
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,290
The sales are pretty good.

618
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,780
-We will be seated here.
-Yes.

619
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,750
I'll be on stage.

620
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,640
I might ask you a question later.

621
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,720
Take it easy on me.

622
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,960
They are simple questions.

623
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,070
If there are difficult ones,
the host will inform you.

624
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,170
Where would the rest of you be?

625
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,880
I'll be cooking here.

626
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,130
-It's delicious.
-Isn't it?

627
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,240
-Wrap dumplings.
-Are you hungry?

628
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,470
When we film, do not

629
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,630
behave like a broadcaster.

630
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,300
-Hello, everyone. I'm Qian Xi Xi.
-That's it.

631
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,690
Hello, darlings.

632
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,930
You're live on scene with us right now.

633
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,840
Every episode,

634
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,820
they'd invite other guests

635
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,900
to share some stories. Then...

636
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,800
We managed to invite the mysterious man.

637
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,160
Jiang Zhe Yang, that's a great idea.

638
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,670
You're impressive.

639
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,340
The team suggested it.

640
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,630
What's this?

641
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,210
This smells really good.

642
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,360
Try it out.

643
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,520
This is the oil they used to fry fritters.

644
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,020
It smells good.

645
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,020
By the way...

646
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,410
Do you still cook?

647
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,660
Not anymore.

648
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,690
You know...

649
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,670
-You should...
-Are you alright?

650
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,530
Did you have breakfast?

651
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,720
It's not that.

652
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,650
It's too slippery and I'm wearing heels.

653
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,980
Yang Yang is the regular guest.

654
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,800
Continue.

655
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,510
What is this fish for?

656
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,240
You can talk to Yang Yang
about your daily life

657
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,710
or your experience as a broadcaster.

658
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,730
Talk about your experience as an actress.

659
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,460
Give it some thought and
inform Yang Yang later.

660
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,170
Think about...

661
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,360
Are you hungry?

662
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,940
I need some iron supplement.

663
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,140
-I just pretend.
-Fish is great.

664
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,240
Well,

665
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,810
we shouldn't waste the effort
of Mr Duan, am I right?

666
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,550
Go and discuss with Yang Yang.

667
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,190
Uncle Qian.

668
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,960
I think your composition is amazing.

669
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,910
You remind me of
the early Paul Simon.

670
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,760
-You realized that.
-Yes.

671
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,520
I love Paul Simon.

672
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,840
My music is influenced by him.

673
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,030
Really? I like him a lot too.

674
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,800
Yes, his music is more...

675
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,070
I prefer classical rock.

676
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,800
-His music is genuine.
-Exactly.

677
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,300
What are you guys talking about?

678
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,710
Xi Xi, let me tell you.

679
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,090
Xiao Jiang has great taste.

680
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,500
He likes Paul Simon.

681
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,320
He's a celebrity, it's not a surprise.

682
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,670
Xi Xi listens to Paul Simon
in her car too.

683
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,050
-Really?
-In terms of preferences,

684
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,940
you guys complement each other.

685
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,170
Don't you think so?

686
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,520
What are you talking about?

687
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,080
Don't be ridiculous.

688
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,469
-It might be the truth.
-I think so too.

689
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,889
-Uncle Qian is right.
-Don't you think so?

690
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,230
All of you are here.

691
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,040
What are you doing tonight?

692
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,820
Nothing.

693
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,280
Let's go for a drink together.

694
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,050
Sure.

695
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,210
Let's go.

696
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,920
Hold on.

697
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,090
Are you going out for a drink?

698
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,290
Leave the car to me.

699
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,130
I need the car.

700
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,210
You shouldn't drink and drive.

701
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,890
I'll get a driver.

702
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,530
Isn't that troublesome?

703
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,540
Not at all.

704
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,640
Let's go.

705
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,240
How about this, Uncle Qian?

706
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,260
I go to live houses very often.
They are great.

707
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,410
Do you want to

708
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,870
join me?

709
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,040
Sure.

710
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,070
Sure, I'll join you.

711
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,640
Have a seat.

712
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,860
I got you a drink. Cheers.

713
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,970
Here.

714
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,570
This song is pretty good.

715
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,970
What are you looking at?

716
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,450
I'm watching the performance.

717
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,370
I'm listening.

718
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,920
Jiang Zhe Yang.

719
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,170
The music is great.

720
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,340
Aren't you going to ask me for a dance?

721
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,710
A dance?

722
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,990
Are you drunk?

723
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,480
Have a drink.

724
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,740
You asked me out for a drink.

725
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,400
Here.

726
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,000
Jiang Zhe Yang,
I need to tell you something.

727
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,000
Remember back then

728
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,690
when we were in school...

729
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,010
Hold on, don't move.

730
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,620
Your hood is out of place.
Let me fix it for you.

731
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,500
It's done now.

732
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,710
Cheers.

733
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,370
Be careful, uncle.

734
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,230
Stop singing.

735
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,470
It's late.

736
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,590
Stop it. Everyone is asleep.

737
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,330
Stop singing along.

738
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,190
-Let's sing.
-Stop it.

739
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,340
I'm happy.

740
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,700
I'm happy.

741
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,890
I'm happy.

742
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,260
-I'm happy.
-Dad, be careful.

743
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,260
Stop singing.

744
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,840
-Let me.
-Let's go home.

745
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,510
-I'll sing with you at home.
-She won't let me sing.

746
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,930
-We will sing later.
-We will sing later.

747
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,250
Jiang Zhe Yang, I'll get the door.

748
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,660
Hurry up.

749
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,040
Goodness.

750
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,100
Old Qian, you're drunk.

751
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,710
Are you happy because
your son-in-law is here?

752
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,620
I'm very happy.

753
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,240
Exceptionally happy.

754
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,870
This is great.

755
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,100
I'm very happy.

756
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,780
My apologies, ma'am,

757
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,190
for bothering you.

758
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,080
-Excuse us.
-Don't worry about it.

759
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,180
Okay.

760
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,900
-See you.
-Come on, Uncle Qian.

761
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,230
-Hurry up.
-Watch the door.

762
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,120
Over here.

763
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,610
Don't drink and drive.

764
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,580
Come back here.

765
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,080
Give me the keys.

766
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,620
What? Come back here.

767
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,210
Stop moving around. I'm getting dizzy.

768
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,750
I'm not moving around.

769
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,250
Stop moving.

770
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,970
I'm not moving.

771
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,220
What's the matter?

772
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,090
I've a question.

773
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,480
What am I to you?

774
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,630
What kind of a person do you think I am?

775
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,790
You...

776
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,290
You're Ouyang Mei Xuan.

777
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,730
You don't say.

778
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,410
You're never sad.

779
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,570
Failure would never put you down.

780
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,390
You're decisive.

781
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,060
You never hesitate.

782
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,150
You're a heroine.

783
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,300
So did I disappoint you?

784
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:31,950
Right now, I lack self-confidence

785
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,960
and I'm not forgiving.

786
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,260
I'm not easy-going.

787
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,410
I think you're pretty easy-going.

788
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,120
Look.

789
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,820
You gave this to me on my birthday.

790
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,460
I still wear it.

791
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,380
I love it.

792
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,470
I love it very much.

793
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,680
It's true.

794
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,260
You know what's funny?

795
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,900
My dad gave me the

796
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,630
exact same thing.

797
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,370
Both of you have similar tastes.
How weird.

798
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,560
Which one am I wearing?

799
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,180
The one your dad gave you.

800
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,890
You lost a diamond from
the one I gave you.

801
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,610
You're right.

802
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,420
Your dad disapproved of us.

803
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,710
You told me you were six years older

804
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,140
and you wanted a career back here.

805
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,930
It was not a problem.

806
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,010
You should at least tell me

807
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,210
that I'm being dumped.

808
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,570
You're breaking up with me.

809
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,640
I was unaware.

810
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,060
What were you doing?

811
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,140
That was so unreasonable.
