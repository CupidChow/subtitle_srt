Mr Wu, Cloud Live is still

Speaking of Qian Xi Xi and Duan Ran,

the reason why I hire them

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,910
is not because they are capable.

90
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,970
I hire them

91
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,980
because we are childhood friends.

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,490

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,110
Sure.

If you really want her, just go ahead.

100
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,770
Of course I don't agree with it.

What should I do if you go for dinner?

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,520
Yes, lose weight.

110
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,420
Can we have a talk outside?

111
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,930
I have to excuse myself first.

00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,409
make yourself comfortable.

114
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,910
Sure.

115
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,700
Coffee is here, let's have a drink.

116
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,050
Speaking of Ding Ding,

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,400
obviously he is against me.

118
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,600
Duan Ran has left the company.

119
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,630
We should help each other more.

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,080
Look out for each other, right?

121
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,680
To safeguard our territory.

122
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,700
Now is the darkest period for the company.

123
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,990
We should really let go of our feud

124
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,340
to confront our common enemy.

125
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,840
To put it simply, I guess

126
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,740
we both share similar aestheticism.

127
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,060
We like the same style.

128
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,800
This is not even a feud at all.

129
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
No problem with that.

130
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,360
If Shen Ding Ding

131
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
harasses or bullies
you again, let me know.

132
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
This is his habit.

133
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,710
He loves to play with
beautiful girls since young.

134
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,130
Speaking of this,

135
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,960
don't worry.

136
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,600
For those who love idle talk in office,

137
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,960
I have my ways to deal with it.

138
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,710
If you didn't come in just now,

139
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,310
I would have punched him.

140
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,930
You saved him.

141
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,780
Come on.

142
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,330
You are gentle and elegant,

143
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,740
there is no way you could behave violent.

144
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,800
No one will buy it.

145
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,670
Violence against violence
is the way to curb him.

146
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,950
Why talk nonsense if we can attack.

147
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,650
It's simple, direct and violent.

148
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,600
New skills learned.

149
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,990
There's nothing wrong with it.

150
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,580
Uncle Duan.

151
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,590
Aunt Zhou.

Why did you buy so many egg tarts?

156
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,000
Bought?

157
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,430
Duan Ran made them?

158
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,770
Duan Ran.

159
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
Why are you making so many egg tarts?

160
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,400
Are you opening an egg tart shop?

161
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,250
Don't ask so much.

162

Since you are here,

163

just try it out.

164
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,930
This is already the fifth tray.

165
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,680
How are you going to finish them?

166
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,900
Who will eat it?

167
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,320
Don't ask or say anything.

168
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,430
Just give a try.

169
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,920
It's hot, quickly.

170

-It's hot!
-Wait!

171

Wait! Let it go!

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,890
Where's my sauce?

175
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,860
Uncle Duan.

176
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,230
How is your health?

177
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm good. I go fishing occasionally.

178
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,780
It's good to exercise
more during recovery.

179
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,180
Does this make a difference?

180
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,540
Just taste it.

181
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,260
Xi Xi.

182
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,050
-Please talk to him soon.
-What's wrong with him?

183
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,910
He has been like this for two days.

184
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,100
Working on egg tarts everyday.

185
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,600
Trying out all flavours.

186
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,330
We have to try all this mess.

187
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,530
We are really sick of it.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
Please talk to him.

189
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,940
Oh my God, there he goes again.

190
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,870
Do you want barbecue flavour?

191
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,400
I'll add some cumin for you.

192
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,230
After adding blueberry sauce,

193
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,070
it doesn't taste that good.

194
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,240
I'll try canned apricot later,

195
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,590
or add some apple sauce.

196
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,150
Have you tried cucumber egg tart before?

197
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,900
What happened?

198
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,440
Let me cuddle for a while.

202
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,300
I'm not being idle,

204
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,120
I'm quite busy these days.

205
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,610
I get up every day

206
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,680
to make egg tarts and desserts.

207
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,780
I have to work out every day too.

208
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,370
By the way, I bought a drum set

209
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,790
and it will arrive in two days.

210
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,380
I am going to do all the things

211

212

You are doing all these

213
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,220
just to make yourself look fulfilled.

214
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,430
Actually you are an escapist.

215
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,600
You are overthinking.

216
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,670
I'm just taking time to relax

217
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,300
and to get some rest.

218
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,370
To feel what real life is all about.

219
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,650
What about me?

220
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,870
Am I within your plan?

221
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,000
Of course.

222

You are my girlfriend.

223

How could it be possible without you?

224
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,040
Of course you are in my plan.

00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,270
Oh, Rui.

227
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,600
As for Rui, I think

228
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,460
by leaving it behind,

229
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,880
I'm getting closer to life,

230
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,920

231
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,770

Duan Ran.

233
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,170
I don't mean to persuade
you to go back Rui.

234
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,450
Because I know I can't
persuade you at all.

235
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,180
But have you ever thought that

236
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,730
Rui is not the only place

237
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,760
to realize our dreams.

238
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,320
There is still Cloud Live.

239
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,470
Cloud Live?

240
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,750
You can join Cloud Live and
be the pioneer with Chen Lang.

241
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,660
Jia Yun has resigned from Rui Live.

242
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,130
She's helping Chen Lang.

243
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,190
It's possible that

244
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,740
Cloud Live will be our new starting point.

245
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,470
You are too naive.

246
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,730
First of all, Shen Ding Ding
probably won't agree to it.

247
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,130
After joining Cloud Live,

248
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,960
aren't we doing the same things again?

249
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,310
The so-called restart

250
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,840
is to start these ideals,
ambitions and desires

251
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,470

252

all over again.

253
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,180
In the end,

254
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,240
it would just reconfirm my failure.

255
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,340
Why bother?

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,940
Isn't life like this?

257
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,670

258
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,840
and your talents and aspirations.

259
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,660
They are neither assumption nor fantasy.

260
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,200

261

do I look kind of intellectual?

289

It's too intellectual.

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,990
You are the most intellectual one.

291

I once worried as this is
only for the niche market.

292

People might not like it.

293

You are the first to buy.

In fact, niche market is not a concern.

296

Because the main concept of Vine

297

[Chat with the host]

349
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,100
As you know the main elements

350
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,680
of Vine series are denim

351
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,180
and our pleated designs.

352
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,420
We're still using

353
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,250
the re-utilization of denim fabric...

354
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,580

Yang Yang, do you have time now?

358
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,300
If you do, come to Rui.

359
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,450
I want to discuss something with you.

360
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,210
I have emphasized in advance that

361
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,140
I need double welt
seam for pleated fabric.

362
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,200
None of this batch of clothes have it.

363
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,150

I saw that this has ripped.

[You are in charge of the
factory. What have you done?]

366
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,280
Mr Ding, I've just appointed

367
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,460
Xi Xi two days ago.

368
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,910
I suppose this batch of clothes was

369
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,540
completed three days ago.

370
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,040
What should we do now?

371
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,160
The pre-sale is already live.

372
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,660
There are already thousands of orders.

373
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,060
Fans are discussing this batch of clothes.

374
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,150
If it is not shipped out on time,

375
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,520
fans will complain.

376
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,580
Why not we ship them first

377
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,270
and then recall the products.

378
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,630
No way.

379
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,170
We can't sell like this.

380
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,080
Exactly, isn't it deceiving consumers?

381
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,480
Besides, our brand

382
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,680
always strive for excellence.

383
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,750

384

Isn't this digging your own grave?

What is your opinion?

386
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,930
Redo everything?

[What did the factory say?]

388
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,040
As for the factory,

389
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,970
Xi Xi contacted the new OEM.

390
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,570
The boss has transferred some machines,

391
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,710
but still they can't make it.

392
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,590
Listen to me.

393
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,640
[Destroy this batch of products.]

394
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,840

Ouyang, Yang Yang.

398

Every piece of clothes from Vine

399
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,870
is all our hard work.

400
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,630
Since there are problems with the clothes,

401
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,950
I think they should not be destroyed.

402
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,210
We should try to salvage them
based on current conditions.

403

404

a designer's collection

441
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,170
that are ready to be
made into apparel products.

Yes this is urgent.

Can I talk to your manager?

447

You can't accept it, is that so?

We're hoping to cooperate with you.

-Great!
-but it's too costly.

460

Our core business is live commerce.

Then we can meet up to
talk about some details.

Why?

The clothes in their own factory

466

has already piled up.

-I won't call Xin Si Le then.
-Forget them.

468
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,840
I was about to call them.

469
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,420
Sorry,

470
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,480

Hello, this is Rui Live.

473
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,340
You don't need to call them.

474
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,200
They don’t make clothes any more.

475
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,250
Yu Shi, be careful.

476
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,670
Mainly about live streaming e-commerce.

477
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,170
It's fine.

478
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,880
Stop calling Sicheng Garment.

479
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,940
Which one? Sicheng Garment?

480
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,140
Yes, they're no longer making clothes.

481
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,200
Take a look.

482
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,290
Now Chenghui, Huali and Xin Jia Le

483
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,220
all think our quantity is too big.

484
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,750
They are not able to commit.

485
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,310
These are the few reliable OEMs left.

486
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,210
We talked to some more in the morning.

487
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,100
Let's call and communicate once again.

488
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,030
By putting together
our Vine design concept,

489
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,100
the outcome we want,

490
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,160
our requested amount,

491
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,180
including their price,
let’s communicate again.

492
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,990
Aren't there three companies
that have agreed

493
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,390
to let us visit tomorrow?

494
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,520
In case we go tomorrow
and find that it’s unreliable,

495
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,780
what should we do then?

496
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,460
We have to call again.

497
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,770
I need to take a call.

498
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,160
-Yu Shi
-This Hu Li Enterprise...

[Why did you video call me?]

501
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,730
[What can I do for you?]

502
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,890
Nothing much.

503
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,650
I just wanted to chat
since it's been a while.

504
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,170
What are you doing now?

505
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,810
[Nothing much, just busy at office.]

506
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,360
Busy?

507
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,010
[You don't look good. What's wrong?]

508
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,110
Is it?

509
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,310
I'm fine. Everything's good.

510
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,480
Perhaps it is caused by
the lighting of this office.

511
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,210
I'm fine, don't worry about it.

512
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,600
Bad lighting?

513
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,010
You think I'm stupid?

514
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,960
I knew about Uncle Duan.

515
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,030
He is no longer the chairman.

516
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,560
You're not the CEO any more.

517
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,020
Who told you this?

518
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,310
There's no way to hide
such a big matter from me.

519
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,610
[Dad, listen to me.]

520
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,930
I'm fine.

521
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,700
Doesn't matter if I'm the CEO
of Rui or not.

522
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,940
I will do my best to protect it.

523
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,040
How could my mother
arranged this blind date?

524
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
She is such a fool.

525
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,160
Why would we need such a blind date?

526
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,650
Isn't it good enough to
have a wine session?

527
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,520
Aunty talked to me yesterday.

528
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,260
She told me that you've almost

529
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,780
turned into a patisserie at home.

530
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,190
She asked me to come and meet you.

531
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,860
My mother is still worried about me.

532
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,930
She is such a cautious person,

533
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,840
always careful and
attentive to everything.

534
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,440
Something happened at home recently,

535
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,140
I think my mother should be
the one to be worried about.

536
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,990
I should be the one worrying.

537
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,080
When she asked me about this yesterday,

538
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,570
I was reluctant at first.

539
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,730
But I still came today.

540
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,130
Firstly, I really want to
comfort and talk to you.

541
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,430
But more importantly,  It's for myself.

542
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,490
You do know why I
went to Rui Live earlier.

543
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,380
I know you do.

544
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,830
At that time,

545
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,650
the streaming cancellation
happened again in Rui Live.

546
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,680
So I thought

547
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,650
I could help you out
more or less over there,

548
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,240
to overcome the challenge.

549
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,110
I also hoped that you could see my

550
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,090
good intentions.

551
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,970
You know how strong my self-esteem is.

552
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,950
For words that I have no confidence,

553
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,480
and things that I'm unsure,

554
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,170
I won't do it, and I won't say it.

555
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,270
But when it comes to you,

556
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,930
my self-esteem is thrown out the window.

557
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,490
So I decided,

558
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,940
whether or not
you know what I'm going to say,

559
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,810
or if I'm going to get
an unfavourable reply today,

560
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,790
I still have to say this.

561
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,920
I still love you.

562
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,860
Come and stay with me for a while.

563
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,230
Relax.

564
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,160
[You want me to go abroad?]

565
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,230
You'll know when you come.

566
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,920
It is scarcely populated over here.

567
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,690
Although there's nothing else here,

568
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,210
but there is time for you to be alone.

569
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,020
Dad, I am a mature adult.

570
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,180
I can take responsibility for my own life.

571
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,150
Just mind your own business.

572
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:10,640
Silly girl, you're reluctant
to hurt this one,

573
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,850
and you need to protect that one.

574
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,150
[I'm thinking of the consequences.]

575
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,380
[In the end...]

576
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,780
[In the end, you suffer alone.]

577
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,070
[You end up getting hurt.]

578
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,370
What are you trying to imply

579
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,190
through this late-night call?

580
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,530
In fact, I'm too far away from you.

581
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,980
I can't reach you. I'm anxious, you know?

582
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,900
[I don't know how to help you either.]

583
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,740
I wish I could be like
how you protect Rui Live,

584
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,410
to protect you by your side.

585
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,050
Thanks, Dad.

586
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,410
Ouyang.

587
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,960
Qian Xi Xi is my lover now.

588
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,170
It's impossible for us to be together.

589
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,610
Xi Xi and I grew up together.

590
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,910
Over the years,

591
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,170
our feelings for each other...

592
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,910
We lived under the
same roof since young.

593
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,750
We shared everything
from food to personal belongings.

594
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,090
I even let her drive my precious car
for so long

595
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,810
yet I don't mind at all.

596
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,510
Then Jiang Zhe Yang appeared suddenly.

597
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,200
After his appearance,

598
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,610
I began to notice that

599
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,670
if Xi Xi and Jiang Zhe Yang...

600
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,570
were getting too close,

601
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,330
I would be unhappy about it.

602
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,070
Sometimes the way they interact,

603
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,110
the way they talk, made me furious.

604
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,500
Fact is, I was jealous.

605
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,700
I'm jealous of the relationship

606
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,990
between Qian Xi Xi and Jiang Zhe Yang,

607
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,650
but I couldn't say it out loud.

608
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,950
I dare not face my relationship at first.

609
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,470
After that I learned

610
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,030
there is no way to escape from it.

611
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,590
Actually it's not that scary after all

612
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,020
to hear it from your own mouth.

613
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,050
It's not so scary after all.

614
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,480
We have known each other for so long.

615
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,260
We should know each other's
temperament very well.

616
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,840
Although I'm telling you straight up

617
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,320
but it will hurt you still.

618
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,900
But I think I still have to tell you,

619
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,100
I want to tell you. I think telling you

620
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,610
is far better than

621
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,190
saying nothing at all
and pretend to be a fool.

622
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,130
I would be a bad guy to behave such a way.

623
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,430
The consequence from that is in fact

624
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,180
the most hurtful thing to you.

625
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,970
That's good.

626
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,720
There's no need for you to apologize.

627
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,230
What you said today is really good.

628
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,220
It's really sincere,

629
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,460
It's simply Duan Ran.

630
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,170
Go directly to the fourth floor.

631
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,670
It's inconvenient for me to move around.

632
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,460
I won't meet you downstairs then.

633
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,530
I wait for you at the lift.

634
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,370
It's easy to spot me
as I'm on a walking stick.

635
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,800
Yes, I'll wait by the lift.

636
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:32,990
Okay.

637
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,120
Are you Mr Duan's mother?

638
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,480
Yes, I am.

639
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,420
Mr Duan is not here.

640
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,430
Is Xi Xi here? I'm looking for her.

641
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,310
Yes, she is.

642
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,720
Before I came today,

643
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,630
I had no expectations.

644
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,420
As for my mission at Rui,
I think it's done.

645
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,720
So I plan to leave.

646
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,650
I understand.

647
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,370
Still I want to thank you.

648
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,280
Thank you for being here to help out

649
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,210
during the the most difficult time.

650
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,780
Thank you as you've done

651
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,030
so much for Rui Live and for me.

652
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,080
I sincerely do.

653
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,040
You don't have to thank me.
I volunteered myself.

654
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,429
Speaking of Vine.

655
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,510
This independent brand

656
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,530
is doing well now.

657
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,290
Although some problems crept up,

658
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,830
but I can see that

659
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,989
Shen Jiang Tao really values ​​it.

660
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,590
Since I'm leaving,

661
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,840
why don't you take over?

662
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,290
Forget it.

663
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,920
I'm no longer with Rui Live.

664
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,670
I don't have a company either.

665
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,790
There's neither resources nor people.

666
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,450
To take over it is to damage it.

667
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,070
Don’t you realize it's a bargaining chip

668
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,830
to serve as a good
opportunity for you to go back?

669
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,600
If that's the case,

670
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,440
just do me another favour.

671
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,990
Let Xi Xi do it.

672
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,610
[Duan Ran]

673
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,250
Aunt Zhou.

674
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,670
What brings you here today
and why such a hurry?

675
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,870
You even come to the office personally.

676
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,550
I just want to ask you out alone.

677
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,880
Let's have a talk.

678
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,620
Your phone.

679
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,820
[Duan Ran]

680
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,140
Why don't you answer Duan Ran's call?

681
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,480
There's nothing important about his call.

682
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,280
I will call him later.
I want to listen to you first.

683
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,920
Xi Xi.

684
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,410
You stayed in our home for years.

685
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,900
How are Uncle Duan and I treating you?

686
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Both of you have been very nice to me.

687
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,450
All these years you both

688
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,820
raised me like your own daughter.

689
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,220
You have been very
accepting, understanding.

690
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,460
You took care of me since I was young,

691
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,280
You gave me a carefree life

692
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,210
and showed me the warmth of a family.

693
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,290
I'm contented.

694
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,830
This...

695
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,880
The feeling of being lovers,

696
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,770
is it different from being siblings?

697
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,190
Aunt Zhou.

698
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,820
Leave Duan Ran.

699
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,120
I can't accept you two being together.

700
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,800
Why?

701
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,670
There's something

702
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,860
in my heart

703
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,750
which I've kept hidden for 13 years.

704
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,540
Xi Xi.

705
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,590
Your mother's death had
something to do with me.

706
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,530
I made an unforgivable mistake.

707
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,820
That's impossible.

708
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,440
My mother died in a car accident.

709
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,320
It was me.

710
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,340
What happened?

711
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,570
Why are you drinking so much again?

712
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,720
Come and take off your clothes.

713
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,350
Can't you drink a little less?

714
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,890
You've been like day everyday.

715
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,120
[Those days]

716
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,470
[were the darkest period in my life.]

717
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,590
[Uncle Duan has just started his career.]

718
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,290
[He was drinking and
socializing so often.]

719
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,610
[We are running late.

720
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,970
Let me stop by for a while.

721
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,650
-I'll be back right away.
-[Every day, after attending to Duan Sr,]

722
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,310
[I had to take care of Duan Jr.]

723
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,950
[It was never ending.]

724
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,350
[I couldn't seem to see the end
of such a life.]

725
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,620
[During that period of time,]

726
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,380
[I often dragged your
mother along for a drink.]

727
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,190
[She had something to do that night.]

728
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,590
[I insisted her to go to the bar.]

729
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,720
[We were having a good time.]

730
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,130
Are you happy?

731
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,490
Of course.

732
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,340
But you tricked me just now.

733
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,030
-I did not.
-Yes, you did.

734
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,490
-No.
-I told you best two out of three.

735
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,630
I beat you twice.

736
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,800
-You said you didn't lose.
-But one more game is left.

737
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,900
Fine.

738
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,490
Let's do it one more round.

739
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,980
This final game decides the winner.

740
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,050
Ready.

741
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,280
Open!

742
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,560
Nothing.

743
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,140
You...

744
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,910
-You tricked me again.
-Alright.

745
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,850
-I won't tease you any more.
-The last game.

746
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:16,280
Rock paper scissors.

747
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,320
I lost.

748
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,470
I won so you go to buy some alcohol.

749
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,700
-Two bottles?
-No, four bottles.

750
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,460
Okay, four bottles.

751
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,010
-Go quick, I'll wait for you.
-Okay.

752
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,780
Isn't it just four bottles?

753
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,220
Someone got hit by a car.

754
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,250
-Someone got hit.
-Let's go and see.

755
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,650
After your mother passed away,

756
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,740
we failed to reach your father.

757
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:08,160
Out of guilt and self-blame...

758
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,720
And of course

759
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,370
responsibility,

760
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,400
I must raise you up on
behalf of your mother.

761
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,470
I want you to grow up healthy and happy.

762
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,870
Guilt.

763
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,320
Self-blame.

764
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,110
Aunt Zhou, do you know?

765
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,900
For all these years,

766
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,460
the way you look at me at home,

767
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,760
I always thought it was somehow weird.

768
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,140
As if I've said something wrong

769
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,430
or I did something wrong again.

770
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,290
I upset you and you were angry.

771
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,080
So it's all because of this incident.

772
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,640
In that case, why didn't
you tell me earlier?

773
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,760
Xi Xi.

774
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,330
Every time I see you,

775
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,710
I wanted to tell you.

776
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,570
But I can't seem to utter the words.

777
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,450
I'm afraid you won't forgive me.

778
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,810
I wanted to raise you up first.

779
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,340
When you are capable,

780
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,770
you can be independent then.

781
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,020
However,

782
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,570
now you're in love with Duan Ran.

783
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,090
This is something I can't face, you know?

784
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,070
I...

785
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,810
I don't want to see you again every day.

786
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,120
I don't want to live in
such a shadow any more.

787
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,430
Because of your self-blame,
you want to atone for it.

788
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,110
You chose to keep me by your side.

789
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,090
Raised me up.

790
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,700
And because you think I won't forgive you,

791
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,950
you chose not to tell me and
concealed it from me.

792
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,760
Now because of you again,

793
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,870
because you don't want to face me
any more,

794
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,320
you forbid Duan Ran and I to be together.

795
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,950
It's all about what you want,

796
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,220
how you like it to be.

797
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,860
Have you ever considered me
when you did all these?
