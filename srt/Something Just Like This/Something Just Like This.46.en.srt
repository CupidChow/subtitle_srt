Please calm down.

11
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,160
Rui Live overcame many
obstacles over the years.

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,000
We're very experienced.

13

Due to this contingency
affected by the weather,

based on my knowledge,

Jiang Zhe Yang is coming all the way
from Beijing to attend the event.

48
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,230
With the current situation,

49
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,760
none of the planes can land.

50
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,110

Where else would I be?
I'm still in Beijing.

Forget it.

57

but all of the flights were cancelled.

59

What did QE say?

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,060

I kindly advised Shen Ding Ding

to watch out for contingencies.

67

He didn't take my advise

68
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,250
and insulted me instead.

69
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,670

They want me to figure something out.

77
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,830
What can I do?

78
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,630
I can only talk to the logistics company

79
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,760
and criticise them. What else can I do?

80

Duan Ran and I are seizing
every opportunity we can.

91

Don't you think the red alert today

If we manage to salvage the event,

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
Shen Jiang Tao has no choice but to agree.

99
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,100
We're saving Rui Live and QE.

100

To us,

101

this is the moment we've been waiting for.

102
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,090
It's our shot to prove

103
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,230
the excellence of a live broadcast.

104

I told you there's a typhoon.

111

I told you not to come out.

I didn't know it was
going to rain so heavily.

It's heavy rain.

You're finally here.

122

All of the goods are still here.

124

-Hurry up and take us there.

-What's the plan?
-It's ready.

132
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,830
Take this. We will split up.

133
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,580
Pack up all the equipment from
the central control centre

134
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,090
and meet up with Yu Shi.

135
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,260
I'll leave the broadcasting
training of all QE employees to you.

-What about you?
-I'm heading

137

to Rui with Mr Five and Su Su.

138
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,990
We will persuade Shen Ding Ding

139
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,830
to employ a live broadcast

140
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,490
to guarantee Vine's
product release on time.

141
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,890
There aren't any local broadcasters
in Fuzhou right now.

142
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,060
Don't forget.

143
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,390
Hai and Fen promised

144
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,930
to transport all the goods

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,510
from Fuzhou by today.

146

Hello, Xi Xi.

What? Head to Rui?

152
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,310
You chose these outfits
for me, didn't you?

153
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,310
Change it!

154
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,410
Everybody, get to work!

155
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,070
Mr Shen,
are we still broadcasting tonight?

156
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,670
Of course.

157
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,910
Hurry and recruit new broadcasters!

158
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,420
Where's Cola and Little Duckling?

159
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,510
I told them to arrive earlier.

160
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,970
They couldn't catch a cab,
so we sent the driver to pick them up.

161
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,940
What are you two doing?
Are you done?

162
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,890
Get back down here and get to work.

163
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,270
Mr Shen, my apologies. I'm late.

164
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,950
The rain was too heavy.

165
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,700
-I couldn't catch a cab.
-Who are you?

166
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,310
Hello, I'm the new broadcaster.

167
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,870
-I'm Zhao Xin Ran.
-You're a broadcaster.

168
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,390
Head to back and pick out your outfits.

169
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,790
Don't make me take care of you.
I've no time.

170
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,610
How could you say that?

171
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm trying my best too.

172
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,250
If you're not going to care,
I don't care either.

173
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,200
Hold on, Zhao Xin Ran. Come back.

174
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,420
Come back here!
I'll place you as the first broadcaster.

175
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,820
It's a chance of a lifetime!

176
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,990
Are young women these days

177
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,720
unable to take a harsher tone?

178
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,960
Mr Shen, the chairman called.

179
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,090
He asked when you'll start the stream.

180
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,960
Hello, Dad.

181
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
We might not able to broadcast tonight.

182
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,190
Should we just...

183
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,590
You're not broadcasting?

184
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,750
Stop kidding me.

185
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,050
[I don't have a choice. It's a storm.]

186
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
I can't broadcast casually anyway.

187
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm sure the board will understand.

188
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,950
What are you talking about?

189
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,940
[What should we do now?]

190
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,270
[I don't have a choice.]

191
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,700
This is the only way.

192
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,409
Let the board know that

193
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,669
this is my responsibility.

194
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,870
I'll deal with the consequences.

195
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,240
It has nothing to do with you.

196
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,230
Brat.

197
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,890
They know you're my son.

198
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,590
Look.

199
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,240
This just happened at Jinjiang.

200
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,040
Look the roof is blown away.

201
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,430
The rain is horrible.

202
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,710
Will I be able to go home today?

203
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,040
Go home?

204
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,160
Are you thinking about going home?

205
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,730
Tonight is QE Nights.

206
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,580
It might be cancelled.

207
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,300
Are they going to cancel the event?

208
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,390
Really?

209
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,190
I thought they are
engaging in investments.

210
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,360
If the event is cancelled,

211
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,500
our employer will not be paid.

212
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,230
What happens if
he doesn't receive investments?

213
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,480
He's going to lay employees off.

214
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,400
It isn't that bad.

215
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,360
I heard the average
sales performance of Rui

216
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,610
are pretty great.

217
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,180
They wouldn't lay employees off.

218
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,350
The promoters will be terminated,

219
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,580
not the broadcasters.

220
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,550
Think about it. The goods are being
sold online by the online celebrities.

221
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,870
They no longer need us.

222
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,730
Let's go.

223
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,920
Xiao You.

224
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,050
Mr Duan, you're here.

225
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,500
I'll resolve the problem

226
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,400
of inadequacy in offline sales.

227
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,410
That's great.

228
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,550
I want all the promoters
of the entire mall

229
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,130
to become broadcasters.

230
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,570
Everyone shall sell their products

231
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,830
before a video camera.

232
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,950
Please help recruit

233
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,780
promoters who are expressive.

234
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,700
Chen Lang will give them a brief training.

235
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,660
I'll talk to Uncle Shen about this.

236
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,760
-Sounds good?
-Yes.

237
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,750
-I'll leave it to you.
-Sure.

238
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,010
-All right.
-Go ahead.

239
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,540
What do you think?

240
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,100
Are you ready?

241
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,480
We

242
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,690
are becoming broadcasters?

243
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,370
What's wrong with that?

244
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,200
I've been in this industry
for over ten years.

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,510
I believe in my proficiency.

246
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,740
When you're in front of the camera,

247
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,630
do not be nervous. Speak slowly.

248
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,050
Take the viewers

249
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,250
as the most difficult client.

250
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,020
Break the client with the gentlest words.

251
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,000
Touch them.

252
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,590
You will have no problem handling that.

253
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,630
I brought the necessary equipment.

254
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,340
Within ten minutes, I can transform

255
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,580
all of you into professional broadcasters.

256
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,360
Goodness. I can't believe
we will become broadcasters.

257
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,300
Give it a shot.

258
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,600
Why isn't anyone here?

259
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,390
The office is empty.

260
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,640
Where's everyone?

261
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,220
Ding Ding.

262
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,270
Ding Ding!

263
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,020
No one is here.

264
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,060
What's going on?

265
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,950
What happened?

266
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,300
The central control room empty as well.

267
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,680
It's raining out there. Why are you here?

268
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,590
Ms Yu, I wanted to ask you.

269
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,390
Why is the office empty?

270
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,750
Mr Shen left.

271
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,110
Everyone left as well.

272
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,140
The rain isn't stopping for a while.

273
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,220
I'm going home after packing up.

274
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,270
You should hurry up and go home too.

275
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,870
I'm leaving.

276
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,250
What's going on? Why did everyone leave?

277
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,110
It's fine.

278
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,780
The three of us is enough.

279
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,120
What's the matter, Uncle Shen?

280
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,460
Are you in a bad mood?

281
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,310
Did you come to laugh at my misery?

282
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,340
You've been through plenty of challenges.

283
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,810
I don't have time right now to

284
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,280
listen to your lecture.

285
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,430
Yes, I understand.

286
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,600
I'll make it short.

287
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,950
Uncle Shen, I came for one reason.

288
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,020
I want to show you something.

289
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,390
Look, place this behind you later.

290
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,720
-Sure.
-Make sure the batteries are full.

291
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,810
I need two pieces here.

292
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,020
Each of you get one.

293
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,650
Uncle Shen, look.

294
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,480
This is the new release
of Vine's latest season.

295
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,360
Yes.

296
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,040
We already got the self-pickup authorised

297
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,570
at the warehouse in Fuzhou.

298
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,700
The amateur broadcasters trained by Xi Xi

299
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,060
are already at Fuzhou.

300
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,310
They are awaiting
instructions at the warehouse.

301
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,390
All of your equipment
are wrapped with ponchos.

302
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,580
Yes, we prepared this beforehand.

303
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
Thus, Uncle Shen,

304
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,630
we only need your agreement.

305
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,020
If you do not agree to the
cooperation between Cloud and QE,

306
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
I'll ask them to leave immediately.

307
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,780
If you agree to the cooperation
between Cloud and QE,

308
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,140
QE Nights will begin at once.

309
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,110
Look at the way you run the business.

310
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,020
My foolish son can't be compared to you.

311
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,840
I'm not alone.

312
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,150
It's the strength of my team.

313
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
At this point,

314
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,990
I've to admit,

315
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,710
Ran Ran.

316
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,100
No, I mean Mr Duan.

317
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,460
Congratulations to Cloud Live as

318
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,810
the new partner of QE.

319
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,710
Sure, thanks Uncle Shen.

320
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,740
[Fen, don't button up.]

321
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,090
[Your collarbone looks really pretty.]

322
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,850
[Yes, unbutton it.]

323
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,800
Remove one more button.

324
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,580
That's right. Don't move.

325
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,190
Do I look good?

326
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,350
Yes.

327
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,150
As for you two's skin tone,

328
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,230
adjusting the beautifying mode to 40

329
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,990
suits you guys best.

330
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,630
Looking good.

331
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,150
Like I said,

332
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,340
melt their hearts.

333
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,130
Place all the products

334
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,370
on display later.

335
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,020
Do not rush into making the

Don't you think

this is a great business strategy?

777
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,990
We adopted the values of physical stores,

778
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,010

779
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,740
with the products
directly and intuitively.

780
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,990
It's brilliant.

781
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,970
I'm announcing a proposal

782
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,820
to the board tomorrow.

783
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,670
I will propose to convert the use
of physical retail stores

784
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,030
into online sales.

785
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,570
The physical stores will be

786
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,340
made into restaurants and an
entertainment centre for families.

787
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,940
Do you understand?

788
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,550
The board isn't completely buying it.

789
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,990
They are too conservative.

790
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,380
They are used to this chronic death.

791
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,870
If you can show up as the son of
Duan Sheng Yun...

792
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,670
The board would think

793
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,530
that the son of Mr Duan is on board.

794
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,370
That also means Mr Duan is on board.

795
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,030
They'd change their opinions about you.

796
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,590
I do not run before a fight.

797
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,580
You're still young.

798
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,700
Once you're as experienced as I am,

799
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,030
you'd understand.

800
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,460
I get it.

801
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,380
Terminating all physical stores

802
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,880
and turning them into
an entertainment centre?

803
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,460
This is too risky.

804
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,060
The execution is very difficult.

805
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,790
I'm reserving my opinion.

806
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,580
Before questioning the
restructuring I proposed,

807
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,250
first let me show you

808
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,550
the financial report.

809
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,870
Besides real estates,

810
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,580
everything else is depreciating.

811
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,060
The withdrawal rates are predicted

812
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,510
to exceed 15% next year.

813
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,030
We will not be able to

814
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,790
receive rent from vacant properties.

815
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,090
Why did I organise QE Nights?

816
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,909
I wanted everyone to understand

817
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,960
that physical retailing
is going out of trend.

818
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,350
I deployed e-commerce channels beforehand

819
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,800
to eliminate all our concerns.

820
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,510
I want to exploit the
highest value of real estate.

821
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,940
Let him in.

822
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,909
Who is it?

823
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,840
Ran Ran.

824
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,449
Hello, fellow investors.

825
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:50,340
I reviewed the proposal of

826
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,270
Uncle Shen in detailed last night.

827
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,570
I acknowledge that we're facing

828
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,310
some problems on this aspect.

829
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,120
However, with the current state,

830
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,150
I think Uncle Shen's
proposal will not work.

831
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,940
In my opinion, QE right now

832
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,830
isn't capable of restructuring right now.

833
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,700
However, with the current foundation,

834
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,460
we can shift closer to a
comprehensive model.

835
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,150
That would definitely work.

836
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,450
QE right now is a ship

837
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,390
at full capacity.

838
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,060
At this moment, we need to

839
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,850
minimise the burdens of this ship.

840
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,580
We shall utilise the Internet
and diversified operations

841
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,070
to speed the boat up.

842
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,160
We shouldn't

843
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,470
transform her into a plane in one go.

844
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,510
All plans to reform a business strategy

845
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,510
requires practicality.

846
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,530
In this proposal,

847
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:59,070
we shall propose a
cooperation consisting of

848
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,900
four major sections with
Rui Live and Cloud Live.

849
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,220
Brand broadcasting.

850
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,700
Private labels.

851
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,060
Live streaming.

852
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,550
Sinking market.

853
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,110
Through these four major sections,

854
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,940
we will make QE the landmark

855
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,670
of consumers' daily lives.

856
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,270
We will turn QE into a major lead

857
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,110
of the e-commerce industry.

858
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,950
Is this your proposal?

859
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,070
This was my dad's proposal.

860
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,860
Mr Duan was waiting for me.

861
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,380
Uncle Shen, you once said that,

862
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,140
we

863
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:41,590
do not bear family feud
or personal grudges.

864
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,380
Hence, I'm viewing this objectively

865
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,180
for QE's sake.

866
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,650
As usual,

867
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,840
we shall vote by a show of hands.

868
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,140
I agree

869
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,710
to the second proposal.

870
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,260
Me too.

871
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,460
Me too.

872
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,570
I agree.

873
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,500
Hello, sir. Welcome to I Do.

874
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,860
How can I help you?

875
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,220
I'm picking something
out for my girlfriend.

876
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,690
The ring on the display window

877
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,860
looks attractive.

878
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,670
Let me introduce the brand.

879
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,750
I Do is a jewellery brand
that preserves happiness.

880
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,930
This is the I Do's Tower diamond ring.

881
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,990
The design derived from the Eiffel Tower.

882
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,380
The rubies on the side represents

883
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,140
the fiery passion of love.

884
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,720
This is perfect for a proposal.

885
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,510
She'd say I do to a proposal with I Do.

886
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,830
Here.

887
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,840
Help me check out my mix of bait.

888
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,970
It's too wet.

889
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,570
It's going to sink at once.

890
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
I need to help you out.

891
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,590
How long has it been since
we last went fishing?

892
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,450
Don't ask me. I don't know either.

893
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,300
I used to choose the locations

894
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,890
while you mix the bait and cast the net.

895
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,420
We would always score big.

896
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,860
Zhou Jie complains

897
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,520
every time we fish together,

898
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,580
we have to eat fish for the whole week.

899
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,100
I'm not sure when

900
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,720
I was left to fish alone.

901
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,990
When did you prepare the proposal?

902
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,460
Back when QE was making a loss.

903
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,100
You said not to mess with QE

904
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,310
but you did it faster than anyone.

905
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,590
If I knew you had a plan,

906
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,180
I wouldn't have...

907
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,110
There are no ifs.

908
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,820
If you hadn't expelled me,

909
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,430
I wouldn't have the time

910
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,590
to reflect, think and read.

911
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,360
I wouldn't have the time to

912
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,690
construct the plan for restructuring.

913
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,040
Do you blame me?

914
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,730
Of course I do.

915
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,250
From then on,

916
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,080
I lost a great guy to fish with.

917
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,730
You're such a liar.

918
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,970
However, after listening to you,

919
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,640
I feel better.

920
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,560
Shen, the next time I call
you out on a fishing trip,

921
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,360
you mustn't reject me.

922
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,030
Don't worry.

923
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,600
Your best fishing companion

924
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,010
will not abandon you.

925
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,720
You probably won't have the time to soon.

926
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,980
Although the plan is devised,

927
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,740
it is still a long way to go.

928
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,080
The board isn't exactly unified.

929
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,670
Come on, Duan.

930
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,320
You're expecting me to
continue to be in charge.

931
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,800
Of course.

932
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,800
Stop kidding me.

933
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,650
It was your plan.

934
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,530
Your son, Ran Ran proposed it.

935
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,970
If you put me in charge,

936
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,460
I'd probably need to
babysit your son in QE.

937
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,490
Don't say that.

938
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,010
We cannot do this without each other.

939
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,920
Like I said,

940
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,760
I'd choose a location to fish,

941
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,450
while you mix the bait and cast the net.

942
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,110
Look.

943
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,110
You'd always catch more fishes than I do.

944
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,010
Your ability to execute is great.

945
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,930
If you're not going to execute the plan,

946
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,330
who else can I confide in?

947
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,490
Just do it.

948
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,490
I trust you, partner.

949
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,180
The fish took the bait.

950
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,840
-It caught the bait.
-It's a huge fish.

951
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,170
Come and give me a hand, Duan.

952
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,460
You said we can't do this
without each other.

953
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,420
Come on.

954
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,140
You're leaving everything to me.

955
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,120
[Ding Ding is a fool.]

956
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,080
[Naive, gullible and dumb.]

957
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,110
[Ding Ding is a fool.]

958
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,120
[Naive, gullible and dumb.]

959
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,990
[This is my Buster Sonic.]

960
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,800
[You're lying. This belongs to Duan Ran.]

961
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,140
[I lent it to him.]

962
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,330
[He's going to combine my car]

963
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,950
[and his car into a new one.]

964
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,360
[A new car?]

965
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,320
[Duan Ran gave us your car.]

966
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,060
[Are you still waiting like a fool]

967
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,970
[to turn the car into an eight-wheeler?]

968
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,570
[Naive, gullible and dumb.]

969
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,900
[Ding Ding is a fool.]

970
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,010
[Naive, gullible and dumb.]

971
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,360
[Ding Ding is a fool.]

972
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,240
What's up?

973
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,120
Duan Ran.

974
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,490
Since things unfolded this way,

975
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,080
let's be frank with each other.

976
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,160
I pushed you and Xi Xi

977
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,470
right to the bottom.

978
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,450
I thought you had no chance
of overturning the situation.

979
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,570
You persisted and

980
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,210
defeated me.

981
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,750
Why? Why do you hate me so much?

982
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,050
Why are you bullying me?

983
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,780
Do you really hate me that much?

984
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,010
It has nothing to do with you.

985
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,430
We persisted

986
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,360
because we're passionate
about this industry.

987
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,840
I like my job.

988
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:23,520
This industry is unpredictable.

989
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,530
It's always changing.

990
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,600
It's not very attractive either.

991
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,670
However, it's primitive,

992
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,450
direct and lively.

993
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,330
I find it stimulating.

994
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,840
Every form of acceptance and expression

995
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,930
are only separated by a screen.

996
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,330
I can't find anything
as thrilling as this.

997
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,600
I believe

998
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,280
that this industry

999
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,760
will soon appear as a giant.

1000
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,070
Right now,

1001
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,280
at this very moment,

1002
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,880
I need to give it my all.
