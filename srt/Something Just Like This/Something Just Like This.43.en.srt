[Episode 43]

4
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,580
You felt guilty and wanted to make amends.

5
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,450
So you chose to care for me,

6
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,180
to bring me up.

7
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,900
You thought I wouldn't forgive you,

8
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,810
so you hide it from me.

9
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,900
And now, because of you,

10
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,900
because you can't face me,

11
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,500
you won't let me see Duan Ran.

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,150
Everything is about your needs

13
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,370
and your wants.

14
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,220
Did you ever consider how I'd feel?

15
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,490
Xi Xi.

16
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,460
I beg you.

17
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,180
Stop tormenting me.

18
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,650
Good evening, Mr Duan Jr.

19
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,250
Madam Li.

20
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,770
Have you seen Xi Xi?

21
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,649
No. I was busy the whole day.

22
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,390
Carry on with your work.

23
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,370
This is the one.

24
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,050
Mr Yu.

25
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,820
Mr Duan Jr.

26
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,210
Have you seen Xi Xi?

27
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,450
You're looking for Xi Xi?

28
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,850
Aunt Zhou was here today.

29
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,370
She took Xi Xi out.

30
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,490
I see.

31
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,920
Carry on with your work.

32
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,800
Mr Duan Jr.

33
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,930
Mr Duan, Mr Duan.

34
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,100
Mr Duan, I want to talk to you.

35
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,500
Just call me Duan Ran.

36
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,930
I should call you Mr Yu from now on.

37
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,860
Mr Duan, I know you hate me.

38
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,650
I also hate myself.

39
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,590
I don't deserve the title.

40
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,250
Please don't mock me.

41
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,330
I really had no choice.

42
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,980
Voting

43
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,020
is all about making a choice.

44
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,120
What do you mean you had no choice?

45
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,330
I'm not trying to explain myself.

46
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,370
I'll repay your debt

47
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,930
with my life.

48
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,890
What is there to repay?

49
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,890
I must repay.

50
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:40,900
Mr Duan.

51
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,580
I may be a cowardly piece of trash,

52
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,409
but I can be recycled.

53
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,300
You know what?

54
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,610
After I voted for Shen Ding Ding,

55
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,210
I told myself enough is enough.

56
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,260
I no longer owe the Shen family anything.

57
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,150
The reason that I became

58
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,860
a puppet CEO

59
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,150
is to protect the others
who are still here.

60
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,540
I want to protect Xi Xi.

61
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,590
I want to protect Mr Five and
those who are still here.

62
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,020
I can protect Rui for you.

63
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,250
Now that you mention it,

64
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,370
our friends and colleagues

65
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,050
do need you here to protect them.

66
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,860
Don't worry.

67
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,890
That's good to know.

68
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,420
At this point,

69
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,200
what are your plans?

70
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,650
I don't have any plans.

71
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,420
I don't know what plans I should have.

72
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,370
I've been thinking.

73
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,250
Why did I become an entrepreneur?

74
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,740
Why?

75
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,050
To prove myself to others?

76
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,740
Who knows.

77
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,060
You have no obligation

78
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,890
to prove anything to anyone.

79
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,610
You are who you are.

80
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,070
You've always been
our most important friend.

81
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,650
You're our pillar

82
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,300
and our compass.

83
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,650
We need you to lead us, Mr Duan.

84
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,050
Lead?

85
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,500
I don't even know what my goals
are anymore.

86
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,210
How can I lead?

87
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,299
I have to find my direction first.

88
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,650
Once you've found your direction,

89
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,450
let me know.

90
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,600
I will give you my full support.

91
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,010
Take care of that leg first.

92
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,930
If it doesn't recover,

93
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,890
how will you support me?

94
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,760
Enough talking.

95
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,380
Standing too long is bad for your leg.

96
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,130
Take care of that leg.

97
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,500
Mum, where did you and Xi Xi go yesterday?

98
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,620
We hadn't met in a while.

99
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,420
So I took her for a massage.

100
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,870
That's pretty late for a massage.

101
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,380
Xi Xi didn't answer my call this morning.

102
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,690
Isn't she up yet?

103
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,330
We'll be more mindful next time.

104
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Duan, what's your plan today?

105
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,770
Me?

106
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm going fishing.

107
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,050
I have to go.

Let's go fishing.

110

No thanks.
The weather is too hot.

111
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
You want to stay here and
let her nag at you

112
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,870
or you want to fish with me?

113
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,500
Think about it.

114
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,070
Is that how you advise your son?

115
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,420
I'll go fishing then.

116
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,010
Is that how you advise our son?

How's your weekend?

120
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,010
It was good.

121
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,330
I'm meeting some investors tonight.

122
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,370
Big shots.

123
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,780
Are you interested to join?

124
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,050
I'm a small fry.

125
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,450
I'd better not join you big shots.

126
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,490
What's wrong?

127
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,020
You're always shunning me.

128
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,450
It's only dinner.

I thank you for your offer.

131
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,180
But today

132
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,980
I have something important.

133
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,770
I'm resigning.

134
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,810
Why?

135
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,980
For personal reasons.

136
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,370
I'll proceed with the handover

137

with Mr Yu.

138
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,800
I plan to let Xi Xi take over
the private label.

139
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,900
I have full authority
on the private label.

140
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,290
You know that.

141
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,490
Do you hate me that much?

142
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,860
We are colleagues.

143
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,540
Hate is such a strong word.

144
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,780
But I wouldn't say we're destined
for each other, either.

145
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,450
Destiny

146
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,690
isn't something you can force.

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,070
Hope you understand.

148
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,810
Alright. It's your loss.

149
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,150
If it makes you happy.

150
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,500
Xi Xi.

151
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,320
Why are you late today?

152
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,500
What happened?

153
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,740
I'm fine.

154
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,130
Did you hear?

155
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,570
Ms Ouyang resigned.

156
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,930
I heard the news.

157
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,940
You resigned.

158
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,650
It's about Duan Ran.

159
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,130
I realised

160
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,190
when it comes to relationships,

161
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,930
clinging on

162
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,380
only leads to misery.

163
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,940
But if you're

164
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,890
always miserable,

165
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,810
you can't let go.

166
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,180
I'm happy now.

167
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,500
Spending the past six months with you

168
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,120
wasn't easy for me.

169
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,370
Since I knew Duan Ran,

170
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,790
there's never been a day

171
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,380
that was easy for me.

172
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,060
Because you're always on his mind

173
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,490
and you're very important to him.

174
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,930
Moreover, with the passing of time,

175
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,010
you two have become more important

176
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,620
to each other.

177
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,620
What can I do?

178
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,900
Never mind, it's in the past now.

179
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,650
By the way, I have two things to tell you.

180
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,180
First,

181
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,940
it's about Vine.

182
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,780
I wanted to pass it to Duan Ran.

183
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,980
But he wants me to pass it to you.

184
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,380
Second,

185
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,420
it's this.

186
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,380
I thought I had lost it.

187
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,420
Let me say two more things.

188
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,010
I think in future,

189
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,250
when you face setbacks at work,

190
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,690
you should be more tactful

191
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,130
and more flexible.

192
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,210
Learn how to communicate better.

193
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Don't go head-to-head all the time.

194
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,860
As for matters of the heart,

195
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,010
just give yourself some time
if you can't find the answer yet.

196
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,500
Thanks, Ms Ouyang.

197
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,250
If we get the chance,

198
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,520
I hope to collaborate with you again.

199
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,690
If we hadn't gotten a new boss,

200
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,500
I wouldn't have resigned.

201
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,860
There you are. Have a seat.

202
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,070
I'm impressed.
Everything feels brand new.

203
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,900
Ever since that phone call we had,

204
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,370
I've been thinking,

205
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,120
"What is divine assistance?"

206
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,780
With you coming here to help me,

207
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,650
that is divine assistance.

208
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,140
So for the past two days,

209
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,100
I gave Cloud Live

210
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,300
a complete makeover.

211
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,660
I've figured it all out.

212
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,250
This place will become Rui's asylum.

213
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,010
Impressive. You're getting smarter.

214
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,010
No. It's just that

215
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,420
we both know each other well.

216
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,700
Well?

217
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,270
Cloud's account will be reactivated soon.

218
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,980
Is everything back on track?

219
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,540
Almost.

220
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,950
I went around this place just now.

221
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,280
But I didn't see Cola and Little Duckling.

222
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,090
They've resigned.

223
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,530
[Duan Ran's Office]

224
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,860
I've taken care of the liquidated damages.

225
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,770
We had been really worried

226
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,160
since we're returning
for a second time.

227
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,020
Yu Shi is the CEO now.

228
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,010
Rui is managed by new blood.

229
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,849
I just joined the company.

230
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,450
My focus will be on you two.

231
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,700
We'll cut to the chase, then.

232
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,770
Sure.

233
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,980
Mr Ding.

234
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,210
What are your plans for us

235
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,780
regarding brand and resources?

236
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,050
What kind of brand do you want?

237
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,500
Pineapple Xpress.

238
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,690
Pineapple Xpress.

239
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,110
[Protein Powder]

240
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,980
There, there.

241
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,210
Cheer up.

242
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,810
You can't force them to stay

243
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,100
if their heart is no longer here.

244
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,900
When Cola first joined us,

245
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,210
I knew

246
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,260
Cloud Live would never be enough

247
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,050
for her.

248
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,950
I think she doesn't know what she wants.

249
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,370
That's why she was so lost

250
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,050
and kept changing sides.

251
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,380
I pity her actually.

252
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,290
Come on. You can always
train new people.

253
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,620
It'll be fine.

254
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,500
It'd be good if they were all like you.

255
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,500
Gentle, caring, kind and understanding.

256
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,290
That would be good.

257
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,210
Jia Yun.

258
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,900
Sometimes I feel as if

259
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,380
I'm a sword.

260
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,930
When I meet people

261
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,690
like Cola, Ding Ding,

262
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,780
Duan Ran, Shen Jiang Tao,

263
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,900
all the people in my life,

264
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,620
be they friends or foes,

265
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,100
are like my grindstones.

266
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,140
The more of them I meet,

267
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,330
the sharper I become.

268
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,740
But you're different.

269
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,330
You're bright and intelligent,

270
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,860
more like a scabbard

271
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,020
that can hide my edge.

272
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,980
Where did you copy these phrases from?

273
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,450
I didn't copy it.
It came from my heart.

274
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,780
Fine.

275
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,660
Since you're so pitiful today,

276
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,930
I'll do you a favour.

277
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,430
Another meeting with Mr Duan Sr?

278
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,920
It's been ages. Will we catch anything?

279
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,740
Quiet. You're scaring the fish away.

280
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,660
Let's chat. It's getting boring.

281
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,870
If you really want to catch some fish,

282
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,580
I'll get us a boat to the sea.

283
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,570
Just cast a net and haul them in.

284
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,450
Is that the same?

285
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,210
Look at us sitting by the sea,

286
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,570
in this beautiful weather
and this sea breeze,

287
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,810
quietly waiting for the fish
to take our baits.

288
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,450
Fishing with a net?

289
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,570
What's the fun in that? It's so easy.

290
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,490
It's nothing compared
to the joy and excitement

291
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,810
of waiting for a catch.

292
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,900
Mum was nagging at me back home.

293
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,900
And now, you're nagging at me too.

294
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,050
You're really hard to please.

295
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,940
If I don't say anything,
you'll say I'm bottled up.

296
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,270
When I say something,
you say I'm nagging.

297
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,010
Alright, fine.
We'll just focus on fishing.

298
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,930
So, did any fish take the bait?

299
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,980
Let me check.

300
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,260
-What fell in?
-Just great.

301
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,020
Our water bottle.

302
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,020
-Oh.
-Clumsy fellow.

303
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,900
Doing business

304
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,850
is not just about money and profit.

305
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,900
Sure, profits can maintain relationships.

306
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,820
But it's not permanent.

307
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,010
You still need the emotional aspect.

308
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,300
You think you and Mr Wu

309
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,970
are totally different people, don't you?

310
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,820
If you can

311
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,740
find a common ground

312
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,210
between you two,

313
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,140
you can establish a friendship.

314
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,690
-Mr Wu.
-So, Jia Yun set me up with you?

315
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,660
I couldn't get you to meet me.

316
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,290
I had no choice.

317
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,460
Why are we sitting here
instead of the sofa area?

318
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,460
That area was full

319
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,710
when I arrived.

320
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,370
But now it's empty.

321
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,510
Do you want to change tables?

322
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,060
No, it's fine.
We'll just sit here.

323
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,520
It won't take long anyway.

324
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,380
Mr Wu.

325
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm really sorry.

326
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,670
I have no choice

327
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,570
but to do this.

328
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,660
Chen Lang.

329
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,690
Cloud Live has just been revived.

330
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,620
We still have our reservations.

331
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,630
I suggest that you work with

332
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,210
some small-scale suppliers.

333
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,670
That would be a good start.

334
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,980
Yes.

335
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,030
After you build yourself up,

336
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,760
we can then collaborate again.

337
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,210
Mr Wu.

338
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,330
You told me this

339
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,610
over the phone previously.

340
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,200
I haven't forgotten.

341
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,610
But the reason I want to meet you today

342
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,620
is not about work.

343
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,540
I just want to

344
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,090
get to know you as a friend.

345
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,530
Get to know me?

346
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,330
If you weren't

347
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,930
so clumsy

348
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,260
as to lose our water bottle,

349
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,620
we wouldn't end up like this.

350
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,500
Let's take a rest under the tree.

351
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,620
This weather is killing me.

352
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,410
Sit down here, you brat.

353
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,020
You know, we're both lucky people.

354
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,270
When lucky people come together,

355
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,170
good things are bound to happen.

356
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,320
I hope so.

357
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,670
The thirst is killing me.

358
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,660
It's killing me too.

359
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,050
Dad.

360
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,760
Ice-cream seller.

361
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,570
Ice-cream seller.
Over here.

362
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,740
Hi there.

363
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,210
This is great.

364
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,500
Heaven opens a window.

365
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,290
-You want ice-cream?
-You bet.

366
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,930
Let me see.

367
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,850
What flavours do you have?

368
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,580
Green bean, milk,

369
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,740
and also ice bar.
Take your pick.

370
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,410
In that case,
give me two of each.

371
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,330
Buddy,
I suggest

372
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,810
you don't eat too much.

373
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,340
Ice-cream may be nice

374
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,130
in this weather,

375
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,810
but it's bad for health.

376
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,340
Others would be happy to sell more.

377
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,800
But you want me to buy less.

378
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,460
Small businesses like mine

379
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,510
are all about heart.

380
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,500
If you get sick,

381
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,200
I'd feel really sorry.

382
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,210
It's rare to meet

383
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,380
a seller as kind as you.

384
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,980
Ran Ran.

385
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,100
Get me one green bean.

386
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,780
-I'm holding it.
-Sure.

387
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,900
Young man.

388
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,290
How much for all these?

389
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,570
Ten fifty yuan.

390
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,930
Since it's fate that brought us here,

391
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,030
I'll give you a discount.

392
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,570
Ten yuan will do.

393
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,060
You're too kind.

394
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,130
Is that okay?

395
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,930
The weather is very hot today.

396
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,500
This must be hard work.

397
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,660
With the high inflation,

398
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,030
how much do you make

399
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,100
selling ice-cream?

400
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,780
I'm not doing this to get rich.

401
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,720
I'm just supplying my old friends

402
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,720
with their favourite ice-creams.

403
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,780
Impressive.

404
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,330
Ran Ran, pay him.

405
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,090
-Yes.
-Please scan here.

406
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,700
Since fate has

407
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,990
brought us together,

408
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,520
I should pay you duly

409
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,290
and not a cent less.

410
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,100
Surely, you jest.

411
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,140
Actually, I think

412
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,810
we have a lot in common.

413
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,930
Really.

414
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,050
Mr Wu, may I ask

415
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,860
where you are from?

416
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,370
Wanbei.

417
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,020
What a coincidence.

418
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,930
I'm from Subei.

419
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,100
Really?

420
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,220
That's pretty close.

421
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,210
Yes.

422
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,980
My house

423
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,050
is very near to Anhui.

424
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,860
It's a small village.

425
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,780
We were very poor.

426
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,940
Can I ask you a random question?

427
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,740
Can you guess where I graduated?

428
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,070
Don't tell me you're from Tsinghua
or Peking University.

429
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,380
Really?

430
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,020
You guessed it.

431
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,900
I'm a computer science graduate
from Tsinghua.

432
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,390
I ran a small business in Beijing
after graduation,

433
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,300
failed,

434
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,140
then came to Xiamen

435
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,900
and got started in women's fashion.

436
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,570
I was from a poor family

437
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,330
with many older sisters.

438
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,510
My parents only bought clothes for them.

439
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,570
I had to wear their hand-me-downs.

440
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,190
Who would've known?

441
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,730
Right? After all, I was a top student
back in the day,

442
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,470
and was somewhat famous.

443
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,390
Wearing flowery outfits everyday

444
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,170
was so embarrassing.

445
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,570
That's not too bad.

446
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,020
I then bought some bleach

447
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,140
and soaked my clothes in it

448
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,580
until the colours faded.

449
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,660
But wasn't it still flowery?

450
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,210
At least they weren't so conspicuous.

451
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,330
Here's the thing,

452
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,150
it turned out kind of nice on me.

453
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,750
But when it comes to alterations,

454
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,780
I have more experience than you.

455
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,840
You had a similar experience?

456
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,260
Ran Ran.

457
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,190
Did you notice how the ice-cream seller

458
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,170
conducts his business?

459
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,660
I think he's a good businessman.

460
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,630
He cares about his customers.

461
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,810
He's full of warmth.

462
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,420
His customers are willing

463
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,750
to give him their money.

464
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,390
Providing comfort is the basis
of business.

465
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,660
But many businessmen these days

466
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,050
only want to maximise their profit.

467
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,920
Did I tell you about your grandfather?

468
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,210
Yes, you did.

469
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,680
He was a street vendor.

470
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,020
He's a vendor in the mountain area.

471
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,670
He gathered chicken and duck feathers

472
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,930
in exchange for goods.

473
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,210
Bartering is the oldest form of sales.

474
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,080
Do you know what it took

475
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,420
to do business back then?

476
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,400
It took rapport and relationships.

477
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,900
Those were simple times.

478
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,980
There's so much plotting and scheming
nowadays.

479
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,940
There are still exceptions.

480
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,980
Me? I try to pass the kindness on.

481
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,570
Ran Ran, you're still young.

482
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,470
You must be able to withstand setbacks.

483
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,170
But most importantly,

484
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,330
you need a clear goal to fight for.

485
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,380
Dad.

486
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,980
I know what you and Mum mean.

487
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,930
My time at home

488
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,660
got me thinking.

489
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,020
Since I came back from the UK,

490
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,930
I've been doing everything my way.

491
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,740
I was kind of wilful.

492
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,500
Who wasn't wilful when they were young?

493
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,170
I was wilful, too.

494
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,990
That's not the problem.

495
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,860
The key is having a clear goal

496
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,450
and knowing when to cut your losses.

497
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,660
Take my advice, son.

498
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,820
If you don't find anything suitable,

499
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,100
come back to QE.

500
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,260
Just come back to QE.

501
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,620
How about that?

502
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,210
What can I do

503
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,780
if I go back to QE?

504
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,380
You can start off as a floor manager.

505
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,850
The main duty of a floor manager

506
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,740
is to maintain merchant-shopper
relationships.

507
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,340
It's a role that requires

508
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,810
high EQ and decisiveness.

509
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,380
As well as warmth, like you said.

510
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,260
It's not an easy job.

511
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,950
The job will be a great training for you.

512
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,700
If I return to QE, it means I have to
talk to Uncle Shen.

513
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,030
What's wrong with that?

514
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,040
Are you afraid he'll put you down?

515
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,170
He won't.

516
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,580
He's not that kind of person.

517
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,580
I know him.

518
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,580
We may disagree

519
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,130
on how to run a business,

520
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,810
but it's nothing personal.

521
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,820
I think you should change your attitude.

522
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,810
Son.

523
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,020
Let go of your ego and your status.

524
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,330
Can you do that?

525
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,270
I was supposed to visit
a manufacturer

526
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,330
to look at some samples today.

527
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,410
Looks like I won't be able to make it.

528
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Time sure flies.

529
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,700
Thank you for your time.

530
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,200
I truly appreciate it.

531
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,580
Well, I got to see a side of you

532
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,000
I've never seen before.

533
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,970
As for your

534
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,420
suggestions and ideas today,

535
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,690
I'll think about it tonight.

536
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,790
Tomorrow, I'll talk to the tailors

537
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,730
at the factory.

538
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,620
If it's viable,

539
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,500
I'll definitely see it through.

540
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,810
Mr Wu.

541
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,500
I told you

542
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,050
this meeting is not about work,

543
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,660
but in the end, we still talk about it.

544
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,210
Chen Lang.

545
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,210
I know

546
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,180
you are passionate about your job.

547
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,980
I know where you're coming from.

548
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,620
Thank you, Mr Wu.

549
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,690
Uncle Shen.

550
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:35,010
I'm here to apologise.

551
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,320
I was too impulsive.

552
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,610
Although I did not push Yu Shi,

553
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,570
I did indirectly cause his injury.

554
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,290
I should apologise.

555
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,850
Recognising your mistake

556
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,900
and apologising

557
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,780
makes you a real man.

558
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,530
I...

559
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,090
Actually I came here today

560
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,570
to ask you for a favour.

561
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,190
I hope you'll grant me this wish.

562
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,370
You want to return to Rui?

563
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,780
I want to go to QE

564
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,810
and become a floor manager.

565
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,530
My problem was being overly ambitious

566
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,410
without any real experience or foundation.

567
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,530
So I think I should start at the bottom.

568
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,930
Hold on.

569
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,810
Mr Liu. Can you come to my office?

[Shapowei Art Zone]

571
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,750
[Vine]

572
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,060
Our new manufacturer worked overtime

573
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,920
to push out these garments for us.

574
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,970
I've checked them.

575
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,300
The quality is quite good.

576
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,530
This is great.

577
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,030
Our new batch of Vine garments

578
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,090
can go online soon.

579
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,340
Lately, I've been thinking about
a new marketing strategy.

580
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,700
I watched a foreign reality show

581
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,030
and found it quite interesting.

582
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,980
Fashion designers are pitted

583
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,280
against each other.

584
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,420
They had to make something
on the spot with the materials provided.

585
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,260
We can emulate this idea

586
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,300
and divide our broadcasters
into teams.

587
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,910
We'll give them different garments

588
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,900
to mix and match.

589
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,700
This should get

590
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,170
the viewers coming.

591
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,910
Sounds like a good idea,

592
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,140
but I think it needs a lot of work.

593
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,290
I'm okay with it

594
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,710
because I plan to spend more time

595
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,010
on work.

596
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,730
Don't worry, Xi Xi.

597
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,410
Don't worry.
I'll help you.

598
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,810
I'll help too.

599
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,020
Let's quickly divide these.

600
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,330
Did you see that?

601
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,280
Iron Lady Qian is back.

602
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,420
She's pulling all-nighters

603
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,740
like she has no life.

604
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,510
Looking at her dark circles,

605
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,350
people may think she's
going for the goth look.

606
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,190
What happened to her?

607
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,330
She only lost the CEO position.

608
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,620
I think she has a relationship problem.

609
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,490
I think so too.

610
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,450
Room Two needs more light.

611
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,740
Tell Tiao Tiao in Room Six

612
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,580
to leave out the jacket.

613
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,780
Change it to the next one.

614
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,780
The next flagship style.

615
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,580
Pass the dress to Mr Five.

616
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,980
Pass the blouse to Warm Broadcast.

617
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,020
And the other blouse...

618
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,370
On this floor,

619
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,150
we have around 40 to 50 merchants.

620
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,690
They're mostly fashion and cosmetic.

621
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,980
We have brands like I Do,

622
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,610
Omega,

623
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,210
and other famous brands.

624
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,100
You can see them as you go around.

625
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,910
Your main responsibilities are

626
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,330
to monitor the appearance of employees,

627
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,930
staff attendance and cleanliness.

628
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,020
You also need to handle

629
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,320
customer disputes,

630
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,910
check the elevators and fire hydrants.

631
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,270
They are actually simple tasks.

632
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,750
It means I have to be responsible

633
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,020
for everything here.

634
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,010
Yes.

635
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,560
But you don't need to be
too serious about it.

636
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,060
Just make your rounds.

637
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,540
I can't do that. Here at QE,

638
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,290
every job matters.

639
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,460
I think you misunderstood me.

640
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,179
You're the son of Mr Duan Sr.

641
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,380
Although he has now retired,

642
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,790
he was always very caring towards us

643
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,650
when he was the company director.

644
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,300
Manager.

645
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,290
I hope you can treat me fairly.

646
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,980
If I need teachings,

647
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,340
you have to guide me.

648
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,409
I'm here to learn.

649
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,620
You are different from what I thought.

650
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,840
Let's go.
I'll show you around.

651
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,050
You are here too.

652
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,570
Xi Xi.
Ding Ding told me

653
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,930
you're in charge of the private label.

654
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,180
You've worked hard.

655
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,130
It's nothing.

656
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,940
I'm just doing my work.

657
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,980
Please sit down.

658
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,330
Yes. Take a seat.

659
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,550
Today is the first day of broadcast

660
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,560
for Vine's second season.

661
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,140
Sales are good.
The company is satisfied with the result.

662
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,540
This is a reward

663
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,420
that my father appealed for you.

664
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,330
Thank you, Uncle Shen.

665
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,460
You're welcome.

666
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
This is Ding Ding's first victory

667
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,220
since he joined Rui.

668
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,100
You contributed half of the success.

669
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,830
Since this is everyone's hard work,

670
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,030
I want to use this money

671
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,310
to continue investing
in the private label.

672
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,900
Work is work.
This reward is personal.

673
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,330
You can keep this money.

674
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,420
We have another matter.

675
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,940
I plan to start a new department

676
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,110
to research on and develop private labels.

677
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,570
Vine is not enough.

678
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,030
We have to develop
different private labels

679
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,380
to cater to different consumer needs.

680
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,830
You have the most experience in this.

681
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,380
I want you to handle this department.

682
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,100
As for Vine, Yu Shi will take over.

683
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,940
You're obviously undermining me
with this promotion.

684
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,220
You're taking Vine away from me.

685
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,270
Let me brief you on this.

686
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,060
The idea came from Xi Xi.

687
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,900
It's in a form of competition.

688
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,700
Broadcasters will be matched
to compete against each other.

689
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,050
They'll be given garments randomly.

690
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,590
Whom do I match with?

691
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,900
You're your own match.

692
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,180
Nobody wants to compete with a celebrity.

693
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,070
Only after the finals, that winner

694
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,270
will compete with you.

695
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,030
This sounds interesting.

696
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,540
Yes, it is.
Since you're now clear about it,

697
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,660
I'll carry on with my work.

698
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,650
Alright.

699
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,740
Xi Xi.

700
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,460
What's wrong?

701
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,460
Darn it.

702
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,890
Why are you here at this time?

703
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,330
Now you know I'm crying.

704
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,140
What does it matter?

705
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,330
Wipe your tears.

706
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,250
Thanks.

707
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,330
What happened?
Did Ding Ding bully you again?

708
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,560
No.

709
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,700
He wants me

710
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,940
to lead a new department.

711
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,770
He's promoting me with a salary increment.

712
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,870
But he's actually undermining me.

713
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,770
This is bullying.

714
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,900
So many things happened lately.

715
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,460
I just can't take it.

716
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,860
Alright, alright.

717
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,220
Just let it all out.

718
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,110
You need to let it out sometimes.

719
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,490
-I'm fine.
-Just let it out.

720
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,660
I've to take this call.

721
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,970
Hello? Mum?

722
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,010
I have work.

723
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,610
It's the first day of my private label.

724
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,050
What?

725
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,860
Why did you accept the job
without consulting me?

726
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,900
I can't go.
Not today.

727
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900
I have to go.

728
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,980
What happened?

729
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,290
My mum really amazes me.

730
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,220
It's no use apologising now.
You knocked over my kid.

731
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,620
I didn't do it on purpose.

732
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,330
I didn't see him coming.

733
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,220
This is your problem.

734
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,220
Excuse me.

735
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,570
I'm the mall manager.
You can speak to me.

736
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,900
He knocked over my kid.

737
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,330
Look, Mr Manager,

738
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,860
is this how you run a mall?

739
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,310
-Yes, yes.
-This delivery guy

740
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,290
pushes so many parcels around.

741
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,830
-It's very dangerous.
-Yes, it's our mistake.

742
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,050
Is your kid alright?

743
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,130
Are you hurt?

744
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,570
He was frightened.

745
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,140
I'm sorry.
Let me apologise to you.

746
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,130
I'm sorry, kid.

747
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,100
Madam, I have two discount coupons

748
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,410
for the toy shop here.

749
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,910
You can get your kid a toy.

750
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,330
Go buy yourself a toy.

751
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,790
-Say thank you.
-Thank you.

752
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,110
-You're welcome.
-I'll let you off this time.

753
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,850
I'm very sorry.

754
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,290
I'm really very sorry.

755
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,700
Could you kindly disperse?

756
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,810
Thanks.

757
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,820
I didn't do it on purpose.

758
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,180
The kid was running so fast
towards my trolley.

759
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,340
I couldn't avoid him.

760
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,740
It's okay.
In the future,

761
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,030
just leave the parcels

762
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,030
in the security room downstairs.

763
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,790
Our mall doesn't allow deliveries.

764
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,990
I'm here to collect parcels.

765
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,310
A shop called for a collection.

766
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,420
That's why I came up here.

767
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,420
So many?

768
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,980
That's normal for that shop.

769
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,530
I have to make two trips every day.

770
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,730
[Reclassified Home Perfume]

771
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,940
This perfume is more subtle.

772
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,230
Hello, Manager Duan.
You can take a seat here.

773
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,570
You're here.
Can I help you?

774
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,940
What are you doing?

775
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,940
Our manager is doing a live stream.

776
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,980
What do you sell?

777
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,020
Perfumes.

778
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,570
We have an online shop.

779
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,020
Our manager does live streams

780
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,420
to promote our perfumes.

781
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,030
So the parcels you send out everyday

782
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,030
are your merchandise?

783
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,140
Yes.

784
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,720
How many do you sell a day?

785
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,610
It's almost the same as a physical outlet.

786
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,510
Besides, some regular customers

787
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,050
prefer to buy online

788
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,540
for convenience's sake.

789
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,880
Why do you stream from the shop

790
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,360
instead of a proper place?

791
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,690
It doesn't matter.

792
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,940
Besides, customers can see

793
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,070
what is happening in our shop.

794
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,200
It's more engaging.

795
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,730
I see. Please carry on.

796
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,850
Alright.

797
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,060
The base note is lemon.

798
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,980
It has a light citrus tone

799
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,180
that adds a romantic touch.

800
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,530
Besides that,

801
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,050
we also have a popular essential...

802
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,620
Are you feeling better?

803
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,710
Thanks for taking me out today.

804
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,660
I've always wanted to do this.

805
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,940
When Mr Ding joined the company

806
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,810
and you were ousted as the CEO,

807
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,260
I thought of taking you
on a relaxing outing.

808
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,940
But when I saw you

809
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,050
working so hard,

810
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,370
I decided not to disturb you.

811
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,840
Too many things have happened lately.

812
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,700
I just don't know how to deal with it.

813
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,700
I can only occupy myself

814
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,420
with work.

815
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,130
Xi Xi.

816
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,820
Do you really want to work on
that private label?

817
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,700
Go ahead if you really want to.

818
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,770
If Ding Ding disagrees,

819
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,850
I'll end my collaboration with Rui.

820
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,010
Don't you do that.

821
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,420
Ms Ouyang and Duan Ran have left.

822
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,070
You're the only one who can protect Vine,

823
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,240
Mr Five

824
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,220
and our brand's

825
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,220
original mission.

826
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,570
If Ding Ding undermines you

827
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,140
like he did to me,

828
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,330
we'll lose everything.

829
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,720
Are you just going to
take it sitting down?

830
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:07,940
Alright.

831
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,590
It's a beautiful day.

832
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,700
Let's not talk about depressing stuff.

833
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,090
Look at the setting sun.

834
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,330
The sea is sparkling.

835
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,490
I wish I could bring you

836
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,940
happiness and sunshine.
