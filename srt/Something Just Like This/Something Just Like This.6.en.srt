00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,010
What's going on?

5
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,970
I'm so unlucky.

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,520
Out of luck!

7
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,470
Not going well.

8
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,600
Go find again.

9
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,110
Perfect.

10
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Okay.

11
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,789
Raise your head a little bit more.

12
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,810
What a coincidence.
Why are you here?

13
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,470
Coincidence?

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,000
I've been here for over an hour.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,550
I'm waiting for a kid named
Zhang Jia Yun to leave school.

16
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,950
There are too many bad guys,
I'm worried she'll get abducted.

17
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,240
Is this Duan Ran's car?

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,400
Yeah, it's his car.

19
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,480
I heard from my friend
that he sold his car.

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,520
I hurriedly bought it.

21
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,720
In case if he wants to buy it back
in the future,

22
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,350
I can sell at a high price.

23
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,440
Let's go. I'll send you home.
Get in the car.

What's wrong?

27
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,810
I want to kill Chen Lang.

28
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
What did he do?

29
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,260
I went to negotiate a brand today.

30
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,530
They said we don't have streamers.

31
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,120
I want to get a few streamers
from Chen Lang.

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,950
I ran into him.

33
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,930
He bought my car!

34
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,470
Fortunately, I've an acquaintance
in this studio.

35
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,370
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known
you're shooting there.

36
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,920
I've resigned.

37
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,780
I'm free anyway.

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,390
I took some photos for fun.

39
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,840
If you want to take photos,

40
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,290
you can tell me.

41
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,110
I can help you to find a job
with higher payment

42
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,720
and more classy.
This standard is too normal.

43
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,780
Don't do that.

44
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,470
Are you treating me as a stranger?

45
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,000
No.

46
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,620
I really don't need it.

47
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,480
Jia Yun, I don't understand you
since childhood.

48
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,500
You can earn money with your beauty,

49
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,240
but you want to use your talent.

50
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,440
Aren't you tired?

51
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,019
Just think of it as I'm not serious.

52
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,190
Such a coincidence,
I'm not serious too.

53
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,240
We're a match.

54
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,670
Let it go.

55
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,070

for the company.

58
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,270
Chen Lang is starting a business too.

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,870
He bought the car

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,220
just to make you angry.

61
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,840
You're better than him.

62
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,380
What logic is this?

63
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,470
Isn't it right?

64
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,310
Enough about me.

65
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,750
What did you do today?

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,050
Don't mention it.

67
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,409
I went to see Yuan Yuan today.

68
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,409
I wanted to ask her

69
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,360
to come back to Rui
as a broadcaster

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
but she disagreed.

71
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,030
Then, I went back to the office

72
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,920
and did an inventory count
with Su Su.

73
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,750
Chen Lang is a jerk.

74
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,410
He emptied the company.

75
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,700
He didn't even leave any valuables

76
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,190
in the warehouse.

77
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,800
I found nothing.

78
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,100
Do you think we're

79
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,190
stuck in an endless loop?

80
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,140
The brand asks you to find streamers.

81
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,000
Streamers ask you to find a brand.

82
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,400
I want to sell something
but we need to have the stock first.

83
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,530
How can we get goods without cash flow?

84
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,590
What should we do?

85
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,590
When I was in the economic class,

86
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,520
I learned about this.

87
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,950
This dilemma

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,100
is the dilemma of whether the chicken
or egg came first.

89
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,760
Tell me then.

90
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,150
Did the chicken or egg come first?

91
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,640
Don't ask me this kind of
philosophical question.

92
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,100
You think too highly of me.

93
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,700
You can't find a good streamer, right?

94
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,990
Do you want to try to find new talents?

95
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,280
Chen Lang has a theory.

96
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,720
A salesperson

97
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,270
is generally modest and unassuming.

98
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,750
Furthermore, they have their own
understanding on fashion.

99
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,720
And they're quite pretty.

100
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,040
Do you want to try?

101
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,710
Why do I need to find one?

102
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,920
We already have one.

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,360
Zhang Jia Yun.

104
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,900
Don't think about her.

105
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,440
I already asked her.

106
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,300
She doesn't want to be a streamer.

107
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,930
Zhang Jia Yun.

108
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,560
Let me think of a way.

109
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,320
Chen Lang.

110
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,570
We've known each other
for half a lifetime, right?

111
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,470
Do you know what I like

112
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
and what I want?

113
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,270
Eat luxury meals, live in a luxury house,
drive a luxury car.

114
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,250
Am I right?

115
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,659
Okay, if you said so.

116
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,190
Don't, I'm joking.

117
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,050
Don't take it seriously.

118
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,810
Who doesn't have their own pursuit?

119
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
I used to have it too.

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,760
But what's the point?

121
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,500
If you work hard

122
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,070
and there's a result,

123
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,190
that's an ideal.

124
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,500
If you work hard but to no avail,

125
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,650
that's reality.

126
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,440
You've a clear mind.

127
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,110
Your face is beautiful
and your brain too.

128
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,520
You also live beautifully.

129
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,200
Why do I like you so much?

130
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,240
I'll still say the same.

131
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,510
Don't waste your time on me.

132
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,300
We're really not the same.

133
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,710
Besides, Qian Xi Xi is my best friend.

134
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,490
I won't go work with you
even if I die.

135
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,030
I don't want you to die.

136
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,840
To find new talent...

137
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,030
That works.

138
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,980
I'll also give you an idea.

139
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,540
I saw a lot of hipsters abroad.

140
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,240
Their clothes are not very expensive.

141
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,440
The pieces look plain

142
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,460
but when put together, they shine.

143
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,520
They incorporate unexpected things.

144
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,310
For the leftover stocks,

145
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,000
see if you can alter it.

146
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,960
Cheap and simple is okay.

147
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,180
Just don't be mediocre, understand?

148
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,440
Alter it?

149
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,390
You're right.

150
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Since Chen Lang
didn't leave anything for us,

151
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,600
let's try to turn the waste
into treasures.

152
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,310
Give him a slap in the face.

153
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,390
Yeah.

154
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,470
Okay, do your best.

155
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,520
It's up to you.

156
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,809
I can't do this alone.

157
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,950
But I think I know someone who can do it.

158
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,470
Coming from the south
or going to the north.

159
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,990
Come take a look and buy.

160
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,470
Created by new designers.

161
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,340
It's fashionable and use exquisite fabric.

162
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,790
Don't miss it.

163
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,920
Young lady, this is the latest fashion.

164
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,120
You can wear it at work.

165
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,870
Young lady

166
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,950
Your skin is white.

167
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,930
This colour suits you.

168
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,830
It's pretty good.

169
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,570
-Right?
-How much is it?

170
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,570
This one...

171
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,060
Three hundred.

172
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,250
Xi Xi.

173
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,030
Are you sure the legendary

174
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,590
market designer Mr Five

175
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,590
is here?

176
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,360
It's nearby here.

177
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,550
You don't have the exact address?

178
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,860
No.

179
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,390
To be precise, I don't even know
what he looks like.

180
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,830
I just saw the photos of the clothes.

181
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,120
It's super cool.

182
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,300
This is the only one in the world.

183
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,370
And that stitch style tailoring

184
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,600
will definitely become a trend this year.

185
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,480
Look.

186
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,830
Look at that logo.

187
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,590
This is my own design.

188
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,050
The legendary Mr Five.

189
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,150
Mr Five?

190
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,410
I've never heard of it.

191
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,940
Just tell me how much it is.

192
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,960
Three hundred.

193
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,280
It's indeed expensive

194
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,980
to buy clothing at a street stall
for 300 yuan.

195
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,280
If this is in the mall,

196
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,500
any jacket costs more than 1,000 yuan.

197
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,560
How can a street stall
be compared with the mall?

198
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
Go sell it in the mall if you're capable.

199
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,170
Don't look down on street vendors.

200
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,420
-You...
-Mao, amiability makes you rich.

201
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,280
The law enforcement is here. Run!

202
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,880
The law enforcement is here!

203
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,040
Run! You go first.

204
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,930
-What about you?
-It's okay, don't worry about me.

205
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,530
Anyway, he's called the market designer
on the Internet.

206
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,160
A piece of clothing is sold for
a thousand yuan

207
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
on second-hand applications.

208
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,810
I heard he's quite handsome.

209
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,560
Many young girls came to find him.

210
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,420
But you can't meet him every time.

211
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,330
Why are they running?

212
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,360
Careful!

213
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,110
Oh no.

214
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,540
It hurts.

215
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,570
Are you okay?

216
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,120
No, my leg hurts.

217
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,600
-Where did you get hit?
-Here.

218
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,480
Your leg?

219
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,110
It hurts.

220
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,590
So serious?

221
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,020
Mister, can you stand up?

222
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
I don't think so.

223
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,950
Su Su, help him to get up.

224
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,590
Slowly.

225
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,250
No.

226
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,550
Mister.

227
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,970
You can't just sit here.

228
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,650
The car is blocking others.

229
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,300
How about this?
You pay me 2,000 yuan.

230
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,830
I can't move this leg at all.

231
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,780
I can't make money because of you.

232
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,520
Please be reasonable, mister.

233
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,870
When did I hit you?

234
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,890
Look.

235
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,710
There's no collision.

236
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,430
You didn't hit me?

237
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,930
Why did I fall then?

238
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,040
How would I know?

239
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,240
The gravity made you fall.

240
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,420
You can really talk.

241
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,190
I don't care.

242
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,700
Don't even think to leave
if you don't pay me 2,000 yuan.

243
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,750
I don't have time to waste with you.

244
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,740
I've some urgent matters.

245
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,120
Let's discuss.

246
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,820
Two hundred.

247
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,600
-Two hundred?
-Okay?

248
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,810
Are you joking?

249
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,120
I drove properly.

250
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,540
You fell from the bike
without any reason.

251
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,090
You scared me.

252
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,780
I haven't asked you
to pay for mental damage.

253
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,040
Two hundred.

254
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,510
You all saw it, right?

255
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,930
She hit me.

256
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,580
You have to testify for me.

257
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,880
She won't pay me.

258
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,980
I can't.

259
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,590
[Mr Five]

260
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,460
Mr Five?

261
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,600
Mr Five?

262
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,010
What?

263
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,970
You're that designer, Mr Five?

264
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,180
It's him?

265
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,820
This...

266
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,880
Why did you pierce my hand
with a toothpick?

267
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,770
I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean it.

268
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,210
I think you did.

269
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,520
You're being unreasonable.

270
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,000
If you didn't mean it,
let me pierce your hand.

271
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,770
Aunt, I've said sorry.

272
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,400
Why do you want to pierce me?

273
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,800
You just pierced me,
so I need to pierce you too.

274
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,000
You just wanted to snatch things
with me.

275
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,930
So you pierce me on purpose, right?

276
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,670
I think you did it on purpose.

277
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,620
You're beautiful,

278
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,320
but why are you so cunning?

279
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,390
-Ma'am.
-You're so bad.

280
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,030
Calm down. What's the matter?

281
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,120
Talk nicely.

282
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,510
Are you buying something?

283
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,440
How about this? You can have these.

284
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,570
Calm down.

285
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,950
Who are you?

286
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,390
Me?

287
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Manager.

288
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,960
Accompany her to shop today.

289
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,870
-Okay.
-Ma'am.

290
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,890
We're giving it to you free today.

291
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,070
-I can take all of it?
-Take all of it.

292
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,680
Let's go.

293
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,700
Ma'am, you can take all these.

294
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,870
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
It's free?

297
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,830
Yes, it's free.

298
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,680
Take it there.

299
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,320
Hello, please enjoy your food.

300
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,200
Thanks.

301
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,920
Mr Duan, do you need anything else?

302
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,860
No, get busy.

303
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,830
Okay.

304
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Thanks, Duan Ran.

305
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
If not for you,

306
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,020
that lady would've killed me.

307
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,830
I said I would treat you to dinner

308
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,590
but you won't go.
You asked me to come here.

309
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,850
So I have to set the table
and cook for you.

310
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,840
I think the food is quite delicious.

311
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,600
If I didn't eat the free food,

312
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,080
it'll get thrown anyway.

313
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,980
Yeah.

314
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,800
But today, I was fortunate enough to eat

315
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,020
the steak that was cooked by Mr Duan Jr.

316
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,470
I'm honoured.

317
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,920
I finally know
why you and Qian Xi Xi

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,920
have been friends for so many years.

319
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,890
Why?

320
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,210
You have a sweet tongue
and easy to feed.

321
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:25,810
Okay.

322
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,060
I've eaten the steak.

323
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,080
Mr Duan.

324
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,760
Tell me about your purpose
for seeing me today.

325
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,890
Jia Yun.

326
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,480
You did a live stream in Sanya.

327
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,550
Everyone can see your talent.

328
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,950
I'm with Rui now.

329
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,240
I started a business.

330
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,750
I would like it if you can work with me.

331
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,250
[Emergency]

332
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,630
What hospital is this?

333
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,890
They couldn't find what's wrong
even though it hurts.

334
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,280
This is a tertiary referral hospital.

335
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,690
I don't think there's a problem.

336
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,160
Let's leave the hospital
as soon as possible

337
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
and discuss about our cooperation.

338
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,190
Mr Five.

339
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,640
I really like your work.

340
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,329
You want to cooperate?

341
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,440
Okay.

342
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,609
But you have to pay me
10,000 yuan for lost work

343
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,010
and compensation first.

344
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,349
Don't you want your work

345
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,240
to be recognised by more people?

346
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,960
You're an e-commerce company
that I've never heard of.

347
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,680
How many people can recognize me?

348
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,340
You've never heard of it?

349
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,800
We're a live-streaming e-commerce
subsidiary company

350
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,320
of QE Group.

351
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,870
Do you know QE?

352
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,090
The largest shopping mall in the city.

353
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,550
If you're so awesome,

354
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,590
why can't you pay me compensation?

355
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,570
Let's discuss the design cost.

356
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,870
After the contract is signed
and the deposit paid,

357
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,200
I can rest assured.

358
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,640
Why are you like this?

359
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,640
You want to get paid
before the job is done?

360
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,500
Enough, don't need to talk to him.

361
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,750
Your back hurts?

362
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:06,990
Rest well then.

363
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,960
Let's go.

364
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,940
Listen here.

365
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,150
If you don't pay me,

366
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,590
I won't get discharged!

367
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,740
Xi Xi, this Mr Five is too cunning.

368
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,720
I've read about Mr Five's introduction.

369
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,050
I've seen his works too.

370
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
It's avant-garde and outstanding.

371
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,380
Why is he such a person?

372
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,340
That's right.

373
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,470
It seems that Xi Xi didn't tell you.

374
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,070
She has actually come to me many times.

375
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,390
But I rejected her.

376
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,810
Xi Xi told me.

377
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,430
But I think

378
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,000
Xi Xi doesn't understand

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,320
what you really want.

380
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,750
I think your reason for rejecting her

381
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,230
is like cheating a child.

382
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,690
Xi Xi is my best friend.

383
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,270
Don't drive a wedge between us.

384
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,330
I didn't mean that.

385
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,990
I learned that you're attending
a cram school.

386
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,280
You're preparing for postgraduate
entrance examination.

387
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,660
I think you're actually very ambitious.

388
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,210
It's not like what people see
on the surface.

389
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,190
But I've rejected Qian Xi Xi.

390
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,030
Why should I say yes to you?

391
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,110
You went with Xi Xi to negotiate

392
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,420
with Pineapple Xpress a few times.

393
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,320
You two went there so many times.

394
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,790
Every time you talked about the products,

395
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,730
the company and strengths,

396
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,700
it didn't make an impression.

397
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,080
Then, I told Xi Xi

398
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,390
to give them an ROI

399
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,750
and a value proposal.

400
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,490
What happened then?
Wu Zhong Quan signed it.

401
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
What I want you to know

402
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,030
is you can't do business
with brute force.

403
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,270
We need skills.

404
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,560
Business is art.

405
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,230
I can teach you this.

406
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,340
I can teach you the thinking logic
of a businessman.

407
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,510
If you're willing,

408
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I can help you to apply for
Cambridge Business School.

409
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,870
What happened?

410
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,630
Why are you hospitalised?

411
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,510
Dumplings.

412
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,150
I'm okay.

413
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,920
When I ran away this morning,

414
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,850
I got hit by a car.

415
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,840
The car owner gave me

416
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,500
two thousand yuan
without saying anything.

417
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,330
I think it's easy to earn her money.

418
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,200
I said I wanted to go to the hospital.

419
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,530
I didn't expect her
to really send me here.

420
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,350
They just left.

421
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,740
They're interested in your designs.

422
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,260
They want to work with you.

423
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,980
You faked an accident
and conned their money?

424
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,590
No, I rob the rich to help the poor.

425
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,930
Rob the rich to help the poor.

426
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,200
You still can't do that.

427
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,070
See?

428
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,080
I told you there must be a problem.

429
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,710
Mr Five's work is good.

430
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
How could there be someone like you?

431
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,630
You played me?

432
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,100
You are...

433
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,510
I'm Qian Xi Xi.

434
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Are you

435
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,180
the legendary Mr Five?

436
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,870
Finally.

437
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,390
Let me introduce myself formally.

438
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,620
I'm a broadcaster of Rui Live,

439
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,270
a subsidiary company of QE Group.

440
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,420
I'm Qian Xi Xi.

441
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,690
She's a streamer now,

442
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,490
but she'll be a CEO in the future.

443
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,380
It's them.

444
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,210
I'll ask my tutor to write
a letter of recommendation for you.

445
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,700
But,

446
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,450
I'm just a university student
in a small county.

447
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,450
I only have some

448
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,570
experience as a salesperson
and model.

449
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,120
Will they accept me?

450
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,440
Don't worry about this.

451
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,420
You're more than a streamer.

452
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,070
I can give you experience

453
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,960
in human resources and finance.

454
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,690
If that's not enough,

455
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,910
I'll use my mall to act as guarantor.

456
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,200
It seems that everything is in order.

457
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,690
If you work with me,

458
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,890
I'll definitely not let you down.

459
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,010
Okay?

460
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,480
Duan Ran, you can't fool me.

461
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,360
Believe in me.

462
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,270
-That's settled then.
-That's settled then.

463
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,240
Actually, there was an e-commerce company

464
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,750
who wanted to buy Xiao Wu's design.

465
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,000
But they cheated her.

466
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,920
So when I heard that you're
from an e-commerce company,

467
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,280
I was very angry.

468
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,440
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,600
He's too straightforward.

470
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,920
He's one-track minded.

471
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,550
He thinks the whole world is bad
after being cheated once.

472
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,810
Don't be mad at him.

473
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,320
It's okay.

474
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,570
With Mao's personality,

475
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,150
I'm sure he makes a loyal friend.

476
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,640
No discord, no concord.

477
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,400
You're my friend from now on.

478
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,110
Okay.

479
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,810
If there's any good design
on Cat Street,

480
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,930
you must think of me first.

481
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,750
Okay.

482
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,030
I've taken a look at the medical bill.

483
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,150
It's around 3,000 yuan.

484
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,090
Let's add as friends in WeChat.

485
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,730
I'll transfer the money to you.

486
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,330
Don't need to transfer to me.

487
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,810
Think of it as a full body check-up
for Mao.

488
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,730
But I didn't expect you
to be the real Mr Five.

489
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,970
I want to discuss about working together.

490
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,970
Sell your fabulous designs online.

491
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,400
It's two different things.

492
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,610
It was his fault this time.

493
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,340
You need to take back the money.

494
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,690
Let's add each other on WeChat.

495
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,760
Tomorrow, we'll finalise
the plan for clearance.

496
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,840
So we want to discuss with you
about cooperation.

497
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,910
Why not we find a place
and drink something?

498
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,000
Okay.

499
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,780
You can go to my studio as well.

500
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,490
Okay. Let's go.

501
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,780
Let's go.

502
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,210
But our house is shabby and small.

503
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,410
I hope you don't mind.

504
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,220
I won't. Let's go.

505
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,510
Let me take it.

506
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,860
I was wrong.

507
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,440
Our house is a bit small and messy.

508
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,350
I hope you don't mind.

509
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,440
Have a seat.

510
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,200
I don't pay attention to lifestyle.

511
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,080
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,650
We're troubling you by coming here.

513
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,850
Thanks, Mao.

514
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,480
You're welcome.

515
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,300
I especially like the denim you made.

516
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,540
All are very thoughtful designs.

517
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,440
Denim is good quality and cheap,
it's suitable for all seasons.

518
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,100
It's trendy and avant-garde.
It's very useful.

519
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,060
Have you studied fashion design before?

520
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,080
I graduated from
Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology.

521
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,520
Then why did you become a street vendor?

522
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,740
For money.

523
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,600
Xi Xi, these pants are quite unique.

524
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,110
It's so cool.

525
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,570
How did you come up
with the stitched design?

526
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,390
That was made with my old clothes.

527
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,100
We wear it during work.

528
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,370
Old clothes?

529
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,150
You're too humble.

530
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,460
Let me tell you both.

531
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,440
She's not only a good designer,

532
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,970
but also a good tailor.

533
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,240
The pants may look unremarkable,

534
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,150
but she sewed it herself.

535
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,440
She sewed it herself?

536
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,920
Really?

537
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,780
The details are too good.

538
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,810
Right? I love it too.

539
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,690
Make me one too.

540
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,160
Su Su.

541
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,680
There are over 3,000 pairs of jeans

542
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,450
in our warehouse right now?

543
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,410
A total of 3625 pairs of jeans.

544
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,600
And some other

545
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,880
skirts and shirts.

546
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,730
With these 3625 pairs of jeans

547
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,560
plus Mr Five's designs

548
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,580
and alteration by Mr Five herself,

549
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,050
our clearance will blow the roof, no?

550
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,720
If you have a market,

551
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,300
I'm willing to cooperate.

552
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,270
We happen to need money.

553
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,200
Why are you back so late?

554
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,030
You work too hard.

555
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,550
It's not hard at all.

556
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
I'm very happy.

557
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,240
Xi Xi, you don't need to do this.

558
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,330
There's no need.

559
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,870
You're wasting time

560
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,750
and your life, what's the point?

561
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,440
It's useless in the end.

562
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,020
You just lie here

563
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,400
and watch your TV.

564
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,080
Anyway, your defeat is set.

565
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,100
You have so many ideas.

566
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,260
I can't wait

567
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,870
to tell you the good news.

568
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,960
I met a great designer.

569
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,480
Not only can she design well,

570
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,740
but she looks cool too.

571
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,230
Not only can she be the broadcaster,

572
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,700
she can also design her own clothes

573
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,870
and stream it.

574
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,060
How can you beat me?

575
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,750
In that case,

576
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,800
I want to tell you good news too.

577
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,420
What is it?

578
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,800
You signed a new streamer?

579
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,630
Not only a new streamer,

580
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,590
but a popular girl.

581
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,600
Most importantly,
she's close with you.

582
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,290
You went to see Zhang Jia Yun?

583
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,370
She agreed.

584
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,800
Are you serious?

585
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,020
What did she say?

586
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,800
No need to call her. I advise you

587
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,270
to give up right now.

588
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,750
I'll take it as a half loss.

589
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,750
Zhang Jia Yun, what's happening?

590
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,610
You agreed to come to the company?

591
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,030
[Yeah, are you surprised?]

592
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,210
I persuaded you so many times
but you rejected me.

593
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,480
But you agreed after Duan Ran
persuaded you once?

594
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,810
You're not good.

595
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,310
Yeah, why so?

596
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,540
Why did she agree after I persuaded her?

597
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,940
Didn't you say she dislikes this industry?

598
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,230
She doesn't like it.

599
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,600
Okay, I now have a streamer

600
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,470
and the goods.

601
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,270
I'll be the CEO for sure.

602
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,630
Nothing to be worried about.

603
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,480
Xi Xi, you just keep your inventory

604
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,810
and waste your time.

605
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,020
Don't overwork yourself.

606
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,940
Can you stop being boastful?

607
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
No.

608
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,440
I'm happy.

609
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,670
So happy.

610
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,790
Move!

611
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Fine, I don't want to argue with you.

612
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,330
Sleep early.

613
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,380
You sleep early.

614
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,240
I'm too happy to be asleep.

615
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,330
Zhang Jia Yun, what's this?

616
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,440
Hello, everyone.

617
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,070
Hello, everyone.

618
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,360
Hello, babes!

619
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,020
-Look here.
-Hello, everyone.

620
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,590
Can I say "everyone"?

621
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,000
We call them "babes".

622
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,030
I can't say "babes".

623
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,230
"Hello, everyone."

624
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,350
It's okay.

625
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,950
Think of this studio

626
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,810
as the exclusive live stream room
for Mr Five.

627
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,720
Let's start.

628
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,640
And this is my streaming room?

629
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,370
Introduce your clothes.

630
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,040
Just talk about its fabric or something.

631
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,420
Fabric?

632
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,230
Jia Yun?

633
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
What's wrong?
Don't you welcome me?

634
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,340
I came to work.

635
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,180
You came to work at my company?

636
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,230
Jia Yun is the core strength
of our team.

637
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,710
Who dare not welcome her?

638
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,900
Do you dare?

639
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,110
You all dare not.

640
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,420
Zhang Jia Yun,
you got bribed by him just like that?

641
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,530
What do you mean your team?

642
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,600
Although we're competing to be the CEO,

643
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,440
this is our company.

644
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,510
You said I'm petty.

645
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,620
Who's petty now?

646
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,700
Stop the nonsense.

647
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,990
Are you guys rehearsing?

648
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,340
You're practicing.

649
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
Yes.

650
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,490
The result is good.

651
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,280
This is my secret weapon
I told you yesterday, Mr Five.

652
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,810
Mr Five is extremely talented.

653
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,850
She's a heavyweight
with its own traffic.

654
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,540
Yeah, Xi Xi is personally training her.

655
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,690
She'll be the next Yuan Yuan for sure.

656
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,840
You're the trainer?

657
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,840
-Of course.
-Can you not harm others?

658
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,050
You yourself are not even well-trained.

659
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,450
How can you train others?

660
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,160
Don't be led astray by her.

661
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,870
This is an intensive training.

662
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,870
Train for live streaming during the day

663
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,990
and alter clothes during the night.

664
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,590
She'll start work tomorrow.

665
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,300
Don't work so hard.

666
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,600
Rest when you should.

667
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,800
It's pointless

668
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,490
to be so tired after all.

669
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,430
Hurry up and rest.

670
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,720
I'll show you around.

671
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,420
Forget about this. Just rest.

672
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,710
What's good to see in the company?

673
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,750
Jia Yun, stay here.

674
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,860
-Stand here!
-What are you doing?

675

Let her go. What are you doing?

-Don't.
-Let her go!

You hit me. What are you doing?

-Okay.
-Did you see?

681
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,700
He hit me. Will you still go with him?

682
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,850
Let's talk later. Bye.

Hurry!

How dare you snatch my people?

685
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,100
You snatched my people.
Zhang Jia Yun belongs to me.

-We can't rest!

Let's start, just now...

How is it? Are you satisfied
with the overall environment?

690
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,630
This is not my first time here,

691
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,160
but it's my first time
to visit as an employee.

692
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,910
It's not bad, I'm satisfied.

693
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,420
You're quick to adjust to the situation.

You've the employee mindset now.

695

Of course.

Mr Duan Jr,
when will I start selling goods?

697
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,700
Not in a hurry.

698
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,070
We just took over.

699

We're still negotiating with brands.

700
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,690
When I have the brands,

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,750
How can Xi Xi train you?

706
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,950
Right?

707
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,270
You just rest at home.

Wait for my good news.

I think so.

It's too hard to make this money.

is more than what I did for half a year.

Did you arrange an undercover
to monitor us?

I guessed you guys should still
be wasting time at the company.

Wasting time?

Including those terms for a breach.

813

Can you get used to it
after coming back to China?

829
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
Yes.

830
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,860
After I returned to China,

831
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,920
I took over a live streaming company.

832
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,200
I set-up a new e-commerce company.

833

Great.

But now  e-commerce is blooming.

I think the Internet has a big impact

844
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,420
on the real economy.

845
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,620
Uncle Mu.

846
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,250
First of all, e-commerce

847
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,040
has much higher profits
than physical sales.

848
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,410
Then, e-commerce

849
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,330
has broken the constraints
of time and geography.

850
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,210
If you want to buy something,
you can just buy it through the phone.

851
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,670
And one last point,

852
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,500
the traditional ways of advertising

853
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,460
are not very effective now.

854
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,130
The youngsters now just install
applications in their phones

855
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,960
and see what they want to see.

856
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,510
They can directly find
the most popular fashion of the season.

857
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,900
Duan Ran.

858
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,510
Tell me.

859
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,960
What should I do?

860
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,480
Uncle.

861
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,210
I just happened to have
a live streaming company.

862
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,680
I think Rui can directly open up

863
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,460
an online service market for Perfect Blue.

864
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,990
You've heard of Pineapple Xpress, right?

865
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,640
They're now doing e-commerce

866
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,540
Perfect Blue can't lose to them.

867
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,730
Father!

868
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,340
-Uncle Mu.
-What happened?

869
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,510
Father.

870
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,410
Talk slowly, Father. Don't be anxious.

871
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,520
You stop talking.

872
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,640
My father can't listen to this now.

873
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,340
-Father.
-That Wu!

874
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,980
The reporter interviewed him that day
and he slandered me.

875
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,130
He said

876
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,810
I sell counterfeit goods

877
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,660
and made my fortune with OEM products.

878
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,580
I've been running Perfect Blue
for so many years.

879
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,140
I worked so hard

880
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,090
to build the enterprise.

881
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,030
That Wu Zhong Quan
beat me down just like that.

882
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,050
Calm down.

883
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,170
Don't be angry.

884
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,350
Uncle, listen.

885
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,600
I've an idea.

886
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:04,780
Perfect Blue is now mainly
targetting women.

887
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,860
Right?

888
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,020
We'll find a suitable streamer

889
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,730
and package her accordingly.

890
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,120
It can give Perfect Blue
a brand-new image.

891
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,890
Duan Ran.

892
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,440
You draft a contract right away.

893
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,090
Let's work together.
We'll be better than him.

894
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,720
Okay, uncle. Don't worry.

895
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,220
I'll go write the contract

896
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,520
and get it back to you
as soon as possible, okay?

897
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,560
You take care.

898
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,930
It's okay, I...

899
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,210
I get angry when talk about this.

900
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,550
-I'll go back first.
-Okay, we'll call you.

901
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,500
Okay.

902
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,820
Father, I've told you.

903
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,020
Don't be anxious.

904
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,950
Leave the rest to me, okay?

905
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,090
Don't worry.

906
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,490
[Shapowei]

907
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,730
Wake up.

908
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,980
What's the time now?

909
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,640
It's dawn.

910
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,660
Let's go home.

911
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,940
How can you work all day and night?

912
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,470
They treat you like a slave.

913
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,380
No such thing.

914
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,240
You're fated to work.

915
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,470
Hurry up and eat it.

916
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,450
Oh, right.

917
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,400
I want to discuss something with you.

918
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,860
Xi Xi wants me to be a broadcaster at Rui.

919
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,480
Every streamer needs an operator.

920
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,280
We have chemistry.

921
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,370
Come and help me.

922
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,610
Please spare me.

923
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,340
I know you're afraid of being restrained.

924
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,450
But you'll have a fixed salary
if you come to work.

925
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,590
Your mother can be more at ease.

926
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,620
You're right.

927
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,850
You want to say "but", right?

928
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,400
You see, I have a stall at Cat Street.

929
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,780
I'm not earning much,

930
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,910
but time is flexible.

931
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,640
You know about my mother's condition.

932
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,840
I can be there in five minutes
if she calls me.

933
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,310
Besides, my friends from Cat Street

934
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,170
grew up together with me.

935
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,150
If I really come here to work

936
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,940
and dress up like Mr Duan every day,

937
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,140
looking all serious,

938
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,240
they'll laugh at me.

939
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,760
I feel awkward just imagining it.

940
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,460
Go home, you haven't slept all night.

941
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,280
Hurry home and see your mother.

942
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,370
Okay.

943
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,200
You eat this while it's hot.

944
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,820
Hurry up and eat.
