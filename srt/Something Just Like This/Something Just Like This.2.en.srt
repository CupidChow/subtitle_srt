00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,570
Yes, it's good.

171
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,460
Mr Chen is the best.

172
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,590
That might be good,

173
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,290
it's even better
if you could return our phones.

174
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,870
Agree.

175
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,520
It's commercial confidentiality.

176
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,930
This is company activity.

177
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,910
Moreover, doesn't your spine hurt?

178
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,630
Constantly peering into the phones?

179
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,560
We should look up at the sky
as we are out here,

180
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,230
look at the ocean. How nice.

181
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,050
But you still posted on social media.

182
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,600
Your phones are here.

183
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,890
They're safe.

184
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,430
Chen Lang posted on Moments.

185
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,500
Where is this place?

186
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,610
Could be Hainan.

187
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,720
We can only confirm that
they are still in the country.

188
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,130
It's been over ten hours
since yesterday afternoon.

189
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,140
It's too late now to get a visa.

190
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,600

192

is Sanya.

193
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,740
Are you sure there's only Sanya?

194
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,150
It's only Sanya.

195
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,290
Reasonable.

196
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,060
Yu Shi,

197
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,910
do you have the previous booking records

198
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,240
of hotel and flights for our company here?

199
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,880
Pull the number
of the booking company.

200
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,030
Give me 20 seconds.

201
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,540
What is he supposed to do?

202
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,660
You mean Yu Shi?

203
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,870
He was assigned as treasurer by the bosses

204
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,990
since Uncle Duan acquired the company.

205
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,880
Chen Lang has been disdaining him.

206
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,220
He's a bit weird.

207
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,200
I understand.

208
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,810
-Ladies, are you feeling thirsty?
-Yes.

209
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,730
If so,

210
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,800
there are juices and cocktails,
go and help yourselves.

211
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,060
-There are cocktails.
-Hurry, let's go.

212
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,720
Oh right, Mr Chen.

213
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,040
Didn't you say that Xi Xi's flight

214
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,450
are half an hour late?

215
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,070
Why hasn't she reached yet?

216
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,330
Xi Xi called me just now

217
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,650
saying that she is not feeling well.

218
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,810
I told her to rest

219
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,290
since there is no live-streaming today.

[Flight MF8307]

223
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,950
Thank you.

Sanya.

225
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,480
It takes half an hour
to reach the airport from here.

226
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,510
I'll buy two flight tickets to Sanya.

227
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,330
Let's go.

228

Director Qian.

229
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,590
Since you guys are leaving,

230
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,100
does it mean that I can go home?

231
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,370
No.

232
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,650
You have to stay here.

233
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,580
I'll call you if there's anything.

234
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,060
I can't understand,

235
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,210
What methods did Chen Lang use

236
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,540
to get everyone
to go with him obediently?

237
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,090
Chen Lang, what is he like?

238
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,290
He is the most complicated person

239
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,450
that I've ever met so far in my career.

240
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,760
His background is not that wealthy,
but he has ideas.

241
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,220
[He is unwilling to be
a normal programmer.]

242
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,920
[He used his savings,]

243
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,110
[sold his house]

244
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,760
[and came to Xiamen to establish a start-up.]

245
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,540
[Anyway, he is a tough guy.]

[Live broadcast starting
in 4 hours 40 minutes]

247
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,580
What happened?

248
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,530
I heard your conversation just now.

249
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,970
The webcast isn't cancelled, right?

250
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,870
Did something happen to the company?

251
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,010
Yuan Yuan, listen to me.

252
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,260
[Ran Ran,]

253
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,320

he's not easy to deal with.]

254
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,050
[This time, whatever you do,]

255
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,590
discuss more with Xi Xi.

256
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,920
Do you understand?

257
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,300
Don't worry,

258
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,930
I surely will
track Chen Lang, this jerk down.

259
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,320
What did Uncle Duan say?

260
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,760
Dad said to let us both handle this.

261
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,380
I made a huge effort to get this job.

262
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,370
I can't let others ruin it.

263
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,780
But he took the people and products away.

264
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,510
There's too much uncertainty,

265
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,090
such as to broadcast or not
and the way to do it.

266
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,690
We have to be well-prepared.

267
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,800
You just said that

268
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,040
rules are rigid, but people are flexible.

269
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,680
Let's say after we reach Sanya,

270
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,870
we find a broadcaster

271
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,670
but Chen Lang doesn't want
to return the products.

272
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,630
I don't care anyway.

273
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,850
The live stream must happen.

274
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,370
After we reach Sanya,
you're in charge of finding them,

275
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,330
I'll buy clothes in the mall, okay?

276
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,300
Okay.

277
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,680
Which side?

278
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,410
What if Mr Duan disagrees with it?

279
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Are you planning to go down with him?

280
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,130
You don't have to be worried.

281
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,500
I have my own plan.

282
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,130
Now, I...

283
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,220
Now, I have confidence that

284
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,810
there's 80 percent chance Duan Sheng Yun
would agree.

285
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,670
Because the current offline products
by QE are awful.

286
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,130
He won't leave Rui behind.

287
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,190
Even if Mr Duan agreed,

288
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,360
there's still no time to webcast
if we go back now.

289
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,680
The clothes are here with me.

290
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,810
As long as he agrees,

291
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,850
we can stream from here right away.

292
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,860
It's none of my business anyway.

293
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,190
It's all your business.

294
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,260
I only care whether it happens today.

295
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,860
I need to prepare in advance.

296
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,880
Yuan Yuan, you truly are
a dedicated broadcaster.

297
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,300
You are definitely
the best in the company.

298
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,380
Yuan Yuan, the reason why
I tell you this much

299
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,440
is that I trust you.

300
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,700
I'm treating you as one of us.

301
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,080
So let me handle this,

302
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,740
you don't have to worry.

303
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,140
Alright.

304
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,660
And also, Yuan Yuan,

305
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,440
as long as I, Chen Lang,
am still in this industry,

306
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,820
the position of head broadcaster
in my company

307
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,310
will always be there for you.

308
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,810
So don't let me down.

309
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,550
Don't let them know about this.

310
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,980
Alright.

311
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,020
I still can't get through them,
what to do?

312
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,250
What happened?

313
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,670
Then, where should we go now?

314
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,820
Let's go out first,
we can't stay in the airport.

315
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,480
We still don't know where to go
even if we are out.

316
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,140
What's wrong?
There's no one answering the phone.

317
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,440
Where did you get this?

318
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,860
There.

319
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,680
Go take one for me.

320
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,690
Alright, I'll go get it first.

321
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,500
Let me have a rest here.

322
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,850
Thank you. No problem.

323
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,450
Su Su is calling.

324
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,430
Answer it.

[Hello, Xi Xi.]

are you okay?

327
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,839
Don't listen to him, I'm healthy.

Mr Chen said the webcast today
is cancelled.

330

All our phones have being  confiscated.

331
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,660
I secretly took mine.

332

[What is Chen Lang trying to do?]

333
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,610
Is he crazy?

334
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,380
Listen to me, the webcast isn't cancelled.

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,150
How about 166?

501
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,560
And 598?

502
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,330
Do you have any stocks for XM400?

503
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,900
How about 753? Is it all done?

504
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,030
[Pineapple Xpress]

505
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,590
- It's ready.
- I'm leaving.

506
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,870
Great! For size S and size M,
I need one for each.

507
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,340
Driver, hurry up!
Design of Nishiyama Yohji collaboration,

508
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,570
Is it available in your store?

509
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,610
Pineapple Xpress... I've visited them.

510
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,870
Why isn't she answering,
it's so annoying.

511
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,730
Have you seen this girl?

512
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,410
She was here just now.

513
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,690
Where did she go?

514
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,730
I have no idea.

515
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,030
I'm starving.

516
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,370
Is Nishiyama Yohji out of stock?

517
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,870
You have it?

518
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,150
Great!

519
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,650
Can you wrap it up for me?
I'll be there soon.

520
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm here.

521
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,170
The clothes that I want,
are they ready?

522
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,700
It's already ready for you.

523
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,110
Great.

524
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,900
Do you still have stocks for the
Nishiyama Yohji collaboration?

525
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,180
We might have.

526
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,350
You still have stocks for
Nishiyama Yohji's collaboration?

527
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,080
Please wait for a moment,
I'll check it up for you.

528
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,320
This is incredible.

529
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,140
Mr Duan Jr?

530
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,920
Are you Su Su?

531
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,540
You had me worried sick.

532
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,860
Miss Qian.

533
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,220
We had all the products you want.

534
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,980
Wow, you guys are amazing.

535
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,250
Thank you.

536
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,420
But we don't have Nishiyama Yohji.

537
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,630
We don't have a direction.

538
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,690
Fine, I'll go rent a boat.

539
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,580
Okay, just wait.

540
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,440
Yuan Yuan?

541
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,730
Hello, Yuan Yuan.

542
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,220
Hello, Su Su, tell me the truth.

543
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,930
Chen Lang and Mr Duan,

544
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,690
what happened to both of them?

545
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,980
Mister, do you still have boat to lend?

546
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,590
No, they are all rented out.

547
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,930
Not even a boat? Any boat is fine.

548
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,750
There's no boat left.

549
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,410
I'm fine with this too.

550
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,920
This is already rented out.

551
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,940
If you really do want to rent boat,

552
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,310
we still have a big one.

553
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,080
A big one? Big is good, I'll take it.
Hurry up.

554
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,980
Let's go.

555
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,940
Mr Duan Jr,

556
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,470
I have their location.

557
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Who sent it to you?

558
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,590
It's Yuan Yuan.

559
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,610
Where is this island?

560
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,370
I just rent two boats.

561
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,960
We'll leave first by riding one
and another will wait for Xi Xi.

562
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,070
Let me tell you, I paid a lot

563
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,490
for you guys at this time

564
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,280
by renting two big boats.

565
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,040

-Xi Xi.
-[How are things going?]

568
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,380
I'm with Su Su now.

569
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,010
We already know their location.

570
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,200
We are now going to find them.

571
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,390
I rented two boats,

572
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,660
one for you.

573
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,860
Have you finished buying the clothes?

574
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,450
[Don't mention it.]

575
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,910
I've bought all basic edition,

576
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,850
but I'm missing
Nishiyama Yohji collaboration.

577
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,830
I'd been through all stores in Sanya,

578
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,880
it's all sold out.

579
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,910
This edition is their main design
of this season.

580
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,930
It has to be broadcasted on this webcast.

581
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,290
What should we do now?

582
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,880
[The webcast is going to start soon.]

583
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,080
[We can't delay it
because of those items.]

584

Come over first.

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,070
[Alright.]

586
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,870
-[I'm coming now.]
-Okay.

587
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,290
-Mr Duan Jr, where is it?
-There it is.

588
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,040
Come, get on the boat.

589
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,370
This...

590
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,870
This is the boat that you paid a lot for?

591
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,500
It's not bad already, hers is worse.
Let's go.

592
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,980
Mister, Xidao Dock.

[Live broadcast starting in 41 minutes]

594
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,800
Chen Lang, I've hidden the clothes.

595
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,830
It's fail-safe, relax.

596
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,630
Have a sit.

597
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,240
Chen Lang,

598
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,190
there's only half an hour left
before the webcast begins.

599
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,920
Are we really not going to do it?

600
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,330
Duan Sheng Yun really is patient.

601
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,500
It's been a few hours.

602
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,150
[Hello?]

603
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,730

604
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,450
[hurry back.]

605
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,950
[It's quite hot there.]

606
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,110
[Stop making everyone anxious.]

607
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,220
[Give me some response.]

608
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,540
[What's the big deal?]

609
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,310
[Don't you feel ashamed]

610

[to run away from home at your age?]

611
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,830
Don't be an idiot.

612
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,390
I'm now negotiating with you Duans.

613
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,750
It's about my shares, my work

614
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,460
and my career.

615
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,670
[Listen, I've been aggravated by you.]

616
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,220
[Now I've come to Sanya, that's enough.]

617
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,170
[Xi Xi is about to have heatstroke.
Stop torturing her.]

618
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,500
If you really care about her,

619
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,320
I suggest you'd better
take her to a cool place.

620
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,820
Just take a hike.

621
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,400
Get out of my way.

622
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,650
Where is the boat?

623
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,920
This dude is unreliable.

624
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,620
I thought he said there's a boat for me.

625
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,680
Is his phone a brick?

626
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,440
Duan Ran, can't you answer the phone?

627
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,650
This won't do.

628
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,180
Pineapple Xpress has strict requirements
for the stream.

629
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,460
We'll have to pay
if we can't start on time.

630
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,460
Stop pretending.

631
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,570
Pay attention.

632
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,760
The person I negotiate with is your dad,
not you.

633
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,070
I know the terms of violating the contract
better than you.

634
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,180
I can start the stream
whenever I want to.

635
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,370
Oh, foolish junior.

636
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,700
Going down together
won't be good for you,

637
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,240
your dad or QE.

638
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,450
If the Pineapple Xpress stream
doesn't go well today,

639
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,660
let's see how your dad
explains to the Board of Directors.

640
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,000
Let see how cool you are

641
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,420
when your dad is screwed.

642
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,590
Be careful of what you say.

643
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,120
Why?

644
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,000
You watch your mouth.

645
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,840
[Just you wait.]

646
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,380
I'm waiting.

647
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,840
What?

648
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,610
Come and find me.

649
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,440
I'll wait for you.

650
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,000
Stop fooling me around.

651
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,400
I'll come now.

652
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,030
It won't make a difference.

653
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,570
I've already told you my condition.

654
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,420
If your family agrees to it,

655
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:22,270
I'll give you an unprecedented
live stream from the island.

656
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,630
Think of it as a finale

657
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,600
before I take Rui away from QE.

658
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,100
Turn around.

659
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,380
I'll let you see how cool I'll be.

660
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,980
You still have the audacity
to pitch a tent here?

661
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,790
Threaten my dad, bully my sister,

662
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,460
and now you're fussing with me.

663
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,480
Do you think you're the best?

664
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,510
I feel pity for my dad.

665
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,010
Why did he choose
such a scoundrel like you?

666
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,630
Are you finished?

667
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,850
Let me tell you what your dad is like.

668
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,870
When Rui was in crisis, your dad set me up

669
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,860
by capitalizing

670
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,390
and took 80 percent
of Rui's shares from me.

671
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,830
He took advantage of me.

672
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,300
That's what your dad is like.

673
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,130
I didn't catch his attention.

674
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,060
It was the business which he wants.

675
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,050
You're such a loser.

676
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,260
No wonder your company can't grow.

677
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,150
Why?

678
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,410
Because of the attitude of your boss.

679
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,650
He can't build it up.

680
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,620
I just went to your company
and had a look.

681
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,380
Did that already scare you off?

682
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,860
Just runaway by your own if you want.

683
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,590
What for taking everyone with you?
Are you crazy?

684
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,530
Duan Ran,

685
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,690
I don't have to argue with you.

686
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,930
Let me tell you the truth.

687
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,680
I went to your company

688
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,540
to meet Xi Xi for lunch.

689
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,430
I didn't even know you existed.

690
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,470
I couldn't care less about
your small company.

691
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,280
Seems like you busted yourself.

692
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,970
A fox can't hide its tail, right?

693
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,640
You can say whatever you want.

694
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:06,130
There's only a few minutes left
before the broadcast starts.

695
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,990
First, there's no broadcaster.
Second, there are no products.

696
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,660
What are you going to do?

697
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,150
Okay, I'm fine with blowing your mind.

698
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,620
I can't do anything except waiting.

699
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,230
-[Xi Xi.]
-Hello.

700
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,820
Are you on the boat now?

701
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,890
I'm still at the dock.

702
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,690
Dude, where is your boat?

703
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,420
[It's at the dock.]

704
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,030
[The biggest one.]

705
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,570
[Can't you see it?]

706
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,760
This huge one?

707
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,720
This is the boat for me?

708
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,620
Little flower,

709
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,400
I know it's boring.

710
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,880
I have to repeat the work every day,

711
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,020
day after day.

712
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,020
Today, I repeated what I did yesterday.

713
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,180
I'm bored too,

714
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,640
but I'm happy.

715
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,180
Think about it. We are avoiding

716
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,990
intense surprises this way.

717
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,220
We can also avoid unnecessary sadness.

718
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,610
Xi Xi?

719
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,160
Why is there no one in the company?

720
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,820
Why don't you switch on the light?

721
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,060
Our company is usually pretty thrifty.

722
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,980
Who are you?

723
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,800
Wu Zhong Quan,
the Chief Executive Officer of Pineapple Xpress.

724
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,860
Hello, Mr Wu.

725
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,150
Hello, Mr Wu.

726
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,040
I'm Yu Shi from Rui.

727
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,580
Please have a sit.

728
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,020
What happened to your company?
Where is everyone?

729
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,020
They all went out.

730
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,230
They went out to make

731
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,930
an unprecedented outdoor
live broadcast for Pineapple Xpress.

732
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,760
-Outdoor live broadcast?
-Yes.

733
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,270
How come Director Qian never mentioned it?

734
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,300
Next time, make sure you notify me
before there's any alteration.

735
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,060
She didn't answer the phone too.

736
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,460
She is not free now.

737
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,190
You see, it's about time.

738
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,040
[Live broadcast starting in 6 minutes]

739
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,080
I'm assuming she is having her make up.

740
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,940
It's really difficult for her
to answer your phone.

741
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,280
This live broadcast is customised

742
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,650
for your company and it is confidential.

743
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,070
That will surprise you.

744
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,790
Surprise?

745
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,880
I like it.

746
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,480
Right, surprise.

747
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,950
Hello, Yu Shi.

748
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:25,970
Bad news.

749
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,350
Mr Wu from Pineapple Xpress came to
the office all of a sudden,

750
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,110
[saying that he wants to
watch the live broadcast.]

751
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,780
[There's a few minutes left
before the broadcast begins.]

752
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,800
What should I do?

753
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,410
Why would Mr Wu come to
the office at this time?

754
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,840
[How would I know?]

755
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,640
Maybe he's worried.

756
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,030
How more time do you guys need then?

757
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,250
I'm still on the sea.

758
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,210
I don't know how long it will take.

759
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,130
Might need quite some time.

760
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,320
Look, Yu Shi,

761
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,210
I need you to distract Mr Wu.

762
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,800
I'll give Duan Ran a call.

763
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,090
Director Qian...

764
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,350
-Xi Xi.
-[Duan Ran.]

765
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,040
Pineapple Xpress's live starts
in a few minutes.

766
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,450
I might not make it in time.

767
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,050
Yu Shi just called me,
saying that Mr Wu came to the office.

768
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,100
Mr Wu?

769
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,490
I suggest you to stop squaring off.

770
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,680
Hurry up and call your dad.

771
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Tell him to agree.

772
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,880
Shut up!

773
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,080
Xi Xi, it's okay.

774
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,350
Don't panic.

775
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,300
Start the broadcast once the time is up.

776
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,110
You're a broadcaster, right?

777
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,000
We have the clothes with us too.

778
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,010
Just start it.

779
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,080
Hang in there, I'll take this one.

780
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,630
[Is Chen Lang next to you?]

781
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,260
Put him on the phone,
let me speak with him.

782
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,170
[Chen Lang.]

783
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,450
[What exactly are you asking for?]

784
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,670
Return Rui to me

785
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,010
according to the original price.

786
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,440
Nice try.

787
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,830
I'm not finished yet.

788
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,210
In light of what happened,
Mr Duan did help me.

789
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,830
I can allow QE to have 49 percent shares.

790
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,470
On the condition that his silly son

791
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,750
leave the company

792
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,080
and never step into Rui Live.

793
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,930
Xi Xi, what's the consequence

794
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,850
if I don't agree with this?

795
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,550
He said if you disagrees with
his three conditions,

796
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,620
it may be at risk of default

797
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,380
if we fail to broadcast.

798
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,240
Get Ran Ran.

799
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,740
Okay. I'll create a voice call group

800
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,980
and add him in.

801
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,600
Okay.

802
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,020
Done.

803
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,200
Hello.

804
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,020
Dad, listen to me.

805
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:49,110
Chen Lang, this jerk is trying to
take advantage of us.

806
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,260
It's okay. You don't have to be worried.

807
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,710
We have the clothes with us too.

808
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,030
The broadcast can proceed normally.

809
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,390
We don't have to panic.

810
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,110
Xi Xi,

811
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,550
what do you think?

812
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,240
I think Chen Lang is the kind of person
that has a lot of ideas.

813
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,610
Things won't be that easy.

814
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,940
Forget about Chen Lang.

815
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,470
Just start the live broadcast
once the time is up.

816
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,660
Don't worry about the rest.

817
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,150
We have the clothes

818
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,740
and you have a luxury yacht.

819
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,580
You can sell whatever you show now.

820
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,080
It doesn't count as a default

821
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,580
as long as there's someone

822
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,090
to broadcast before airtime.

823
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,820
You will have to hang in there
for 25 to 35 minutes.

824
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,160
Xi Xi?

825
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,040
Hello?

826
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,280
[Okay.]

827
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,980
Muster up the courage you had during
the summer stream and start.

828
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,560
Get Chen Lang,
I want to have a talk with him.

829
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,440
Mr Duan wants to give you his consolation.

830
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,950
Mr Duan,

831
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,810
I'm forced to do this.
There's no other way.

832
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,270
[Chen Lang.]

833
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,290
[I get the gist.]

834
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,800
I think that our collaboration
with customers

835
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,520
shouldn't be affected
by internal problems.

836
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,230
This is a fundamental principle.

837
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,900
[Internal problems
should be dealt with ourselves.]

838
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,220
[As for Ran Ran,]

839
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,780
[he never had the intention
to work at your company.]

840
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,830
[He is not a threat to you.]
