[We Are Young]

00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,260
[Episode 40]

4
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,430
Back then, you left Rui.

5
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,030
I can understand.

6
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,490
Since the whole start-up team

7
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,980
only owns 20% of shares.

8
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,500
That was unreasonable.

9
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,740
Young people like you

10
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,210
contributed your prime to the company.

11
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,620
That is more valuable

12
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,170
than the money I invested.

13
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,470
I understand this completely.

14
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,740
That is why I agreed

15
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,390
to transfer a portion

16
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,990
of my personal shares to you.

17
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,660
You didn't want them

18
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,940
and insisted to leave.

19
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,940
I know

20
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,979
that you were pressured by the investors.

21
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,289
I tried many times to talk to you,

22
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,020
but you wouldn't listen.

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,630
You were very stubborn.

24
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,170
I understand now,

25
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,789
but it's too late.

26
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,780
If it is too late,

27
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,660
we will not be able to meet today.

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,900
Chen Lang.

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,750
Do you know why we
invited you over tonight?

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,750
Please tell me.

31
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,120
Actually, I'm aware

32
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,650
QE isn't performing as well as before.

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,820
You've always

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,620
wanted to restructure QE

35
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,460
towards the direction of
entertainment, theatres

36
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,950
and F&B.

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,720
Yes.

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,590
I want QE to be a centralized
entertainment centre.

39
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,760
Leave the retailing online.

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,430
But Duan isn't interested.

41
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,990
That's because
Uncle Duan is a conservative.

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,230
You were his right-hand man for years.

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,760
You're easily as good as he is.

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,160
Wouldn't you like to achieve
your goals and ambitions?

45
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,730
If I said I've never thought so,

46
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,850
I would be lying to you.

47
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,540
However, I don't want to betray Duan.

48
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,740
After what happened to Chen Lang,

49
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,340
I released the shares of

50
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,690
Cloud Live immediately.

51
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,890
You're aware of this.

52
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,980
Those were garbage assets.

53
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,380
Do whatever you like with it.

54
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,420
Yes.

55
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,260
My company owns
60% of Cloud Live's equity.

56
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,110
After selling it off,

57
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,579
not only did I avoid a loss,

58
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,110
I even made a profit of
over one million bucks.

59
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,820
That isn't bad.

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,430
Do you know

61
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,260
who the buyer was?

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,150
You're honest to him,

63
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,060
but look at the way he treats you.

64
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,740
I bought all of the shares

65
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,180
of Cloud Live from the investor.

66
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,670
That means,

67
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,260
sixty percent of your company
now belongs to me.

68
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,100
I made a decision.

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,910
You shall

70
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,440
continue to operate Cloud Live.

71
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,370
However,

72
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,950
like I requested the same of Duan Ran,

73
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,430
I want you

74
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,370
to get Cloud Live back on track

75
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,870
within a year.

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,890
Are you willing to take over

77
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,579
and start over again?

78
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,080
Are you still willing to trust me?

79
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,880
I've always trusted you.

80
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,220
You're just unwilling to trust me.

81
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm very certain

82
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,700
after this cooperation,

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,120
with your abilities,

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,790
Cloud Live will be able

85
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,210
to rise again.

86
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,130
Thank you, Mr Duan.

87
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,890
You should thank Jia Yun instead.

88
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,050
Dad, it's obvious.

89
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,710
Duan Sheng Yun would
never agree to your idea

90
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,640
to turn QE into a centralized
entertainment centre.

91
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,430
He's willing to diminish
the equity of QE he owns

92
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,660
to help Chen Lang.

93
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,500
Chen Lang betrayed him once.

94
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,970
He has no idea

95
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,870
that the investor of Cloud Live

96
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,240
is related to you, right?

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,710
Of course not.

98
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,260
I'd never make a mistake like that.

99
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,710
My subordinates handled the acquisition.

100
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,820
You'd caused me a lot of troubles.

101
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,970
You almost ruined my entire plan.

102
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,050
What do you mean?

103
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,890
You spend money to compete with Duan Ran.

104
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,180
I couldn't care less.

105
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,830
However, remember this.

106
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,020
Anything that involves Duan Sheng Yun,

107
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,000
you need to inform me at once.

108
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,970
Do you hear me?

109
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,130
Yes, Dad.

110
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,580
I wondered why Duan

111
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,690
cashed out QE shares hastily.

112
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,020
So it was to help that punk.

113
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,450
Are you sure it's over for Cloud Live?

114
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,659
It's a live streaming company.

115
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,990
Their accounts are
blocked for three months.

116
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,990
Not even God can save them now.

117
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,670
Dad, what are we going to do next?

118
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,490
Jia Yun.

119
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,160
Thank you

120
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,100
for everything you've done for me.

121
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,340
Don't thank me first.

122
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,580
Just promise that

123
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,900
in the future,

124
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,340
have some conscience.

125
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,990
Stop focusing only on money.

126
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,590
You need conscience as well.

127
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,580
Alright, I promise you.

128
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,180
I also swear

129
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,340
that I'll be a good man from now on.

130
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,100
I'll also be a conscientious business man.

131
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,260
What are you? Sailor Moon?

132
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,320
Put your hand down.

133
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,760
Still, I need to thank you.

134
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,700
I'm serious.

135
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,260
All these while,

136
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,030
my investor was the one

137
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,780
who was influencing me to
go against the Duans.

138
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,550
I didn't expect

139
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,940
Mr Duan to acquire

140
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,470
the company from them.

141
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,100
Everything that happened

142
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,070
was elicited by your investor,

143
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,190
Mr Ding?

144
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,390
When you put it this way,

145
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,780
I'm not completely innocent either.

146
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,700
Who is that person?

147
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,210
I don't know.

148
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,750
I just know that he returned from England.

149
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,810
He was doing financial investments.

150
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,100
There's one thing I'm very curious about.

151
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,220
He seems to know

152
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,740
Duan Ran longer than I do.

153
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,130
I'm curious about his
relationship with Duan Ran.

154
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,990
The consortium supporting him

155
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,190
is a mystery as well.

156
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,750
He came back from England?

157
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,490
Is he one of Duan Ran's school mates?

158
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,980
Come to the office after the holidays.

159
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,140
You should talk to Xi Xi and Duan Ran.

160
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,730
Do I have to?

161
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,370
What's the problem?

162
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,840
Xi Xi and Duan Ran aren't
as petty as you imagined.

163
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,950
Okay.

164
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,950
It's up to you.

165
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,140
I'll come if you want me to.

166
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,510
Don't you think that Ding Ding is
different after returning this time?

167
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,720
He would never get mad at anything we say.

168
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,780
Now, he'd oppose everything we say.

169
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,200
In my opinion,
Chubby Ding from the past is way cuter.

170
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,130
I convinced him to give me
the four-wheeled drive easily.

171
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,850
I don't get it.

172
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,270
You guys fought the vehicle.

173
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,530
What's so great about it?

174
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,310
Does it transform like a Transformer?

175
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,440
It can't do that.

176
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,190
-It can't transform.
-Yes, it can.

177
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,780
-It can't.
-It's the same.

178
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,390
I recall that you'd always bully
Chubby Ding when we were young.

179
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,700
I was worried he might be
psychologically affected.

180
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,050
Look at him today.

181
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,540
Does he look like he's
psychologically disturbed?

182
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,950
He was abroad for two years.

183
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,390
He had some minor achievements

184
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,870
and he had the guts to defy me.

185
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,350
I'll help him recall
some childhood memories.

186
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,640
What do you mean?

187
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,920
We shall go down on a trip to memory lane.

188
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,780
That's enough.
He's a grown, opinionated man now.

189
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,180
You should face reality.

190
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,100
What is that?

191
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,740
How beautiful.

192
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,710
Every new year's,

193
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,530
I'd look forward to
watching fireworks the most.

194
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
Next year,

195
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,180
I'll give you your own fireworks.

196
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,460
Why would you

197
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,400
tell me in advance about
romantic gestures like this?

198
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Can you leave me some surprises?

199
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,430
I'm not keeping any secrets from you.

200
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,760
Besides,

201
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,760
we should live our
lives with anticipation.

202
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,080
Well, what are you looking forward to?

203
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,730
It doesn't matter.

204
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,280
We will be able to live on with
something to look forward to.

205
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,090
I'll be able to live on
as long as I have you.

206
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,080
I'll look forward to you.

207
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,310
-I'll look forward to you too.
-Me too.

208
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,680
[Life. Live]

209
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,240
I told you to dress up.

210
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,250
You only wore a t-shirt.

211

[Go Younger]

212
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,950
-What's wrong with this?
-Mr Shen

213
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,260
came to drop us a gift.

214
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,770
Please take it seriously.

215
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,830
I think we should put up a

216
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,090
welcome banner for Mr Shen.

217
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,250
We will place a row of fresh flowers here.

218
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,700
-That's enough.
-Another row of flowers here.

219
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,910
That's enough.

220
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,540
Banners are so outdated.

221
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,420
We're taking this very
seriously by coming out here.

222
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,930
I could barely see you.

223
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,100
It's my style.

224
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,990
He's here.

225
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,240
Mr Shen.

226
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,840
Where's your dad?

227
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,580
You two came out to welcome me.

228
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,900
No, why are you here alone?

229
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,830
Where's Mr Shen?

230
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,360
What's with the attitude?

231
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,750
Mr Shen has a very important meeting.

232
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,270
I'm here by his orders.

233
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,930
I even brought you

234
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,460
a cheque of six digits.

235
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,180
I came all the way here

236
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,470
to send you money.

237
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,470
Shouldn't you treat me politely?

238
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,840
-You're right.
-You should welcome me.

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,500
-You're right.
-Welcome you?

240
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,750
You should have told us
earlier, Chubby Ding.

241
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,160
If Mr Shen wasn't coming,
I wouldn't have come.

242
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,400
Firstly,

243
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,310
stop calling me Chubby Ding.

244
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,900
Secondly, I'm representing my father,

245
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,870
Mr Shen.

246
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,540
I'm representing QE to inspect the field.

247
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,780
Take it seriously.

248
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,680
Yes, we're being very serious.

249
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,800
We understand that

250
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,550
Mr Shen is occupied with work.

251
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,090
It's the same with you.

252
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,160
Let's go inside.

253
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,010
How dare you, Chubby Ding?
You forgot your roots.

254
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,410
I can't even call you by your nickname.

255
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,490
Stop calling me Chubby Ding.

256
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,360
You're in great shape.

257
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,740
You're so skinny.

258
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,050
You're Skinny Ding.

259
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,020
Skinny Ding.

260
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,870
Shen.

261
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,430
-Are you here for me?
-Duan, hurry to the meeting room.

262
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,380
The board are all waiting for you.

263
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,130
I wasn't informed of
a board meeting today.

264
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,640
Mr Shen arranged for it last minute.

265
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,080
Let's go.

266
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,400
Zheng Kai.

267
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,660
What's scheduled for me this afternoon?

268
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,040
Mr Shen told me to clear your schedule.

269
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,440
It's nothing too urgent.

270
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,560
We will talk after this meeting.

271
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,460
Let's go.

272
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,970
What's going on?

273
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,270
-Jia Yun.
-You're here.

274
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,780
Look at what I brought you.

275
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,830
You did me a great favour the last time.

276
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,430
It's time for me to return it.

277
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,210
Inglemirepharm's concentrated serum.

278
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,320
Thanks a lot.

279
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,780
It's your first day so I asked you over

280
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,020
for you to meet Mr Duan.

281
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,420
Tell him about the investor

282
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,540
who was behind all of this.

283
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,100
Sure, my accounts are blocked anyway.

284
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,070
I don't have anything to do.

285
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,770
I should get out and exercise

286
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,390
my body and mind.

287
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,480
It's good to stay active.

288
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,210
We've a lot of work to do here.

289
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,470
Well, that's exactly why I'm here.

290
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,230
Let's head to the warehouse then.

291
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,090
-Let's fold some clothes.
-Sure.

292
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,890
Where's Xi Xi and Duan Ran?

293
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,560
Forget it. An important guest is coming.

294
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,570
They are hosting him.

295
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,410
Who is so important

296
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,310
that Xi Xi and Duan Ran
have to host him themselves?

297
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,680
Initially, Mr Shen of QE

298
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,800
wanted to give us

299
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,820
a gift personally since work started.

300
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,990
In the end, he had an important meeting

301
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,250
so he couldn't make it.

302
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,940
Who came then?

303
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,610
His secretary

304
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,920
brought his son over.

305
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,270
Apparently,
he just returned from the overseas.

306
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,750
He's here to inspect the office.

307
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,490
Since you brought it up,

308
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,390
you reminded me

309
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,720
when I was at Rui.

310
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
Mr Duan gave me a call.

311
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,830
He said Mr Duan Jr was coming
to inspect the company.

312
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,960
I had to run around too.

313
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,890
That's the funny thing about life.

314
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,980
You're right.

315
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,570
Forget it. Let me do it.

316
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,520
Look at the expert.

317
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,610
Not bad.

318
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,180
Have a look, Ding Ding.

319
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,730
This is Duan Ran's office.

320
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,800
Come in and have a seat.

321
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,800
You're welcome.

322
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,190
Here, Xi Xi.

323
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,870
Chubby Ding.

324
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,630
What do you think

325
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
of my office?

326
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,620
Check out each area.

327
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,630
The lounge, the gym, the pantry,

328
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,040
dance room, yoga room, the design hub,

329
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,030
I have everything.

330
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,520
Not bad, don't you think?

331
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,340
How great can it be? It's so old.

332
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,430
This must be Mr Duan's aesthetics.

333
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,830
Well, he mostly
thinks the designs aren't trendy.

334
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,330
He's been pestering me about a renovation.

335
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,660
Chen Lang has been here for some time.

336
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,990
Nothing's changed.

337
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,590
You know Chen Lang?

338
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,910
Everyone in this industry
know who Chen Lang is.

339
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,650
Who's in charge of recruiting

340
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,920
the broadcasters?

341
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,010
Me.

342
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,320
What do you think of my perception then?

343
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,570
We've everything.

344
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,380
Every style, every figure,

345
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,630
every semblance.

346
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,180
Don't you think I did well?

347
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,100
What do you mean?

348
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,120
Broadcasting and recruiting broadcasters

349
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,830
aren't the same as selecting an artist.

350
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,780
Appearance isn't the important.

351
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,270
Affinity,
ability to promote and sell goods,

352
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,700
including the patience and
enthusiasm towards viewers,

353
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,720
are the core strengths we look for.

354
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,110
You're ignorant, brat.

355
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,700
Yes, I sure am.

356
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,280
As long as you're happy.

357
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,870
You didn't even serve me tea.

358
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,100
All I get is plain water I guess.

359
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,220
It's the best.

360
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,540
Go ahead. Don't worry about it.

361
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,100
It's tough for Uncle Duan.

362
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,070
He probably invested all
his money in your company.

363
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,220
You can't even afford
to purchase tea leaves.

364
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,140
Xi Xi and I started this company

365
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,640
on our own.

366
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,860
In order to pay rent,

367
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,750
raise enough start-up capital,

368
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,400
he even sold his favourite car.

369
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
He was so upset.

370
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,620
Everyone started their
business on their own too.

371
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,020
Yes, listen up.

372
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,300
Ding Ding studied equity
trading in the UK.

373
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,870
A single leverage is worth
hundreds of millions.

374
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,750
-Really?
-It has nothing to do with him though.

375
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,850
Listen up.

376
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,030
I studied all that in order to

377
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
help my father

378
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,900
with the restructuring of QE.

379
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,750
Chubby Ding, what you said today

380
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,540
proves that you've matured.

381
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,750
You're responsible now.

382
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,339
Xi Xi and I worked so hard

383
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
for this company

384
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,130
in order to expand it

385
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,930
and help my dad

386
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,750
in restructuring QE as well.

387
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,440
Chubby Ding.

388
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,660
I'm warning you. For the last time,

389
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,380
stop calling me Chubby Ding.

390
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,660
-Alright, alright.
-Okay.

391
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,200
Chubby Egg.

392
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,850
-Meatball. He hates the name Chubby Ding.

393
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,610
That's enough.
I'm leaving the cheque here.

394
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,320
That's it. I don't want to talk to you.

395
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,750
Alright, thanks for coming, Ding Ding.

396
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,990
You came all the way here.

397
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,990
-Thanks.
-Bye, Meatball.

398
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,210
-Bye.
-Bye.

399
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,150
Don't go complaining to daddy and get mad.

400
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,150
I did not bully you.

401
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,610
He's going to cry to daddy.

402
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,670
Of course he would.

403
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,390
He's going to tell his father about it.

404
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,300
Look at him. He's asking for a beating.

405
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,940
I just have to annoy him.

406
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,340
Jia Yun, do you have more?

407
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,470
There's space here.

408
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,390
Over here.

409
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,360
-Anything left?
-We're done. Let's go.

410
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,330
Sure.

411
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,700
Am I seeing things? Why are you here?

412
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,300
-Mr Five.
-He's here to look for Mr Duan.

413
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,960
He came to help us out a little.

414
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,990
I'm very sorry for what happened.

415
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,320
It wasn't my intention.

416
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,750
It's never too late to
turn over a new leaf.

417
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,770
You're doing great. Help us more often.

418
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,830
-Sure.
-Excuse me.

419
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,980
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

420
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,310
I find him very different.

421
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,650
He's still as annoying though.

422
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,540
Like I said,

423
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,990
he's all grown up with his own thoughts.

424
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,920
Whatever it is, the cheque is here.

425
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,880
I'm at ease now.

426
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,650
Duan Ran.

427
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,780
Guys.

428
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,630
I can't guarantee the
investment in Cloud Live.

429
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,220
Even if I submit this to the board,

430
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,180
I believe

431
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,230
that no one would agree to this.

432
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,630
Everyone is unable to accept this.

433
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,770
Our leader, our chairman

434
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,300
engaged in external investment on his own.

435
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,420
What is the relationship
between this and Rui?

436
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,870
They are competitors.

437
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,870
How does it affect QE?

438
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,750
It's hard to tell.

439
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,650
You're right. For the past six months,

440
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,570
you diluted the

441
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,230
shares of QE twice.

442
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,690
You invested in Rui and acquired Cloud.

443
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,460
These aren't minor.

444
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,160
The annual statistics show that

445
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,120
our company shows negative growth.

446
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,900
Duan, as the chairman of QE,

447
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,700
you continued to

448
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,060
make private investments.

449
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,680
Are you planning to retire?

450
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,140
No, I'm not.

451
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,810
This is the case.

452
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,030
I can guarantee this.

453
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,060
Give Cloud Live six months.

454
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,740
If its prospects are promising,

455
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,580
they will be merged into QE

456
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,600
and become a family of QE.

457
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,880
That fatty

458
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,100
was the investor of Cloud Live?

459
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,490
I thought his last name was Ding.

460
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,750
I didn't know he was Shen Jiang Tao's son.

461
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,460
This is...

462
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,170
What was Uncle Shen thinking?

463
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,590
He invested in Rui Live.

464
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,940
He helped us.

465
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,660
On the other hand, he allowed his son

466
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,870
to support Cloud Live to go against us.

467
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,130
What is his intention?

468
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,990
[The power went off.]

469
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
[An emergency occurred.]

470
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
[Don't worry.]

471
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,720
[Xi Xi and the team
will handle the issue.]

472
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,670
[This is too much of a coincidence.]

473
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,420
[It's the will of the heavens.]

474
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,080
[Mr Ding: Gift is sent. Please check.]

475
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,060
*[Gift has been sent. Accept it.]

476
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,050
[I told you,]

477
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,650
[don't employ lowly methods like these.]

478
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,370
[I'm not a regular person.]

479
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,200
[You're indeed special.]

480
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,460
[Mr Ding forced me to.]

481
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,700
[What can he do to you?]

482
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,330
[He knows you've feelings
for the CEO of Rui.]

483
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,540
-[That's why he made me do it.]
-[I'm your investor.]

484
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,300
[You do whatever I ask you to.]

485
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,130
[I just want to be a
conscientious businessman.]

486
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,640
[I'm done]

487
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,260
[with evil and corrupted schemes.]

488
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,030
I poached many broadcasters

489
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,990
and resources of Rui

490
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,060
because he instigated it.

491
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,810
I founded Cloud Live because of him too.

492
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,570
Duan Ran.

493
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,330
I'm concerned.

494
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,940
Like I said,

495
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,330
I thought Ding Ding

496
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
was very different this time round.

497
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,460
Is he targeting our company?

498
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,300
Don't worry.

499
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,810
Major shareholders of the company
are on our side.

500
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,810
Am I right?

501
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,050
Chen Lang has a number of shares too.

502
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,560
After Mr Duan and Mr Shen

503
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,820
made the investment,

504
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,270
my equity has been reduced to 10%.

505
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,700
A friendly reminder.

506
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,030
In recent years,

507
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,250
at this very meeting room,

508
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,010
we've discussed a lot

509
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,980
about the restructuring of QE.

510
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,550
New era of retail has come.

511
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,470
It has brought upon great change
to the industry of retail.

512
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,380
Every one of us

513
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,760
can purchase whatever you can think of

514
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,620
through mobile phones
without leaving the house.

515
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,440
At the same time,
enjoy the pleasures of shopping.

516
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,490
The acquisition of Rui Live

517
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,210
has proven the

518
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,500
possibilities of e-commerce
through broadcasting.

519
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,560
You want to be on board of e-commerce.

520
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,610
You showed us that the synergy
between online and offline retail

521
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,700
isn't just a dream.

522
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,860
We support the online development.

523
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,520
What happens offline then?

524
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,660
-Yes.
-He's right.

525
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,900
We will diversify operations
online and offline.

526
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,610
We will retain the current business model.

527
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,280
Are we retaining if it's making a loss?

528
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,830
Yes.

529
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,090
Fellow directors.

530
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,520
I've been in the retail
industry all my life.

531
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,780
I believe

532
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,740
the interaction between seller and buyer

533
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,790
portrays real emotions and
essence of human interaction.

534
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,550
Hence, I insist that

535
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,870
online retail is an extension
and assistance to offline retail.

536
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,530
I insist on maintaining the current
operation of offline retail.

537
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,510
I've also been in the
retail industry all my life.

538
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,340
You might not

539
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,670
be wrong,

540
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,150
but the past two years have shown us

541
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,870
that the market is changing rapidly.

542
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
QE Group

543
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,040
is a mall we founded.

544
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,670
A shopping mall of
thousands of square feet

545
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,160
is reduced to a plagued giant.

546
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,540
We need emergency treatment

547
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,370
or there will be no future.

548
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,070
Shen.

549
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,500
What do you mean?

550
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,510
There is no future in offline retail.

551
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,080
Our entity

552
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,220
needs to progress towards
congregation of people.

553
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,540
A centralized entertainment centre

554
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,410
is the future of QE.

555
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Within two to three years,

556
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,690
I'm planning to close down most

557
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,850
fashion retail stores and grocery stores.

558
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,980
All these can be incorporated online.

559
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,500
We shall focus on F&B, movie theatres

560
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,540
and education centres.

561
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,700
Children are a great business opportunity.

562
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,940
As businessmen,

563
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,170
statistics are important.

564
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,840
The data showed

565
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,730
that a restructuring is necessary

566
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,300
or there's no way out for us.

567
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,370
We established QE on our own.

568
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,570
From a small grocery store,

569
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,220
we developed it into a super mall

570
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,750
and what is it today,

571
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,100
a centralized shopping centre.

572
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,480
In the retail industry,

573
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,750
I'd experienced basically

574
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,630
every business operation and models.

575
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,860
I tried them as well.

576
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,380
I always believe that

577
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
the experience of offline shopping

578
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,580
is irreplaceable

579
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,270
no matter what happens.

580
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,680
Duan, I do admire you sometimes.

581
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,850
We do everything

582
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,230
with a goal.

583
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,910
You do everything

584
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,290
with a dream.

585
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,030
Sometimes,

586
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,000
when men dream,

587
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,220
they'd fall into a logical fallacy.

588
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,550
We've done this all our lives.

589
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,220
We cannot afford to lose anything.

590
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,890
The future path of QE,

591
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,020
in my opinion,

592
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,660
should be decided by the

593
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,940
board of directors through vote.

594
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,570
Is everyone with me?

595
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,880
Mr Duan.

596
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,730
We're very concerned about your health.

597
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,930
Yes.

598
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,820
Don't worry.

599
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,290
It's nothing major.

600
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,590
You need to be cautious of this man.

601
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,940
He's brutal.

602
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,970
Mum.

603
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,330
I'll head over immediately.

604
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,230
What happened?

605
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,940
My mum said Shen Jiang Tao
organized a board meeting

606
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,440
to determine the future
of the company by vote.

607
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,840
My dad is going to resign.

608
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,900
What are we doing here?

609
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,070
Let's hurry back.

610
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,250
-What's going on?
-Hurry up.

611
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,270
Come on, let's go. My purse is downstairs.

612
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,270
We're leaving. I'll talk to you later.

613
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,220
Go ahead.

614
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,150
Does the resignation of Mr Duan

615
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,360
have to do with

616
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,720
the acquisition of Cloud Live's shares?

617
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,630
If that's the case, I'd be condemned.

618
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,820
Put that aside.

619
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,270
If that's the case,

620
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,340
the information of equity holders

621
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,250
probably changed.

622
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,250
We need to reassess the situation.

623
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,770
QE owns 35% of Rui Live's shares.

624
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,860
If Shen Jiang Tao exerts his power,

625
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,460
including Shen Ding Ding, the shares

626
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,270
they own are up to 45%.

627
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,600
If he obtains 6% of shares,

628
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,790
he will have a total of 51% of equity.

629
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,070
Then, he will be able
to control the company.

630
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,750
You said something

631
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,300
about the employees owning shares.

632
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,940
The employees own a total of 35%.

633
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,070
Am I right?

634
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,760
This is bad.

635
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,220
We had suspicions about a mole.

636
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,620
The designs of Mr Five were stolen.

637
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,700
If this mole owns

638
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,180
a number of shares,

639
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,510
the company is in trouble.

640
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,260
Yu Shi.

641
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,250
Why are you acting all nervous?

642
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,220
What are you talking about?

643
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,130
The company is our home.

644
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,720
You need to treat it like your home.

645
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,140
Relax.

646
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,430
Why are you always so uptight?

647
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,990
Rui is my home. I'm not being uptight.

648
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,980
That's just how I am.

649
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,850
Let's eat.

650
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,590
Your chopsticks are reversed.

651
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,990
I'm not going to eat with you
if you continue on like this.

652
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,090
Don't be mad.

653
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,590
I'm just tired.

654
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,720
You should eat more.

655
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,680
I'm feeling mad for Xi Xi and Duan Ran.

656
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,830
Who does Mr Shen Ding Ding think he is?

657
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,180
He's here to create problems.

658
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,510
He thinks he's so great.

659
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,900
He bragged and boasted.

660
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,990
In my opinion,

661
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,640
he's probably an inferior person.

662
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,850
Yes, you're right.

663
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,090
He's inferior?

664
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,650
That's possible.

665
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,300
Listen to me, Su Su.

666
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Men are complicated creatures.

667
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,670
On the surface, many people

668
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,420
may appear a certain way.

669
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
In reality,

670
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,010
it is all just a facade.

671
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,710
Besides,

672
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,230
everyone has dark secrets.

673
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,950
I know that.

674
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,280
The dark side of humans. I have it too.

675
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,690
You've a dark side too?

676
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,170
Tell me about it.

677
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,150
When I was young, I hated

678
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,550
the old lady next door.

679
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,940
One day, I took a pair of scissors

680
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,000
and destroyed her favourite tulips.

681
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,960
Isn't that cool?

682
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,380
I still remember it.

683
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,900
What a fool.

684
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,970
Pass this to me.

685
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,190
You're pretty honest.

686
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,070
Mr Duan, are you packing this up?

687
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,310
No, I'll take it myself.

688
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,590
-I'll get back to work.
-Sure.

689
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,750
You're here.

690
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,790
From tomorrow onwards,

691
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,540
this office belongs to you.

692
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,180
You must have been looking forward to it.

693
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,950
What do you mean?

694
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,930
If I'm right,

695
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,290
Richard Shen

696
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,110
is most likely your son, Shen Ding Ding.

697
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,270
Actually, I'd been investigating

698
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,180
the investor behind
Loud Capital in secret.

699
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,640
When I saw the name,

700
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,190
I understood everything.

701
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,660
From Chen Lang's initial pull-out

702
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,550
to the blocked accounts of Cloud Live,

703
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,150
you tried everything to
slip the information of

704
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,730
acquisition of shares to my secretary.

705
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,610
I wasn't the one who instigated this.

706
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,170
It was Ding Ding.

707
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,920
I didn't expect

708
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,180
such a prominent figure like you to

709
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,060
fall into such an easy trap.

710
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,640
I said this before.

711
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,760
Chen Lang is a great kid.

712
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,700
I will not stand idly by.

713
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm not surprised
this was Ding Ding's idea.

714
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,350
He did it to help you.

715
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,260
I did not ask him to.

716
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,390
It was you.

717
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,200
Everything you did let me down.

718
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,280
Since he told me

719
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,270
you acquired Cloud Live,

720
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,590
I realized this.

721
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,780
You and I are on different paths.

722
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,260
Shen.

723
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,900
You were supportive of

724
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,260
Xi Xi becoming the CEO.

725
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,330
Both of us invested 10 million

726
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,520
to acquire the shares of Rui Live.

727
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,670
Thus, no matter what it is,

728
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,650
we are on the same boat.

729
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,250
The way things are,

730
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,420
we should be open with each other.

731
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,159
Tell me honestly.

732
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,290
Besides your disagreement
with my work philosophy,

733
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,610
why are you doing this?

734
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,080
I'm doing this for Ding Ding.

735
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,650
After all these years,

736
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:55,440
all I'm left with
besides memories, is my child.

737
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,820
If you're doing this for Ding Ding,

738
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,100
when Ding Ding returned from England,

739
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,790
why didn't you arrange him to work at Rui

740
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,920
for him to compete with Ran Ran fairly?

741
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,340
A fair competition?

742
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,950
How is that fair?

743
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,980
Your child and my child

744
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,050
were never on the same starting point.

745
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,950
In order to put them

746
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,740
on the same starting point,

747
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,330
you'd rather forsake
our years of friendship.

748
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,290
Duan.

749
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,520
You'd never mistreated me.

750
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,820
When my business failed,

751
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,530
you took me in.

752
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,620
You saved me. I remember all of that.

753
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,380
But I did not do anything wrong.

754
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,220
I was just ahead of time.

755
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,510
I was too radical, so I failed.

756
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,130
Times have changed now.

757
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,310
I believe I will win this time.

758
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,180
Hopefully.

759
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,310
Time will prove everything.

760
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,250
I had no choice but
to force you to resign.

761
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,410
You and your family may continue
to live on the penthouse of QE.

762
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,560
You can oversee the kingdom you built.

763
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,010
Thanks for your kind intentions, Shen.

764
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,530
The children are innocent.

765
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,050
They are motivated and innovative.

766
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,750
I realised their strengths.

767
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,420
Let me remind you,
do not underestimate them.

768
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,050
They have unlimited possibilities.

769
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,200
Allow them to decide their own future.

770
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,960
Shen Jiang Tao is cornering you.

771
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,990
Back then when the both of
you started the business,

772
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,390
he wanted to initiate a supermarket chain.

773
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,570
He made a huge loss.

774
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,330
He couldn't even afford a pair of shoes.

775
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,380
If you didn't take him in,
he wouldn't be here today.

776
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,470
Shen is very ahead.

777
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,990
It was the era of shopping malls.

778
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,620
The conditions did not allow him
to launch a supermarket chain,

779
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,200
so the idea was nipped from its bud.

780
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,690
As a brother,

781
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,440
who's going to help him if not me?

782
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,560
You're still defending him.

783
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,420
He's doing it for the sake of QE.

784
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,860
You're doing it for the company too.

785
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,270
Well, no one is on my side.

786
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,530
Honey.

787
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,500
When life happens,

788
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,110
we must learn from the wise.

789
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,570
Take it from Su Shi.

790
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,460
The reformation of Wang An Shi,

791
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,920
Su Shi did not understand.

792
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,140
He submitted an appeal about
the flaw in his system.

793
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,140
That angered Wang An Shi.

794
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,940
In the end, Su Shi initiated

795
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,340
a resignation from the capital.

796
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,870
Life is fleeting.

797
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,310
It is pointless to wallow on petty things.

798
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,500
I submitted my resignation.

799
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,300
I've a lot of free time now.

800
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,940
I can spend more time with you as well.

801
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,700
You should think for Duan Ran.

802
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Of course I'm thinking for Duan Ran.

803
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,250
I've my plans for the kids.

804
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,730
Don't worry.

805
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,280
-Dad.
-Uncle Duan.

806
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,400
Duan Ran. Xi Xi.

807
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,870
-Aunt Zhou.
-Come here.

808
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,110
I've something to talk to you about.

809
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,670
Talk to your dad.

810
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,980
Excuse me.

811
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,270
Dad.

812
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,140
Uncle Duan, do you need break?

813
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,140
We can talk later.

814
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,670
It's fine. I'm not tired.

815
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,280
Dad, why did you buy
the shares of Cloud Live?

816
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,250
I did it for Chen Lang.

817
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,700
You and Chen Lang are similar.

818
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,650
Both of you are bold and
responsible young men.

819
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,710
I admire that a lot.

820
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,450
Thus, I want to support him.

821
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,110
Have you forgotten what he has done?

822
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,590
He was manipulated and
instigated by devious men.

823
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,040
All these while,

824
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,600
Ran Ran, Xi Xi and Chen Lang

825
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,400
have always been excellent individuals
in my mind.

826
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,680
My greatest dream

827
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,220
if for the three of you to

828
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,790
cooperate and accomplish something.

829
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,420
Uncle Duan,
you want us to work with Chen Lang?

830
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,510
-Yes.
-You want us to work together?

831
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,840
If Chen Lang does things the right way,

832
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,660
I've no reason not to.

833
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,380
Let's put him aside.

834
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,110
Dad, how is it going with Uncle Shen?

835
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,630
I don't plan to fight with Uncle Shen.

836
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,550
Uncle Shen and I

837
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,600
had our disagreements with management.

838
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,480
Nothing else.

839
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,780
About the restructuring of QE,

840
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,390
Xi Xi and I are on your side.

841
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,610
Online retail is an
extension of offline retail.

842
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,440
It can never replace offline retail.

843
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,130
When I watched my mum

844
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,310
run her little grocery store,

845
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,310
the interaction between
she and her customers

846
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,510
and the joy it brings,

847
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,460
it will always be imprinted in me.

848
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,980
I'm glad the both of you think that way.

849
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,810
Uncle Shen told me something

850
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,370
and I found it reasonable.

851
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,690
He said when one gets to a certain age,
they are only left with two things.

852
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,090
One is memories, and the other, children.

853
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,620
Xi Xi, Ran Ran.

854
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,610
I'm entrusting

855
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,900
all of my hopes on the both of you.

856
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,340
Uncle Shen is the same.

857
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,660
He's entrusting his hopes on Ding Ding.

858
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,590
Go for it, you youngsters.

859
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,770
The future is yours.

860
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,430
Sure.

861
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,540
I understand.

862
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,480
Just do it.

863
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,560
Dad, congratulations.

864
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,400
After so many years,

865
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,860
you are finally seated

866
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,940
in the position of chairman.

867
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,700
There's nothing to be happy about.

868
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,010
It's just a desk and a chair.

869
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,870
We fought for the pride.

870
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,580
Dad, right now, you bear

871
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,150
the most advanced conception
of the retail industry.

872
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,490
You're way more ahead of Duan Sheng Yun.

873
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,900
You worked with him all these years

874
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,150
because you were grateful.

875
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,610
Now that you're in this position,

876
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,790
you finally got what you deserved.

877
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,790
The higher the climb,
the lonelier the journey.

878
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,920
Honestly speaking,

879
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,520
I'm having mixed feelings.

880
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,250
Don't forget your promise to me.

881
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,740
Don't worry, Dad. I'll stick to it.

882
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,990
The restructuring of QE

883
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,810
requires the support of Rui.

884
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,530
The sooner the physical stores
can be converted online,

885
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,790
the smoother it will go

886
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,560
for your promotion with the board.

887
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,660
Thus, I need control of Rui Live.

888
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,800
Dad, you must help me

889
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,830
obtain the support from the board.

890
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,660
I'm betraying a friend

891
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,450
for the second time.

892
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,740
We need to succeed.

893
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,630
I promise you will not
regret this decision.

894
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,990
[Ding Ding, lend me your
Buster Sonic for a while.]

895
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,200
[No.]

896
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,520
[I don't want to.]

897
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,640
[Did you know? My dad went to Japan]

898
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,100
[and got me the latest GP Chip.]

899
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,630
[It will transform our cars]

900
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,860
[into a brand new eight-wheeler.]

901
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,420
[The manual from the chip says]

902
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,050
[after the two combine into one,]

903
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,100
[they are called the Extreme Speed.]

904
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,900
[Based on the different modes,]

905
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,860
[there's another setting, called]

906
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,810
[the Speed of Sound.]

907
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,680
[They are the best.]

908
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,010
[It's the dark series. It's awesome.]

909
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,690
[Can they really merge together?]

910
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,740
[Do you know how to do it?]

911
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,740
[Of course I do.]

912
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,820
[It's kind of complicated.]

913
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,430
[It takes 81 days]

914
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,050
[to put the cars together.]

915
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,440
[They have go through high voltage.]
