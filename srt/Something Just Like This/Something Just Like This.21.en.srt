[Episode 21]

4
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,350
It has been tough on you recently.

5
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,210
You have been working more
than ten hours everyday.

6
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,120
I'm all right. Well, it is
not like I have a choice.

7
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,080
Be it actors or broadcasters,

8
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,710
what do we fear about the most?

9
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,810
What?

10
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,990
What we fear most about
is not being criticised

11
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,690
or being disliked by others.

12
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,560
Rather, it is being ignored.

13
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,539
Stop thinking about it.

14
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,860
Go back and have a good rest today.

15
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,539
Tomorrow you will work an entire day too.

16
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,750
I won't get to sleep either way.

17
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,750
I still have to memorise
the products catalogue later.

18
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,330
Save it for tomorrow.

19
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,870
Let me tell you, that product
catalogue alone is so thick.

20
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,800
What's wrong?

21
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,130
Oh no.

22
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,210
I left the products catalogue
in the office.

23
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,760
Luckily we haven't gone far.
Let's go back to take it.

24
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,120
All right. If it is this hour,

25
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,320
Qian Xi Xi should still be in office.

26
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,990
Let's go back and take it.

27
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,750
Seriously, this memory of mine.

28
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,870
What was I thinking?

29
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,170
I'll go back with you.

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,200
Who is it?

31
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,329
Don't move!

32
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,010
-Let go of me!
-Xi Xi!

33
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,360
-Let go of me!
-It is me.

34
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,540
I don't care who you are!

35
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,320
It's me. I'm Jiang Zhe Yang.

36
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,079
Jiang Zhe Yang?

37
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,960
Wait, wait.

38
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,740
Let me catch my breath.

39
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,460
You are quite strong for a woman.

40
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,870
What are you doing here
so late in the office?

41
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,130
You scared me. I thought a thief broke in.

42
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,620
I'm here to see how you're doing

43
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,080
on your father's command.

44
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,950
What? Are you going to attack me?

45
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,650
Let me tell you, my entire body

46
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,760
from head to toe is insured.

47
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,540
It is fine if you wish
to visit my company.

48
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,790
However, you are dressed
in black from head to toe.

49
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,190
Of course I'd get scared.

50
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,000
This is how I usually dress.

51
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,040
Look at me,

52
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,540
I have got weapons prepared.

53
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,050
Shield.

54
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,850
Dagger.

55
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,380
If you dare to kidnap me,

56
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,090
I'll stab you to death.

57
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,650
I have no words.

58
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,430
You are still the same
as when we were little.

59
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,090
Did I have such strength?

60
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,260
Why did you suddenly think
of visiting our company?

61
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,130
No reason. I'm curious, that's all.

62
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,970
So this is our office.

63
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,870
Level 1 is the live streaming zone.

64
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,670
These are the live stream rooms.

65
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,430
Level 2, look over there.

66
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,130
Meeting rooms, rest area,

67
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,830
and that is my office.

68
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,280
-Is that so?
-The one with the tiger cub.

69
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,410
Duan Ran said,

70
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,530
Rui Live is his Going Merry.

71
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,440
Going Merry? Luffy's first pirate ship.

72
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,660
You watched that?

73
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,090
Of course I did.

74
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,710
This is also the first time
he set up a company.

75
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,370
He wishes to bring his friends

76
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,560
to achieve a dream like One Piece.

77
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,480
To set sail towards the ocean.

78
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,630
But as far as I know,

79
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,850
aren't you the

80
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,260
CEO of this company?

81
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,870
Why aren't you leading everyone

82
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,280
to set sail?

83
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,880
Me?

84
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,260
I suddenly feel that the subconscious
mind is quite scary.

85
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,830
Actually, deep down,

86
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,580
in my truest thoughts,

87
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,690
Duan Ran is forever the leader.

88
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,570
It seems you don't
understand yourself enough.

89
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,490
Let's take a look at my live stream room.

90
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,590
Sure.

91
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,090
Come on in.

92
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,440
This is my live stream room.

93
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,430
I live stream while standing here.

94
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,060
for hours everyday.

95
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,500
For hours?

96
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,210
That's right, for hours.

97
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,570
This is the live stream light.

98
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,390
Be careful of your eyes.

99
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,210
It is quite bright.

100
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,720
It is one of the necessary equipment.

101
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,100
Why is it so cluttered here?

102
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,900
None of them tidied up this mess.

103
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,970
It is because I'm too nice.

104
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,190
I'm too kind towards them

105
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,750
so all of them became very lazy.

106
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,380
This won't do. From now on,
I'll impose strict rules for this.

107
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,310
Or else, I'll deduct their salary.

108
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,310
You were a bully when we were kids.

109
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,990
And now, you are still so fierce?

110
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm a bully?

111
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
How is that possible?

112
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,780
Look how cute and gentle I am.

113
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,220
How could I be a bully?

114
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,290
You seem gentle,

115
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,100
but you are in fact a domineering person.

116
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,200
Do you remember?

117
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,500
When we were little,
there was once I got bullied.

118
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,570
When you saw it,

119
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,250
you came right up and gave him a kick,

120
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,540
so he quickly ran away.

121
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,710
Impossible.

122
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,660
I'm very gentle. How could I have kicked
someone? That is too ill-mannered.

123
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,880
I'm serious.

124
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,220
Quick, be honest with me.

125
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,990
When we were kids, did you think

126
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,280
I was very ill-mannered?

127
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,220
Let me tell you, I sat on the floor,

128
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,570
and I was dumbfounded.

129
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,110
To me, it was as if you were shining.

130
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,850
That is, how should I put it?

131
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,050
The damsel saving a hero in distress.

132
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,150
Besides,

133
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,370
you looked very, very adorable.

134
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,810
Adorable?

135
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,090
Your live stream room is not that big.

136
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,820
Yes. Anyway, broadcasters
live stream from here.

137
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,630
And that is the operating workbench.

138
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,940
That is the transfer screen
for mobile phones.

139
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,990
I've watched your live stream.

140
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,320
You were "Ms Qian Xi Xi".

141
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,380
You've watched it?

142
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,690
Yes.

143
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,570
So, Ms Streamer,

144
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,720
will you let me experience it?

145
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,190
-You mean now?
-That's right.

146
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,290
Jiang Zhe Yang.

147
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,480
Xi Xi.

148
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,970
Sister Yuan Yuan. Brother Bin.

149
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,930
Why haven't you two left?

150
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,310
I left the products catalogue here
so I came back to take it.

151
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,380
Hi, Yuan Yuan.

152
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,790
-Hi.
-Hi.

153
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,160
-Hi.
-I'm here to see how she is doing.

154
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,560
He is here to tour around the company.

155
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,260
By the way, thank you very much

156
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,070
for the birthday video last time.

157
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,200
Don't worry about it. It is no big deal.

158
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,130
You two carry on. We will get going.

159
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,919
Yuan Yuan, since you are here,

160
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,700
Jiang Zhe Yang wishes
to witness a live stream.

161
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,050
Jiang Jin Suo.

162
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,640
Jiang Zhe Yang!

163
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,680
Yuan Yuan is our company's
top broadcaster.

164
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,160
Why don't you do a
live stream with us?

165
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,230
Me?

166
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,850
That's right. I mean it.

167
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,410
Let’s have Rui's top broadcaster

168
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,340
and popular celebrity, Jiang Zhe Yang,

169
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,950
collaborate once. What do you think?

170
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,850
Sure, it is fine with me.

171
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,200
What about you?

172
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,610
Sure. Let's do a live stream together.

173
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,630
-You do the set up.
-Sure, no problem.

174
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,210
That said, can Jiang Zhe Yang
appear on screen?

175
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,430
I don't think it is appropriate.

176
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,080
That is true.

177
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,120
Can you?

178
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,680
It is an issue.

179
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,970
What about...

180
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,050
Hi, babes.

181
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,870
Today, we will mainly recommend to you

182
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,660
these two lipsticks from Perfect Blue.

183
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,100
They are so gorgeous.

184
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,370
So, Mr White Fox,

185
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,870
which colour do you prefer?

186
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,010
The grapefruit red is a darker shade,

187
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,230
so it is suitable for when you're

188
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,140
going on a date with your boyfriend.

189
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,050
Dates.

190
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,880
Mr White Fox knows what
we women are thinking.

191
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,300
Seriously,

192
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,610
women who are always
working overtime, like myself,

193
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,740
have no life.

194
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,980
I want to be in a romantic
relationship so bad.

195
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,620
Mr White Fox is too great.

196
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,780
Next, I'll try this lipstick shade on

197
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,440
for you all.

198
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,610
Some babes said

199
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,380
they wish to see the effect
of a light application.

200
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,440
Why don't we do that

201
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,830
-and show to our babes?
-Sure.

202
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,390
First, let's remove the
current lipstick colour.

203
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,490
Tissue.

204
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,240
Don't worry, we will take
care of that right away.

205
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,210
I have an idea.

206
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,240
We don't have tissue.

207
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,190
What Mr White Fox means is,

208
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,820
this way, we are able to show you

209
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,970
the effect of light application.

210
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,560
Mr Duan,

211
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,940
please help to inform Perfect Blue

212
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,970
to restock lipsticks no. 109 and 147.

213
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,020
Weren't there a lot left at
the stock take yesterday?

214
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,430
Last night's sales were exceptional.

215
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,430
They were all sold.

216
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,830
Please ask for a restock,

217
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,530
or else we will experience a
"window period" for these lipsticks.

218
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,600
Yuan Yuan did another
live stream last night?

219
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,090
Well, she did one extra session.

220
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,870
I saw you giving her a ride back home.

221
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,600
She came back to do another one.

222
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,310
No, you should not worry
about stuff like this.

223
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,430
Just tell Perfect Blue

224
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,090
to restock, and it is settled.

225
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,220
Doing live streams on the side
entails a salary deduction.

226
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,430
-I'll let the admin department know.
-Don't.

227
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,380
Mr Duan, please don't do this.

228
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
In that case, tell me what happened.

229
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,340
Last night, Yuan Yuan left the
products catalogue in the office,

230
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,540
so we came back to take it.

231
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,070
And we chanced upon
Jiang Zhe Yang and Ms Qian.

232
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,700
After that, Jiang Zhe Yang
insisted to try live streaming,

233
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,950
so Ms Qian let Yuan Yuan
live stream with him.

234
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,750
That is how the additional
live stream came about.

235
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,210
Why was Jiang here?

236
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,970
I have no idea. Maybe he
had a date with Ms Qian.

237
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,610
Yuan Yuan has a huge
amount of workload daily

238
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,610
and is so stressed.

239
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,190
Why ask her to do that when
she should be getting some rest?

240
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,130
She is too much.

241
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,320
Too much.

242
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,700
No, this is not Ms Qian's fault either.

243
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,190
Jiang Zhe Yang is a
celebrity after all, right?

244
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,310
If he wishes to try live stream,

245
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,970
it is not like we have the
option to turn him down.

246
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,470
So, that is why we sacrificed
sleep to play along with him.

247
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,490
I'll talk to Perfect Blue for you.

248
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,200
I'll get going.

249
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,120
Thank you, Mr Duan. Good work.

250
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,400
Stop. How do you do that?
How to play back?

251
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,660
Just drag this little dot.

252
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,410
-Click this to play, right?
-Yes, that's right.

253
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,320
Mr Duan, you watched this for the third time.

254
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,270
Are you going to watch it again?

255
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,170
Su Su, you just

256
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,020
go talk to Yu Shi for a while first.

257
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,880
-All right, sure.
-Hurry up.

258
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,490
Qian Xi Xi, you...

259
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,370
No...

260
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,490
You and Jiang Zhe Yang,

261
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,270
what were you doing?
What were you two doing?

262
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,600
How am I going to ask her?

263
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,810
Don't panic. I'll take care of it.

264
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,000
Qian Xi Xi, what do you mean by this?

265
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,340
[The grapefruit red
shade is a darker colour,]

266
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,360
[so it is suitable for when you're]

267
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,540
[going on a date with your boyfriend.]

268
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,220
[-Dating.]
[-Mr White Fox]

269
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,420
[knows what we women think.]

270
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,610
[To be honest,]

271
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,930
[women who work overtime
from morning till night]

272
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,190
[are slaves to their jobs.]

273
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,610
[I want to be in a romantic
relationship so bad.]

274
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,770
Who let you do extra
live streams last night?

275
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,200
Our company has our own rules.

276
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,510
If you live stream as you wish,

277
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,510
how will we regulate our employees?

278
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,050
Our live stream last night

279
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,670
got all the lipsticks in
our company sold out.

280
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,100
You have to know that

281
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,030
rules are rules.

282
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,270
However, sometimes,

283
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,040
earning money is much
more important than rules.

284
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,200
Our broadcasters need to rest too.

285
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,700
You are a broadcaster yourself.

286
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,050
We cannot use their personal time

287
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,290
to achieve sales for you.

288
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,700
Besides, the live stream is already done.

289
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,710
Why did you bring an outsider here?

290
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,370
Outsider?

291
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,410
You mean Jiang Zhe Yang?

292
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,490
Who else? Isn't he an outsider?

293
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,170
It is no big deal.

294
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,540
He... Even if he is an outsider,

295
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,660
he still cooperates

296
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,190
with our company well, right?

297
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,290
Also, why are you making such a fuss?

298
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,430
I'm making a fuss? I work for the
company's good every single day.

299
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,980
What is it?

300
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,680
I just feel you look cute
when you get jealous.

301
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,750
Now, you look just like an

302
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,580
irritable great black bear which
just woke up from its sleep

303
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,240
and probably has not been fed.

304
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,680
I'm jealous?

305
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,150
Sister, stop kidding.

306
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,079
You think too highly of yourself.

307
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,640
I'm just worried, since you are so silly,

308
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,400
that you will get played.

309
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,089
Let me tell you, you need to
keep a distance

310
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,010
with such a celebrity.

311
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,910
With our relationship,

312
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,710
why do we need to keep a distance?

313
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,300
What kind of relationship are you
that you don't need to keep a distance?

314
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,010
That kind.

315
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,520
You two even have
that kind of relationship?

316
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,520
What relationship is it?

317
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,250
Look, me and Jiang Zhe Yang

318
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,390
used to be primary schoolmates.

319
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,590
Then we lost contact.

320
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,180
And now, after many years,
we finally meet again.

321
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,970
Anyway, it's complicated.

322
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,850
Exactly what relationship is it?

323
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,680
Have a guess.

324
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,970
Xi Xi.

325
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,680
Qian Xi Xi!

326
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,820
Zhang Jia Yun, what are you doing?

327
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,480
You almost scared me to death.

328
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,640
Wait, something is wrong.

329
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,250
What's wrong?

330
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,610
Let me have a look.

331
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,060
Girl,

332
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,300
You have rosy cheeks and moist eyes

333
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,890
with a weird smile going on.

334
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,210
Something good must have happened.

335
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,610
Are you really all right?

336
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,510
You watched too many
idol dramas, didn't you?

337
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,220
You are saying this
with no problem at all.

338
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,680
No.

339
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,060
I definitely sensed a strange atmosphere.

340
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,480
Duan Ran did something?

341
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,280
He...

342
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,610
Why does it have to be him?

343
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,680
It could be someone else.

344
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,180
You don't treat me as a
good friend anymore.

345
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,090
You won't even share it with me.

346
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,890
All right. Fine.

347
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,520
I'll tell you.

348
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,890
Yesterday, me and Jiang
were in the office.

349
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,800
Sister!

350
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,200
One second.

351
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,680
What is it? You seem very happy.

352
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,680
Xi Xi gave me a tour around her company.

353
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,460
Or, is it because you two
sold lipsticks together

354
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,040
that makes you happier?

355
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,460
Oh my, unbelievable.

356
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,300
How come you know about everything?

357
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,830
I'm your manager after all.

358
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,210
How can I not know?

359
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,680
I'm monitoring you.

360
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,550
Shouldn't you have told
me about this sooner?

361
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,750
What if a paparazzi took photos of you?

362
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,280
I won't even have time
for crisis management.

363
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,380
I'm not so silly.

364
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,040
I went there with the full gear on.

365
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,130
Besides, when we sold lipsticks,

366
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,030
I did not show my face either.

367
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,250
I was wearing a mask.

368
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,770
Smart, right?

369
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,370
Smart? If your mother finds out,

370
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,490
you will get it.

371
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,060
My mother can't find out about this.

372
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,860
Besides... Do you know the
reason why I went there?

373
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,730
Qian Xi Xi, of course. What else?

374
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,550
You are too shallow.

375
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,700
I went there for the suspect.

376
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,210
That...

377
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,260
As written in the script,

378
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,670
the male broadcaster
with a split personality?

379
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,910
You went there to experience it?

380
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,010
That's right.

381
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,370
As an actor, right?

382
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,980
Getting such a good script

383
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,030
for a good character,

384
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,130
shouldn't I go and

385
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,680
do some research first?

386
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,400
Sure.

387
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,340
Regardless of how we put it,

388
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,820
as long as it is beneficial
for your career,

389
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,240
I can't comment against it either, right?

390
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,090
But Ms Ouyang, I feel,

391
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,800
before we get the part,

392
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,550
should we keep it a secret first?

393
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,890
Of course.

394
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,010
Especially from your mother.

395
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,270
If she finds out about this,
we will be in big trouble.

396
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,750
All she is thinking now is for you to

397
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,010
act in that idol drama.

398
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,520
I wonder what we should do.

399
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,460
My mother did get older.

400
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,420
Her perspective while handling problems

401
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,090
is too superficial.

402
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,030
Anyway, your mum has her own strengths.

403
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,370
She means well.

404
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,210
I think,

405
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,100
when it comes to your acting career,

406
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,240
she needs to think bigger.

407
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,610
You're the best.

408
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,220
This is the last time.

409
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,320
Got it.

410
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,480
[Rui Live]

411
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,180
Yuan Yuan.

412
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,320
Xi Xi, I have something to tell you.

413
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,610
I have something to tell you, too.

414
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,880
First of all, congrats.

415
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,780
It hasn't even been a week

416
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,670
since you made the Talent Chart.

417
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,420
Yuan Yuan, this was

418
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,400
your best performance yet.

419
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,040
Really?

420
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,400
Really.

421
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,650
Isn't it great?

422
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,640
But there's more.

423
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,560
I've prepared a mystery gift for you.

424
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,850
A surprise.

425
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,560
What kind of surprise?

426
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,580
I know Secret Of The Ocean

427
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,380
is one of your favourite brands.

428
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,050
You've been using
their products, haven't you?

429
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,090
I struck a deal with them.

430
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,490
A deal?

431
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,920
Are you surprised? Are you happy?

432
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,320
They're a high-end international brand.

433
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,690
We've never done such a thing before.

434
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,680
That's why I want to try.

435
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,290
Yuan Yuan, say something nice, will you?

436
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,320
Come on, praise me.

437
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,130
You know,

438
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,590
closing this deal

439
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,280
wasn't easy.

440
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,270
Actually, I've been keeping
this a secret from you.

441
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,930
I've been working on it
for a long time.

442
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,460
I've visited them umpteen times,

443
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,040
but I never told you.

444
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,780
At first, they were reluctant.

445
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,900
But because you topped the charts,

446
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,120
they finally decided to sign the deal.

447
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,440
Aren't you happy?

448
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,560
What's on your mind?

449
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,130
Why do you seem unhappy?

450
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,770
I'm not.

451
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,200
It's just that, all this while,

452
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,350
I never thought I'd be able
to promote such a brand.

453
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,010
So do your best.

454
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,850
I already gave them my word.

455
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,940
I told them, Yuan Yuan
could beat a hundred streamers.

456
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,560
So don't disappoint them.

457
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,800
Okay.

458
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,400
Thanks.

459
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,520
What are you thanking me for?

460
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,610
To be honest, we are more

461
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,320
like comrades.

462
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,730
You fight on the front lines,

463
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,120
while I support you at the back.

464
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,440
Why did you come?

465
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,160
Nothing.

466
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,160
I just wanted to ask you
about the sales figures.

467
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,320
I'll ask them to send it to you.

468
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,560
Sure. I'll be off, then.

469
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,230
Good luck. Happy streaming.

470
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,730
I know it's hard.

471
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,010
Don't worry.

472
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,730
A big international brand

473
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,420
for Yuan Yuan to promote.

474
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,370
What can go wrong?

475
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,240
I haven't given her...

476
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,790
I forgot the product catalogue.

477
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,370
Product catalogue.

478
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,160
In yesterday's audition,

479
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,320
both Ms Hong and the director
thought highly of you.

480
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,130
They feel you're inarguably
the leading lady.

481
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,060
Chen Lang's investors have also
agreed to enlist you.

482
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,210
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

483
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Do you know how many girls

484
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,320
would kill to land a role like this?

485
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,490
Yuan Yuan, do you want to become
an actress or not?

486
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,670
Do you want to

487
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,610
build a name for yourself in showbiz?

488
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,850
The opportunity is yours.

489
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,920
You decide.

490
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,430
If you let it slip by, you might regret it
for the rest of your life.

491
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,730
Okay.

492
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,220
I'll see Xi Xi later

493
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,730
and talk to her about it.

494
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,030
Let's go to your office.

495
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,440
You want out?

496
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,160
Actually, I came just now

497
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,890
to tell you about it.

498
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,280
But why?

499
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,890
Xi Xi, please.

500
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,320
Now I don't know where to even begin.

501
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,450
Tell me what the reason is.

502
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,370
The reason is

503
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,250
I

504
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,440
was offered a leading role in a movie.

505
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,970
I know.

506
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,700
You've always wanted to be an actress.

507
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,800
Yes.

508
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,700
I've made myself clear before I

509
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,910
embarked on the challenge.

510
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,970
I'm sure you know

511
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,590
how important this is to me.

512
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,030
Then you should also know

513
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,760
how much resources and talent

514
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,390
the company has poured into you

515
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,370
when you vied for the Talent Chart.

516
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,520
You just made it.

517
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,640
And now you're going to abandon us?

518
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,770
But I have no choice.

519
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,870
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

520
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,060
Waiting for such a good

521
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,730
opportunity?

522
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,440
You could ask for a leave.

523
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,420
You could work in the evenings.

524
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,040
Shooting a movie
is a full-time commitment.

525
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,040
Besides, there is no leeway
in my contract.

526
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,170
I'll have no time or energy
to come here and stream.

527
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,770
Besides, Xi Xi,

528
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,970
you know the rules of streaming.

529
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,060
Once you're out, you're out.

530
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,670
Last time, I took a month's break

531
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,820
and my popularity
was never the same again.

532
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,060
Is that why you're

533
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,480
forsaking us right now?

534
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,490
Yes.

535
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,890
I know I'm being a jerk.

536
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,560
But you know something?

537
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,380
Getting this role

538
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,060
was like placing first in the national

539
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,790
art school exam all over again.

540
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,770
Just thinking about it makes me excited.

541
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,400
It isn't something
that making lots of money

542
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,370
or selling a bunch of products

543
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,210
can compare to.

544
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,520
Yuan Yuan, calm down.

545
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,370
Your proposal was a little too sudden.

546
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,690
Can you hold off the decision for now?

547
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,560
Besides,

548
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,520
you also had a contract with Rui.

549
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,220
If you want to terminate the contract,

550
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,950
then you must follow the terms.

551
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,730
Since I've brought it up to you,

552
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,950
it means I'm prepared

553
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,090
to honour the terms of the agreement.

554
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,440
Yuan Yuan!

555
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,250
Don't worry.

556
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,510
I'll pay the termination fee

557
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,730
of five million and not a cent less.

558
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,890
Can you afford it?

559
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,790
That's not your problem.

560
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,640
So please be understanding.

561
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,560
Thanks.

562
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,770
Yuan Yuan!

563
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,160
How did this happen?

564
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,630
Why?

565
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,970
Stop fidgeting. You're making me dizzy.

566
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,400
Duan Ran.

567
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,680
It's all your fault.

568
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,500
We've been over this.

569
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,420
I told you it won't work.

570
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,100
You gave her all the traffic,
all the protection,

571
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,860
and all of the company's resources.

572
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,550
You think that was going to work?

573
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,220
You didn't listen. Now look what happened.

574
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,620
I didn't know she'd
turn out this way, did I?

575
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,180
I did nothing wrong.

576
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,800
What? It was totally your fault.

577
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,090
If it's not your fault,

578
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,250
then tell me, what should we do?

579
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,040
Can we even negotiate?

580
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,030
Since Yuan Yuan took it upon herself

581
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,210
to pay you five million to terminate
the contract,

582
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,700
it means she's not interested
in negotiating.

583
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,790
She was just informing you.

584
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,320
Five million yuan.

585
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,250
Can she fork out the cash?

586
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,440
I know full well how much she makes.

587
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,870
Her family isn't rich,

588
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,820
and she has

589
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,250
many mouths to feed.

590
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,850
She can't pay the amount.

591
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,480
Since she had the gall to say it,

592
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,090
she must have her ways, right?

593
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,910
We signed that contract

594
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,250
as an assurance to both of us.

595
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,890
Having that assurance

596
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,460
gave me the confidence

597
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,210
to put all our best resources,

598
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,720
all our money on her.

599
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,630
Now that the assurance is gone,

600
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,970
we ought to get back our money.

601
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,090
Actually, this isn't about the money.

602
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,560
Do you know what I feel
the most hurt about?

603
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,660
It's her strong,

604
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,010
Aries-like streak of individualism.

605
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,890
She didn't even let me have a say

606
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,500
before she decided to shell out
the five million yuan.

607
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,090
What am I to her?

608
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,040
I feel so manipulated.

609
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,010
You...

610
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,130
Cancers like you are no slouch either.

611
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,160
Tough and fierce on the outside,

612
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,640
soft and fuzzy on the inside.

613
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,920
Isn't that right?

614
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,770
Right?

615
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,680
Give me a break.

616
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,050
Can't you pick a better time
to flatter me?

617
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,250
You're obviously trying to console me.

618
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,820
Then tell me,

619
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,160
what am I going to do?

620
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,910
Two things.

621
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,440
First,

622
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,890
Yuan Yuan's departure

623
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,680
is a fact.

624
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,150
You can't change it.

625
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,850
So after she leaves,

626
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,730
you should fill up that void
as soon as possible.

627
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,380
Everything from the broadcaster
to the supply chain

628
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,780
should be restructured.

629
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,400
That's a lot to handle.

630
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,420
The die is cast.

631
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,840
We have to move on
no matter how difficult.

632
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,320
What's second?

633
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,570
If Yuan Yuan wants
to pay you five million yuan,

634
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,330
just take it.

635
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,570
That's true, but...

636
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,920
Ms Qian, Mr Duan.

637
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,460
Ms Qian, is this a good time?

638
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,840
No, it's not.

639
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,570
Well, of course it is.

640
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,889
Go.

641
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,330
Be strong. Come on.

642
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:55,600
I'm off, then.

643
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,970
The company comes first. Save the company.

644
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,900
Ms Qian, I know you
must be furious at Yuan Yuan.

645
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,830
But it's an opportunity of a lifetime.

646
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,860
This is the big break

647
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,180
Yuan Yuan has been waiting for.

648
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,510
She's got her big break.

649
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,550
But does that mean she can abandon us?

650
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,650
It's not like that.

651
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,500
If Yuan Yuan had a better choice,

652
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,960
she wouldn't have done so.

653
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,360
Ms Qian, I apologise to you
on Yuan Yuan's behalf.

654
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,400
I'm really sorry.

655
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,730
That's enough, Zhang Bin.

656
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,660
I understand why Yuan Yuan
made this decision.

657
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,860
But she tried to sever ties with me
out of the blue,

658
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,660
even at the cost of five million.

659
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Does she have the money?
Does she respect my feelings?

660
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,010
Ms Qian, I came here

661
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,840
just to talk about that.

662
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,360
I'm sure you know Yuan Yuan's character.

663
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,160
She's on the reckless side.

664
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,380
I know she wants out,

665
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,420
but I didn't know

666
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,700
she'd do it by the book

667
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,300
and pay the termination fee.

668
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,590
When she came out of your office,

669
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,810
she told me to put her car and her house
up for sale online.

670
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,750
She's selling her car and her house?

671
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,850
Yes.

672
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,330
You know her family's situation,
don't you?

673
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,180
The only assets she has

674
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,490
are her house in Xiamen and her car.

675
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,440
If she sells them off,

676
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,390
what would become of her?

677
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,400
Ms Qian,

678
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,440
I know in everyone's eyes,

679
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,810
I'm just a small fry.

680
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,880
But I just want to take this chance

681
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,570
to tell you how I feel.

682
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,160
Sit down.

683
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:17,050
The truth is, I'm a fan of Yuan Yuan's.

684
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,160
Everybody knows that.

685
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,880
At first, I wasn't a fan of hers

686
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,630
but of some other starlet's.

687
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,140
So I got together

688
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,050
with a few other fans and went to
the set to see her.

689
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,840
But upon interacting with her,

690
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,160
I realised my idol was nothing like
her celebrity persona.

691
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,080
I was disappointed.

692
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,010
I sat under a tree,
leaning against its trunk.

693
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,860
Then I heard someone speaking
to me from above,

694
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,210
asking if I could get her a packed lunch.

695
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,570
Yuan Yuan?

696
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,070
That was the first time I saw Yuan Yuan.

697
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,370
She was in her wired costume,

698
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,010
hanging on the tree.

699
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,970
The crew had gone out to lunch.

700
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,430
I didn't want to mess up her costume,

701
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,360
so I...

702
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,680
I fetched her a packed lunch.

703
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,280
I get it.

704
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,030
You took a shine to Yuan Yuan

705
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,490
from that moment on.

706
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,640
Not so soon.

707
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,220
So I took the packed lunch
in one hand

708
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,950
and fed her with the other.

709
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,630
Her hands were tied, you see.

710
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,380
Since that incident,

711
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,160
I began to notice her.

712
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,680
I discovered that she was an extremely
dedicated actress.

713
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,890
Since then,

714
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,680
I decided to become Qi Yuan Yuan's
number one fan.

715
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,690
Zhang Bin,

716
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,210
I hear you used to be a top executive

717
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,740
at an internet company.

718
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,360
I worked 12 hours a day, six days a week.

719
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,760
After meeting Yuan Yuan,

720
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,900
I felt showbiz was too tough for her,

721
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,440
so I suggested she go into streaming.

722
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,810
Seeing her become the head broadcaster

723
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,210
makes me rather proud.

724
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,810
Do you know why

725
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,590
we were so upset when she tried

726
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,120
to end her contract with us?

727
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,120
Because she's the pride of our company.

728
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,130
I know it's not easy for you and Mr Duan
to start a business.

729
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,130
But it's no easier for Yuan Yuan
to get this far either.

730
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,920
So I beg you,

731
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,120
seeing as we are all still young,

732
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,290
seeing as we have a long road ahead of us,

733
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,470
can you please go easy on her

734
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,920
and let her off?

735
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,220
Don't make her sell her house and her car.

736
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,540
Let her accumulate some wealth.

737
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,310
In the future,
if she runs into any trouble,

738
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,790
please show her some
kindness and generosity.

739
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,190
What are you doing?

740
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,740
[Time, It's time to show]

741
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,900
There's just one issue

742
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,920
about the movie.

743
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,600
He's going to play
a murderer in "The Suspect".

744
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,050
Madam, can you please
stop harping on that?

745
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,240
Alright?

746
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,480
So, Ms Ouyang,

747
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,330
after all that drivel,

748
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,000
just say it plainly.

749
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,120
Just tell me I'm short-sighted.

750
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:58,430
Madam, that's not what I mean.

751
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,400
If you think...

752
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,440
That's enough.

753
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,310
Let's not argue anymore.

754
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,620
Look at you, you've been working so hard

755
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,140
with barely any time to rest.

756
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,600
You should kick back, take it easy.

757
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,190
Have you had dinner?

758
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,720
I'll get you a bowl
of Guilin rice noodles.

759
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,230
No need to, Madam.

760
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,590
Seriously.

761
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,040
Have some water.

762
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,080
Don't worry. Keep training.

763
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,330
Isn't Xiao Yu in "The Suspect"

764
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,070
supposed to be a beefcake?

765
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,390
I need to get this.

766
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,720
Sure.

767
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,070
Hello, Duan Ran.

768
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,210
I've been so busy lately.

769
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,050
I wanted to get in touch with you.

770
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,150
I'm guessing you want to see me?

771
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,020
Guess what it's about?

772
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,110
About work stuff, I guess.

773
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,360
I heard.

774
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,560
Your big time broadcaster Yuan Yuan

775
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,190
just got a movie deal and wants to split.

776
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,180
It must cost your company
plenty of viewership.

777
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,560
But Yang Yang's been busy, too.

778
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,960
He's not available.

779
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,550
I'm not asking for him.

780
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,830
Then who?

781
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,490
Can you set me up with someone

782
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,250
who has a big following?

783
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,560
Some kind of internet celebrity.

784
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,610
[Sure, I'll think about it.]

785
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,790
[I have to check]

786
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,930
[their schedules first.]

787
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,450
[If I find anyone suitable]

788
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,600
[and available,]

789
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,930
[I'll fix you up.]

790
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,450
Thanks. Just what I'd expect
from a top notch agent.

791
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,920
One phone call is all it takes.

792
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,180
I'll wait for the news.

793
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,100
[Sure. I'll talk to you again.]

794
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,630
[Bye-bye.]

795
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,950
What is it?
