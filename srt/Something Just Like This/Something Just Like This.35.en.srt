[We Are Young]

00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,640
[Episode 35]

4
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,990
Hello.

5
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,250
Duan Ran, I have something to tell you.

6
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,750
We can still use
Yuanbaobao's streaming account.

7
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,950
Jia Yun also agreed that she
should specialise in mukbangs.

8
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,830
Listen,

9
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,120
Yu Shi really surprised me.

10
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,930
Didn't he cover a live stream today?

11
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,289
The results are pretty good.

12
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,090
I've watched Yu Shi's performance.

13
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,910
I didn't know that guy
had this hidden talent.

14
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,650
Say, speaking of Yuanbao,

15
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,670
I have an idea.

16
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,020
Didn't Yuanbao always want
to prove herself to her father?

17
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,759
Let's work with Hualu Coffee

18
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,740
for the Singles' Day event.

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,630
I've met Mr Bai before.

20
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,780
With his personality,

21
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,860
he is not afraid to make
huge business deals.

22
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,080
There are two ways to cut a
deal with someone in business.

23
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,009
Either starve him to death,

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,830
or you feed him until he bursts.

25
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,760
Feed Mr Bai until he burst.

26
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,380
You startled me.

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,829
You're here.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,100
I'm here.

29
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,300
I ordered a drink for you,
your usual.

30
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,400
Mojito.

31
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,780
Why are you grinning at me?
Something good happened to you?

32
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,240
Let me show you something.

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,579
What is it?

34
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,160
Hi, everyone. I'm Yu Shi.

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,500
What is he doing here?

36
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,660
Isn't he

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,520
that treasurer who works for Duan Ran?

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,500
That's him.

39
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,010
-It's him?
-He has become a broadcaster too?

40
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,280
All hands on deck?

41
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,100
Their company is in trouble.

42
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,100
All their broadcasters

43
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,910
have been blocked.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,050
What happened?

45
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,670
Says they have been framed.

46
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,190
Only one mukbang can go on air now.

47
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,780
Xi Xi came to see me today.

48
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,560
She asked for my help.

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,920
Are you going to help her then?

50
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,790
Since she has asked,
I couldn't really say no.

51
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,190
Besides, I've thought about it.

52
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,170
My endorsement with Perfect Blue

53
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,630
has expired now, right?

54
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,470
And I don't have any other
endorsements right now,

55
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,200
so I thought I should help her.

56
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,160
So you asked me out today

57
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,100
just to show off that

58
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,190
you get to work side by side with your

59
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,010
dream girl again, didn't you?

60
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,540
The thing is

61
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,270
you know who I am, right?

62
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,630
I am Jiang Zhe Yang,

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,050
a superstar.

64
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,380
And you,

65
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,980
if you can utilise your tenacity

66
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,050
and your determination
when you're at work,

67
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,720
there's nothing you can't do.

68
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,180
So I thought

69
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,490
both of us are not the type
of people who give up easily.

70
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,660
You're doing so well in
the entertainment industry.

71
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,980
Going to their small company

72
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,580
should be a piece of cake to you, right?

73
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,820
Besides, if you can take
advantage of your resources

74
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,010
to help them,

75
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,960
like planning, promoting or marketing,

76
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,640
it'll be a great boon
for their company.

77
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,330
It's also a good thing for their brand.

78
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,880
And I'll be a hero and
come to her rescue by then.

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,300
While you just need to impress Duan Ran

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,920
with your image as a
powerful businesswoman.

81
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,140
So you asked me out

82
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,210
to persuade me to join their company?

83
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,470
Are you serious? This is ridiculous.

84
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,020
If I agree to this, I'm just drunk.

85
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,310
But then again,

86
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,290
Duan Ran and Xi Xi's company

87
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,670
are really in trouble now.

88
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,350
And they do need help.

89
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,330
So,

90
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,620
you really want the two of us

91
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,290
to help them, don't you?

92
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,520
Brother,

93
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,160
you're finally off work.

94
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,090
What are you still doing here?

95
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,320
I was going to wait until
you got off work to talk to you.

96
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,810
I didn't know you're so busy.

97
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,400
You've been staying
in your office all night.

98
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,720
Sorry.

99
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,700
Singles' Day is just a
couple of days away.

100
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,810
We're all working overtime at the office.

101
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,570
We just set up an army cot in the office.

102
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,020
It's just one night anyway.

103
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,659
We're going out to get some buns.

104
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,950
You guys have been working really hard.

105
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,920
Let's go together.

106
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,930
Sure, let's go.

107
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,020
I'll buy you a bun.

108
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,830
I'm really sorry

109
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,030
to keep you waiting all night.

110
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,290
-This door is the exit, right?
-Yes.

111
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,810
I didn't expect you would do this.

112
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,220
I can't believe a rich guy like you

113
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,820
would wait downstairs
by our office all night.

114
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,920
Wait, where do you get
the idea that I'm a rich guy?

115
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,770
Well, you came to see
me yesterday, right?

116
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,570
After that, I went back to the company

117
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,690
and looked into your company profile.

118
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,930
Your dad is pretty awesome.

119
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,390
He's not that great.

120
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,470
My dad is just an ordinary businessman.

121
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,590
Sounds like

122
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,300
you're starting your own business.

123
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,940
I'm sure your family
didn't force you to do that.

124
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,270
It must be because you wanted
to surpass your father, right?

125
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,440
Not really.

126
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,950
It's just that my dad and I

127
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,360
have different perspectives
on how to run a company.

128
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,460
And I don't like to follow
the path they set for me.

129
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,550
My company was just getting on track,

130
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,150
Singles' Day is our peak period,

131
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,790
yet our accounts are blocked.
It's really worrying.

132
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,020
I see.

133
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,970
I'll look into it when I go
back to my office later.

134
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,550
If there's anything

135
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,050
I can do to help, I will.

136
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,390
But don't get your hopes up.

137
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,400
I'm really relieved to hear you say that.

138
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,110
I only realised how hard it is

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,350
when I started my own business.

140
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,620
When my company was just established,

141
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,320
I encountered many obstacles.

142
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,310
At that time, our company was
short of money and had no cash flow.

143
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,460
And then, I sold all my
collection of figurines,

144
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,590
like my One Piece figurine, you know.

145
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,300
Yet it was still not enough.

146
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,940
And recently, all the
physical apparel companies

147
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,520
in our area have formed an alliance

148
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,470
to suppress our live streaming industry.

149
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,049
It's been really tough for us.

150
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,120
Don't you think you've bought too much?

151
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,260
Little Duckling, let me tell you,

152
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,929
hyaluronic acid is great for its

153
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,909
moisturising and repairing effect.

154
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,840
Really?

155
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,030
Every time after I used it,

156
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,430
my face would become
particularly supple.

157
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,500
Mum has set me up with a few blind dates.

158
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,830
This will come in handy.

159
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,230
Let me take a look.

160
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Hyaluronic acid moisturiser.

161
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,070
-I'll give you a bottle later.
-Little Duckling.

162
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,330
Ke Ke.

163
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,780
Miss me?

164
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,870
I miss you so much.

165
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,240
Come in, come in.

166
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,440
-Come on.
-What are you doing back here?

167
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,780
I'm here to see you. I miss you.

168
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,230
Look at your clothes.

169
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,030
Looks like Mr Chen treats you well.

170
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,570
I've been working hard myself.

171
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,430
-How are you doing?
-That's good.

172
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,440
Compared to you, we are worse off.

173
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,470
What happened? I noticed
something was wrong

174
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,920
when I came in just now.

175
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,290
Singles' Day is coming soon.

176
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,090
Why is Rui so quiet?

177
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,370
Forget it.

178
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,780
Our accounts have been blocked

179
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,890
by the live streaming platform.

180
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,820
All the projects we've prepared,

181
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,360
none of them can be used now.

182
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,310
What are you guys going to do then?

183
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,700
Cola, there's no way you didn't know.

184
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,340
This is all thanks to Mr Chen.

185
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,550
What do you mean?

186
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,270
Do you have any proof?

187
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,270
He's the one who gave us the stock.

188
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,280
All stocks were from the market.

189
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,380
If they're all the same,

190
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,890
how come yours are fine
but ours aren't?

191
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,100
You're blaming others

192
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,470
for your bad luck.

193
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,140
That's enough. Cut it out.

194
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,040
Xi Xi and Jia Yun have
been looking into this.

195
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,210
Although Chen Lang is
the most suspicious one,

196
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,470
we can't conclude that he did it,

197
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,660
right?

198
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,150
Little Duckling, you flip-flopper.

199
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,340
Whose side are you on?

200
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,790
Who are you calling a flip-flopper?

201
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,420
All you do everyday is
getting mad at people.

202
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,620
-Ke Ke.
-No wonder you don't have a boyfriend.

203
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,910
Li Ke Ke, are you insulting
me for not having a boyfriend?

204
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,280
-That's exactly what I said.
-Ke Ke, I'm hungry.

205
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,490
My blind dates are coming up.

206
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,700
I'll have ten boyfriends, you'll see.

207
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,990
-I'd like to see that.
-Don't go away.

208
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,190
-I'll show you ten boyfriends.
-Let's go.

209
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,510
I'm so mad.

210
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,700
Su Su is just quick-tempered.

211
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,510
Don't argue with her.

212
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,980
It's not that I want to
argue with her. The point is

213
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,070
she was slandering Chen Lang.

214
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,760
We all know Chen
Lang really likes Jia Yun.

215
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,910
There's no way he would set Jia Yun up.

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,370
This is a fight between the bosses.

217
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,520
Nobodies like us should
just stay out of it.

218
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,150
Come, I'll buy you a cup of milk tea.

219
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,650
It'll be my treat.

220
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,820
What would you like to drink?

221
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,570
I'll have a cup of hot milk tea,
full sugar.

222
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,690
-I got it. Wait outside.
-Okay.

223
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,400
One hot milk tea, full sugar.

224
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,630
And one sugar free. Thank you.

225
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,820
Okay.

226
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,390
Little Duckling,

227
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,470
Singles' Day is coming soon.
What to do?

228
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,630
We still have Yuanbao's
mukbang, don't we?

229
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,140
Besides, Mr Duan is
looking for help in Beijing.

230
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,240
There's nothing to worry about.

231
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm asking about you.

232
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,920
I don't really have any
great ambitions anyway.

233
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,720
I just want to make a little money.

234
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,860
And eat delicious food
from all around the world.

235
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,680
Miss, your milk teas are ready.

236
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,890
Thank you.

237
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,160
Just foods and drinks.

238
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,970
You're quite easily content.

239
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,130
Nice.

240
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,210
Honestly, I envy you.

241
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,240
You see, when I was in Rui,

242
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,050
I wanted to perform better than Yuan Yuan.

243
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,450
After I joined Cloud,

244
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,230
I want to surpass Xiao Xiao.

245
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,150
Ke Ke, you're being too hard on yourself.

246
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,230
How nice it would be

247
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,650
if we could combine our personalities.

248
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,370
Do you remember the time

249
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,820
your live stream
room was under renovation,

250
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,320
and you did a live stream with me?

251
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,030
It turned out really well.

252
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,540
Of course I remember.
My mum even watched it.

253
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,710
She said we looked so similar,
we were like sisters.

254
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,250
What else did she say?

255
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,880
She said we're pretty.

256
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,810
Does your mum watch live streams?

257
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,180
She doesn't really watch them.

258
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,110
Enjoy your food.

259
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,680
-I think all our dishes are served.
-Thank you.

260
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,410
Everything we ordered is here.

261
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,400
Yuanbao, stop drinking.

262
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,470
Pour yourself some lemonade.

263
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,060
Oh, okay.

264
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,440
That's a lot of dishes.

265
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,080
Just a simple meal will be fine.
You're too generous.

266
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,950
No way. This is my treat today, Mr Bai.

267
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,410
When you came to see Yuanbao last time,

268
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,270
I was in a hurry, I didn't
get to greet you properly.

269
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,550
Today,

270
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,410
all these dishes,
just make do with it.

271
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,350
You're quite a smart girl.

272
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,690
But Director Qian, there are
some things you may not know.

273
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,980
With my current
relationship with Si Yu,

274
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,050
unless it's an emergency,

275
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,130
she would not ask me
to have a meal together.

276
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,300
What is it? Just lay it out.

277
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,110
Dad, can't you put it in a nicer way?

278
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,180
Xi Xi is my best friend.

279
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,600
My relationship with Yuanbao,

280
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,880
plus,

281
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,210
seeing your forthright character now,

282
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,190
I'll just cut to the chase, Mr Bai.

283
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,050
The thing is our company

284
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,160
is facing a crisis.

285
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,430
On this Singles' Day, we'll lead
with Yuanbao's mukbang account.

286
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,980
We're here to make a deal with you today.

287
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,630
What crisis? What deal?

288
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,730
-Our company...
-Our company has been set up.

289
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,030
Business is war.

290
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,790
Consider it a lesson to you.

291
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,600
But all of the company's
accounts have been blocked,

292
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,100
except mine.

293
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,140
So Director Qian wants
to focus on promoting you.

294
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,250
No, it's me.

295
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,890
I want to sell our coffee online.

296
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,960
She meant it, Mr Bai.

297
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,370
We're focusing on promoting

298
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,650
mukbang on Singles' Day this time.

299
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,650
Plus, Yuanbao's account has a lot of fans,

300
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,980
and it's very active.

301
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,370
Furthermore, we've
learned about Hualu Coffee.

302
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,450
Your company has been developing
steadily in the e-commerce business.

303
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,770
Through this collaboration,

304
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,260
it is also a good opportunity for you

305
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,720
to venture into e-commerce live streaming.

306
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,660
Has your father seen a live stream before?

307
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,330
-He has, he has.
-He has!

308
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,700
You know that one, Mr Bai,

309
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,990
Hello, babes. Hi.

310
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,130
This cabbage is so good.

311
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,830
-Place your order now.
-I believe you've heard the rumours

312
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,290
that I have a huge appetite.

313
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,430
I've heard about those rumours.

314
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,670
But don't you underestimate us.

315
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,470
We've done our homework.

316
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,110
And that's why we're placing this order

317
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,600
with Hualu Coffee today.

318
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,110
Look, Mr Bai.

319
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,510
We can buy the goods

320
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,000
at an ex works price that
matches the physical retail prices.

321
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,790
Director Qian, are you
sure this is business?

322
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,150
Not charity?

323
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,340
Mr Bai, I think

324
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,570
you don't know much about the model

325
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,770
and the cost of online sales.

326
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,540
Really? I must expand my horizons then.

327
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,520
So?

328
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,890
We have a deal.

329
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,500
We've got the deal.

330
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,290
Here's to you.

331
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,780
Cheers.

332
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,200
He's your father indeed.

333
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Thank you, Mr Bai.

334
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,660
Have some more.

335
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,100
You haven't been eating properly.
You've become slimmer.

336
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,820
Why are you laughing?

337
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,270
Haven't I lost weight?

338
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,510
Jia Yun,

339
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,160
everything went well with Yuanbao's dad.

340
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,830
I'm going to take some samples now.

341
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,560
What about you? How is it going?

342
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,830
You have no idea.

343
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,550
I've been making calls all morning.

344
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,810
I've finally cut the deal
with that local products shop.

345
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,080
They happened to be interested in
starting their own e-commerce business.

346
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,400
But they never had the chance.

347
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,080
This is a chance for them
to try it out through us.

348
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,110
What about Duan Ran's side?
I wonder how he is doing.

349
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,970
Anyway, Yuanbao is our hope now.

350
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,310
You must make sure you
attend to every detail, understood?

351
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,340
I got it, Director Qian.

352
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,339
I'm working on the backdrop
and discount coupons now.

353
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,140
But Xi Xi,

354
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,829
we have only two accounts this time.

355
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,520
Can we make it to the infield?

356
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,960
[I'm not sure if we can make it.]

357
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,109
What else can we do?

358
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,089
Let's just work on what we can.

359
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,900
Alright.

360
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,270
I have to go.

361
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,760
I'm making room in your office here.

362
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,730
Hurry up and come back.

363
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,400
Alright, we'll talk later.

364
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,730
Hello, Ms Ouyang.

365
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,790
How did your father's surgery go?

366
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,200
It went well.

367
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,650
He's resting now.

368
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,440
That's good. Are you still in Beijing?

369
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,980
Yes. I'm going back soon.

370
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,570
I have a lot of things to
take care of in my company.

371
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,480
Is your company still hiring these days?

372
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,750
Yes.

373
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,700
Do you have any recommendations?

374
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,410
Me.

375
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,650
Stop joking. We can't afford you.

376
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,540
Well, it's true that other people can't,

377
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,170
but if it's you,

378
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,800
I won't charge you.

379
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,830
You can't go through me on this.

380
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,300
You'd better talk to Jia Yun.
It's improper to go through me.

381
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,060
Fine, I won't put you in a bad spot.

382
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,080
Going through the normal
procedure, right? I'll talk to her.

383
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,490
Alright then. Bye-bye.

384
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,000
Bye-bye.

385
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,540
All of these have been
moved to the truck, right?

386
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,610
Yes. You can sign here.

387
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,800
Okay.

388
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,780
And then, get all of these into the truck.

389
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,790
Those as well.

390
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,070
Okay, okay.

391
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,960
All clear.

392
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,370
Okay, thank you.

393
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,630
[Please do not throw
cigarette butts and trash here]

394
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,890
Hello.

395
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,260
Xi Xi,

396
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,800
are you in the office now?

397
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,970
No, I'm picking up
products at Hualu Coffee.

398
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,900
How is it going over there?

399
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,380
Ms Ouyang called me just now.

400
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,240
Saying that she wants to work for us.

401
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,730
What's going on with her?

402
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,640
What's an agent like her
doing in a live streaming company?

403
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,370
She just said she wants to join.

404
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,800
And I thought about it.

405
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,780
Ms Ouyang is highly qualified.

406
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,160
And she's an all-round professional.

407
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,960
[We have an opening anyway.]

408
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,640
We can use her help.

409
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,070
Duan Ran, I don't agree with this.

410
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,960
What are you thinking?

411
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,930
You're now telling your girlfriend

412
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,950
how great your ex-girlfriend is.

413
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,400
What are you trying to say?

414
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,990
I'm not saying anything.

415
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,480
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

416
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,890
But I...

417
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,300
Hello?

418
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,710
Hello?

419
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,510
That's really quick-tempered.

420
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,820
That's not what I meant.

421
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,830
That's why I'm letting you
know about this, aren't I?

422
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,140
Alright, go work on it.

423
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,560
Ms Ouyang,

424
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,030
what brings you here?

425
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,910
I'm here to talk to your CEO

426
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,710
about some work-related stuff.

427
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,550
What a coincidence.

428
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,760
I'm the acting CEO of Rui now.

429
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,100
Why don't you talk to me?

430
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,370
I see.

431
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,010
Sure. Let's have a talk.

432
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,620
You're making a career change?

433
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,480
A crossover, to be precise.

434
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
That's interesting.

435
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,440
With your qualifications and
experience, Ms Ouyang,

436
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,440
there are many companies
that can put your talent to good use.

437
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,770
That's true. So I have come here

438
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,350
to see you now, haven't I?

439
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,550
That's a great honour.

440
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,400
But here's the thing.

441
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,340
Unfortunately,

442
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,680
Mr Duan and Director Qian
are not here today.

443
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,070
I should talk to them first,

444
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,610
shouldn't I?

445
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,600
Doesn't the CEO of your
company have the authority

446
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,370
on direct appointment and dismissal?

447
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,630
I've only been on the post
for a short while, haven't I?

448
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,690
I don't know about this.
I can't say anything.

449
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,540
Regardless of what company you're in,

450
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,130
even if you're just an acting CEO,

451
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,130
you still have the direct authority on
personnel appointment and dismissal.

452
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,270
Besides,

453
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,090
all of your company's live stream
rooms have been blocked now.

454
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,370
Aren't you anxious?

455
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,080
Don't you want to solve it?

456
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,960
Don't hesitate too long when
you're hiring a talent.

457
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,130
Fine.

458
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,000
Since you've offered to join us,

459
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,390
I welcome you on behalf of Rui.

460
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,910
The wise trim their sails to the wind.

461
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,810
Then Ms Zhang,
I have two requests for you.

462
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,630
First, please arrange an
office for me immediately.

463
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,600
Second,

464
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,140
I don't plan on going home today.

465
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,810
So my luggage is still in my car.

466
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,190
First, I'll arrange an office
for you right away.

467
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,960
Second, I'll send someone
to pick up your luggage later.

468
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,230
Deal.

469
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,690
This way, please.

470
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,870
Let's go.

471
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,020
Currently, there are
three offices for directors.

472
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,300
Mr Duan's office.

473
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,530
Director Qian's office.

474
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,260
And treasurer Mr Yu's office.

475
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,950
Which office is yours, Ms Zhang?

476
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,670
That one downstairs.

477
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,010
I used to take Xi Xi's office back then.

478
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,380
But since she has returned now,

479
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,490
I have to give it back to her, right?

480
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,560
Yes.

481
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,190
So that means

482
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,870
I'm working in your company now,

483
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,500
but I don't have an office yet.

484
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,300
Yes indeed.

485
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,370
How about I have some workers

486
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,100
to remodel the training
room downstairs for you?

487
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,720
That's going to take a few days.

488
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,040
Where can I work during this period?

489
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,110
I'll just have to ask you

490
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,780
to share a place with the directors.

491
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,370
Sure. I'm fine with it.

492
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,080
I can share it with Mr Duan.

493
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,240
I'm afraid that's not possible.

494
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,670
Why?

495
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,310
Well, you and Mr Duan

496
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,820
are both busy people.

497
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,500
How could we put you two together, right?

498
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,750
Yes, point made.

499
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,700
I'll let you arrange it then,
dear acting CEO.

500
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,910
Ms Ouyang, what about my office?

501
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,500
Never mind.

502
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,100
The design of your room
matches you perfectly.

503
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,090
Besides, it's not right
for you to move out.

504
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,440
If neither Mr Duan's office

505
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,840
nor mine works for you,

506
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,220
there's only one office left.

507
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,180
Mr Chen.

508
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,780
Here you are.

509
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,680
When you first came to the company,

510
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,140
did you feel a lot of pressure?

511
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,990
I was suppressing you on purpose.

512
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,200
You're the kind of person who
bounces back stronger

513
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,980
the harder you're knocked down.

514
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,930
And it turns out
I'm right about you.

515
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,480
You even manipulated your friend.

516
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,200
Stop mocking me, Mr Chen.

517
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,570
I just want Little Duckling
to have a better future too.

518
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,410
You two can start as soon as possible.

519
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,040
Be ready to start working.

520
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,080
I'll fulfill my promise to you.

521
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,700
Jia Yun.

522
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,020
You're back.

523
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,510
What have you got here?

524
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,540
I bought some By-Health.

525
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,080
I'm going to put them in the break room,

526
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,570
so everyone can recharge.

527
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,770
Alright, I'll leave you to it.

528
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,580
I'm exhausted, I'm going in there.

529
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,990
Xi Xi.

530
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,320
Xi Xi,

531
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,870
when you enter your office later,

532
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,890
no matter who you see,
or what you encounter,

533
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,830
you must stay calm, okay?

534
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,770
Who is here?

535
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,580
Xi Xi, I'm sure you know

536
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,470
I am this company's CEO now.

537
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,380
You can understand that
I have my reasons, right?

538
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,430
Of course.

539
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,450
You're the CEO.

540
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,900
I'll stand by whatever
decision you make.

541
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,050
Alright, then, I mean,

542
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,300
-later in your office...
-Don't move!

543
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,930
Xi Xi,

544
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,870
Ms Ouyang came to ask me for a position.

545
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,400
She said she wanted to cross over
to e-commerce live streaming.

546
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,170
You know it too, her
experience and academic qualifications

547
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,580
are really good.

548
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,750
Plus, our company has gone through

549
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,890
a lot of hardships over
the past six months.

550
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,140
It's true that we're
lacking professional

551
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,380
and high-level talent like her.

552
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,930
And at this critical
moment for the company,

553
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,850
I have no choice but to take her.

554
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,790
Zhang Jia Yun, you...

555
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,110
Are you insane?

556
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,220
You're my best friend,
and yet you kept her here.

557
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,230
What are you thinking?

558
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,950
Calm down. Take a deep breath.

559
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,790
She's on probation anyway.

560
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,300
If she performs poorly, you can
just fire her. What do you say?

561
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,030
Do you really believe
that she's here for the job?

562
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,090
Xi Xi, all I can tell you is

563
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,090
her qualifications can really help us now.

564
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,400
But I...

565
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,870
It's fine. I'll go.

566
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,180
I remember you told me before

567
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,640
you were a fan of Yang Yang.

568
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,400
So I have prepared a proposal here

569
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,860
which allows you to
interact with Yang Yang.

570
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,900
And then, let's create a
fangirl persona for you.

571
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,020
Actually, Ms Ouyang,

572
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,130
I'm not a fan of his anymore.

573
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,070
It's just that I had several chances

574
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,520
to meet with Yang Yang before.

575
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,100
But I always missed them.

576
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,510
After I went home, I thought about it.

577
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,370
Maybe I was just not destined
to meet with Yang Yang.

578
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,120
After that, I turned my
attention to other male celebrities.

579
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,020
Then this could be the opportunity

580
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,090
for you to fall in love with him again.

581
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,670
You can become his fan again.

582
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,120
No way, no way.

583
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,290
The celebrity I like now
is Yang Yang's rival.

584
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,930
I'll be in trouble if I betray him.

585
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,210
Don't be so head-strong.

586
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,260
Drop it.

587
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,410
You can't force things to work.

588
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,120
Stop forcing Yuanbao.

589
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,250
Also, tell me,

590
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,830
what is this table doing here?

591
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,370
The admins arranged it.

592
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,210
Yuanbao, think about it,

593
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,540
it's for work, don't be so stubborn.

594
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,190
I just happened to
have this proposal here.

595
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,580
I want to get Yuanbao to interact
with Yang Yang on stream.

596
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,300
So I let her take a look.

597
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,290
Take a look, Xi Xi.

598
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,970
I see you came prepared.

599
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,890
I've done many proposals
like this for Yang Yang before.

600
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,690
I happened to have it, and we need it now.

601
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,880
So I brought it over.

602
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,830
I know Duan Ran needs my help.

603
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,890
That's why I'm sitting here today.

604
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,310
Yuanbao,

605
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,210
as a broadcaster,

606
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,550
you win the audience by being
approachable and natural.

607
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,610
I don't think you need this.

608
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,500
I...

609
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,800
I find that you're really funny.

610
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,690
We're doing live streams
to sell stuff, aren't we?

611
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,550
Whenever a camera's involved,

612
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,370
the truth displayed
is subjective and relative.

613
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,390
Don't you know this?

614
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,200
Are you kidding now? Did you
seriously say I don't know that?

615
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,350
Girls,

616
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,060
how about this,

617
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,600
you two talk it over first.

618
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,750
Just let me know when
you come out with a decision.

619
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,680
This is just awkward for
me. I need to leave. Bye-bye.

620
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,350
Director Qian, you can't
really think that the fact that

621
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,730
your company is in a big
mess before Singles' Day

622
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,570
is all due to external factors, do you?

623
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,390
Of course we have reflected
on our own problems.

624
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,040
Duan Ran and I are close.

625
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,850
We grew up together.

626
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,830
We've been through so much together.

627
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,360
We knew each other too well.

628
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,090
Not to mention that this is our company.

629
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,820
We know Rui inside out.

630
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,200
We know exactly how to solve this.

That's great.

You should thank me.

I miss you so much.

Are you not happy to see me?

659
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,700
You've become skinny.

660
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,110
It was freezing there.

661
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,770
And you've shrunk because of the cold?

662
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,620
Be honest with me,
I'm going to ask you something.

663
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,810
Go ahead.

664
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,330
Did you agree to let
Ms Ouyang come to work for us?

665
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,310
Did you conspire with
Zhang Jia Yun on this?

666
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,940
It's not really a conspiracy.

667
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,540
Zhang Jia Yun's decision happened
to coincide with mine on this.

668
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,040
Think about our
company's current situation.

669
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,970
Don't worry about Ms Ouyang's identity.

670
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,730
Just think about what she can bring us

671
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,370
once she joins our company, okay?

672
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,110
As far as the company's concerned,

673
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,060
I can't fault Ms Ouyang's ability.

674
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,830
That's right. That is
what a boss should say.

675
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,770
-Right?
-No.

676
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:44,040
[Chen Lang]

677
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,630
Why is Little Duckling at your company?

678
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,940
Little Duckling is here because of Cola.

679
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,920
They are best friends.

680
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,900
Maybe she felt more secure with her here.

681
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,320
Besides, seeing how we're doing,

682
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,640
she must've been impressed.

683
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,930
They believed they would have
a better future by sticking together.

684
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,730
As an owner of the company,

685
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,550
I had no reason to turn them down.

686
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,910
Alright. Inform Little Duckling
to come back

687
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,110
and sign the termination
contract when she's free.

688
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,890
That's all you have to say?
Aren't you going to yell at me?

689
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,380
I understand her.

690
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,330
Cola is her best friend after all.

691
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,640
Jia Yun, about what happened last time,

692
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,750
I wanted to help you guys.

693
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,100
That was my intention.

694
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,350
But what happened next,

695
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,420
it was out of my control.

696
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,320
Alright, that's enough.
I don't want to hear any of this.

697
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,420
Okay, okay.

698
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,240
But Chen Lang, next time you want a slap,

699
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,910
there's no need to mess things up.

700
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,510
Just give me a call and I'll be there.

701
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,800
How did your things go in Beijing?

702
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,610
That guy said he would
help me to study it.

703
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,330
Will he figure something out?

704
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,600
I'm not sure.

705
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,640
Forget about him. I brought you a gift.

706
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,490
A gift?

707
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,760
What is it?

708
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,610
Show me now.

709
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,500
It's golden and shiny

710
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,080
and tightly wrapped.

711
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,810
I got these marriage talismans in Beijing.

712
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,300
One for you,

713
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,240
and one for me.

714
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,790
[Happiness]

715
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,210
Marriage talisman?

716
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,840
I like this name.

717
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,290
Are you happy now?

718
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,020
I'm happy that you're back.

719
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,380
I'm happy when I see you.

720
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,440
You're pulling my ear again.

721
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,540
Let me pull yours.

722
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,290
You can't reach it, you can't.

723
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,810
You can't reach it.

724
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,180
I got you.

725
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,460
This is so pretty.

726
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,659
Jia Yun?

727
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,120
Jia Yun, what can I do for you?

728
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,290
Little Duckling has been poached by Cola.

729
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,440
She has moved to Chen Lang's company.

730
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,139
Chen Lang pulled off a two-trick combo.

731
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:31,480
Shame on him.

732
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,239
Did you say yes?

733
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,010
Does Little Duckling have
a contract termination fee?

734
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,210
Yes, but not much.

735
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,460
Chen Lang can afford it.

736
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,280
It's fine.

737
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,260
Little Duckling's performance

738
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,630
has been so-so anyway.

739
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,679
Maybe she'll have a better future

740
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,190
with Cola after she joins them.

741
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,450
Director Qian,

742
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,880
you're talking and
thinking differently now.

743
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,140
You have noticed it, haven't you?

744
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,570
Do you know what this is called?

745
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,080
You can make her stay,
but you'll never have her loyalty.

746
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,630
There is no point
dwelling on the past, right?

747
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,260
Let bygones be bygones.

748
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,490
Jia Yun, I have good news for you.

749
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,130
Duan Ran made a breakthrough
with the platform.

750
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,580
Let me tell you...

751
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,740
-What are you...
-The platform has replied to us.

752
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,960
So soon?

753
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,630
You hear that?

754
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,010
Girls,

755
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,110
I've set up this

756
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,130
live stream room specially for you two.

757
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,720
It took me a lot of work.

758
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,050
Great foresight, Mr Chen.

759
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,650
I see you've expected that
Little Duckling and I will join you.

760
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,140
Well, I have to have this confidence,

761
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,740
and you two have to have
this expectation, am I right?

762
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,320
Here, turn on the light.

763
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,750
-What do you think?
-Wow, it's lovely.

764
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,720
It's good.

765
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,830
And the outfits behind you were

766
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,590
picked out by me personally,

767
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,660
they are perfect for your style.

768
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,110
With you girls here,

769
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,740
we can finally capture

770
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,370
the 18 to 25-year-old female

771
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,090
market segment.

772
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,520
Moreover, this segment

773
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,730
accounts for quite a significant
proportion on the platform.

774
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,530
Here. Come out, everyone.
I have something to say.

775
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,760
Listen, guys,

776
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,620
let's give a big round of applause

777
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,910
to welcome them for joining Cloud Live.

778
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,090
I hope that their joining

779
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,090
will bring Cloud Live a fresh strength.

780
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,290
Here.

781
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,720
Upon investigation, it was found that
accusations of Rui Live

782
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,500
selling counterfeit goods

783
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,390
may have been a smear campaign.

784
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,210
In light of the upcoming
Singles' Day shopping spree,

785
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,760
we have adjusted the blocking period

786
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,700
for Rui's associated accounts to

787
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,760
three days.

788
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,780
Accounts of the company's broadcasters

789
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,950
will be unblocked

790
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,490
at 8 a.m. on November 11.

791
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,560
This is wonderful. That means
we still have a chance on Singles' Day.

792
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,750
Jia Yun,

793
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,300
Did Little Duckling
really join Cloud Live?

794
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,560
That can't be happening. I have to
call her and ask her to come back.

795
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,100
Just let her be.

796
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,210
She didn't even tell us.

797
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,900
She was determined to leave.

798
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,790
You'd better focus on your
own work for Singles' Day.

799
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,760
Fine.

800
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,380
This guy's pretty reliable.

801
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,020
He didn't keep me waiting
that long for nothing.

802
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,440
Let's not get too excited.

803
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,420
It's still unknown if
we'll be able to make it to

804
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,960
the infield with Yuanbao's account yet.

805
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,740
And even if the ban is lifted
on 8 a.m. of the eleventh,

806
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,890
if we don't get the ticket to the infield,

807
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,950
it is still all for nothing, isn't it?

808
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,940
Duan Ran,

809
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,040
even Yu Shi was dragged into this

810
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,540
and opened a live stream room.

811
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,870
What about you? Would
you like to give it a try

812
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,460
and be a broadcaster?

813
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,110
That's right. I think he should try.

814
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,480
Fine by me.

815
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,890
But if I am to be a broadcaster,

816
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,950
the setup of my live stream
room can't be taken lightly.

817
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,760
It has to be grand.

818
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,920
The whole thing has to be
classy, magnificent,

819
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,260
and awe-inspiring.

820
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,650
So hurry up, everyone.

821
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,800
Stop wasting time
