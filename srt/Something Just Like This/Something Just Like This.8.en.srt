00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,080
I know.

170
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,760
But Mr Duan Jr is quite interesting.

171
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,640
You don't say, you took everyone
to Sanya quietly that time.

172
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,940
I heard that he and Qian Xi Xi
flew there right away

173
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,390
and did a live stream on the sea.

174
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,690
If not for both of them,

175
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,590
perhaps that day you would've given me

176
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,930
a blank show, right?

177
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,450
Mr Wu, I'd never do that.

178
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,960
-I was...
-Do you know why I like this place?

179
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,450
It's clean.

180
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,920
Honest people doesn't insinuate.
We're all clear-minded.

181
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,940
I was moved by an interesting idea

182
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,790
from Duan Ran.

183
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,900
What idea did Duan Ran give you

184
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,240
that moved you so much?

185
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,490
He wanted me to set up a bet with you.

186
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,530
What are we betting?

187
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,460
Next season's contract.

188
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,070
How can we bet on that?

189
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,490
The two companies will go live
for three hours concurrently.

190
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,810
The contract will go to

191
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,400
the best seller.

192
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,440
You don't wish this to be
our last contract, right?

193
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,910
Chen Lang, are you scared?

194
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,770
Don't forget.

195
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,800
You were the one who took Rui Live down.

196
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,610
They're equal to a newborn now
that they've revived.

197
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,240
Don't you have the confidence?

198
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,910
Mr Wu, you're taunting me.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,490
Listen to your words.

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
Those broadcasters of yours,

201
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,070
there's several of them who
are above average.

202
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,030
They only have Qian Xi Xi there.

203
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,690
Zhang Jia Yun is still an amateur.

204
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,380
You're not willing to take the bet?

205
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,350
Sure, I'll do as you say.

206
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,900
-Let's have a bet.
-That's better.

207
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,680
Come.

208
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,160
You're pouring wine?

209
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,180
It's your song.

210
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,050
Coming, coming!

211
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,100
Here it comes!

212
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,180
♫ It's like a game ♫

213
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,180
♫ Love's 36 Strategies ♫

214
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,940
[I've given you the chance.]

215
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,080
[It's time to prove yourself.]

216
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,120
Looks like Mr Duan is still
confident in the fight.

217
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,230
Do you believe me if I
tell you I have a plan?

218
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,690
Of course.

219
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,290
You have a great mind for
business, Mr Duan.

220
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,600
Can you tell me what the plan is?

221
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,450
I'm preparing to retrieve
Pineapple Xpress.

222
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,070
Look! Mr Five knows this move! See?

223
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,590
I'm taking down Pineapple Xpress.

224
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,730
Are you joking?

225
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,020
What's up, Xi Xi?

226
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,440
-Let's get high!
-High!

227
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,010
Chen Lang is now...

228
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,920
You'll sing.

229
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,010
-Hello?
-[Chen Lang.]

230
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,430
[I heard they did one more special.]

231
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,900
It's the remainder stock.

232
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,370
They also had a steady sale.

233
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,930
They'll run out of inventory.

234
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,130
We'll see what happens after that.

235
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,390
[That's better.]

236
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,370
[One more thing, you must
hold on tight to Pineapple Xpress.]

237
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,920
[Don't let them snatch it.]

238
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,080
I know.

239
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,760
[Chen Lang, another reminder.]

240
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,090
[Rui Live is still in the cradle.]

241
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,470
[If you don't kill it right now,]

242
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,880
[you'll be killed when it grows up.]

243
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,620
I have good news for everyone.

244
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,230
We received a challenge.

245
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,520
We're going to compete with Chen Lang.

246
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,780
The winner will get the endorsement

247
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,200
for Pineapple Xpress' next season items.

248
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,570
Mr Duan.

249
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,120
I think you've been duped.

250
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,630
Think about it. Chen Lang is familiar
with the products.

251
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,430
He can tackle us with time lapse.

252
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,720
Don't disrupt our morale.

253
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,280
Hurry and get to work.

254
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,340
I'm not disrupting our morale.

255
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,140
I'm stating the truth.

256
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,300
Besides from the point I said,

257
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,430
how about the hosts?

258
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,990
We only have Xi Xi, Mr Five and Jia Yun.

259
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,470
There are only a few of us.

260
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,070
How can we beat Chen Lang?

261
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,900
We'll win him if we can.

262
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,280
We'll try if we can't.

263
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,590
Look at how Chen Lang made us suffer.

264
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,890
We finally get a chance for revenge.

265
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,560
Xi Xi and I are pointing
our guns outwards.

266
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,180
We have to fight them, understand?

267
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,730
Duan Ran is right.

268
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,640
We all know this is a tough fight.

269
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,500
But no matter how tough it is,

270
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,710
we have to fight back.

271
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,010
During this moment,

272
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,670
the company needs unity.

273
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,340
As for Su Su,

274
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,670
for the problem you said?

275
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,300
Don't worry, leave it to us.

276
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,650
Without further ado, let's familiarize
with the catalogue.

277
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,660
Get busy!

278
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,430
The live stream is tomorrow.

279
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,410
Then we'll go get busy.

280
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,850
Do you know about unity?

281
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,330
I'm telling the truth. What's our plan?

282
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,670
It's rare for them to be in harmony.

283
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,870
Why do you...

284
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,270
Mr Bai, may I know when you're available?

285
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,160
I'll bring Yuan Yuan for an
audition or something.

286
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,050
You chose someone else?

287
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,030
No, please, Mr Bai.

288
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,480
Is there another way? Mr Bai? Director...

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,040
He hung up.

290
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,450
I'll call someone else.

291
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,510
Never mind.

292
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,450
It's okay, I'll find you another drama.

293
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,810
I know we're not doing well these days.

294
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,290
Your contract with Rui Live
has several days left.

295
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,140
-Why don't we...
-No.

296
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,100
When we meet Xi Xi later,

297
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,560
don't mention this to her.

298
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,940
Mr Duan?

299
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,260
Where's Xi Xi?

300
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,440
Xi Xi didn't have to come now
that she has no authority.

301
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,360
The company is now under my command.

302
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,630
Yuan Yuan, I came to inform

303
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,430
your contract with Rui is still on.

304
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,230
You're still bound by the terms.

305
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,460
As so to say,

306
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,750
you must do your duty.

307
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,460
So when the company needs you back,

308
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,390
you have to come back.
Understand?

309
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,950
No, Mr Duan.

310
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
You're right in every way.

311
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,150
But you have to obey the Labour Law.

312
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,240
Yuan Yuan applied for leave.

313
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,640
The days she applied for
leave are centralized.

314
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,520
Whether you took leave or not...

315
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,870
Duan Ran!

316
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,250
Are you nuts?

317
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,740
What did I tell you?

318
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,490
Didn't I say not to disturb Yuan Yuan?

319
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,120
Why did you come here?

320
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,190
Yuan Yuan applied leave from me.

321
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,560
From you?

322
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,180
Do you have that authority?

323
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,670
You're not the CEO yet.

324
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,780
Know your position and don't make trouble.

325
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,790
I'm not, neither are you.

326
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,770
I'm not, but I'm representing
our biggest shareholder, QE.

327
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,750
What's wrong about asking Yuan Yuan
to fulfil her duties?

328
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,970
That's it.

329
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,250
Stop playing a fool here.

330
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,940
Yuan Yuan's contract will end in two days.

331
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,110
I know.

332
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,840
The competition for Pineapple Xpress'
special is coming up soon.

00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,190
they're super compatible.

666
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,040
[And don't worry, babies.]

667
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,880
[Those who are more feminine]

668
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:16,500
[might think they can't wear this suit.]
[But it's not the case]

669
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,679
Yuan Yuan still has it.

670
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,409
It's different.

671
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,139
Wait a minute, babies!

672
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,230
I'll introduce you another bag.

673
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,010
There's a zipper inside...

674
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,290
Where did you go, Yuan Yuan?

675
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,300
You're late.

676
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,190
Can you push yourself more?

677
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,449
So embarrassing of you
to sell so little.

678
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,580
Hurry!

679
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,770
Chen Lang, Rui is catching up!

680
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,110
What do we do?

681
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,960
It's a matter of time for us to catch up
to Cloud Live.

682
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,210
The sales are rising so much!

683
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,850
That's wonderful, babies!

684
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,540
Tell all the broadcasters now.

685
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,820
Tell them

686
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,460
we're cancelling all the rest time.

687
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,230
They'll broadcast three-by-three
after this.

688
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,370
Sure.

689
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,750
Until the end of the whole livestream.

690
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,800
Go!

691
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,300
Rest time is cancelled!

692
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,220
No rest until the end of the live stream!

693
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,690
My dearest babies!

694
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,620
I'm really grateful to everyone of you

695
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,220
for joining me on Pineapple Xpress'
special event today.

696
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,950
[With all of you in Xi Xi's room,]

697
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,940
[-I'm lucky to have you as my viewers.]
-Mr Duan, did you notice that

698
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,080
Xi Xi's sales has been rising

699
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,800
after Yuan Yuan got here?

700
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,900
-Yes.
-She was provoked.

701
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,090
Hurry and follow me right away!

702
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,380
Come on! Take your chance and order now!

703
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,340
And next,

704
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,780
it's going to be different.

705
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,740
There's a sequencing design below.

706
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,350
The pieces that I introduce to you

707
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,140
will always be really nice.

708
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,730
And it's affordable too.

709
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,540
The logo on this.

710
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,920
-This logo...
-It's like denim,

711
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,190
[but it's not denim.]

712
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,600
[The exterior is like this...]

713
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,380
[The sizing is...]

714
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,860
The summer feel...

715
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,680
What happened?

716
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,130
-What's this?
-What happened?

717
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,320
Maybe the main switch flipped.

718
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,540
Main switch? Where is it?

719
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,030
It's outside the building.

720
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,260
How did this happen?

721
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,360
Mr Shen, a circuit breaker
will lower the sales.

722
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,850
What to do?

723
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,140
Good things take time.

724
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,840
Why are they offline?

725
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,920
We're having a power failure.

726
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,150
I can't believe our luck.

727
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,300
It's an emergency.

728
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,650
Don't panic, everyone.

729
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,250
Our team will handle the
problem immediately.

730
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,160
Zhang!

731
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,420
Go to the main control room.

732
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,660
Don't stop, continue the live stream.

733
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,980
Don't worry! The company is
really dark right now.

734
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,880
Xi Xi?

735
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,310
Don't worry, everyone!

736
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,410
-It's really dark.
-Xi Xi?

737
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,020
-You scared me.
-That was scary.

738
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,520
What caused the power failure?

739
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,640
I don't know, go live at the control room.

740
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,030
Tell them to not panic, okay?

741
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,800
-And you?
-I'll fix the main switch.

742
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,910
The main switch?

743
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,410
-Be careful then.
-Okay.

744
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,030
-Hurry and go.
-Be careful!

745
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,790
Babies!

746
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,660
Our company is now in the dark.

747
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,170
We're having a real emergency.

748
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,370
It's on fire!

749
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,220
It's on fire! Anyone!

750
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,160
It's on fire!

751
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,310
It's on fire!

752
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,960
It's on fire!

753
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,970
It's on fire! Anyone!

754
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,770
It's on fire!

755
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,880
Hurry and help us out!

756
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,100
Where's the fire?

757
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,610
-Mr Duan!
-It's on fire!

758
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,560
Did you call the fire department?

759
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,760
-Why hug me?
-I did, they'll be here soon!

760
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,340
Where's the extinguisher?

761
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,500
Where's the fire extinguisher?

762
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,760
Fire extinguisher...

763
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,680
We're at the main control room.

764
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,590
Don't panic.

765
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,810
You're still streaming?

766
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,090
It's lagging.

767
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,740
How can we have a power failure now?

768
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,980
Mr Wu.

769
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,040
Uncle Shen.

770
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,680
We'll settle it immediately.

771
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,700
Come!

772
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,480
Hurry and tell the broadcasters

773
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,390
to grab hold of this chance.

774
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,130
Use their all and push the sales up!

775
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,050
Right away!

776
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,430
I remember this place.

777
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,090
There should be one here.

778
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,200
Xi Xi!

779
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,170
It's been five minutes
and there's still no power.

780
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,540
Fans are dropping out.

781
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,280
Don't panic! I'll fix the network soon!

782
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,640
My fans have dropped by thousands!

783
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,840
No, it's really laggy.

784
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,220
You'll lag if you use 4G too!
I'm almost done!

785
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,850
Even if we have connection,

786
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,340
we can't even broadcast.

787
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,330
How can we see anything in the dark?

788
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,540
[I sent you a gift.

789
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,990
-Here it is! Here it is!
-Why is it locked?

790
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,190
I'll do it! I'll do it!

791
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,850
-Move!
-Okay!

792
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,030
How about this?

793
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,070
We'll explain to the fans
what's happening.

794
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,900
Then we try to keep them tuned in.

795
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,390
Everyone, use your phone

796
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,130
and light up the broadcasters.

797
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,260
Keep the stream up.

798
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,190
Understand?

799
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,450
Uncle Shen, Mr Wu.

800
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,580
I'll go and check with Duan Ran.

801
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,340
-Hurry.
-Go then.

802
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,930
Stay tuned, babies!

803
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,050
Our main switch is actually on fire!

804
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,530
Please stay tuned, dear babies!

805
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,850
Open the door!

806
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,740
Hurry!

807
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,720
The main switch is really on fire!

808
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,700
It's really on fire!

809
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,320
But continue to stay tuned!

810
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,970
Our men are using the fire extinguisher

811
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,430
to spray at the main switch.

812
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,430
It's really an emergency right now.

813
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,630
The screen is dim but I'm fixing it.

814
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,560
Xi Xi's livestream is popular now!

815
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,070
Mr Wu, Mr Shen, look!

816
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,830
[It's on fire!]

817
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,290
[Our main switch is actually on fire!]

818
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,260
Hurry and look!

819
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,480
She's showing Mr Duan saving the fire.

820
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,930
-They're spraying it.
-With an extinguisher?

821
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,370
-Oh, God.
-Be careful, Xi Xi.

822
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,720
Show Xi Xi's screen with our phone!

823
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,120
We'll broadcast her stream. Hurry!

824
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,840
-This...
-This sounds nice.

825
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,100
[Stay tuned!]

826
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,050
[The smoke is choking me.]

827
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,600
Be careful, Duan Ran!

828
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,760
I can't breathe.

829
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,050
The fuse is blown. Find a new fuse.

830
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,230
-Fuse? Security!
-The fuse is blown.

831
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,550
[-Look for fuse!]
[-Get a new fuse!]

832
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,960
First time streaming with no power.

833
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,360
Racing against time.

834
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,850
Good luck, broadcaster!

835
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,760
Don't panic, babies!

836
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,940
Hurry up!

837
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,990
We're on our way to the security room.

838
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,160
Security room!

839
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,640
We're now in the security room.

840
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,170
What is this? Not this one!

841
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,560
-Our staff is now...
-We got it!

842
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,580
It's our Ms Qian!

843
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,350
My headcount is coming up!

844
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,190
It's at 69,200.

845
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,780
Look, it's rising up quickly!

846
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,980
We're almost catching up to Cloud Live!

847
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,400
-Hurry, Mr Duan! Mr Duan!
-Come!

848
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,940
We have the fuse.

849
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,000
The extinguisher stinks.

850
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,950
-Let me do it!
-Give me pliers.

851
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,740
We're changing the fuse.

852
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,680
Can you do it?

853
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,980
He is a very important staff
of our company.

854
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,370
He is, yes. He is helping...

855
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,930
[He's changing the fuse. Can you do it?]

856
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,960
[This is a professional staff of ours.]

857
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,130
[-They're fixing the fuse...]
-It's just a fuse break.

858
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,330
Making it look like there's a huge fire.

859
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,720
Chen Lang, their popularity
is rising quickly.

860
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,350
Done!

861
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,330
Is this okay?

862
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,970
-Give me the pliers!
-Here.

863
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,990
Here it is.

864
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,220
This is our professional technician.

865
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,930
Now is the most crucial time.

866
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,890
The electricity is back!

867
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,080
Resume the streams!

868
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,140
Yes, I'm going now!

869
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,130
-Wait for me!
-Babies, we can resume now.

870
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,800
So handsome! So cool!

871
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,580
Our technician is too cool!

872
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,970
Too professional!

873
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,430
Duan Ran, how are you so great?

874
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,890
He's so cool that he ignored me.

875
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,050
That is...

876
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,660
Thanks to all the babies

877
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,540
who witnessed this great moment with us.

878
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,570
[Now that we fixed the main switch,]

879
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,700
[we'll resume our stream right away.]

880
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,870
[Later, babies!]

881
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,740
Adjust it for me.

882
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,310
Now we'll resume our live stream.

883
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,830
I forgot where I left off.

884
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,040
This is a piece of jacket
that I really love.

885
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,400
It has a different design.

886
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,710
We don't have much time left

887
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,890
till the end of the special live stream.
