00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,730
I'm thinking of asking him to
give you some pointers

505
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,180
to ensure we can do our best
on Singles' Day.

506
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,690
I did some research too.

507
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,630
The peaks sales volume on Singles' Day

508

is not right now.

509

It'll be tomorrow afternoon.

510
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,650
Ms Ouyang, you're really a workaholic.

511
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,690
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

512
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,480
[Ouyang asked me here]

513

[to evaluate you based on
an artiste's standard.]

514

According to your different styles,

515
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,520
I'll point out your speciality.

516
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,280
Jia Yun, you're the ace in Rui Live.

517
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,530
You must remind yourself that
you're the trump and genie.

518
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,720
You're the princess.

Mr Five.

520
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,540
You have an androgynous look.

521
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,400
But it doesn't mean you have
to be serious all the time.

522
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,450
You must learn to

523
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
manage your expressions, alright?

524
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,600
Okay, back to the topic.

525
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,350
Duan Ran, come here.

526
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,820
What are you looking at?

527
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,800
Who's this Mr Li?

528
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,270
He's a new trainer hired by Ouyang.

529
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,090
It's okay to have high standards.

530
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,690
If not, how will you stand out

531
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,380
from so many broadcasters, right?

532
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,070
We'll speak fairly.

533
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,780
Since Ouyang came,

534
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,720
she brought Rui Live

535
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,680
plenty of new blood and energy.

536
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,310
I only have you in my mind.

537

-I'm yours.
-Only I can endure you.

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,570
The lady killer in live broadcasts?

542
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,020
What lady killer?

543
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,750
Perfect boyfriend.

to go live everyday.

I'm really busy.

They must have bad eyesight.

547

You have good eyesight.

548
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,510

for their snacks.

with Jiang Zhe Yang.

840
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,440
That's old school.

841
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,950
Stop humming this song.

842
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,430
We always leave together after a schedule.

843
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,890
Now you're sending me off.

844
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,050
What to do?

845
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,550
I was your manager before.

846
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,740
We're now collaborative partners, right?

847
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,990
You're now Party A and I'm Party B.

848
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,720
I have to please you instead.

849
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,810
What are you talking about?

850
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,310
Look at our relationship.

851
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,860
But I think

852
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,850
I feel comfortable now.

853
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,600
Comfortable because I'm not
managing you anymore?

854
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,770
No way! I'm counting on you
to help me, Sister.

855
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,020
You must be exhausted after this.

856
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,520
Yes, I'm tired.

857
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,130
But I really like the working
ambience in the company.

858
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,080
Everyone is united and working as one.

859
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,620
It's nice.

860
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,780
So what's your plan?

861
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,200
Will you establish your own brand?

862
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,530
Of course I will.

863
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,140
What about Qian Xi Xi?

864
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,900
I'll woo her.

865
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,830
I'll woo her!

866
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,860
Sure.

867
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,370
I'll go now.

868
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,550
Leaving? Be careful.

869
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,100
Take care.

870
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,030
Remember our last time at the seaside?

871
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,440
It's that time.

872
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,770
Chen Lang took drastic measures

873
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,860
and emptied out the company.

874
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,690
We had no one then.

875
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,510
No broadcasters, no products,

876
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,170
no supply chains and equipment.

877
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,670
We had nothing.

878
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,970
You took me to a big coastal rock,

879
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,120
held my hand

880
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,840
and told me to save the world.

881
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,190
It's that time, right?

882
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,970
It's depressing to think back.

883
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,570
We forgot how we overcame it.

884
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,710
There's no road in the world.

885
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,570
We'll create our own paths while we walk.

886
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,960
Did you know why I agreed

887
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,550
to save Rui Live with you?

888
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,570
Because I persuaded you.

889
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,340
I said, Duan Ran, don't
forget your ambition.

890
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,610
Don't forget your talent and dreams.

891
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,850
Rui Live is the only way to fulfil them.

892
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,700
It's because you told me that

893
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,900
Rui Live is like your child.

894
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,730
You watched it grow up everyday.

895
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,150
You can't bear to leave it.

896
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,990
So I thought to myself.

897
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,930
No matter how hard I'll try and

898
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,560
how great the price I'll pay,

899
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,470
I have to resurrect Rui Live with you.

900
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,690
Thank you, Duan Ran.

901
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,680
I should thank you.

902
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,440
For presenting such a

903
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,860
nice present to me.

904
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,810
I'm thinking about

905
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,340
managing Rui Live well and
excel in this industry.

906
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,500
It's not just to prove myself.

907
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,120
I think this industry

908
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,100
is like the new rising sun.

909
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,080
It's brilliant and glorious.

910
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,500
It can bring convenience to every family.

911
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,460
I made an oath before to resurrect

912
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,720
Rui Live for sure in half year's time.

913
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,800
We did it now, right?

914
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,930
Are you tired?

915
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,780
I'm suddenly feeling sleepy.

916
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,270
I'll give you a hug.

917
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:30,200
[Cloud Live]

918
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,300
Cola.

919
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,520
Though we didn't defeat Rui Live

920
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,440
in the Singles' Day sale,

921
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,250
alas we achieved good results.

922
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,500
But why is Mr Chen still upset?

923
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,820
Mr Chen thought that he could win.

924
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,930
But he lost.

925
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,220
Isn't earning money the most
important thing for a company?

926
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,860
Why should they fight to their deaths?

927
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,460
To someone like him who never
won anything since birth,

928
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,790
it's really important.

929
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,620
Never mind, let it be.

930
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,570
We're finally the head broadcasters now.

931
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,270
Shouldn't we celebrate right now with beer

932
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,320
and barbecue?

933
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,300
No way, I'm meeting my personal trainer.

934
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,450
Let's do it another day.

935
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,470
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go.
