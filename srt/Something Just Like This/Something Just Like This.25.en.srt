[Episode 25]

4
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,450
Have you seen Su Su today?

5
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,640
No.

6
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,450
Have you heard?

7
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,660
-What?
-Perfect Blue's liquid foundation fiasco.

8
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,760
Yes.

9
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,210
I heard.

10
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,360
I just bought it and haven't used it yet.

11
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,490
The company has made a clarification.

12
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,680
Now only one company

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,560
has problems with its products.

14
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,560
Where are you, Su Su?

15
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,370
I'm going to Taizhou.

16
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,710
I'm on the bus now.

17
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,740
You're really going there.

18
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,940
I didn't expect it.

19
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,700
Have you informed Mr Duan?

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,560
I've applied for a leave.

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,640
[He approved it.]

22
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,910

[Not until tomorrow morning.]

24
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,320
Be safe, Su Su.

25
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,880
Stay safe.

26
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,710
[Take care of your
belongings while on the bus.]

27
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,259
Got it.

28
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,300
Don't blame yourself, Yu Shi.

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,160
I can take care of myself.

30
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,650
I'm ending the call, bye.

[a business strategy to
resolve Rui's challenges.]

41
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,390
[I can't retain talent or close deals.]

42
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,940
[Plus, I'm short-sighted and unpopular.]

[Because of my incompetence,]

47
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,329
[I dragged us down.]

[Do you really think I'm suitable?]

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,800
This old house

50
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,270
holds memories that I
don't want to relive.

51
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,829
But for some reason,

52
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
whenever I'm down,

53
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,790
I'd take refuge here.

54
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,630
Xi Xi, I really hope you'd see me

55
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,680
as your refuge to some degree.

56
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,440
Duan Ran.

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,470
Why do you like me?

58
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,310
I don't know why.

59
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,630
I just feel that I'm not worth it.

60
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,070
Do you remember

61
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,120
when we were young,

62
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,520
Uncle Li’s daughter

63
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,350
wore a nice pink princess
dress at her birthday party.

64
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,770
I just loved it.

65
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,430
I just kept staring at it.

66
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,540
Aunt Zhou came over and asked me.

67
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,690
Do you like it, Xi Xi?

68
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,720
I'll buy it for you if you like it.

69
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,620
Guess what I said at that time.

70
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,000
You said you don't like pink.

71
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,190
Is that right?

72
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,250
You remember it.

73
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,750
Of course I remember.

74
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,300
I loved that princess dress so much.

75
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,750
I just didn't think I deserved it.

76
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,960
I...

77
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,310
I'm just so awkward.

78
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,840
Xi Xi.

79
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,440
In my heart,

80
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,810
there's not a thing that
you're unworthy of.

81
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,080
Only things that are unworthy of you.

82
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,550
Got it?

83
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,290
After all, you're worthy of me,
aren't you?

84
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,390
Can't you stop bragging about yourself?

85
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,240
Don't you like me this way?

86
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,350
I really don't know what I want.

87
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,480
I don't even know what
things I could do well.

88
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,470
I couldn't do well
when I was a streamer.

89
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,210
When I got to be the CEO,

90
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,930
I knew I was not up to it.

91
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,560
I just wouldn't give up.

92
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,430
There was always a voice telling me.

93
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,960
Qian Xi Xi.

94
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,120
You have to work hard, you have
to persist, you have to keep it up.

95
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,750
You have to prove yourself.

96
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,850
There's no other way
except relying on yourself.

97
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,300
But now,

98
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,430
everything is ruined.

99
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,630
This proves that I can't do things right.

100
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,120
It didn't matter how hard I tried.

101
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,840
Don't be silly.

102
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,350
Xi Xi.

103
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,630
Let me tell you.

104
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,000
Every time you feel inferior,

105
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,530
I feel terrible.

106
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,150
I feel guilty

107
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,040
for not doing my part well enough

108
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,550
and making you feel this way.

109
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,460
Actually, you're a fine person.

110
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,530
You just don't know it.

111
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,470
You didn't know how much I like you.

112
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,960
I like you more than you like yourself.

113
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,030
You know that?

114
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,510
Duan Ran.

115
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,520
I'm just grateful.

116
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,250
Because you like me.

117
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,190
It makes me feel great.

118
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,120
I hope no matter what I do.

119
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,590
You can support me.

120
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,299
What are you doing?

121
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,870
Okay, stop crying.

122
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,510
Let me hug you a little longer.

123
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,210
Heads or tails?

124
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,210
Heads or tails?

125
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,320
Heads or tails?

126
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,870
Heads or tails?

127
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,540
Heads or tails?

128
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,670
This doesn't count.

129
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,750
I touched it with my hand.

130
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,160
One last time.

131
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,280
Heads or tails?

132
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,790
Heads, go. Tails, no go.

133
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,360
This is the last time.

134
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,940
This doesn't count.

135
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,440
This doesn't count. I dropped it.

136
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,320
One last time. Tails, I'm going.

137
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,560
Heads, go. Tails, no go.

138
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,040
Tails, I'm going.

139
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,180
Why is everyone here?

140
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,210
You've nothing to do?

141
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,910
Stop loafing there.

142
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,260
We're in dire straits.

143
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,320
Just get moving.

144
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,510
Get down to work.

145
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,440
We wanted to work.

146
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,010
Can't do it without products.

147
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,280
Nothing we can do now.

148
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,780
No products?

149
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,510
That's impossible.

150
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,040
Aren't there some Perfect Blue products?

151
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,970
The Fall Specials

152
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,410
has eight more brands.

153
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,800
Don't we have these?

154
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,290
Xi Xi, forget about promoting Perfect Blue

155
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,920
products on live streams.

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,930
Even the mere utterance of its name

157
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,570
is enough to rile up the fans
and make them unfollow us.

158
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,870
We just can't do it.

159
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,720
She's right.

160
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,420
I won't even buy from myself.

161
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,320
You can't do cosmetics,

162
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,870
what about clothes?

163
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,990
This morning,

164
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,670
among the Fall Specials brands,

165
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,520
three have left us.

166
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,360
The remaining five don't
seem to be keen, either.

167
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,040
Pineapple Xpress has contacted us.

168
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,860
If we can't resolve the
matter on Perfect Blue,

169
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,990
they're going to stop working with us.

170
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,060
The head office wants those causing

171
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,920
this mess to be held responsible.

172
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,230
Yu Shi and Su Su.

173
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,870
They'll be fine.

174
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,920
Listen here.

175
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,400
We'll temporarily stop doing
all Perfect Blue products.

176
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,300
The live streams will go on as usual.

177
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
We'll do the remaining five brands.

178
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,540
Don't worry. I'll handle the other stuff.

179
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,550
Xi Xi.

180
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,750
We've received a letter from the SAIC.

181
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,790
The SAIC?

182
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,170
A reparation proposal by the SAIC.

183
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,670
I'll read it for you.

184
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,470
First, we can't sell unregulated products.

185
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,720
Second, we have to give
all customers a refund.

186
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,970
Third,

187
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,520
compensate the customers

188
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,430
for the damages incurred.

189
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,840
Hello, Uncle Duan.

190
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,870
I got it.

191
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,360
Sure.

192
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,570
Uncle Duan and Uncle Shen want to see me,

193
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,720
now.

194
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,350
We have to follow the SAIC's proposal.

195
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,430
I'm worried about them.

196
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,650
Remember how

197
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,660
Yu Shi and Su Su stood by us

198
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,280
when Chen Lang sold us out?

199
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,180
Yes.

200
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,720
Now the company is having trouble,

201
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,440
we can't let them go.

202
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,520
I understand.

203
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,180
How are we going to deal with

204
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,390
the head office?

205
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,800
[Resignation]

206
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,000
I've decided.

207
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,680
I should be held responsible

208
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,590
for this matter.

209
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,910
I engaged Fei Fei first.

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
So I should leave.

211
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,960
Su Su should stay.

212
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,110
Where are you going then?

213
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,790
To look for Su Su.

214
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,330
You should've done that.

215
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,920
That's what you need to do.

216
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,840
But Yu Shi,

217
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,230
take this back.

218
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,360
Ms Qian, someone has to take the blame,

219
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,740
else how are you going
to answer to the head office?

220
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,520
I'll deal with that.

221
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,180
You should go now.

222
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,470
Thanks.

223
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,300
Let's meet with them.

224
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,670
Xi Xi.

225
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,390
What happened?

226
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,230
Why is there talk about

227
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,210
customers growing beards after using

228
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,720
Perfect Blue's products?

229
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,670
Uncle Duan.

230
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,280
I've been telling the press

231
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,400
that this has nothing to do with us.

232
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,960
The Perfect Blue product is defective.

233
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,170
We still can't be sure

234
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,520
about the cause.

235
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,870
Maybe

236
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,950
it's the hormones inside
the perfect Blue product.

237
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,070
Maybe there's something
wrong with the logistics.

238
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,730
Or maybe

239
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,360
it was just an act by the girl.

240
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,670
There are various possibilities.

241
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,970
What I can do is just to
continue investigating it.

242
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,520
I'll issue a statement

243
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,110
to clarify the matter
to all our customers.

244
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,750
I just heard

245
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,440
the SAIC

246
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,790
has given us their reparation proposal.

247
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,230
There's nothing much we can do.

248
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,220
I understand, Mr Duan.

249
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,160
Since it's already happened,

250
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,180
it's meaningless to say
or do anything.

251
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,920
The purpose of me coming here

252
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,350
to see you

253
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,420
is not to give you any explanation.

254
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,560
From this incident,

255
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,560
we realised

256
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,280
there are huge problems in the company.

257
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,920
Shoddy management.

258
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,080
Poor quality control.

259
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
Even in the face of this disaster,

260
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,850
we don't have a PR team

261
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,110
to deal with it.

262
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,890
All these have nothing to do with anyone

263
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,100
except me, the CEO.

264
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,790
The reason I'm here today

265
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,540
is to take the blame
and tender my resignation.

266
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,070
Xi Xi.

267
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,480
Now Rui is in a precarious condition

268
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,280
and hanging by a thread.

269
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,480
If you resign,

270
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,160
then you'll be the last straw
that breaks the camel's back.

271
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,880
Uncle Shen.

272
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,670
You think too highly of me.

273
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,310
I don't deserve it.

274
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,380
I'm not indispensable.

275
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,190
If you ask me

276
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,810
what the benefit
of a flat organisation is,

277
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,960
I'd say nobody in Rui is dispensable.

278
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,510
Uncle Shen, Dad,

279
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,170
give us some time.

280
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,720
I'll talk to Xi Xi.

281
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,710
Xi Xi, you need to be clear.

282
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,730
Assuming the role of CEO

283
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,360
and resigning from it

284
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,790
are no laughing matters.

285
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,940
That's my final decision, Uncle Duan.

286
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,790
Rest assured,

287
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,780
I'll be responsible for it.

288
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,840
Let's have a talk.

289
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,880
Xi Xi.

290
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,620
You're sacrificing yourself
for Yu Shi and Su Su.

291
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,290
You just don't get it, do you?

292
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,450
I'm the CEO.

293
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,940
The matter can only
be resolved if I resign.

294
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,230
Do you think this is a game?

295
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,480
Do you think you can just leave?

296
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,570
What are we supposed to do if you leave?

297
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,670
Have you thought about the staff?

298
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,530
You promised my dad you'd make
the company great.

299
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,960
But now you're coping out
at the first sign of trouble.

300
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,460
Can't handle failure?

301
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,550
Can you just shut it?

302
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,900
You thought I haven't considered it?

303
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,360
I've thought about it all.

304
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,910
I'm very calm and sensible now.

305
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,200
I fought for the post of CEO

306
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,150
because I wanted to vent my anger.

307
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,650
But I knew very well

308
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,000
that you were better.

309
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,880
You have a better mindset

310
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,120
and vision, so why can't you

311
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,290
be the CEO?

312
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,840
Don't even think about it.

313
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,200
I just won't do it.

314
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,120
Why not?

315
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,600
Now you're my boyfriend.

316
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,170
Nobody is a better candidate

317
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,290
for CEO than you.

318
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,360
Why can't you be the CEO?

319
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,490
You even promised me

320
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,620
that you'll support me no matter what.

321
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,430
Xi Xi.

322
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,630
Be brave.

323
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,570
Don't be afraid of failure and challenges.

324
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,570
I'll always be by your side.

325
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,840
We'll get through it.

326
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,190
What are you afraid of?

327
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,510
Duan Ran, you're right.

328
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,150
I'm just scared.

329
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,780
I'm scared of failure.

330
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,070
So I don’t deserve to be the CEO.

331
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
Now the company is in trouble.

332
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,350
I just can't do anything.

333
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,450
So I don't deserve it, do you understand?

334
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,960
-You can.
-I can't.

335
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,770
Can't you see the truth?

336
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,640
I'm just helpless.

337
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,420
Then there's Su Su and Yu Shi.

338
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,750
I don't want them to go.
Do you understand?

339
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,000
Qian Xi Xi.

340
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,860
Do you know that you're
just giving up on yourself?

341
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,550
This won't solve the problem.

342
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,190
Qian Xi Xi.

343
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,600
Hello, I'm looking for Zhang Si.

344
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,910
No such person.

345
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,500
Wait.

346
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,460
Is this Cuihua Estate?

347
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,640
Yes.

348
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,390
Isn't this unit 603?

349
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,540
The person could be the
guy who lived here before.

350
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,960
I just moved in recently.

351
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,000
Do you know where he's moved?

352
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,880
No idea.

353
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,050
But I heard he's working nearby.

354
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,470
He may not live too far.

355
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,810
Thanks.

356
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,990
It's okay.

357
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,470
The battery's dead.

358
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,880
Forget it.

359
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,360
I can't let this trip go to waste.

360
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,690
Excuse me.

361
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,720
Do you know

362
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,530
the whereabouts of Zhang Si

363
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,420
who lived upstairs previously?

364
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,070
Thanks.

365
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,410
Hello, I just want to know

366
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,760
if you know a guy by the name of Zhang Si?

367
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,640
No.

368
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,960
Thanks.

369
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,150
It's nothing.

370
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,910
Hello, boys.

371
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,140
Do you know a guy by the name of Zhang Si?

372
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,390
No.

373
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,770
I must be crazy.

374
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,460
How would kids know about it?

375
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,880
Mister.

376
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,690
Do you know

377
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,170
a guy by the name of Zhang Si?

378
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,360
Zhang Si?

379
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,930
You mean the guy who lived
here previously?

380
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,150
Yes.

381
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,550
He's moved away.

382
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,430
Where did he move to?

383
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,910
Turn right at the intersection up front.

384
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,050
Look to the left along the road.

385
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,600
There's a public library.

386
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,040
His house is at the
bottom of the staircase

387
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,470
next to the library.

388
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,750
Thanks so much.

389
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,160
Hello, miss.

390
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,470
I need your help.

391
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,600
Have you seen this girl?

392
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,720
I don't think so.

393
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,880
-No.
-Thanks.

394
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,060
It's okay.

395
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,810
Hello, mister.

396
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,390
-Hello.
-I just need your help.

397
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,020
I'm looking for a person.

398
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,360
I'm looking for her.

399
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,350
Have you seen her?

400
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,470
Zhang Si.

401
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,640
Zhang Si.

402
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,180
What do you want?

403
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,240
Hello, mister.

404
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,660
Does Zhang Si live here?

405
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,670
Does Zhang Si live here?

406
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,930
He lives here.

407
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,720
When will he come back?

408
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,230
He's working.

409
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,020
He'll be back in a while.

410
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,360
Just in a while.

411
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,880
Thanks, mister.

412
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,400
You're welcome.

413
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,590
Your voice sure is loud, miss.

414
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,180
Finally found him.

415
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,240
Dad.

416
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,930
Let's have a chat.

417
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,120
Sure.

418
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,270
Is it about Xi Xi's suspension

419
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,030
from her duties as CEO?

420
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,650
This is a collective
decision by the head office.

421
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,840
Dad.

422
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,300
The fault

423
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,360
definitely lies
with Perfect Blue's products.

424
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,380
Perfect Blue's Mr Mu is shirking

425
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,540
his responsibility and blaming us.

426
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,390
He's so unscrupulous.

427
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,660
Although we're not out of the woods,

428
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,450
I've discovered that

429
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,640
someone must be fanning the flames

430
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,720
through the media.

431
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,600
Their motive

432
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,950
is to destroy Rui.

433
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,620
Aren't we playing into their hands

434
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,790
by removing Xi Xi

435
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,270
from her position as CEO?

436
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,220
On the surface, it seems like

437
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,950
a product defect issue.

438
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,880
Of course, there's also
poor after-sales service.

439
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,690
We could have fixed

440
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,440
our weaknesses to prevent
this from happening.

441
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,760
The SAIC is demanding reparation.

442
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,360
Xi Xi, being the CEO,

443
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,710
is responsible.

444
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,270
Xi Xi should be given a chance

445
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,360
to resolve the matter.

446
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,310
And she would be if things

447
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,790
hadn't gotten this bad.

448
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,350
But now it's too late.

449
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,050
Tomorrow, Uncle Shen will be at Rui

450
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,760
to appoint an interim CEO.

451
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,310
Get ready

452
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,960
to take over from Xi Xi.

453
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,840
No, Dad.

454
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,600
I can't do this.

455
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,840
Why?

456
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,430
You should know Xi Xi well.

457
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,350
She may look tough

458
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,240
and ever-cheerful.

459
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:13,480
Deep down, she's actually
very sensitive and fragile.

460
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,080
When she was the CEO,

461
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,670
she wanted to prove
her ability to everyone.

462
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,080
Now she's resigned.

463
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,250
We're in dire straits.

464
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,230
If I replace her as the CEO,

465
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,960
it'll hurt her

466
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,170
deeply.

467
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,670
-We can't do this.
-You're being emotional.

468
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,540
Rui is in trouble.

469
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,060
Someone has to stand up and lead.

470
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,660
You understand Rui's business,
and you have passion.

471
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,770
At this moment,

472
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,280
you're the best person

473
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,120
to lead the company.

474
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,650
I understand.

475
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,150
From the company's perspective,

476
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,750
it's only reasonable.

477
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,880
But from me and

478
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,700
my conscience's perspective,

479
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,080
I just can't do it.

480
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,270
I can't do this to her.

481
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,840
As a leader,

482
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,550
you can't be too emotional.

483
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,380
That's just outdated management dogma.

484
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,010
Xi Xi doesn't know much about
management and leadership.

485
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,190
But she's able to keep
the company in order.

486
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,720
Rui is full of soul because of her.

487
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,930
Everyone has a sense of mission.

488
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,790
Only she can do this.

489
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,270
I'm unable to replace her.

490
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,550
Just think about it.

491
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,880
You are here.

492
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,000
Luckily you gave me a call.

493
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,290
I couldn't wait to get out of the gym.

494
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,310
I made an excuse to come out.

495
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,810
If Ms Ouyang knew,

496
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,270
I'd be dead.

497
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,310
Jiang Zhe Yang.

498
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,110
You've been working hard.

499
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,180
What if you fail to get the part?

500
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,040
I've worked hard anyway.

501
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,390
The rest is fate, right?

502
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,750
I know I've done my best.

503
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,380
Hey,

504
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,550
how's your company right now?

505
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,180
I've just resigned.

506
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,310
Anyway, I'm unemployed now.

507
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,190
It's that serious?

508
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,580
It's actually not that bad.

509
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,480
I finally have time to myself

510
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,640
to sit back and relax.

511
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,570
Fine.

512
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,360
If you need my help,

513
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,720
feel free to ask.

514
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,080
Please.

515
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,260
You're a big celebrity.

516
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,170
How could I?

517
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,660
Thanks for your concern.

518
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,690
Is this how you should
celebrate your resignation?

519
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,260
Without any companions?

520
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,000
I've done the right thing asking you out.

521
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,170
It's crunch time now.

522
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,260
Everyone is busy.

523
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,720
Only I am idle.

524
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,080
I can only come for coffee.

525
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,840
I also want to be like you today.

526
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,310
Since you're now unemployed,

527
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,510
what do you want to do today?

528
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,840
It's really unnecessary.

529
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,750
Actually, I came to meet you today

530
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,120
to thank you in person.

531
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,190
I'm serious.

532
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,480
We've been lucky to have you

533
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,910
and Ms Ouyang's help.

534
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,950
Then there's the handover.

535
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,530
Duan Ran will replace me

536
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,120
as Rui Live's CEO.

537
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,270
I'd like to apologise

538
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,760
for implicating you in
the Perfect Blue incident.

539
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,920
Though I suppose after this fiasco,

540
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,290
you wouldn't be working with us.

541
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,910
You've resigned.
Stop talking about work.

542
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,720
There's no need to apologise.

543
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,400
We have the final say

544
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,000
in the endorsement deal,

545
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,190
don't we?

546
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,930
Rui only played

547
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,030
the role of a middleman.

548
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,960
-Isn't that right?
-Really?

549
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,050
Okay.

550
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,140
Let's not talk about work today.

551
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,430
Let's do something relaxing.

552
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,990
I'm not in the mood.

553
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,880
I insist.

554
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,380
I'll make the call.

555
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,650
Do you think it's okay to do so?

556
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,660
Yes.

557
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,170
-Let's go.
-Where to?

558
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,360
Just follow me.

559
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm starving.

560
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,880
When will you be back, Zhang Si?

561
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,110
Yu Shi?

562
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,640
Yu Shi!

563
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,070
It's delicious.

564
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,150
How did you know I like Meko Fruit Tea?

565
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,180
Don't underestimate me.

566
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,050
I'll have you know

567
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,020
I bought out the entire mall.

568
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,270
You're the best.

569
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,810
Are you hungry? I've got some bread.

570
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,000
Try this.

571
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,650
I know you're hungry.

572
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,330
Here you go.

573
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,600
Why are you here?

574
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,780
What do you think?

575
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,180
You're getting too bold now.

576
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,780
A helpless girl like you,

577
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,800
coming to a strange place like this,

578
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,050
looking for a stranger.

579
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,900
Don't you know it's dangerous?

580
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,430
Come on, I know how
to take care of myself.

581
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,170
Aren't you afraid?

582
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,360
Aren't you?

583
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,530
What if Zhang Si suddenly shows up

584
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,800
and drags you inside?

585
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,110
How can you resist?

586
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,070
Just cut it out.

587
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,120
Let's play a game.

588
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,550
You're scared, aren't you?

589
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,420
Trying to distract yourself
with a game, are you?

590
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,600
Then forget it.

591
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,989
What game do you want to play?

592
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,639
Ever heard of "one-two-three-three"?

593
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,199
What game is that?

594
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,520
Like this.

595
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,370
Who doesn't know that?

596
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,440
I'll win.

597
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,920
I'm sure.

598
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,710
You lose.

599
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,800
What's that?

600
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,000
You're cheating.

601
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,190
Stop cheating.

602
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,600
This is cheating.

603
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,900
I wonder when Zhang Si will be back?

604
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,360
It's been a day.

605
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,790
He's still not back yet.

606
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,300
♫ Chasing unfinished
dreams, even if I fall down ♫

607
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,020
♫ Time never goes back ♫

608
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,290
♫ Stubborn but comforting ♫

609
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,270
♫ Right beside you ♫

610
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,330
♫ Following closely like a shadow ♫

611
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,120
That was beautiful.

612
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,260
You should've heard me
before I made it big.

613
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,270
When I was a trainee,

614
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,440
I used to hole up in the studio

615
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,250
and practise for the whole day.

616
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,880
I was tired and lonely.

617
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,780
I don't miss it.

618
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,540
I know how you feel.

619
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,760
When I started out as a streamer,

620
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,960
I would be alone in the streaming room

621
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,200
facing only a handful of fans.

622
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,550
The loneliness was unbearable.

623
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,840
Is it more tiring

624
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,370
to be a streamer

625
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,200
or a CEO?

626
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,350
Being a streamer is a solo act.

627
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,540
But as a CEO, you're stretched
on all sides.

628
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,200
There are too many things
to think about.

629
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,090
Actually, it's not easy

630
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,440
to do everything well.

631
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,660
Look.

632
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,670
Look at all the people fishing.

633
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,040
Look over there.

634
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,480
The lights on the bridge

635
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,970
and the lights on the boat
are so beautiful.

636
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,760
Yes indeed.

637
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,220
These lights will eventually

638
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,640
be turned off at night.

639
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,460
Just like streamers.

640
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,330
In truth, a streamer can only work

641
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,740
for so many years.

642
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,700
From a rookie to the top performer,

643
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,720
an enormous effort is required

644
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,560
for growth and breakthrough.

645
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,880
I had no idea

646
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,290
how tough I had to be

647
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,360
in order to survive the journey.

648
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,110
Xi Xi.

649
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,880
You're amazing.

650
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,350
Really?

651
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,510
Miss, isn't this something?

652
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,720
What do you think?

653
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,120
Are you thirsty?

654
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,400
I'll open it for you.

655
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,880
You even know my favourite
drink is Peach and Pink Grapefruit.

656
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,270
Look,

657
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:56,700
I got you your favourite food and drink.

658
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,450
Aren't you going to let
me in on some information?

659
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,310
Tell me where she went.

660
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,160
You've angered her,

661
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,790
and you expect me to sell out
my sworn sister

662
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,700
for a little supper?

663
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,160
I couldn't find her anywhere.

664
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,970
She didn't even answer my call.

665
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,080
I'm anxious.

666
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,640
Now you know.

667
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,990
Why were you mad at her?

668
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,150
I...

669
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,440
I was wrong, okay?

670
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,080
Tell me where she is.

671
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,880
She's with Jiang Zhe Yang.

672
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,280
What?

673
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,840
She's with Jiang Zhe Yang.

674
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,230
She's with Jiang Zhe Yang?

675
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,950
She's with Jiang Zhe Yang?

676
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,130
She came here just now.

677
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,980
Then Jiang Zhe Yang called her.

678
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,130
As you know, he is our company's

679
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,000
main breadwinner.

680
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,080
So they went out for a talk.

681
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,330
Isn't it night time now?

682
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,370
Is there a need

683
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,160
to talk at this time?

684
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,770
What's there to talk about?

685
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,140
Isn't it time to come home?

686
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,240
Isn't it late now?

687
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,860
Don't they know the time now?

688
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,110
Can't she talk to me?

689
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,960
Are you both together?

690
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,070
No.

691
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,960
So what's the big deal?

692
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,610
They're both singles.

693
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,330
What's wrong with a meetup

694
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,520
or even a date?

695
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,130
A date?

696
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,920
They have nothing in common.

697
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,140
You must be kidding.

698
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,460
Since when are you two together?

699
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,670
We are not.

700
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,850
It can't be more than a month.

701
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,620
Otherwise, I would have known it

702
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,990
from her expression.

703
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,940
Who made the first move?

704
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,570
Since she's so proud and awkward,

705
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,920
it must be you who confessed to her?

706
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,200
I didn't confess.

707
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,240
How did you do it?

708
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,440
Just tell me.

709
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,710
Let's see.

710
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,130
Yes, that's the expression.

711
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,010
You were blushing, weren't you?

712
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,630
I didn't blush.

713
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,680
What did you say?

714
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,770
Let me analyse it for you.

715
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,120
I didn't say anything. I didn't confess.

716
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,750
What was her response?

717
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,200
Stop asking.

718
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,090
-She...
-Just stop.

719
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,180
-She won't like it.
-Confessed together?

720
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,400
I'm sure you made the confession first.

721
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,770
Eat this and shut up.

722
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,230
You said too much.

723
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,140
Look at that.

724
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,420
The waterfall looks fun.

725
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,490
-Yes, I noticed.
-There's a smiley face.

726
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,840
Happy Children's Day,

727
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,030
little kid.

728
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,750
You're a little kid.

729
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,670
[JUKEBOX]

730
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,040
That guy sure looks like you.

731
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,870
-Who's that?
-That's me.

732
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:45,350
["Dui Dao", Jiang Zhe Yang]

733
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,030
It really is you.

734
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,530
"Dui Diao".

735
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,550
What a weird name.

736
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,280
That's "Dui Dao" to you.

737
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,150
-Dui Diao?
-Dui Dao!

738
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,310
Let me be honest.

739
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,640
The photo is overdone.

740
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,850
You look better in person.

741
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,090
Really? Then I'll ask them

742
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,820
to change the poster tomorrow.

743
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,440
It's not necessary.

744
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,390
The edited photo is not bad at all.

745
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,680
We're ex-classmates,

746
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,470
yet I've never listened
to any of your albums.

747
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,440
Would you like to?

748
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,990
Sure.

749
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,520
Wait.

750
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,100
What are you trying to find?

751
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,480
This is the key to the shop.

752
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,290
A buddy of mine owns this bar.

753
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,230
He hides the key here.

754
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:28,910
Here.

755
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,460
Back up.

756
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,890
It isn't a good idea

757
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,400
to just sneak in, is it?

758
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,680
It's no big deal.

759
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,160
We're not thieves.

760
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,530
Are you a thief?

761
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,570
Neither am I.

762
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,990
It's all right, come on.

763
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,270
It's my buddy.

764
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,950
After you.

765
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,070
My first time breaking into a bar.

766
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,960
There are so many vinyl records here.

767
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,960
You said it. This floor is the bar.

768
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,880
The second floor is where
you listen to records.

769
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,950
Come with me.

770
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,270
Do you see that?

771
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,400
So many albums?

772
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,590
Yes.

773
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,160
Is this yours?

774
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,880
-Yes.
-It's "Dui Diao".

775
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,020
No. This is "Zhe", another album.

776
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,980
You've released so many albums.

777
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,080
Yes.

778
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,790
Jia Yun.

779
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,090
Why aren't you surprised at all

780
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,790
with Xi Xi and I?

781
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,900
I've been rooting for you two

782
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,780
since way back in university.

783
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,370
All these years,

784
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,160
I've been fantasizing about

785
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,580
you two being together.

786
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,150
Now my dream has finally come true.

787
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,400
"Back in university"?

788
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,940
Back in university.

789
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,400
So you're saying, even back then,

790
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,050
she's had a crush on me?

791
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,950
You must do better than just
buying me a nice meal.

792
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,330
This is nothing.

793
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,530
Whatever you want,

794
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,270
just name it and you'll have it.

795
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,790
But you have to answer me.
