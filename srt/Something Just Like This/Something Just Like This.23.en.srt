4
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,030
The costs of keeping the
existing brands are much lower

5
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,560
than acquiring new brands.

6
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,940
Thanks for your effort.

7
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,180
That's all for today.

8
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,350
Everyone, get back to work.

9
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,900
Let's go.

10
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,200
Everyone trusts Duan Ran more.

11
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,470
Both of you have
different responsibilities.

12
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,200
Duan Ran handles the matters that
affect their benefits directly.

13
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,979
Jia Yun.

14
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,180
I'm starting to doubt my abilities.

15
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,800
Professionally, I can't stream
as well as you and Yuan Yuan.

16
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,670
As for management skills,
you've seen it yourself.

17
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,750
I can't retain anyone or close any deals.

18
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,950
I'm short-sighted and no one trusts me.

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,060
What's wrong with me?

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,380
A regular undergraduate like me

21
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,900
is trying to compete with
a Cambridge graduate

22
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,370
for the position of CEO.

23
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,010
Qian Xi Xi.

24
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,980
Do not forget.

25
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,170
You were chosen as the CEO

26
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,100
by both the chief executives of QE.

27
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,700
Have some faith in yourself.

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,550
Alright, I'm getting back to work.

29
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,370
Qian Xi Xi.

30
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,340
Stand right here.

31
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,390
Why did you do that this morning?

32
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,010
Why did you drive off
without waiting for me?

33
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,950
You said I occupied something
that didn't belong to me,

34
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,130
so I occupied your car.

35
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,370
I need to go.

36
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,340
It was a joke years ago,
you still remember.

37
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,350
Are you mad that Yuan Yuan left?

38
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,620
You're still young, manage your anger.

39
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,910
It will wear you down.

40
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,100
You should seize this
time to keep in touch

41
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,560
with your ex-girlfriend.

42
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,310
Hurry up and reach out to her.

43
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,450
Mr Duan, can you follow up with ex

44
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,100
on the status of the star broadcaster?

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,260
We're all waiting.

46
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,930
Is that necessary?

47
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,820
I contact her just for work.

48
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,620
That's unnecessary, alright?

49
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,180
There will be no problems.

50
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,020
If you don't believe me,

51
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,930
I'll call them.

52
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,810
-Listen to our calls.
-No.

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,890
I'm busy.

54
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,260
I have to head to QE to report to
Uncle Shen after Yuan Yuan leaves.

55
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,540
As for this matter,

56
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,100
just do your best, Mr Duan.

57
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,410
Hello, Ms Qian and Mr Duan.

58
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,650
Good morning, Ms Ouyang.

59
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,910
I brought Xiao Xiao here.

60
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,579
She's Ms Qian, the CEO.

61
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,650
Ms Qian.

62
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,370
Please excuse me.

63
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,020
I've some urgent matters to attend to.

64
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,700
It'd be Mr Duan's pleasure

65
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,520
to host the both of you.

66
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,980
I'm leaving.

67
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,420
I'll show the both of you around

68
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,620
and get to know the team. Come on.

69
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,910
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

70
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,430
The greatest feature

71
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,460
of this cream

72
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,050
is its moisturising repair power.

73
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,990
It seeps into the bottom of your skin

74
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,820
and minimises all sorts of wrinkles.

75
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,390
It rejuvenates the skin

76
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,190
and gives it a translucent glow.

77
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,180
Do you remember?

78
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,980
When you start a live stream,

79
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,159
-the goods will be here.
-Let me introduce you.

80
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,330
The famous online streamer,
Xue Xiao Xiao.

81
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,290
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello.

82
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,909
I'm sure you know who she is.

83
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,940
Yuan Yuan just left and

84
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,060
you recruited another
star of the industry.

85
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,050
That's true.

86
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,350
I met Xiao Xiao yesterday.

87
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,630
We clicked very well.

88
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,940
I brought her here
for a tour of the office.

89
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,310
We're going to discuss
our cooperation soon.

90
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,860
You're too modest, Mr Duan.

91
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,540
Well, get back to your meeting.

92
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,650
-I'll show the guest around.
-Okay, bye.

93
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,620
Let's go.

94
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,170
-Over here, please.
-Bye.

95
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,030
Next, we will proceed with the
training program for our broadcasters

96
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,960
to increase their overall skills.

97
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,990
We'd teach them how to
communicate with the audiences.

98
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,380
In the previous streaming challenge,

99
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,390
our broadcaster

100
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,850
made the top 30

101
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,980
in the Talent Chart.

102
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,280
Our daily sales exceeded ten million.

103
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,310
We achieved the preliminary target

104
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,610
of this quarter.

105
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,580
Uncle Shen,
this is the summary of the quarter.

106
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,830
Another issue is Yuan Yuan's resignation.

107
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,470
Don't worry, we're figuring something out.

108
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,870
I'll inform you once
there is any progress.

109
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,360
Xi Xi.

110
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,430
Yuan Yuan's contract termination

111
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,260
has impacted Rui Live nonetheless.

112
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,220
However, I'm glad that

113
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,540
you accepted the termination fee.

114
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,260
How did you know about that?

115
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,700
Of course I'd know.

116
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,390
You didn't want to accept it back then.

117
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,700
Duan Ran came to me

118
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,320
and wanted me to pressure you into it.

119
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,620
Yes.

120
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,780
He insisted

121
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,800
on accepting the termination fee.

122
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,210
As young people start their businesses,

123
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,170
there are some problems you'd face.

124
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,650
The balance between favours and business.

125
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,770
It's a necessary lesson.

126
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,020
That's why I had to intervene.

127
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,990
I said, if you don't
accept the termination fee,

128
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,740
I'll fire you and make

129
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,450
Duan Ran the CEO instead.

130
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,210
That is sort of a

131
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,860
small test for you guys.

132
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,170
I'm very satisfied with your performances.

133
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,020
Xi Xi.

134
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,090
Xi Xi.

135
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,200
Back then, when we chose you as the CEO,

136
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,930
we believed in your

137
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,820
abilities and judgment.

138
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,770
Thanks, Uncle Shen.
The things you told me,

139
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,910
if you didn't say anything,

140
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,260
I wouldn't have known.

141
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,630
For us,

142
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,040
you're doing your best.

143
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,050
I've to remind you.

144
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,850
During this period of time,

145
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,909
especially with regards
to Yuan Yuan's resignation,

146
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:39,290
Duan Ran is improving

147
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,820
a lot faster than you are.

148
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,860
A lot has happened
in the company recently.

149
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,100
Nevertheless,

150
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,020
I'll learn and grow from them.

151
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,260
Thanks for the reminder, Uncle Shen.

152
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,120
Just stay firm and stay
bold. Nothing will go wrong.

153
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,370
Cola, come over for some donuts.

154
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,330
Go ahead. I'm on a diet.

155
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
Have any of you seen Su Su?

156
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,070
Why are you looking for Su Su?

157
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,100
In the live stream room,

158
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,750
some viewers said the system delayed

159
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,100
when they were adding items into carts.

160
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
I wanted to find out what's going on.

161
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,410
It's nothing.

162
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,930
She's probably out for lunch.

163
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,220
She went downstairs.

164
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,070
When she returns,
I'll let her know at once.

165
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,600
I'll settle it for you guys.

166
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,100
She orders take-out usually.

167
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,740
Why did she leave for lunch?

168
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,180
I guess you guys are unaware.

169
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,720
Yesterday, when I was on the way home,

170
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,350
I saw a man

171
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,810
picking Su Su up in a BMW.

172
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,570
I think the both of them

173
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,300
are having lunch together.

174
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,330
A car picked her up?

175
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,060
A man picked her up?

176
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,130
What? Is Su Su in love?

177
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,130
How could that happen?

178
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,990
That's absolutely impossible.

179
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,430
You said she's always going on blind dates

180
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,690
and it never works out.

181
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,060
Well, I'm not sure.

182
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,690
Yesterday, I saw that

183
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,860
the both of them were very close.

184
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,560
They probably succeeded in moving forward.

185
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,020
The man was pretty good looking.

186
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,330
Wow.

187
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,810
Listen to me.

188
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,930
I found Su Su acting weird recently.

189
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,490
Quick, have a seat.

190
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,180
Did you know? She's completely

191
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,300
dazed right now.

192
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,420
She daydreams all day.

193
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,250
It seems like

194
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,420
love was in the air.

195
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,090
Being in love

196
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,150
is such a great thing.

197
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
Unlike single women like us,

198
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,010
no one wants us.

199
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,130
Yu Shi, what are you doing?

200
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,890
That's such a waste.

201
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,740
[Sorry.]

202
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,750
[The number you dialled
is currently unavailable.]

203
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,950
[Please try again later.]

204
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,810
[Sorry. The number you
dialled is currently unavailable.]

205
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,860
[Please try again later.]

206
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,860
[Sorry.]

207
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,870
[The number you dialled
is currently unavailable.]

208
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,100
[Please try again later.]

209
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,430
[Sorry, the number you
dialled is currently unavailable.]

210
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,940
Is anyone here?

211
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,500
The phone is ringing.

212
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,860
Hello, please speak.

213
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,810
[Is this Rui Live?]

214
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,180
Yes.

215
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,630
[I want to file a complaint.]

216
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,760
[Your company sells fake cosmetics.]

217
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,970
[I bought products from your broadcasters]

218
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,900
[and I grew a beard after using them.]

219
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,300
[I'm turning into a man.]

220
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,580
[You have to compensate.]

221
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,240
I understand. This is a fraud.

222
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,780
A new form of fraud, I suppose.

223
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,710
[This is not a fraud. I have proof.]

224
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,950
[If you do not believe me,]

225
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,140
[I'll send the pictures to you.]

226
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,220
That's enough.

227
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,750
You probably photoshopped it.

228
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,540
Photos are no longer credible now.

229
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,960
A beard grew on you?

230
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,120
Just shave it then.

231
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,270
I've a beard too.

232
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,570
I shave mine every day.

233
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,300
Can't you fraudsters

234
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,370
come up with

235
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,190
a more convincing excuse?

236
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,690
Who's going to believe
that you grew a beard?

237
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,350
[How could you say that to me?]

238
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,440
[You're a bully.]

239
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,810
Go ahead and cry.

240
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,990
You will not get an ounce of my sympathy.

241
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,860
Listen up, I want to cry.

242
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,980
I'm going to cry.

243
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,070
Who am I going to file a complaint to?

244
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,330
Uncle Duan.

245
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,170
The both of you are up so early.

246
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,860
Come, Xi Xi.

247
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,540
I made some soup last night.

248
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,820
It's perfect to have
them now. Have a taste.

249
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,150
It's my favourite soup.

250
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,510
Thank you, Aunt Zhou.

251
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,170
How long did you boil this for?

252
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,130
Xi Xi.

253
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,450
Why would you move back

254
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,360
to the old home all of a sudden?

255
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,450
When Duan Ran told me yesterday,

256
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,380
I was shocked.

257
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,800
The house is in a bad condition.

258
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,940
You're occupied all the time.

259
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,980
Aunt Zhou, don't worry.

260
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,900
I renovated the old house.

261
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,580
I bought new furniture as well.

262
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,180
It is comfortable to live in.

263
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,570
Xi Xi.

264
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,530
You're leaving suddenly,

265
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,450
did anything happen?

266
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,010
No matter what happens,

267
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,630
you've to tell Aunt Zhou and I.

268
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,380
We're worried.

269
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,530
Nothing is happening.

270
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,250
Well, my close friend, Zhang Jia Yun,

271
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,400
you know who she is.

272
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,380
She's looking for a new place

273
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,450
to move into.

274
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,360
She couldn't find a place
so I allowed her to stay.

275
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,220
I'm grown up now and
I need to be independent.

276
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,880
We can take care of each other.

277
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,690
Xi Xi.

278
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,420
Uncle Duan and I watched you grow up.

279
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,620
You're like a daughter to me.

280
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,530
Look at you.

281
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,810
Don't be like this. I'm sad too.

282
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,500
I'm worried about you.

283
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,690
I know.

284
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,810
I...

285
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,940
Aunt Zhou.

286
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,620
I don't know how to take it.

287
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,300
Don't cry.

288
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
It's upsetting.

289
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,190
I can't get used to it.

290
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,210
I know.

291
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,410
Look at you.

292
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,890
What are you guys up to?

293
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,700
If you're worried about her,

294
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,500
I've a way to deal with this.

295
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,580
What do you think?

296
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,100
Let's renovate our old home.

297
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,420
I'll move out next to her

298
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,170
and take care of her every day.

299
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,420
Stop joking around.

300
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,950
I'd be glad if you can
take care of yourself.

301
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,860
Listen to me.

302
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,700
Don't create troubles for Xi Xi.

303
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,660
Don't say that.

304
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,990
I was abroad for a long time.

305
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,190
I took care of myself.

306
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,300
You have no idea how good I am.

307
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,770
Sure, you are.

308
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,570
The kids are all grown up.

309
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,330
Sooner or later,

310
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,420
the kids will leave.

311
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,900
If you'd like marinated meat,

312
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,190
I'll make them for you.

313
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,250
Forget it. Help clean up.

314
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,340
Duan Ran, you should help her out.

315
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,890
Don't worry, of course I will.

316
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,860
I'll go upstairs first.

317
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,370
What's the matter?

318
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,100
You seem pretty upset.

319
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,320
Let's eat.

320
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,730
I'm fine.

321
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,210
Ms Qian.

322
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,900
What's up?

323
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,500
I need to be rewarded.

324
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,400
Of course, here's your reward.

325
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,940
Oats and milk go great together.

326
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,060
I don't want this.

327
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,550
You need a balanced diet.

328
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,450
Time to get up!

329
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,490
I did all that to protect you.

330
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,100
Reduce its size.

331
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,570
I know.

332
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,980
If you don't accept the termination fee,

333
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,570
I'll fire you and make

334
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,790
-Duan Ran the CEO.
-What do you want?

335
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,780
Qian Xi Xi.

336
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,690
Listen to me this time.

337
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,280
You may be nothing to others,

338
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,050
but to me,

339
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,620
in my world,

340
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,850
you're the most important being.

341
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,810
What's the matter?

342
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,620
Can't bear to leave me?

343
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
Cheer up.

344
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,060
I'll take you out for some food.

345
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,050
Come on.

346
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,530
Thank you, Duan Ran.

347
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,040
What is that for?

348
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,760
I know everything. Uncle Shen told me.

349
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,780
You insisted on

350
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,600
accepting the termination fee

351
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,500
because you're afraid

352
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,330
I might lose my job as CEO.

353
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
I thought you were going to confess.

354
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,150
I would accept it if you confessed.

355
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,970
After I help you move,

356
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,050
the rest of your time belongs to me.

357
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,140
Sure.

358
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,470
Let's get in the car.

359
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,230
This box goes to the bedroom.

360
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,370
There are too many things.

361
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,530
It's stuck.

362
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,020
Hey, buddy.

363
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,020
Put it inside.

364
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,500
Qian Xi Xi.

365
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,210
Did you wake up late today?

366
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,700
You came late.

367
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,700
I employed this moving company

368
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,900
from 58.com,

369
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,060
they are highly efficient.

370
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,300
If I wait around for both of you,

371
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,500
the day would be over.

372
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,380
You can't blame me.

373
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,050
It's Duan Ran's fault.

374
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,460
He was wasting time.

375
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,800
I urged him many times.

376
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,050
Hello, everything is unloaded.

377
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,570
Sure, thanks a lot.

378
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,530
Is everything done?

379
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,450
We're here to help.

380
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,620
-We're to help.
-Mister.

381
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,670
You were out there the whole time

382
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,290
and all you took in was a frog?

383
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,220
This is not a frog, it's a dinosaur.

384
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,380
This is a giant frog.

385
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,300
Isn't this a tyrannosaurus?

386
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,170
It's green. Frogs are green.

387
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,260
Yes. It's a Dino-frog, alright?

388
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,140
Hurry up and clean up.

389
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,380
Okay.

390
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,260
I'll make your bed for you.

391
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,980
The bed is covered with stuff.

392
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,180
If we don't clean that up,
you can't make the bed.

393
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,830
Make the bed, then clean up.

394
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,990
The bed should come first.

395
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,100
Put it down. Where is your common sense?

396
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,430
You'd need to pack up first
then do the bed.

397
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,420
Everyone puts the sheets first.

398
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,970
Everyone packs up first.

399
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,410
Guys, please.

400
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,610
Where is your common sense?

401
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,910
You lack common sense.

402
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,170
Make the bed together.

403
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,210
We'll do it one at a time, okay?

404
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,220
-Let's get to work.
-He has no common sense at all.

405
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,480
-Unbelievable.
-Where's the bedsheet?

406
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,030
Isn't it somewhere here?

407
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,100
Where?

408
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,660
Oh no. I forgot to bring it.

409
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,040
You can use mine.

410
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,690
Let's get a new one.

411
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,010
-Alright?
-Tell you what,

412
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,690
once we're through tidying up,

413
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,420
the three of us can go shopping.

414
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,050
Count me out.

415
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,780
I have something on.

416
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,050
Jia Yun.

417
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,380
I have something on tonight.

418
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,010
And what may that be?

419
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,220
What's it to you? I'm busy, that's all.

420
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,580
Jia Yun, you promised me

421
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,910
you'd help me tidy up today.

422
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,220
What's going on tonight?

423
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,820
Can't she have some privacy?

424
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,300
We won't disturb you.

425
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,180
Come on, let's go buy the sheets.

426
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,050
-Now?
-Now.

427
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,550
Just leave it for now.
I'll be back to clean it.

428
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,100
Okay, sure.

429
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,260
Sure.

430
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,100
Whatever you say.
Probably having a tryst again.

431
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,020
Look how happy the children are.

432
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,100
Not a care in the world besides play.

433
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,420
It's been a day already.

434
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,810
Can you cheer up?

435
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,210
This won't do.

436
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,390
There's a nice dorayaki place up ahead.

437
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,650
I feel like having one.

438
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,280
Can you get it for me?

439
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,290
What flavour?

440
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,570
Chocolate.

441
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
Are you kidding?

442
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,180
It's got to be red bean,

443
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,500
the best flavour.

444
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,010
Do you have any taste?

445
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,300
For desserts

446
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,700
like ice-cream, chocolate's the way to go.

447
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,960
It's the safest option

448
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,460
that'll never let you down.

449
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,910
But for dorayakis,
red bean flavour's the best.

450
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,900
No, chocolate.

451
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,810
Let's bet on it. Two slaps.

452
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,550
Red bean tastes better.

453
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,100
I'm not scared even if it's ten slaps.

454
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,810
Go big or go home.
Tell you what, the loser buys the winner

455
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,330
dorayakis for a year.

456
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,920
-Are you game?
-One year?

457
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,080
That's nothing.

458
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,100
The loser will buy the winner
a lifetime's supply of dorayaki,

459
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,290
and that's that.

460
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,140
A lifetime?

461
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,670
What do you mean, "a lifetime"?

462
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,570
A "lifetime" means a lifetime.

463
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,790
Although I'm confident

464
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,270
that chocolate is the best,

465
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,810
but if I really lose,

466
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,870
imagine all the money!

467
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,170
It'll be okay. You buy me dorayakis,
I support you for life.

468
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,100
Sir, what flavour would you like?

469
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,510
We're having a promotion.

470
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,380
A one-for-one couple's special.

471
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,910
That's okay. We'll buy separately.

472
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,970
We're not a couple.

473
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,930
Wait, we are a couple.

474
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,590
Who says we aren't a couple?

475
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,690
So what flavour would it be?

476
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,460
We'll buy a red bean dorayaki

477
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,170
and for the free one,
we'll get the chocolate.

478
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,050
I'm sorry, the free one has to be
red bean as well.

479
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,270
Who says we're a couple?

480
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,300
You're turning down freebies?

481
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,420
That's so unlike you.

482
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,860
Today, we're a couple.

483
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,020
So what will it be?

484
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,400
We'll get a chocolate dorayaki

485
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,160
and a red bean dorayaki gratis.

486
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,460
Sorry.

487
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,450
We can't give you a red bean dorayaki
for a chocolate one.

488
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,980
You see, it has to be the same flavour.

489
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,070
You're saying

490
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,460
if we buy the chocolate one,

491
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,790
the freebie will be chocolate, too?

492
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,780
That's right.

493
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,820
Are we still betting?

494
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,810
Of course.

495
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,900
Come on.

496
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,100
Please come again.

497
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,780
This red bean dorayaki is delicious.

498
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,470
This chocolate dorayaki is so delicious.

499
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,660
Try the red bean.

500
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,000
What's so good about red bean?

501
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,690
Chocolate is too cloying.

502
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,090
It's like jam.

503
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,040
-It's horrible.
-It's horrible.

504
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,140
Don't lie.

505
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,630
You're the liar.
Chocolate is obviously superior.

506
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,900
Red bean is better.

507
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,420
If you're going to be a weasel, I quit.

508
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,530
Don't quit. I haven't gotten
my lifetime of dorayaki.

509
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,460
Chocolate is clearly the winner.

510
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,260
That's it, I'm out.

511
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,100
You just won't admit it.

512
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,210
If you're so great,

513
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,590
why don't you eat

514
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,930
all four of them?

515
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,740
Then I'll square up.

516
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,930
-You promise?
-Are you game?

517
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,810
If I finish them,

518
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,590
you'll buy me a lifetime's supply
of dorayaki?

519
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,940
what are you doing

520
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,660
You think a little food can intimidate me?

521
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,790
Are you eating it like a burger?

522
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,330
Qian Xi Xi.

523
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,660
I like you.

524
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,210
Since when?

525
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,100
I don't remember.

526
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,160
It was too long ago.

527
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,450
Duan Ran.

528
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,210
I like you, too.

529
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,860
Since when?

530
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,430
There are still many dorayakis out there.

531
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,030
Finish them, and I'll tell you.

532
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,930
I can hear your heart telling me

533
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,900
it wants to hug

534
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,100
this cutest girl in the world.

535
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,130
Alright. Then I'll satisfy it.

536
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,120
How do you like my hug?

537
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,900
Are you the most lovable man
in the world?

538
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,090
-Yes.
-What about me?

539
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,040
-Yes.
-Really?

540
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,530
Does it feel like flying?

541
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,550
What are you two doing?

542
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,950
-Xi Xi...
-Aunt Zhou.

543
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,360
She twisted her ankle.

544
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,490
-Twisted?
-Yes.

545
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,080
-Gently...
-Does it hurt?

546
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,690
-That hurts.
-How was it twisted?

547
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,050
I... I have no idea.

548
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,000
-He hit it.
-Who would hit you?

549
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,860
-I was going to carry her upstairs.
-Okay.

550
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,000
Let me see.

551
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,550
Does it hurt?

552
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,240
Put it on ice.

553
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,040
You're right. We need ice.

554
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,590
-Give me that.
-Thanks, Aunt Zhou.

555
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,680
It's your fault.

556
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,790
Let's go.

557
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,680
Come on.

558
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,530
[Shapowei Art Zone]

559
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,010
Do you need help?

560
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,690
Su Su.

561
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,160
Su Su.

562
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,790
Thanks.

563
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,250
I was hurt.

564
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,850
By the boyfriend I met on a blind date.

565
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,730
He posted photos of our dates

566
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:41,930
and our outings

567
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,250
on WeChat Moments.

568
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,150
He even made snide remarks.

569
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,770
I couldn't believe my eyes.

570
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,530
Mr Wu,

571
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,840
do you think I'm shabby?

572
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,650
Not at all.

573
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,770
Su Su, he only did those things

574
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,970
because he's a bad person.

575
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,850
He's tall, handsome,

576
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,980
and he makes me smile at times.

577
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,490
How could he be such a jerk?

578
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,970
Su Su.

579
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,490
I loved him so much.

580
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,020
I thought I'd finally found a husband.

581
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,390
But it went up in smoke.

582
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,560
Mr Wu, you must find a boyfriend.

583
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,530
But don't be like me

584
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,530
and get played by jerks.

585
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,040
I hope they all die!

586
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,290
-Okay.
-I hope they combust spontaneously.

587
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,560
Mr Wu, you're on.

588
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,400
Okay, I'll be right there.

589
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,880
Su Su, I have to go and stream.

590
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,190
Cheer up, okay?

591
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
I'll meet you after the live stream.

592
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,840
Su Su, there's a complaint
at the front desk.

593
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,680
Can you go check it out?

594
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,880
Is there no one besides me?

595
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,630
Just hold the fort for a while.

596
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,800
So, what is your complaint?

597
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,000
The Perfect Blue cosmetics

598
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,719
I bought during your live stream

599
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,770
were duds.

600
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,330
They gave me a beard.

601
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,650
A beard?

602
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,949
That's special effects makeup, isn't it?

603
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,260
It's pretty convincing.

604
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,199
Please.

605
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,330
Is everyone here

606
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,770
as unreasonable as you?

607
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,010
I made a call prior to this.

608
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,070
No one believed me.

609
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,159
I was even insulted

610
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,449
and accused of extortion.

611
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,870
That's why I came here.

612
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,190
Extortion?

613
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,980
It sure looks that way.

614
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,220
Anything could've caused a beard.

615
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,620
What makes you think
our company's responsible?

616
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,220
It's never happened before,

617
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,850
until I used your cosmetics.

618
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,470
Doesn't that make you responsible?

619
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,730
Little Missy,

620
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,400
just between us,

621
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,750
your beard may be due

622
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,680
to a hormone imbalance, who knows?

623
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,920
Do you have a boyfriend?

624
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,200
Not anymore

625
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,490
because of the beard.

626
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,620
Breaking up over a beard?

627
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,680
Your boyfriend was a jerk, too?

628
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,280
Don't you speak of Zhang Si like that!

629
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,810
You think I want to?

630
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,570
Listen up, there's nothing I hate

631
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,630
more than dishonest people like you.

632
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,110
You and that jerk deserve each other.

633
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,760
You're too much!

634
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
I'm sorry.

635
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,240
Accusing you of extortion was too kind.

636
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,160
The ugly truth is, you're a fraud.

637
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,240
You...

638
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,200
You're too much!

639
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,440
Sorry, we don't take kindly

640
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,990
to deceitful people here.

641
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,430
If you keep this up,

642
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,120
I'm calling security.

643
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,020
The nerve of some people.

644
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm so full.

645
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,750
I'm turning in.

646
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,390
Sure, go.

647
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,570
What are you doing?
Aunt Zhou might see us.

648
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,090
-That was quite a scare.
-Don't worry. We're safe here.

649
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,240
That was scary.

650
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,650
We were nearly exposed.

651
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,720
Tell me about it.

652
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,400
Take a whiff at my feet.

653
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,570
Seriously? Put that away.

654
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,690
Thanks to Aunt Zhou,

655
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,350
it smells like Red Flower Oil.

656
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,770
Good thing you moved out.

657
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:54,010
Otherwise, they'd be breathing down
our necks every day.

658
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,480
Imagine that.

659
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,490
So, as for Jia Yun,

660
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,660
should we keep our secret from her?

661
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,480
I guess.

662
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,970
The more people knowing,
the more trouble.

663
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,920
But you

664
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,570
should stay away from Jiang Zhe Yang.

665
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,370
Stop flirting with him.

666
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,640
No more "Mr Fox",

667
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,050
-selling lipsticks and whatnot.
-Okay, I got it.

668
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,910
How many times must you remind me?

669
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,170
And you,

670
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,490
keep your distance from Ms Ouyang.

671
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,460
Don't go running to her
for help all the time.

672
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,460
Okay, relax. I'll stay clear of her.

673
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:32,880
Time for bed.

674
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,370
Separately?

675
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,600
Separately.

676
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,240
Go to bed.

677
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,780
Where's my goodnight kiss?

678
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,040
Come on.

679
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,160
Come on.

680
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,520
Come on.

681
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,560
Don't avoid me.

682
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,640
Alright.

683
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,970
Please, I need to sleep.

684
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,270
Xi Xi,

685
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,610
this stuff is great.

686
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,840
You over-timers

687
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,240
should take it.

688
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,600
Give it a stir. One glass each.

689
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,600
-Duan Ran.
-Duan Ran.

690
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,640
-Come back.
-What for?

691
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,720
What is it?

692
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,580
What's that in your hand?

693
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,890
What's that?

694
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,480
She's been driving it all this while.

695
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,890
Let me take it for a spin.

696
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,240
What for?

697
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,570
You two work at the same place.

698
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,100
Doesn't matter who drives.

699
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,130
Leave it.

700
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,460
Never mind, Aunt Zhou.

701
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,720
Let Duan Ran drive.

702
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,600
I've always wanted a chauffeur.

703
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,480
A chauffeur?

704
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,680
Sure, go ahead.

705
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,770
Sit down. What are you standing there for?

706
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,210
Be careful.

707
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,090
That was close.

708
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,850
Take this. You drive from now on.

709
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,840
You be the chauffeur.

710
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,350
Here are the eggs

711
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,490
and the salad. Pass it over.

712
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,240
Alright, let's dig in. Here.

713
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,160
Give it a stir.

714
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,360
Try it, see if you like it.

715
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,230
Look at you.

716
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,810
Eat up.

717
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,010
We've got to take off.

718
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,010
Don't rush me.

719
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,290
What are you giggling about?

720
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,380
-Nothing.
-You two have a long day ahead.

721
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,960
Stop being silly. Eat up.

722
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,250
Knock it off.

723
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,610
Duan Ran, I have a challenging
question for you.

724
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,910
-Shoot.
-You've been working at Rui

725
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,770
and looking at me for so long.

726
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,050
Do you know what colour

727
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,450
of lipstick I'm wearing?

728
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,120
No, I don't.

729
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,170
As my boyfriend, you should know

730
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,360
that the colour of my lipstick

731
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,120
is strawberry red. Got it?

732
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,810
I might quiz you again.

733
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,850
What's wrong?

734
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,380
Strawberry red, you say?

735
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,640
Why doesn't it taste
like strawberries?

736
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,570
Someone's calling me.

737
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,410
Who?

738
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,110
-Who?
-How would I know?

739
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,800
It's Yu Shi.

740
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,890
Answer it.

741
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,080
Yu Shi.

742
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,490
What?

743
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,720
Sure, just hold on.

744
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,970
We'll be right over.

745
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,890
Quick, trouble at the office.

746
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,150
-What's wrong?
-No idea. Just step on it.

747
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,210
Go.

748
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,490
Can't get enough of that strawberry taste.

749
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,960
It's urgent.

750
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm serious.

751
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,000
We're off.

752
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,750
[Shapowei Art Zone, Art, Life, Live.]

753
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,360
We can't simply open our warehouse.

754
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,200
But we have a search warrant.

755
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,800
-I know, I know.
-At least wait for our CEO.

756
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,720
Wait a second.

757
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,050
Have a heart, comrades. I'm just

758
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,230
a middle manager...

759
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,220
-They're here.
-Yu Shi.

760
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,210
Su Su.

761
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,320
-What's going on?
-Mr Duan.

762
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,880
The SAIC is here on an investigation.

763
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,890
Apparently, someone reported us.

764
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:26,880
Who?

765
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,520
May I know who's in charge here?

766
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,690
-Her.
-That's me.

767
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,250
Is there a problem?

768
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,860
Here's the search warrant.

769
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,290
We received a complaint
from a consumer

770
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,890
that your company is selling

771
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,380
counterfeit cosmetics.

772
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,320
We'll need to seize and inspect all of

773
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,080
your Perfect Blue merchandise.

774
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,480
I used your company's liquid foundation

775
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,200
and this happened.

776
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,920
Where did that beard come from?
