Soon after,

5
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,130
you're going to be the CEO of Rui,

6
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,030
and the head of Live Stream Alliance.

7
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,180
You're going to be occupied.

8
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,340
Will you still have time for me?

9
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,520
What should I do?

10
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,430
Should I ask Jia Yun

11
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,680
to continue her position as Rui's CEO?

12
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,190
[Actually, it's fine if Jia Yun]

13
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,650
resumes as CEO.
I'm just unsure if she's willing to.

14
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,680
She's unwilling to.

15
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,470
You should take over as
head of the alliance. I don't want it.

16

I don't want to.

[I can truly shine in tasks
that require creativity.]

19

Becoming the head is a
misuse of my talents.

20

It really is.

21

The both of you are so excessive.

32
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,670
Have you ever considered

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,200
the feelings of a single lady like me?

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,160
Gosh.

35
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,090
You're snuggling up against me.

36
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,860
I did consider your feelings.

37
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,680
However, I find it redundant.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,100
The both of you manage to find each other

39
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,930
while I'm all alone.

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,410
What's going on with Chen Lang?

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,220
Did he bother you to convince us

42
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,910
so he could return to
the Live Stream Alliance?

43
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,010
He says life is hard.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,200
I think it's hard because

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,800
he's too greedy.

46
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,020
Well, nobody truly understands themselves.

47
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,470
Am I right?

48
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,200
Don't worry.

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,480
I had it all figured out.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,800
I plan to approve all
broadcasting companies

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,760
that would like to join the alliance,

52
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,470

turned their backs on us

00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,320
you're being too kind.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,470
Let me break it down to you.

62
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,190
Do you know what this is?

63
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,120
This is cooperative competition.

64
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,760
I don't understand.

65
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,760
Yes, I'm sure you'd get it.

66
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,590
For example,

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,519
I would like to open my own
restaurant on a food street.

68
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,360
The attraction of a food street

69
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
is greater than a restaurant alone.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,460
We will use the attraction
of the food street

71
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,850
to attract the customers.

72
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,450
Then, with our specialities

73
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,810
and skills,

74
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,590
we attract the customers
to our own restaurant.

75
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,530
That means, we cooperate.

76
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,760
Then, we compete fairly.

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
This is the best way of development.

78
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,250
Not bad, Qian Xi Xi.

79
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,680
You worked hard during
the time you left Rui.

80
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,600
It would work.

81

86
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,750
Mr Duan Sr obstruct the negotiation
between three parties?

87

establish the regulations of the industry.

89
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,590

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,030
Tomorrow, before 12pm,

171
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,020
if the sales do not increase in 20%,

172
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,430
you need to treat me to a meal.

173
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,680
Yu Shi.

174
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
How could you make me buy?

175
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,650
We were just pretending.

176
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,840
All right.

177
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,400
I'll buy you a meal instead.

178
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,480
That's acceptable.

179
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,960
We're going to eat vermicelli.

Apparently, someone reported us.

216
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,180
In our previous promotions,

217
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,830
we sold a batch of unauthentic apparels.

218
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,470
It was proven after
investigation, so we were blocked.

219
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,590
Then, he hung up.

220
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,070

I found it.

234
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,440
This was sent by Chen Lang.

235
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,970
There's a defect on its collar,

236
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,850
so we kept it.

237
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,120
We sold the rest of it.

238
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,240
That guy is so evil.

239
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,210
He intended to sabotage us.

240
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
He was so pretentious.

241
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,850
What a faker.

242
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,770
Chen Lang is unbelievable.

243
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,240
I envied Jia Yun back then.

244
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,350
Turns out he harbours ill intentions.

245
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,170
Jia Yun, don't be mad.

246
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,780
This was my fault.

247
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,870
I trusted Chen Lang
without thinking twice.

248
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,680
I did not inspect the apparels he sent

249
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,090
and approved the sales.

250
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,690
Don't be like this.

251
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,770
Come on, Jia Yun.

252
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,780
Don't blame yourself.
It is not your fault.

253
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,330
Evil can never be completely prevented.

254
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,210
If someone aims to harm you,

255
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,850
you can't prevent it no
matter how hard you try.

256
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,780
That's right.

257
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,650
Yu Shi, Su Su.

258
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,200
Find me the inspection
form of these garments.

259
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,210
We must retrieve the unauthentic goods.

260
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,340
We must stop the customers
from filing complaints.

261
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,530
Okay.

262
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,810
I just arrived at the office.

263
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,040
I've a meeting in the afternoon
with the Apparel Alliance.

264
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,480
[Remember to eat your lunch.]

265

[The people of the Apparel Alliance]

266
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,240
[are petty and stingy.]

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,370
[I'll take care of them when I'm back.]

268
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,600

269
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,430
Something looks wrong.

270
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,800
I'll check on her, talk to you later.

271
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,120
[Okay. Keep me updated anytime.]

272
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,610
Don't worry.

273
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,650
What's the matter?

274
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,440
What are my arrangements
for Singles' Day?

275
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,450
The programs were distributed.
Nothing's changed.

276
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,390
Why are my goods

277
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,610
different from Xiao Xiao and the rest?

278
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
Before I joined the company,

279
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,400
Mr Chen promised to

280
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,360
raise me up as the head broadcaster.

281
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,240
Every broadcaster who joins Cloud Live

282
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,440
are potentials we'd like to train.

283
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,650
Mr Chen has expectations for all of them.

284
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,580
If you weren't given better goods,

285
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,850
that's because you lack

286
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,850
the qualities Mr Chen appreciates.

287
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,280
We know Chen Lang very well.

288
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm not surprised that

289
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,700
he was capable of doing this.

290
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,300
Most importantly, don't blame yourself.

291
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,560
I felt like

292
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,330
I've let you down.

293
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,240
I've let Rui down.

294
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,330
Don't be sorry.

295
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,720
There are three more days
left to Singles' Day.

296
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,970
Duan Ran is still at Beijing.

297
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,360
I'll get him to clarify
things with the platform.

298
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,460
We will explain that
we did not do it on purpose.

299
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,850
Don't worry.

300
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,530
Zhang Jia Yun, remember this.

301
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,800
You're the CEO.

302
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,040
You're the best.

303
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,320
You can do this.

304
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,040
Hello.

305
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,720
My colleague told me you'd like to

306
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,980
appeal for the blocking of
accounts for your company.

307
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,600
Yes, you finally showed up.

308
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,690
Our company is getting
ready for the Singles' Day.

309
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,800
All of the broadcasters' accounts

310
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,970
are blocked

311
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,410
because the products
sold were unauthentic.

312
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,890
However, those goods weren't ours.

313
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,820
We were sabotaged by a competitor.

314
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,240
Have you submitted an appeal online?

315
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,330
I did everything.

316
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,690
The website says the process
will take a few days.

317
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,440
Singles' Day is coming soon.
We will not make it.

318
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,560
It's going to be too late then.

319
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,760
This is the case, sir.

320
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,560
The only way to appeal

321
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,410
is through our online customer service.

322
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,660
They will request for
relevant evidence then.

323
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,480
Just show them the evidence
and it will be settled.

324
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,810
I brought the evidence.

325
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,630
Look, this is the delivery receipt

326
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,360
of Cloud Live.
The unauthentic goods belonged to them.

[Cloud Live]
[List of Delivery]

328
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,080
This is a valid evidence,

329
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,230
but it is not a direct evidence.

330
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,780
If you'd like to unblock your accounts,

331
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,830
it'd be great if you can
provide direct evidence.

332
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,340
Our company is investigating
the situation right now.

333
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,600
We will send the evidence
once they find it.

334
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,210
Is this usable?

335
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,040
If it is, unblock all our accounts.

336
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,770
Allow us to continue broadcasting.

337
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,560
We're running out of time.

338
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,850
Sir, my apologies.

339
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,890
Our company

340
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,320
does not provide leeway for any companies.

341
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,360
We understand that

342
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,040
Singles' Day is approaching.

343
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,350
Time is running out.

344
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,240
All of us are working overtime

345
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,690
to resolve these issues.

346
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,600
I've matters to attend to, excuse me.

347
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,210
No, I'm not asking for a leeway.

348
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,540
I came here personally.

349
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,890
There's no need to submit
my appeal virtually.

350
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,170
-Isn't that right?
-Sir.

351
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,530
Just proceed my appeal and
unblock two accounts of mine.

352
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,120
You need to be patient.

353
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,170
I...

354
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,240
I don't have patience. Come on.

355
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,170
Mr Chen, what do you mean?

356
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,180
Firstly, you did not knock.

357
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,760
Secondly, what's with the attitude?

358
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,770
Can we have a proper conversation?

359
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,650
Fine.

360
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,570
Previously, you tried many times

361
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,650
to convince me to be your mole.

362
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,960
You told me,

363
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,200
if I join Cloud Live,

364
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,000
you'd make me the head broadcaster.

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,960
What happens next?

366
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,800
I did everything you wanted.

367
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,840
What about you?

368
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,750
Cola, don't you know

369
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,960
why am I doing this?

370
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,370
Just be frank.

371
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,970
I'm waiting for you to create
an opportunity of your own.

372
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
What do you mean?

373
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,890
Yuan Yuan did not become
the head broadcaster

374
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,410
in a day.

375
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,480
She worked harder than anyone else.

376
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,000
I work very hard too.

377
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,120
I work out every day without fail.

378
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,050
Working hard isn't as
simple as going on a diet.

379
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,710
You need to use your brain.

380
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,470
Focus on your performances.

381
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,230
Understand what exactly

382
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,720
your fans need.

383
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,520
Why do they like you?

384
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,000
Do you even know?

385
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,010
[Hello, everyone. I'm Cola.]

386
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,870
[Hello, I'm Little Duckling.]

387
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,580
[This is my best friend.]

388
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,510
[This is my best friend.]

389
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,210
[Today, we would like to introduce]

390
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,540
[matching outfits.]

391
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,090
Of course I remember.

392
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,290
Something happened to
Little Duckling's live stream room,

393
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,290
so she came to mine

394
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,760
and joined my broadcast.

395
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,810
What did you see?

396
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,960
When I broadcast with Little Duckling,

397
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,580
I was more affable.

398
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,170
This is one of the reasons.

399
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,270
Because of this video,

400
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,420
I realized something special in you.

401
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,160
From this video,

402
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,690
I saw something else.

403
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,890
I realized a new form of broadcasting.

404
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,890
A broadcasting collaboration.

405
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,600
Mr Chen, are you saying that...

406
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,600
I trust you.

407
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,080
Miss, I'll give you a ride.

408
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,510
It's okay, sir.

409
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,020
I'll just take the subway.

410
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,410
It's on the way. Come on.

411
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,050
Forget it.

412
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,500
Stop wasting time. Get in here.

413
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,240
Why are you staring at me?

414
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,410
Yes, it's you.

415
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,580
You sold spicy strips in your live stream.

416
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,450
You watched my live stream secretly.

417
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,850
What are you saying?

418
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,450
It's normal for a father to be
concerned about his daughter.

419
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Is the company closing down?

420
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,690
Do you no longer have clothes to sell?

421
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,560
How could you say that?

422
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,240
We signed a contract with the
Apparel Alliance a few days ago.

423
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,890
We have great prospects.

424
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,330
If the prospects are great,

425
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,070
why are you selling junk food?

426
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,000
Are you quitting your coffee research?

427
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Some of the broadcasters' accounts

428
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,200
are facing slight issues.

429
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,690
It's just a phase.

430
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,500
I'm still working on my coffee.

431
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,690
Come home earlier after work.

432
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,200
I want you to try my coffee.

433
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,130
I made it myself.

434
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,840
Why are you working so hard?

435
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,000
Come back.

436
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,110
My business

437
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,690
will be yours soon.

438
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,290
Do not try to leave the
responsibility to me

439
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,770
while you enjoy life.

440
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,010
It's your prime.

441
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,810
You should hustle a few more years.

442
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,890
Plus, when I was young, you said,

443
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,450
Yuanbao, daddy will

444
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,450
produce the

445
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,480
best coffee in all of China.

446
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,690
Have you forgotten?

447
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,530
-No, I haven't.
-Good.

448
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,790
Dad, I want to be independent.

449
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,460
I want to live my own life.

450
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,050
If something happens to you then...

451
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,990
What?

452
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,300
No, I mean,

453
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,410
when you retire,

454
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,610
and I take over,

455
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,630
I'll have my own set of rules

456
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,600
to manage our brand, Axis Coffee.

457
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,970
Just because I'm your daughter,

458
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,890
I need to inherit Axis Coffee.

459
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,080
I want to be capable and

460
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,430
competent enough to manage Axis Coffee.

461
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm pleased to see how
ambitious and diligent you are.

462
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,520
I just don't feel good about it.

463
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,960
I don't want you to suffer.

464
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,890
That's enough, dad.

465
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,360
If you go on, I'm moving out tonight.

466
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,840
You're impressive. You can do this.

467
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,300
Of course I'm impressive.

468
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,080
You lost so much weight.

469
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,530
Have I?

470
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,240
Besides supplying food,

471
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,200
I think engagement is essential.

472
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,120
I left the office.

473
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm trying to increase engagement.

474
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,080
My guest is here.

475
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,130
I'm hanging up.

476
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,240
Bye.

477
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,390
Here.

478
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,250
Turn around.

479
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,510
I'm sorry

480
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
to make you come all the way here.

481
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,930
It's fine. I was filming nearby anyway.

482
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,770
That's why I decided to meet you here.

483
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,960
Are you working?

484
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,600
Am I

485
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,410
occupying your time?

486
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,840
-It's fine.
-I'll not waste your time.

487
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,990
I'll keep it short.

488
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,080
Okay.

489
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,110
The previous issues

490
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,640
were mostly resolved.

491
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,060
However, a new problem arose.

492
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,600
What happened?

493
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,480
All broadcasters' accounts of our company

494
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,300
are blocked by the platform.

495
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,930
Blocked?

496
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,960
Only one remaining account stands.

497
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,720
She's Yuanbao, a food broadcaster.

498
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,580
Her account is still accessible.

499
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,080
Singles' Day is happening soon.

500
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,410
With her account alone,

501
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,840
it's hard for us to enter
the centralized market.

502
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,080
That's why I thought of you.

503
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,860
I wonder if you could
come and give us a hand

504
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,010
and broadcast with Yuanbao.

505

Yuanbao?

506

The last time we live streamed

507
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,410
about the Bulletproof Coffee.

508
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,020
Yuanbao curated the Bulletproof Coffee.

509
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,810
She's a big fan of yours.

510
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,970
Are you asking me to join her broadcast?

511
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,360
Can you do that?

512

Sure, it's okay.

513

we will settle it formally.

I need to stop you right there.

522

Our relationship

523
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,380
is only going to be affected
if money is involved.

524

Thank you so much.

525

I didn't want to bother you

526
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,410
during a time like this.

527
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,920
Don't worry about it.

528
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,380

529

to buy you a drink.

If that's what you'd like, sure.

531

Buy me the most expensive

532

eat and stream all day online.

You rarely sell any high-end products.

536

You just watched the live stream
of my spicy strips promotion.

537

I eat well every day.

538

You should catch a few more.

539
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,790
I'm a busy man.
I've no time to watch you eat.

540

What's wrong with
the young people nowadays?

541
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,330
Why do they enjoy watching people eat?

542

There's nothing wrong with that.

to lower your blood pressure.

to evaluate young people like you.

550
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,550
Of course you can.

How about this?

552
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,360
I'll create a live stream room for you.

553

By the way,

if any of my friends, your uncles,

560
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,000
ask what you're doing,
do not tell them you're a broadcaster.

561

It's the biggest joke.
I don't want to be embarrassed.

Why would you be
embarrassed with what I do?

Listen to me. You're only capable
if you're in the entity industry.

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,320
for neglecting your brother.

841
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,740
He's worried about you.

842
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,720
He was too protective.

843
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,170
I'm guarded even
when I was in the restroom.

844
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,490
It's crazy.

845
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,250
That's why I ran away.

846
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,490
You're rebelling against
your dad over the years.

847
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,010
Not exactly,

848
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,410
but I'm not my brother.

849
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,420
Although we share the same parents,

850
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,970
we're still different.

851
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,010
I'm aware of what I'm doing.

852
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,190
It's just that

853
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,950
I've my own set of rules.

854
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,170
I want to do what I want.

855
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,170
I'll be fine.

856
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,510
Right now,

857
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,320
he allowed you to pursue broadcasting.

858
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,080
He did change a little.

859
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,080
This is nothing.

860
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,960
It's a very small matter.

861
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,360
I want him to trust me completely.

862
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,850
Allow me to do the things

863
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,040
I want to on my own.

864
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,960
Jia Yun.

865
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,040
Thus, Jia Yun,

866
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,520
if the company is willing to give
me a shot during Singles' Day,

867
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,600
I'd promise to work hard.

868
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,600
Besides, Axis Coffee is

869
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,280
reaching a plateau.

870
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,890
It's time for a change.

871
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,130
Don't worry.

872
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,600
Your idea

873
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,930
fits perfectly with my plan.

874
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,200
Actually, I've to

875
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,410
thank Chen Lang for this.

876
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,890
I didn't know anyone from our company

877
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,620
would be grateful towards him.

878
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,810
Jia Yun.

879
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,970
How do you feel about Chen Lang?

880
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,380
I'm curious.

881
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,410
I'm just asking.

882
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,010
-How do you feel?
-How do I feel?

883
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,380
Nothing.

884
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,750
He's just a friend.

885
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,800
I could barely call him my friend now.

886
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,940
Guys.

887
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,110
I believe all of you are aware.

888
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,740
Previously,
we had to deal with many challenges.

889
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,450
I thank all of you for sticking by.

890
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,720
However,
we're faced with a bigger problem.

891
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,380
Singles' Day is approaching.

892
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,370
It's a difficult battle.

893
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,760
Thus, I hope all of you

894
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,670
will join me in fighting
a victorious battle.

895
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,120
I believe everyone knows

896
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,540
that we just entered

897
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,930
the newly established,
Live Stream Alliance.

898
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,190
We will be able to enjoy

899
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,270
the underwriting clauses agreed by

900
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,950
both parties.

901
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,320
Hence, this will not affect

902
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,260
Singles' Day in any way.

903
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:00,840
Broadcasters.

904
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,490
With every ten ranks you improve,

905
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,520
you'll get 1%.

906
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,500
If we enter the centralized market,

907
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,840
everyone will get 5%.

908
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,360
Hooray!

909
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,560
How much you earn depends
on how hard you work.

910
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Let's do this together! Okay?

911
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,170
Yes!

912
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,520
Let's get to work!

913
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
All right!

914
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,890
Get to work!
