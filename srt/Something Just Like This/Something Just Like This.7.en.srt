[Episode 7]

4
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,780
Hi, babes.

5
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,460
Yes, I'm your beloved Qian Xi Xi.

6
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,460
Come with me,
you will be in high spirits.

7
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,789
If this is your first time

8
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:42,070
watching my live stream,

9
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,400
remember to click the follow button.

10
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,259
Follow me
and there's nothing that you will miss.

11
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,259
From now on, you belong to me.

12
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,220
This is a denim skirt by a niche designer.

13
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,170
Isn't it cool?

14
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,710
Someone said that it's cool.

15
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,940
It's pretty, isn't it?

16
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,690
This is how it looks like on me.

17
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,970
Yes, it is a loose fit.

18
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,120
Some girls have noticed
its design concept.

19
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,770
Smart girls.

20
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,550
This is something
that I can't wait to tell you.

21
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,130
The designer of this denim skirt is...

22
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,730
She's our

23
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,170
super cool

24
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,010
and talented Mr Five.

25
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,220
Not only is she talented,

26
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,350
she's also beautiful.

27
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,460
She has really long legs.

28
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,650
If she puts on

29
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,370
this kind of denim skirt,

30
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,420
she'll look stunning.

31
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,570
Mr Five might seem young,

32
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,900
but she has already designed

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,290
many clothes.

34
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,180
Now, Mr Five will share with us

35
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,130
the design concept of this skirt.

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,260
Just say anything.

37
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,610
Hurry up, maestro!

38
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,220
The cut.

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,340
Hi guys, I...

40
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,650
I'm Mr Five.

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,450
Well... This...

42
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,990
This skirt, I actually...

43
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,620
I cut it in the middle.

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,790
Then I attached five buttons on it.

45
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,930
It's beautiful.

46
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,220
Tell us more.

47
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,210
The fabric.

48
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,260
It's... It's denim.

49
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,560
Yes, it's denim.

50
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,810
Denim.

51
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,140
The fabric is denim.

52
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,100
Then I... I cut this side
and attached two buckles on it.

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,340
You scared the hell out of me.

54
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,600
Go  and draft a new  contract.

55
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,730
You got the deal?

56
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,420
We got Perfect Blue.

57
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,570
You're amazing!

58
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,930
Listen, draft it quick

59
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,790
and let Su Su contact the platform.

60
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,900
Then the streamers

61
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,810
have to study the products

62
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,290
of Perfect Blue.

63
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,660
The promotional photos
of each streamer,

64
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,230
event photos of the products

65
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,900
and our live photos

66
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,950
have to be prepared.

67
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,720
Go ahead.

68
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,980
Right away!

69
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,620
It goes very well with any clothes.

70
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,730
I really like it.

71
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,340
I also... I also cut the sides.

72
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,530
After I cut it...

73
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,020
After I cut it,
I put on another two buttons.

74
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,060
What else?

75
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,690
Just say anything.

76
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,300
Our designer is quite a personality.

77
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,590
She's very cool, isn't she?

78
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,020
Super cool.

79
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,620
Outstanding designers

80
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,630
usually keep the design concept
to themselves.

81
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,700
They usually don't speak much.

82
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,420
Mr Five was right.

83
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,310
The biggest highlight
of the design of this denim skirt

84
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,450
is this split.

85
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,300
Its location and size are just perfect.

86
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,310
Can you see it? After putting it on,

87
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,890
you'll expose a little bit of your leg.

88
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,909
Today, in Xi Xi's live stream room,

89
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,900
it only needs...

90
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,700
What a great idea.

91
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,760
She's inviting any old person
on her live stream.

92
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,030
What on earth is she thinking?

93
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,660
Does she really think

94
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,120
that anyone can be a streamer
as long as they have a mouth?

95
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,080
Her name is Mr Five, right?

96
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,130
It wouldn't work even if she's Master Wu.

97
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,490
What's this?

98
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,100
I think Qian Xi Xi

99
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,540
is already desperate.

100
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,710
If I'm not mistaken,

101
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,450
this batch of jeans are old stocks
from a year ago.

102
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,210
She has come to a dead end.

103
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,250
Qian Xi Xi is a streamer after all,

104
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,470
she can sell products.

105
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,910
But if you make her manage a company,

106
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,240
how can she handle that?

107
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,700
She only has passion.

108
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,150
And now people are laughing at her.

109
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,820
Then why did QE ask her
to compete with Duan Ran

110
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,580
for the position of CEO?

111
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,500
Now they have no money, no streamers,

112
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,980
no clients and no products.

113
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,060
I have no idea either,

114
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,790
but I don't have the guts to ask.

115
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,190
Back then, Duan Ran competed with you,

116
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,909
now he's competing with Qian Xi Xi.

117
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,340
I think since I left Rui,

118
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,420
the company's been lacking talent.

119
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,740
But I think

120
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,930
between Duan Ran and Qian Xi Xi,

121
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Xi Xi might be the better candidate.

122
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,540
She's worked with me
for some time after all,

123
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,870
she has some experience.

124
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,540
But what is up with Duan Ran?

125
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,770
Just let them be.

126
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,580
Let's see how long they can survive.

127
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,250
Smell it.

128
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,770
Guatemala.

129
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,260
It's your favourite.

130
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,890
Good!

131
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,580
Give me a massage.

132
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,420
Sure.

133
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,540
Do you think

134
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,010
I was born with business sense

135
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,090
Easy, easy.

136
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,580
or did I work for it?

137
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,370
I don't know, but please be gentle.

138
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,930
What?

139
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,020
Well, you,

140
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,330
you can be jealous,
but don't be so obvious, okay?

141
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,820
Who's jealous of you?

142
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,070
My toe will break.

143
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,210
Listen. Don't be so full of yourself.

144
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,150
It's only been a few days,

145
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,260
it's too early to find out the result.

146
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,610
You just won't admit it.

147
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,250
Let me teach you a trick or two.

148
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,370
Trick? What kind of trick do you have?

149
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,960
I'd be grateful
as long as you don't frame me.

150
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,110
You are my sister.

151
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,170
Focus.

152
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,020
Shouldn't your brother
teach you something?

153
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,890
Go ahead, go ahead.

154
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,820
Aren't you short of cash flow?

155
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,150
Aren't you worried about this?

156
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,810
That's the only issue, right?

157
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,140
So?

158
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,440
If you need money, just ask my dad.

159
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,170
Problem solved.

160
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,070
You're asking me
to borrow money from Uncle Duan?

161
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,770
Are you out of your mind?

162
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,710
-What's wrong?
-You asked me about your business sense,

163
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,980
I think you worked for it.

164
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,640
Go bang your head on the floor.

165
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,300
It's up to you,

166
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,130
but I gave you an idea.

167
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,340
You have a choice.

168
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,620
My dad is the best choice you have.

169
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,710
That's impossible.

170
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,670
It's up to you.

171
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,740
Massage my feet.

172
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,690
-No.
-Hurry up.

173
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,770
No.

174
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,140
Ran Ran.

175
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,500
Uncle Duan.

176
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,840
Are you looking for me?

177
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,690
No, no.

178
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,380
Dad, sit down.

179
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,940
Well, Xi Xi...

180
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,429
It's nothing, Uncle Duan.

181
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:46,380
Xi Xi desperately needs your

182
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,450
-help.
-No.

183
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,900
There's nothing to be shy about.

184
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,420
Tell me what you need.

185
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,190
Uncle Duan, it's nothing.

186
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,320
Don't listen to him.

187
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,490
We were talking about

188
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,910
the company’s new management method
and development plan.

189
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,540
I'm also new to live streaming.

190
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,510
Like a primary school student.
I still have to learn.

191
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,630
But when it comes to running a company,

192
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,160
it's always the same thing.

193
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,420
Talent is the key.

194
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,060
You have to discover talents, train them

195
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,010
and the key is to keep them.

196
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,740
Then...

197
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,180
Then you have to do more marketing.

198
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,220
Any other questions?

199
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,530
Dad.

200
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,690
Today, I closed a deal with Perfect Blue.

201
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,380
We'll sign a contract soon.

202
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,860
If you have any advice,

203
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,130
please tell me.

204
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,940
Perfect Blue?

205
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,450
When was it?

206
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,890
Today.

207
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,850
Mu isn't in a good condition today.

208
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,180
He's still in the ICU.

209
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,140
No way. You got the wrong information.

210
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,740
I met him this morning.

211
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,570
It happened in the afternoon.

212
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,570
Alright, I should take a rest now.

213
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,650
What happened to Mr Mu?

214
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,560
I was waiting to close the deal.

215
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,590
Why would he end up in the ICU?

216
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
What should we do?

217
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,730
What should we do?

218
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,750
Thwarted by the competition again?

219
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,130
What do you want to eat? Just name it.

220
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,160
Why can't you be more optimistic about me?

221
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,500
You seem to be quite free.

222
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,870
You still have time for a jog.

223
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,180
I'm learning from you.

224
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,810
We should exercise for our health.

225
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,450
Whenever you say nice words,
there must be something.

226
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,210
Hurry up.

227
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,210
Spill it. What happened?

228
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,100
Only a close friend
would know me this well.

229
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,130
Yuan Yuan,

230
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,300
we've been friends for so long.

231
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,540
I know you very well.

232
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,670
You have a sharp tongue,

233
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,450
but you're soft-hearted.

234
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,630
Then you don't know me well enough.

235
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,980
It's okay. I might not know you well,

236
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,770
but I just need to know
that you're very good.

237
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,860
Unfortunately,

238
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,330
I had been very clear.

239
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,020
I will never be a streamer again.

240
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,270
As a matter of fact,
I didn't come here today

241
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,940
to ask you to be a streamer.

242
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,820
[401 Intensive Care Unit (ICU),
Patient Access]

243
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,570
Duan Ran, I know why you're here today.

244
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,140
But my dad is in a coma, you saw it too.

245
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,900
It's pointless even if you see him.

246
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,330
Now I have to take over the company.

247
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,630
I have to handle the internal handover

248
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,980
and brand endorsement.

249
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,660
I have my work cut out for me.

250
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,170
-I know.
-I don't have time for a new project.

251
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,210
I get it. I understand.

252
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,010
I came here
because I'm worried about Mr Mu.

253
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,540
Don't stress out.

254
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,060
Take care of yourself.

255
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,540
Alright, I'll go back in.

256
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,860
Sure.

257
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,300
Take care.

258
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,740
Hello, Jia Yun.

259
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,740
Mr Duan, how was your deal?

260
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,770
[When can we start making money?]

261
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,540
I'm working on it now.

262
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,900
I just finished a meeting.

263
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,340
Don't worry.

264
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,770
I have to pick the best one for you,

265
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,860
am I right?

266
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,540
Don't worry. Take a break at home.

267
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,470
After I close the deal,
I'll call you, alright?

268
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,730
I'll wait for your good news then.

269
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,450
[But I can't wait too long.]

270
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,780
[Sure, sure. Don't worry, don't worry.]

271
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,860
[You may rest assured.]

272
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,850
[Alright.]

273
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,310
[Push yourself because
no one else is going to do it for you]

274
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,130
Why did you call us over so early?

275
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,060
Both of you are the most outstanding,

276
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,940
most adorable,

277
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,380
and most beloved babes in my eyes.

278
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,560
Is she trying to borrow money?

279
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,390
I'm not borrowing money.

280
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,810
Then what do you want?

281
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,700
Everyone knows
what our company is going through.

282
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,980
It is at risk.

283
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,130
I'm the only streamer in this company.

284
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,570
The stress is no joke.

285
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,120
As for the stress,

286
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,510
I won't talk about it.

287
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,340
But sales aren't getting any better.

288
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,610
So after racking my brains
for all kinds of solutions,

289
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,950
I finally found an excellent idea

290
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,610
which suits us perfectly.

291
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,270
I've invited a mysterious guest

292
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,890
to give both of you a special training.

293
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,180
Wait.

294
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,190
Who do you mean by "both of you"?

295
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,820
You

296
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,450
and also Mr Five.

297
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,550
I...

298
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,250
Stand there. Come back.

299
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,300
Xi Xi, I can't do this.
I'm scared of cameras.

300
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,620
Why not?

301
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,740
Neither can I.

302
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,230
I... I'm also afraid of cameras.

303
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,680
Mr Five.

304
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,880
Su Su.

305
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,410
Aren't you my best friends?

306
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,270
If both of you are my best friends,

307
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,900
then just do your best friend a favour,

308
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,130
will you?

309
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,590
Su Su, are you planning on
being a programmer for your whole life?

310
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,260
If you don't want to,

311
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,130
you should work hard and change your life.

312
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,250
No, no.

313
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,270
I've always wanted to be a programmer.

314
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,330
I enjoy being a programmer.

315
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,940
Fine, forget it.

316
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,100
I didn't expect you to do it.

317
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,850
But if you don't do it,
you can accompany Mr Five.

318
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,460
You have nothing to do anyway.

319
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,180
Just take it as a training.

320
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,620
Alright. I'll make myself clear.

321
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,100
I'm here to accompany Mr Five.

322
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,620
I will never live stream.

323
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,260
-Xi Xi.
-Mr Five.

324
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,340
Don't you wish
that more people get to wear

325
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,540
your beautiful denim jackets,

326
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,210
jeans and skirts?

327
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,570
I want it too.

328
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,300
But you saw it too.

329
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,260
I tried and I'm not a good fit
for a streamer.

330
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,450
No one was born a streamer.

331
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,560
Yuan Yuan.

332
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,990
She was the best streamer

333
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,099
in our company.

334
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,940
If you want to be a good streamer,

335
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,140
the most important thing
is to determine your goal first.

336
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,320
But you already have a goal,

337
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,400
so there is no reason not to work hard.

338
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,690
So what if you fail?

339
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,350
After you fail, pick yourself up
from where you've fallen

340
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,480
and give yourself another chance.

341
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,210
Don't worry. If you're not suitable
to be a streamer,

342
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,330
I will tell Xi Xi right away,

343
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,550
so that she won't waste her time on you.

344
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,900
That's not it!

345
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,290
Yuan Yuan, they told me already.

346
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,680
They really want to be good streamers.

347
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,620
I hope they really do.

348
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,740
You know what? Yuan Yuan is amazing.

349
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,100
She trained Xi Xi before.

350
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,620
So she will teach you well.

351
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,780
Then you should do it.

352
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,660
I'm keeping you company.

353
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,630
Where are you going?

354
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,530
Close your legs.

355
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,700
Stand up straight, pull your stomach in.

356
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,960
Straighten your legs.

357
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,430
Keep your back straight.

358
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,180
Introduce the clothes you're wearing,

359
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,700
then strike different poses.

360
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,920
You can do anything.

361
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,860
Showcase your body.

362
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,410
Showcase. Don't just spin around.

363
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,930
This shirt is great!

364
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,380
Showcase your clothes and your body.

365
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,490
Look over here

366
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,790
and interact with them, okay?

367
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,860
Showcase your figure.

368
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,720
Let people notice its beauty.

369
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,980
Especially this.

370
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,610
Look at the camera.

371
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,850
Hello, babes.

372
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,810
I'm your beloved Qian Xi Xi.

373
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,810
You mustn't miss this chance.

374
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,700
It's now or never.

375
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,780
You can pull it all you like.

376
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,910
No matter how hard you pull it,
it won't be torn.

377
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,610
No pills or deformation.

378
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,820
This is the best thing about Rui.

379
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,050
Why are you here?

380
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,010
Mr Duan, Xi Xi invited me

381
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,270
to train the new streamers.

382
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,550
Describe how it feels like
after you put it on.

383
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,780
So that they know
that you really like the clothes.

384
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,930
Hello, Mr Duan.

385
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,670
Come to the office.
There's a training session here

386
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,750
that can help you improve your sales.

387
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,380
Sure, I'll be right there.

388
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,620
No false lashes,

389
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,410
no red lips.

390
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,750
The biggest difference between being
a streamer and being a broadcaster

391
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,610
is that you have to be outstanding

392
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,450
while being approachable.

393
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,780
Mr Five, you look so cool when you run!

394
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,530
One, two, three.

395
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,820
I guess I'll be a programmer.

396
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,860
Go on, go on.

397
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,730
What are you doing?

398
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,940
Stand properly.

399
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,670
This training is only
to build your foundation.

400
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,660
Posture.

401
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,870
-Stand up straight.
-Stand properly.

402
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,580
-Lift your hips.
-You have to get changed

403
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,170
within two minutes.

404
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,090
Then you can be

405
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,530
a good streamer.

406
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,690
Go!

407
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,290
A training manual on
how to win large sales?

408
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,650
I found the good stuff.

409
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,980
The positioning of these brands

410
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,810
makes them likely to pay more attention

411
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,020
to high-end malls like QE.

412
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,700
Alright, I got it.

413
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,050
Thank you, Uncle Shen.

414
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,950
Why didn't Uncle Duan
show me this earlier?

415
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,060
Every streamer has to combine
her personality

416
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,390
with the brand's traits

417
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,850
in order to fully show off her charm.

418
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,930
Go!

419
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,210
Go up. Let's go!

420
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,850
I'm a streamer,

421
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,450
not an athlete.

422
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,050
Coach,

423
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,500
how long do we need?

424
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,910
Drink it and continue your training.

425
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,050
Zhang Jia Yun.

426
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,620
What are you doing?

427
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,820
Xi Xi, I think I'm good enough.

428
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,370
I don't need training.

429
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,210
Is this correct, Yuan Yuan?

430
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,330
Why are you drinking already?

431
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,370
We do not fit

432
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,940
your brand positioning very well.

433
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,930
Yes.

434
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,610
But thank you

435
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,160
for giving me this chance.

436
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,360
Yes, it's my duty. It's my duty.

437
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,880
Sorry for your loss.

438
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,370
Do the female consumers

439
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,900
like fashionistas?

440
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,660
Do they like skinny models?

441
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,010
No, they don't.

442
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,090
You have to remind them constantly,

443
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,760
that by wearing your clothes,

444
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,530
they can achieve anything.

445
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,380
Show them your face.

446
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,330
Idiot! Show your face!

447
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,810
How dare you hit me!

448
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,610
What are you doing?

449
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,900
I can't do this!

450
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,050
It's to show them the skirt.

451
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,270
We're selling products, aren't we?

452
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,170
Hi guys, I'm Yuan Yuan.

453
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,580
Follow me. Look at the camera.

454
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,670
Tell the camera this is your design.

455
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,930
It's your turn. Go.

456
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,700
Jia Yun?

457
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,050
It's been so long.

458
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,430
You know what?
Your live stream in Sanya was impressive.

459
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,950
Come. Sit down, sit down.

460
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Thank you, Mr Wu.

461
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,550
It’s a great honour
to have your compliment.

462
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,090
Mr Wu, Jia Yun is now

463
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,200
a signed streamer of Rui.

464
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,600
Really? That's great.

465
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,670
Why do you always have such a good taste?

466
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,060
I told you it's a waste for you
to be a sales assistant.

467
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,860
It's good to be a streamer.
You have a great future.

468
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,980
Mr Wu, thank you for your kind words.

469
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,860
But the most important thing

470
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,390
for an e-commerce streamer
is the brand.

471
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,120
Good product is a top priority.

472
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,820
-Am I right?
-I know what you mean.

473
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,740
Today, you and Mr Duan

474
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,710
are here to collaborate with me.

475
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,820
Mr Wu, you're really clever.

476
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,450
You hit the nail on the head.

477
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,420
Mr Wu, we really look forward

478
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,270
to collaborating with Pineapple.

479
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,600
You also watched our live stream in Sanya.

480
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,690
Our e-commerce live stream does not

481
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,120
apply to low-end product marketing only,

482
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,270
but also high-end product marketing.

483
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,380
Besides, we have

484
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,390
excellent streamers like Jia Yun.

485
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,520
If we work together,

486
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,810
I think Pineapple's image

487
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,530
will be greatly improved.

488
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,700
You're right.

489
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,220
Jia Yu has style and presence.

490
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,390
Pineapple's outfits

491
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,740
look good on her.

492
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,780
Mr Duan, you made a great choice.

493
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,780
Mr Wu, you are flattering me.

494
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,710
But our company

495
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,300
has a lot of good streamers.

496
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,290
Mr Wu, you have to have faith in us.

497
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,780
Of course I do.

498
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,330
This month we will launch

499
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,820
new products for the coming season.

500
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,860
I want to organise a live streaming.

501
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,820
We are in the midst
of planning our sales and operation.

502
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,030
I will notify you
as soon as we have an update.

503
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,270
I look forward
to working with you again, okay?

504
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,510
Then I'll go back
and wait for your update.

505
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,660
Thank you, Mr Wu.

506
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,500
Thank you, Mr Wu.

507
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,450
Alright.

508
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,210
This is weird.

509
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,140
What's wrong?

510
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,620
That was too easy.

511
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,170
Mr Wu is not usually like this.

512
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,050
He was fooling us.

513
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,860
Why would he do that?

514
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,020
Is there anything else?

515
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,210
Mr Wu,

516
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,400
you're fooling us, aren't you?

517
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,260
How... How could you say that?

518
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,060
Is something holding you back?

519
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,500
Just be frank with us.

520
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,500
Duan Ran, Chen Lang

521
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,990
has emptied out Rui.

522
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,060
Now Qian Xi Xi and Jia Yun

523
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,570
are your only streamers.

524
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,150
No brands are willing to work with you.

525
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,550
Pineapple has so many product lines.

526
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,260
We have men's, women's, summer, autumn,

527
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,940
jackets, shirts, skirts and so on.

528
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,670
You don't even have a streamer.

529
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,050
Can you handle this?

530
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,130
Mr Five,
we're training new streamers now.

531
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,100
They will be available soon.

532
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,390
During the live stream in Sanya,

533
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,910
Jia Yun came to your rescue.

534
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,700
Qian Xi Xi exceeded her target

535
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,100
and even cleaned the men's rooms.

536
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,260
I get it.

537
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,460
Chen Lang is a rascal.

538
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,810
He wanted to sacrifice our session

539
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,170
to threaten Mr Duan.

540
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,620
But we're doing business.

541
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,000
We need competence.

542
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,790
If you're competent,

543
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,870
I'll hand over the project to you
without hesitation.

544
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,330
But if you can't handle it,

545
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,450
stop making my life hard.

546
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,850
We need competition
to show our competence.

547
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,160
Why not hire both Chen Lang and us?

548
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,940
We'll compete against each other.

549
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,510
Whoever has the higher sales

550
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,900
will win this project.

551
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,020
How is that?

552
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,870
Yes, we'll promote Pineapple together.

553
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,930
The sales of Pineapple
will definitely grow by double.

554
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,800
Alright, although I have a contract
with Chen Lang,

555
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,660
I can talk with him.

556
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,780
Mr Five!

557
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,680
What's wrong with you?

558
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,220
Don't be like this. Let me tell you.

559
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,620
When I started to learn live streaming,

560
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,850
I was also terrible at it.

561
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,110
This is just the beginning.

562
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,420
Besides, you work really hard

563
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,390
during your training.

564
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,500
I believe you'll be able to master it.

565
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,900
Xi Xi,

566
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,260
I think I'm not a good fit
for streaming.

567
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,750
I feel uncomfortable as soon as
I step into the live stream room.

568
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,630
Who says you're not a good fit?

569
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,760
I told you that you have your own style.

570
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,550
But back in the live stream room,

571
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,950
you kept adjusting your standing posture.

572
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,450
Did you find it uncomfortable?

573
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,000
To be honest,
the training during these few days

574
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,500
was not that hard.

575
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,180
It's just my standing posture.

576
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,980
Since I was young, I had never...

577
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,290
I had never stood like that.

578
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,780
I get it now.

579
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,100
You didn't like standing like that,

580
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,050
so you restrained your posture.

581
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,550
So, during the entire session,

582
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,030
you only focused on your posture

583
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,230
which diverted your attention, right?

584
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,690
Then don't do it anymore.

585
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,030
We won't stand like that.

586
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,960
We'll do whatever's comfortable.

587
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,040
You know what, Mr Five?

588
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,980
Every streamer has her own charm.

589
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,570
What do you think is your charm?

590
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,590
What kind of charm do I have?

591
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,360
I just fool around while selling clothes.

592
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,980
Exactly.

593
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,980
Fooling around it is.

594
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,670
And you said you're selling clothes.

595
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,270
Your design and your talent,

596
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,410
aren't those your charms?

597
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,430
Is fooling around also a kind of charm?

598
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,140
It's a unique charm of yours.

599
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,820
Think about it.

600
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,820
Why do so many people like your designs

601
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,060
and your clothes?

602
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,940
Who are those people
who like your designs?

603
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,580
What is their lifestyle like?

604
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,450
These are your common interests.

605
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,400
They are your charms which sell
the product and attract followers.

606
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,050
Think about what I said.

607
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,410
Think about it.

608
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,950
Why are you sitting here?

609
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,290
Go and train.

610
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,700
What for?

611
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,820
I went out with you.

612
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,370
Look, my legs got thinner.

613
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,550
Drink some water and go training.

614
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,970
Mr Wu wants you to do it.

615
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,260
I'll drink War Horse.

616
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,560
Got to boost my energy.

617
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,820
Mr Wu wasn't sure about it.

618
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,030
He might not be able
to settle their contract

619
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,360
and persuade Chen Lang.

620
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,300
If he can't solve it,

621
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,020
I'll find other clients.

622
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,300
But after I get clients,

623
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,140
I have to count on you.

624
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,020
Why don't

625
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,980
you train with me?

626
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,630
Sure. As long as you're willing to train,

627
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,700
I'll do whatever you want.

628
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,100
Tell me. What do you need?

629
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,020
Dancing?

630
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,900
Definitely not dancing.

631
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,730
-I can't dance.
-You can't dance? Stop fooling me.

632
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,280
You used to learn dancing.

633
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,570
Come on.

634
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,750
As long as you're willing to train.

635
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,660
I can do anything
if you can train properly.

636
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,740
Come.

637
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,780
I remember Xi Xi

638
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,670
used to be addicted to dancing
for some time.

639
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,200
But she eventually gave up.

640
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,290
Is that so?

641
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,120
She has such bad coordination.

642
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,940
Could she even dance?
She could trip while walking.

643
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,820
She said

644
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,410
you asked her to be your dance partner.

645
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,810
Yes. And I regretted it right away.

646
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,690
She was stiff like a pole

647
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,100
while I danced away.

648
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,780
I thought I was pole dancing.

649
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,750
You should compliment her more often.

650
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,290
She actually
has many strong points, right?

651
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,180
She's already so full of herself
even though I don't compliment her.

652
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,980
If I do, she'd get a swollen head.

653
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,100
How was my idea?

654
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,460
I think it's not bad.

655
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,550
How about this? Later,

656
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,060
I will tell Mr Five.

657
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,290
I'll give her a link.

658
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,700
Come check it out
in the control room later.

659
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,030
Okay, take care of it for me.

660
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,050
Okay.

661
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,780
Look over there.

662
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,300
Come. Come here.

663
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,290
-Come here.
-What's the matter?

664
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,920
You know what? This is my first time
seeing Mr Duan dance.

665
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,210
Mr Duan,

666
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,450
actually,

667
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,660
deep down, you do admire her, don't you?

668
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,020
What do you mean?

669
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,290
Are you her spy?

670
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,010
If I were a spy, I wouldn't tell you this.

671
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,150
I am a part of your team.

672
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,060
If you're not a spy,

673
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,350
why do you keep talking about Qian Xi Xi?

674
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,020
Jia Yun is so beautiful.

675
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,020
What are you doing?

676
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,980
I'm recording a video.

677
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,290
Come here.

678
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,240
Just focus on Duan Ran.

679
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,860
Zoom in.

680
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,620
[Shapowei Art Zone,
Art, Life, Live]

681
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,420
Time's up.

682
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,929
Jia Yun looks stunning.

683
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,940
Mr Five's pose is amazing.

684
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,050
I've never seen her like that.

685
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,969
She's like a superstar.

686
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,770
Yuan Yuan, you blew me away.

687
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,260
It's only been a few days,

688
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,380
but they're totally different now.

689
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,800
Your success depends on good leadership.

690
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,310
This is just the beginning.

691
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,290
If they want to be good streamers,

692
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,460
there's still a long way to go.

693
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,680
Yuan Yuan, you're simply amazing.

694
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,110
It's such a waste
that you're not a streamer any more.

695
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,620
Live streaming companies tend to rely
too much on their leading streamers.

696
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,770
This is a common barrier in this field.

697
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,710
But in Rui,

698
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,050
you're willing to train new streamers

699
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,730
and give them resources to help them grow.

700
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,620
This is a good thing.

701
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,860
So, Mr Duan, don't worry.

702
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,730
They are all excellent.

703
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,840
I believe they'll be
better than me in no time.

704
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,220
Yuan Yuan, you're too humble.

705
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,550
When someone can do things
that she doesn't like so well,

706
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,660
what is that called?

707
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,970
It is called talent.

708
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,590
Look at me. I spent so many years

709
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,460
doing everything I could,

710
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,050
but I still can't beat you.

711
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,620
As for them,

712
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,200
there's still room for improvement.

713
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,730
We really need you.

714
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
Xi Xi, you're doing fine,

715
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,770
but the grass is always greener
on the other side.

716
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,330
Everyone has their own idea.

717
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,050
You're right.

718
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,460
Everyone has things
that they wish to pursue.

719
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,770
We can't control Yuan Yuan's thinking.

720
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,460
But, Yuan Yuan,
Rui will always be your home.

721
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,660
We will always welcome you
if you want to come back.

722
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,420
In fact, the time

723
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,140
I spent training new streamers here

724
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,660
made me recall
all the good memories in Rui.

725
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,760
Speaking of which,

726
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,190
I need to thank you, Mr Duan.

727
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,330
And Xi Xi, of course.

728
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,480
It's hard to let you leave.

729
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,730
Babe, my height is 165cm,

730
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,980
so this is how I look

731
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,790
with this stylish pair of jeans.

732
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,850
This is how it looks when seated.

733
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,450
And this is how it looks standing up.

734
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,140
Wear a pair of shoes
which shows your ankles.

735
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,310
This type of pants will make your legs
look very long.

736
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,420
Besides,

737
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,250
it'll show off your curves.

738
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,730
Anyway, they look good on me.

739
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,250
But most importantly,

740
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,410
this jeans has a nice design.

741
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,460
Today, we have more than just nice jeans.

742
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,460
As you can see,

743
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,970
there's a series of denim clothes,

744
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,850
shirts and jackets at the back.

745
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,990
These designs came from an amazing

746
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,530
and super talented designer.

747
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,660
This is her logo, Mr Five.

748
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,700
Our babes today

749
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,940
are very lucky

750
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,730
because today,

751
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,110
I've invited Mr Five
to the live stream room.

752
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,850
She will tell you

753
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,580
her stories about
the denim shirts and skirts,

754
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,180
and also share the denim series
with all of you.

755
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,700
And now,

756
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,750
we'll leave it to the talented Mr Five.

757
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,550
The live stream room is hers now.

758
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,300
You can do it.

759
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,180
Hi guys, I'm Mr Five.

760
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,460
As Xi Xi said earlier,

761
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,110
I designed the jeans that she was wearing,

762
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,940
including all the jeans,

763
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,140
shirts, jackets and pants here.
They're all my designs.

764
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,580
For example, this pair of jeans.

765
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,420
There's a slimming design at the bottom

766
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,220
that will make you look slimmer.

767
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,490
And the entire jeans...

768
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,740
This is the same.

769
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,350
My design doesn't have
any eye-catching features

770
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,220
such as tacked-on logos,

771
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,420
but its style...

772
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,200
What are these people talking about?

773
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,220
So it's worthless just because
it's not branded?

774
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,020
So what if she ran a stall before?

775
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,970
[I just fool around
while selling clothes.]

776
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,020
[That's right.]

777
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,430
[Fooling around it is.]

778
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,290
[Is fooling around also a kind of charm?]

779
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,970
[It's a unique charm of yours.]

780
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,800
So you guys like big names, do you?

781
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,340
But let me tell you,

782
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,830
the cost of those branded stuff

783
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,010
[only accounts for
a small part of the price.]

784
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,970
[The remaining amount
is the brand premium.]

785
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,990
Are you looking down
on independent designers?

786
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,730
Do big names equate good design?

787
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,070
[Even top notch designers started out
as independent designers.

788
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,730
[Those clothes are the assembly
line product of the design team.]

789
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:43,980
Impressive.

790
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,620
Don't let her attack the viewers.

791
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,680
I understand your doubts
about buying clothes online.

792
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,620
Because you can neither see it
nor touch it,

793
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,820
so you feel insecure.

794
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,360
Fine, today I’ll give you
a sense of security.

795
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,420
Mr Five!

796
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,140
Xi Xi was right.

797
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,970
I graduated from a design school,

798
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,640
but my stuff are not as luxurious
as you think.

799
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,310
Because I sell my clothes

800
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,010
from a stall on Cat Street.

801
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,530
But I saw all kinds of girls

802
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,050
on Cat Street.

803
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,590
I realised every girl

804
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,050
has her own charm.

805
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,970
They can wear
whatever clothes they want.

806
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,380
Whether you're tall, short, fat or skinny,

807
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,010
these are not important.

808
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,990
What matters is
that after you put them on,

809
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,040
you feel confident and pretty.

810
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,220
I don't get it. You're not models.

811
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,830
Why should you care
if those clothes are eye-catching?

812
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,890
Shouldn't you care

813
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,490
if they can bring out your beauty

814
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,530
after putting them on?

815
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,270
If you can't even understand this logic,

816
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,050
then don't buy my clothes.

817
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,970
Babes,

818
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,620
what Mr Five meant was

819
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,850
we should wear clothes that suit us,

820
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,460
not change ourselves to suit the clothes.

821
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,770
Am I right, Mr Five?

822
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,220
This is our current condition.

823
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,070
In our country,
there are a lot of excellent

824
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,420
and original designers.

825
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,940
They have some pretty distinctive styles.

826
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,290
But they need more opportunities

827
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,110
and platforms to support them.

828
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,590
I believe that in the future,

829
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,590
she will come out
with even more beautiful outfits

830
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,520
and more attractive denim series.

831
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,020
Since I'm standing here,

832
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,140
this live stream room belongs to me.

833
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,050
Of course it is yours.

834
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,290
Look at them.

835
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,080
All of them said
that my brand is a generic brand.

836
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,930
You're absolutely right.

837
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,990
Because all the famous brands

838
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,810
started off as generic brands.

839
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,700
I designed

840
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,870
all the clothes here myself.

841
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,750
Every single stroke was modified
over and over again.

842
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,130
Besides, I made every single piece

843
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,730
with my own hands.

844
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:06,160
Every stitch has also been modified
over and over again.

845
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,220
I think my designs

846
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,460
are on par with the famous brands.

847
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,890
Besides, I will work hard

848
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,090
so that people
will notice my strength.

849
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,370
Xi Xi.

850
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,990
Don't you want me
to be an excellent streamer?

851
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,980
Of course.

852
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,000
Now I'm telling you that I can do it.

853
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:23,980
However,

854
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,850
if you always let me rely on you,

855
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,900
I will never make it.

856
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,150
This live stream room is yours.

857
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,700
Go for it.

858
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,030
Let's go back to our topic.

859
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,010
Now I will introduce to you

860
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,100
a denim jacket.

861
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,770
Just like what I said,

862
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,290
this jacket of mine

863
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,440
doesn't have any dazzling features.

864
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,270
There are no tassels, no logos,

865
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,850
[no sequins,]

866
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,310
[but after you put it on,]

867
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,110
[it will set off your waistline.]

868
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,100
[Besides,]

869
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,310
[do you know this pair of jeans
can make you look slim?]

870
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,410
[A person that's 60kg]

871
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,140
[will look like she's 47.5kg.]

872
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,420
This is what we should aim for

873
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,050
when wearing clothes.

874
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,050
You should look good in it.

875
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,540
It should bring out your beauty,
am I right?

876
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,650
[Total Amount]

877
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,550
Let me try it on for you.

878
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,080
We have many new followers.

879
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,940
It's starting to pick up.

880
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,350
[Total Amount]

881
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,370
It's working.

882
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,990
-It's working.
-There's a sudden spike!

883
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,050
It's sold out!

884
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,820
That was fast! That was fast!

885
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,830
Not only can this money save our company,

886
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,180
it can also be used on marketing

887
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,310
and advertisement.

888
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,550
Control your emotions.

889
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,340
Why should I? I made money!

890
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,860
We did it! We did it!
