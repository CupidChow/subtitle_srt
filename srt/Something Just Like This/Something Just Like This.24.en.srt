00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,150
You need to eat something.

174
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,570
We can discuss it later.

175
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,230
Joy begets sadness.

176
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
Things were fine yesterday.

177
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,200
And today we suddenly got trouble.

178
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,380
It was certainly strange.

179
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,740
We got a raid today

180
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,230
after the complaint was made yesterday.

181
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,620
The negative online comments

182
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,750
about us are spreading like wildfire.

183
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,330
Our priority now is to find out

184
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,790
the cause of the problem.

185
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,030
It would help if the girl could
just step forward and speak.

186
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,270
No matter what,

187
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,150
we were rude to her.

188
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,650
She deserves an apology.

189
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,610
That's for sure.

190
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,810
Don't worry.

191
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,020
I'll talk this over with Mr Mu Jr,

192
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,110
to get his opinion on this.

193
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,200
It'll be fine, okay?

194
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,060
Who's that?

195
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,250
Ouyang.

196
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,780
[Duan Ran.]

197
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,100
[Well,]

198
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,790
[I have bad news for you.]

199
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,180
[We lost Xiao Xiao.]

200
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,840
Didn't we have an agreement?

201
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,600
[It was unexpected.]

202
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,150
She informed me over the phone yesterday.

203
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,800
She probably got a better offer elsewhere.

204
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,620
That's why I'm informing you at once.

205
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,050
Okay, got it.

206
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,060
Thanks.

207
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,570
What's going on?

208
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,530
Xiao Xiao turned her back on us.

209
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,200
She's not signing with us.

210
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,650
That's sudden.

211
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,750
Someone could have played a trick on us.

212
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,980
I don't think so.

213
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,410
Not many knew about this matter.

214
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,160
That day,

215
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,150
a few people were with us.

216
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,470
Cola.

217
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,440
-Little Duckling.
-Little Duckling.

218
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,750
-Yuanbao.
-Yuanbao.

219
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,160
Zhang Jia Yun.

220
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,370
And Mr Five. That's all of them.

221
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,730
One of them

222
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,490
could be the culprit,
if it was someone's doing.

223
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,190
Do you really think

224
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,910
it's one of them?

225
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,300
Nothing can't be sure yet

226
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,530
as it's just a guess.

227
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,500
We'll just see about it.

228
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,980
Dealing with the complaint
is our top priority now.

229
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,080
Take a bite.

230
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,780
How is it?

231
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,750
Good.

232
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,980
Wipe your mouth.

233
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,690
It's still there.

234
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,990
-Is it clean now?
-Yes.

235
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,220
Take another bite.

236
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,520
Is this the right place?

237
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,590
I think so.

238
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,310
Number two.

239
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,710
This is it.

240
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,960
We've found it.

241
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,100
Yes.

242
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,200
Ring the doorbell.

243
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,920
Why can't you do it?

244
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,610
I'm not good at speaking.

245
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,070
I'm worried that
I might say the wrong thing.

246
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,870
I'll do it then.

247
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,100
We must do this.

248
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,140
Who's that?

249
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,300
[Ms Fei Fei, this is Su Su.]

250
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,070
[Yu Shi and I are here
to give you an apology.]

251
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,350
[Hello, Ms Fei Fei.]

252
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,850
We've brought the hair
removal tool with us.

253
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,930
It has a rating

254
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,080
of 99.99% on the Internet.

255
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,750
Just leave!

256
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,780
I'm sorry, Ms Fei Fei.

257
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,460
Please accept my apology.

258
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,230
[I was rude]

259
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,600
[over the phone.]

260
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,240
[I handled it poorly.]

261
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,500
[My apologies.]

262
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,670
[There's a saying.]

263
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,570
[Everybody makes mistakes
and nobody's perfect.]

264
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,900
[Mr Lu Xun said it well.]

265
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,920
[One who made a mistake deserves a chance]

266
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,460
[to make it right.]

267
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,950
[Ms Fei Fei,]

268
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,440
[I hope you'll accept my sincere apology.]

269
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,480
Enough!

270
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,190
Get out of my sight!

271
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,140
Didn't you say it well?

272
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,520
Did it really help?

273
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,800
She refused to see us.

274
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,620
Well...

275
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,510
Let's go.

276
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,340
She's still hasn't
got over the whole thing.

277
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,220
I guess

278
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,860
we have to be patient
for the time being.

279
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,200
At least,

280
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,880
we know she's living here.

281
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,050
We can try again in another while.

282
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,310
Let's go check out some cafes nearby.

283
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,580
We can get a coffee

284
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,790
while she cools off.

285
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,610
We can calm ourselves down, too

286
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,490
Su Su,

287
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,430
we can't give up easily at this moment.

288
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,250
You're sweating.

289
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,850
Wipe it off.

290
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,130
Let me hold this for you.

291
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,330
We shouldn't stop until we succeed.

292
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,660
This was our first attempt.

293
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,060
It's just the first step.

294
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,980
We'll try again.

295
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,230
We'll try a second time if we fail.

296
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,900
If not, we'll still go for it again.

297
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,910
I'm sure she...

298
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,410
How was it?

299
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,700
I just broke off with someone
and you won't know how I feel!

300
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,950
Doesn't she know that is illegal.

301
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Are you all right?

302
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,850
I guess she feels better right now.

303
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,430
My goodness.

304
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,210
Although we were at fault,

305
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
she shouldn't have done this to you.

306
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,600
You're all wet.

307
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,540
She's just too much.

308
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,280
I'll do it myself.

309
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
I wonder what's the matter
with that Fei Fei.

310
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,079
She can reject your apology.

311
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,680
But she didn't have to be so hostile.

312
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,300
Let's just forget it.

313
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,290
No, wait.

314
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,710
Su Su.

315
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,970
I'm already all wet.
She vented her frustration.

316
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
Let's just accept it.

317
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,460
Didn't we agree not to give up?

318
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,220
Let's try again.

319
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,980
Her growing a beard

320
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,960
could be the reason she's mad.

321
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,240
There are many aspects

322
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,080
in emotional management.

323
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,100
Mentally, she would be maniac.

324
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,860
She could be irritable this
moment, and then become depressed.

325
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,720
That sounds serious.

326
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,300
Psychologically,

327
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,560
it's called emotional dysregulation.

328
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,650
She'll get mad when she's emotional.

329
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,590
When the mood goes down

330
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,040
she becomes depressed.

331
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,530
It's scary.

332
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,970
What happens next?

333
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,510
That is hard to say.

334
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,770
She would be restless and lethargic,
as well as crying and shouting.

335
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,330
It's possible to kill, or be killed.

336
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,970
Killing?

337
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,990
Where are you going?

338
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,660
I feel something is wrong with her.

339
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,990
Since when did you care?

340
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,350
I'm just worried.

341
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,390
Fei Fei?

342
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,800
It's us, Fei Fei.

343
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,250
We're here, again.

344
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,210
Mr Mu.

345
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,560
The beard issue
has spread on the Internet.

346
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,050
It's all over.

347
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,250
Our office was raided today.

348
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,760
We're closed temporarily.

349
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,670
What are we suppose to do now?

350
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,710
Xi Xi.

351
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,910
I was shocked when I heard the news.

352
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,360
How could this happen?

353
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,220
Let's be honest.

354
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,780
Is there any problem with your products?

355
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,330
Do you think we'll still be cooperating

356
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,820
if there's a problem?

357
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,570
Could there be a
problem in the production?

358
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,220
If it's a quality issue,

359
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,940
then we need to handle it
as a case of PR crisis.

360
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,180
All we need is a confirmation.

361
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,340
Perfect Blue has been
operating for decades.

362
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,660
Our quality control is strict.

363
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,990
Absolutely no problem.

364
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,990
I think the girl, Fei Fei,

365
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,280
is an anti-fan.

366
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,540
She could be hired by our competitor.

367
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,580
It's a common tactic.

368
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,240
We still need to resolve this.

369
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,910
It's getting worse.

370
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,080
We're in the brink of collapse.

371
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,770
I promise you.

372
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,630
We'll give you the full support

373
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,790
to resolve this matter.

374
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,090
We appreciate it.

375
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,760
You've done this to me,

376
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,390
you should feel better, right?

377
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,890
We're here to sincerely apologise to you.

378
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,380
-Open the door.
-Please.

379
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,670
Please, Fei Fei.

380
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,640
Give us a chance.

381
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,880
Please...

382
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,020
This...

383
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,910
Fei Fei.

384
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,930
What do you want?

385
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,730
When is this going to end?

386
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,450
Fei Fei.

387
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,820
What are you trying to do?

388
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,960
It's none of your business.

389
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,390
Mr Mu.

390
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,280
Speak!

391
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,500
The report on the quality check is out.

392
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,370
Our liquid foundation

393
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,700
does contain excessive hormones.

394
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,920
You'll feel better after crying.

395
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,620
Everything will be fine.

396
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,890
No, it won't.

397
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,360
Zhang Si dumped me.

398
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,620
It won't be good anymore.

399
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,050
-Zhang Si?
-Zhang Si?

400
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,500
Who's that?

401
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,280
This.

402
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,420
Do you know why?

403
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,170
After using the
Blue Perfect cosmetic product,

404
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,980
I started growing a beard.

405
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,670
Zhang Si broke up with me because of this.

406
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,200
Now listen to me carefully.

407
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,020
Handle this as a case of PR crisis.

408
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,510
What about Rui?

409
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,890
Should we inform Mr Duan about this?

410
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,070
Just forget about them.

411
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,150
We can barely save ourselves right now.

412
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,190
Perfect Blue

413
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,910
won't go down just yet.

414
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,080
I'm sorry, Fei Fei.

415
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,290
We really don't know
what's wrong with Perfect Blue.

416
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,880
We can promise you

417
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,900
to resolve this matter.

418
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,410
We'll also give you a compensation.

419
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,550
No.

420
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,950
I don't want that.

421
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,800
Are you sure?

422
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,480
Can you understand my pain

423
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,900
after breaking up with Zhang Si?

424
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,720
Do you think

425
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,010
the compensation and your apologies

426
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,370
could make up for this?

427
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,040
We were deeply in love.

428
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,780
Everything is ruined

429
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,770
just because of your product.

430
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,360
It's all over.

431
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,500
Fei Fei.

432
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,070
About love

433
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,400
and Zhang Si...

434
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,020
Just shut up!

435
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,030
I don't want to listen anymore.

436
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,400
Just leave at once.

437
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,360
Leave now!

438
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,950
Get the hell out of here!

439
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,210
Leave now!

440
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,850
-We're leaving.
-We're leaving.

441
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,300
We're leaving.

442
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,950
We're leaving at once.

443
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,580
You must control your emotions.

444
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,130
We're leaving now.

445
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,030
Get some water, cool yourself down.

446
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,350
Go.

447
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,190
-What are you doing?
-Fei Fei.

448
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,800
You may not want to listen to us.

449
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,210
But I must say this.

450
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,280
Let me finish.

451
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,140
You may not forgive us.

452
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,460
But you must not hurt yourself.

453
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,360
If the guy broke up with you

454
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,950
just because of your beard,

455
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,970
then he's just a scoundrel.

456
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,290
How could you hurt yourself for such guy?

457
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,260
Don't hurt yourself for anyone, okay?

458
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,360
Bye.

459
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,210
Hello, Mr Ding.

460
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,460
Are you ready to
negotiate with Perfect Blue?

461
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,270
Perfect Blue

462
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,160
has no other choice

463
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,480
but us.

464
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,090
[You're really good in
seizing good opportunities.]

465
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,790
I'll take it as praise, Mr Chen.

466
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,520
So long as Duan Ran feels the pain,

467
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,020
it's worth my time.

468
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
I guess we share the same sentiment.

469
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,600
[I've informed the media.]

470
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,550
The news should be out any time.

471
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,920
[He won't be able to get out of this.]

472
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,660
I'm just afraid the effect will die down.

473
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,770
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

474
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,350
It's just the beginning.

475
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,610
[There are more surprises coming up.]

476
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,970
Fine.

477
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,260
Just be careful, Mr Ding.

478
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,680
-I'll watch your back.
-Chen Lang.

479
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,310
[Ask yourself.]

480
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,480
Have you ever given me
a full assurance on that?

481
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,660
Mr Ding.

482
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,440
One of the broadcasters in Rui is my spy.

483
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,750
When Rui falls,

484
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,120
all their broadcasters

485
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,970
shall be ours.

486
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,570
I shall await your good news then.

487
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,360
It's late over there, right?

488
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,590
Get some rest and take care.

489
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,450
Are you tired?

490
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,170
I'm in a bad mood.

491
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,350
What's going on?

492
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,570
It's even worse now.

493
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,400
Hello.

494
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,680
Hello.

495
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,530
Ouyang.

496
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,910
[I heard that something
happened to Perfect Blue, right?]

497
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,720
How's the situation?

498
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,800
I know that and am working on it now

499
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,410
[Anyway, if you need help,
please feel free to ask.]

500
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,470
Okay, I got it. Thanks.

501
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,980
Are you all right?

502
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,270
Are you jealous?

503
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,040
I don't feel good.

504
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,980
It's all in the past.

505
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,310
I still don't feel good.

506
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,050
I didn't say anything,
just go if you want.

507
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,470
I won't see her.

508
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,850
You'll think I'm so stingy.

509
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,560
Aren't you stingy?

510
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,280
Yes, I am.

511
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,480
-It's Su Su and Yu Shi
-You...

525
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,890
There's nothing we can do to pacify her.

526
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,000
Look like there's no way.

527

You're right.

529

Can't you think of a way?

530

Hello, everyone.

575
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,440
The Perfect Blue's quality issue

576
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,170
has triggered a wave of
public opinion recently.

577
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,200
All sectors of the community
have questioned our products.

578
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,800
So today I'm making an announcement

579
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,510
that our cosmetic products

580
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,970
have no quality problems.

581
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,200
Of course,

582
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,260
it doesn't rule out the product spoilage

583
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,200
is due to our sole agent's logistics

584
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,730
and warehousing problems.

585
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,240
We'll carry out an investigation

586
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,600

trust in Cloud Live.

There's a problem.

to the one with Rui Live.

deviations in the numbers.

00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,830
Su Su.

681
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,090
Are you okay?

682
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,410
I'm fine.

683
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,120
I'm fixing the computer.

684
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,790
Are you still thinking about Fei Fei?

685
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,280
I want to look for Zhang Si.

686
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,660
You know Fei Fei's situation.

687
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,680
She's in a mess.

688
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,980
We don't know what happened to them.

689
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,290
Let's go and help her find Zhang Si.

690
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,650
There might be a
misunderstanding between them.

691
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,100
But...

692
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,480
But I think we shouldn't involve ourselves

693
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,370
in this kind of matter.

694
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,190
There's nothing much we can do.

695
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,990
If we poke our nose into this,

696
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,880
it may make it even worse.

697
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,730
What should we do then?

698
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,960
Like she said,

699
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,550
if they broke up because of us,

700
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,010
then we must do something.

701
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,620
Why don't we try to help her?

702
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,830
Just calm down.

703
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,430
I think you're a unique person,

704
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,710
as you're generous

705
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,850
and helpful.

706
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,850
-But you have to be careful.
-Are you with me?

707
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,920
Anyway, I will go by myself.

708
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,110
Su Su.

709
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,730
Mr Duan wants to talk to you.

710
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,080
I've read the data.

711
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,330
There're about 200 customers in Xiamen

712
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,270
who have bought the foundation.

713
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,200
They're spread across the city.

714
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,190
This is the plan.

715
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,250
Mr Five and Mao

716
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,810
will handle the Jimei area.

717
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,550
The two of you will
handle the Xinglin area.

718
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,480
Jia Yun and I will handle Daonei.

719
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,320
Xinglin is so far away.

720
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,520
Do you want to exchange
with me, Mr Five?

721
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,980
No problem.

722
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,260
I've done an estimation.

723
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,410
The three of you are handling about 50.

724
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,220
Mao and I have about 60 to cover.

725
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,660
You want to do an exchange?

726
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,100
I'm okay with it.

727
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,660
It's actually not too far away, Cola.

728
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,360
Enough of exchanging places.

729
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,980
When you reach their house,

730
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,170
let them have a refund automatically.

731
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,340
Su Su will handle it.

732
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,820
They'll get it at once.

733
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,060
I want to take a leave, Mr Duan.

734
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,400
What is it?

735
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,710
I'm actually unwell these two days.

736
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,350
Jia Yun will stay in the office

737
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,550
to handle the refund.

738
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,250
I'll go to Daonei by myself.

739
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,880
Not a problem.

740
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,290
All clear?

741
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,590
Let's move.

742
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,900
You dare to sell defective
products during the live sessions.

743
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,880
Aren't you unscrupulous to do such thing?

744
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,130
We didn't know about the quality problem.

745
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,430
-We won't do it if there's a problem.
-Stop pretending.

746
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,450
Does apologising and refunding help?

747
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,710
I want to file a report.

748
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,760
Anyone home?

749
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,330
Anyone there?

750
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,850
Hello, I'm from Rui Live.

751
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:22,320
You bought a bottle of liquid foundation

752
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,230
during our live session

753
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,380
on 25th of August, right?

754
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,790
What's the matter?

755
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,690
It was our fault.

756
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,160
We don't wish to see anything bad

757
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,560
happen to you again.

758
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,770
If you buy anything
during our live session,

759
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,450
we'll give you a full rebate.

760
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,370
-Really?
-Yes.

761
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,780
Don't worry.

762
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,220
Nobody at home.

763
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,840
Do you have any discomfort after using it?

764
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,250
No.

765
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,610
Next season,

766
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,930
not only makeup products,

767
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,350
we have clothes, shoes and bags

768
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,380
that you'd like.

769
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,560
Well,

770
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,190
the liquid foundation

771
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,420
has some quality issue.

772
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,440
So our company

773
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,640
is giving you a refund.

774
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,890
-Don't worry.
-I'll watch your live again.

775
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,020
-The records are here.
-Be sure to give me a rebate, okay?

776
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,290
-Sure.
-Don't worry.

777
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,170
You're now our VIP.

778
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,160
We don't have VIPs.

779
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Okay.

780
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,420
We don't give rebates either.

781
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,600
Is it because she's nice looking?

782
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,950
Am I not helping the company?

783
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,880
I would have beaten her
if I was my old self.

784
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,600
Little Duckling.

785
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,150
Little Duckling.

786
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,280
You're loafing again.

787
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,970
I'm exhausted.

788
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,050
How is it going?

789
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,310
It's all here.

790
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,660
The remaining customers are not at home.

791
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,490
There are still so many.

792
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,120
Let's hurry up.

793
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:27,110
-Let's take a break.
-It's getting late.

794
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,310
Let's go, Yuanbao.

795
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,860
-Wait for me.
-I want to quit.

796
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,780
Have you seen Su Su today?

797
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,800
We didn't see her.

798
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,190
Have you seen Su Su?

799
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,420
No.

800
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,590
The red lipstick is really nice.

801
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,950
I think so too.

802
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,700
Have you seen it?

803
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,840
-What?
-Perfect Blue's liquid foundation.

804
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,900
Yes.

805
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,480
I heard.

806
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,000
I just bought it and haven't used it yet.
