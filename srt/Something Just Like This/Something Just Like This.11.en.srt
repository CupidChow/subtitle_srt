[Episode 11]

4
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,539
How did it go?

5
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,160
I wish we had never gone there.
It was all for nothing.

6
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,510
Couldn't you find anything
from the three warehouses?

7
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,500
Two of them wouldn't even
allow us to go inside.

8
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,180
They refused to deal with
brand owners like us.

9
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,600
And we couldn't even see
the leftover items.

10
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,060
Isn't there another
target left on our list?

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,520
Nothing here yet.

12
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,430
What about over at your side?

13
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,820
Nope.

14
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,740
What about you, Su Su?

15
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,660
I haven't got anything yet.

16
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,420
How about this one?

17
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,000
The fabric is unacceptable.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,270
We could change the cut

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,500
but not the fabric.

20
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,800
No matter how,

21
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,640
we can't sell this.

22
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,610
Thanks to Chen Lang,

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,480
we lost our supply chain.

24
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,770
If we put this on sale,

25
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,820
managing product returns
will be a real handful.

26
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,620
We'll lose our customers and
get a bad reputation.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,570
This won't work, Yuan Yuan.

28
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,990
And too bad we don't have
a reliable supply chain.

29
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,950
There must be a way out of this.

30
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,770
Hello.

31
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,730
Yes, I'm the landlord's daughter.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,890
What?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,350
Noises?

34
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,430
You don't know what's happening inside?

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,990
I'll go check it out the soonest I can.

36
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,610
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,980
I'm so sorry.

38
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,430
Sorry for the trouble.

39
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,810
What's going on, Xi Xi?

40
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,770
I got a call from the Municipal Office.

41
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,220
They were complaining to me

42
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,730
that lately my tenant is always
making noises in the house.

43
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,400
I have to go settle this at once.

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,470
Just go. We can handle this.

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,170
We'll get in touch with you.

46
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,710
I'll leave it to you.

47
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,610
It's nothing.

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,430
-Don't worry.
-Bye.

49
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,730
Let's continue finding.

50
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,810
I believe I'll make the cut.

51
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,410
So I came here to apply
for the broadcaster job.

52
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,940
Hi, everyone. I'm Mei Li.

53
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,220
It's recording, right?

54
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,760
I can make money being
an internet celebrity.

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,160
Making lots of money.

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,550
I'm a little nervous.

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,920
Being a broadcaster is
like selling houses.

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,390
I used to be a chef.

59
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,290
I've had this talent since I was young.

60
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,730
Good.

61
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,940
What do you think?

62
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,570
Okay.

63
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,850
It's done.

64
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,120
Xi Xi.

65
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,370
Enough playing for today.
The meal's ready.

66
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,909
Duan Ran took our money.

67
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,690
I saw it.

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
He was just playing around with you.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,659
You can play with him after your meal.

70
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,620
Let's go shopping.

71
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,880
Come catch me. You can't catch me.

72
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,560
Xiao Bai.

73
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,760
Open the door, Xiao Bai.

74
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,780
Open the door.

75
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,850
This is Qian Xi Xi.

76
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,330
What took you so long?

77
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,990
Hello, Ms Qian.

78
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,690
Switch it off, quick.

79
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,660
I got a call from the Municipal Office.

80
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,430
They received complaints
from the neighbourhood.

81
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,500
The people are complaining

82
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,310
about the loud noises you made.

83
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,720
What's going on with you, Xiao Bai?

84
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,590
This house isn't big.

85
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,920
And yet it's full of all kinds of stuff.

86
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
What's with the big machine?

87
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,500
It's as if you're producing
biochemical weapons.

88
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,460
No, Ms Xi Xi.

89
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,700
That's a coffee grinder.

90
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,570
It made all the noises.

91
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:35,120
I can't find anywhere else
for it in the house

92
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,690
except to put it over there.

93
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,060
I've kept reminding you
when you first moved in.

95
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,690
This is an old house.

96
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,550
The neighbours around
here are elderly folks.

97
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,400
You must always be mindful

98
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,950
not to cause disturbance
to the neighborhood.

99
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,020
The elderly folks are no
longer around here.

100
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,420
Now it's all young
neighbours living here.

101
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,290
No matter who,

102
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,890
no disturbance.

103
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,870
There is so much equipment.

104
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,990
Do you grind the coffee everyday?

105
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,850
Aren't you going to school?

106
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,620
I'm in my fourth year at university.

107
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,600
There won't be classes everyday.

108
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,830
And now,

109
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,990
I'm trying hard to realise my dream.

110
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,190
I'm using my beloved coffee beans

111
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,810
to make several types
of bulletproof coffee.

112
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,910
Bulletproof coffee?

113
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,230
This was originally

114
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,000
the first energy drink in Silicon Valley.

115
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,289
It can make you feel full and refreshed.

116
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,580
It's quite popular among fitness lovers.

117
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,780
My bulletproof coffee is simply awesome.

118
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,330
The ratio of the drink's ingredients

119
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,110
is calculated by a formula.

120
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,170
Are these the coffee beans? Smells nice.

121
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,700
What formula do you use?

122
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,010
I'm a food engineer.

123
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,620
The ingredients include

124
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,790
butter, coconut oil and coffee.

125
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,330
I was so accurate

126
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,880
that it was calculated

127
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,290
up to the three decimal places.

128
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,650
This is how the drink is made.

129
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,330
Not only is it delicious, it makes
you feel full and refreshed,

130
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,760
and it's creamy, too.

131
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,590
Just try it.

132
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,310
Yuanbaobao Bulletproof Coffee?

133
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,060
Your coffee is bulletproof

134
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,620
but my house isn't.

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,180
Stop worrying. Try it.

136
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,580
The bottle looks kind of fun.

137
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,980
The taste

138
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,960
is rather unique.

139
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,970
It's quite mellow.

140
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,370
So it contains

141
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,370
-coconut oil and butter?
-Yes.

142
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,870
I think,

143
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,730
if my coffee is brought to market,

144
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,310
it'll be sensational and sell well.

145
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,740
Xiao Bai.

146
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,200
The production of this coffee of yours

147
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,230
is up until what stage?

148
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,750
As a matter of fact,

149
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,240
I've got

150
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,340
the business paperwork done.

151
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,570
Not only that,

152
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,980
I've also signed an agreement

153
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,300
with a bottling company.

154
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,400
Now I'm thinking,

155
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,420
how should I best market it?

156
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,740
You mean there are already similar coffees

157
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,480
on the market right now?

158
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,680
But they're only available online.

159
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,440
Have you ever thought of
doing a live stream?

160
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,420
Yes.

161
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,340
I actually bought myself the equipment.

162
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,100
Then I did it at home.

163
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,910
However, I didn't like the result.

164
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,600
Maybe I'm lacking the skills.

165
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,490
Yuanbaobao Bulletproof Coffee.

166
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,060
Yuanbaobao.

167
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,210
Yuan Bao is my nickname.

168
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,740
Yuan Bao.

169
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,330
Yuanbaobao.

170
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,100
Do you know what's the
greatest fate of all?

171
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,090
The encounter of Qian Xi Xi and
Yuan Bao right here at this moment

172
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,670
is the greatest fate given by heaven.

173
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,240
[Coca-Cola]

174
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,380
Hi, everyone. I'm Li Ke Ke.

175
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,200
My friends all call me Cola.

176
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,440
I usually like to drink Coke.

177
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,980
I'm a performance arts graduate
from the Communication University.

178
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,810
Although I just graduated,

179
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,050
I already have three months
of experience as a streamer.

180
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,640
My hobbies

181
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,300
are singing, dancing and performing.

182
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,920
If I'm given a chance,

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,740
I'll let everyone remember me.

184
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,230
Look at her.

185
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,230
Doesn't she resemble Yuan Yuan?

186
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,850
Is she the spokesperson for Coca-Cola?

187
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,980
What are you doing, girl?

188
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,390
I look like no one.

189
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,630
I don't endorse anything.

190
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,100
I am who I am.

191
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,210
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,280
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,510
Excuse me, please line up.

194
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,370
I have something urgent.

195
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,130
Line up.

196
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,550
I came to find my friend.

197
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,620
-Over here.
-Cola.

198
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,560
You are?

199
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,390
My name is Little Yellow Duck.

200
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,160
Your clothes even have a
little yellow duck on it.

201
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,710
Wearing such a T-shirt

202
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,560
makes me at least five
to ten years younger.

203
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,190
And I'm wearing a
high-waist pleated skirt

204
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,550
with a pair of little white shoes.

205
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,680
Everyone will think I'm a school girl.

206
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,040
She's good.

207
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,460
We don’t have a broadcaster who
promotes brands of this age.

208
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,700
It'll make you look outstanding.

209
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,410
She has an aura almost
similar to Yuan Yuan's.

210
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,530
I think this little girl is pretty cute.

211
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,030
I think Mr Duan Jr has a keen
eye in picking the candidates.

212
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,850
I believe I have the talent
in picking a streamer.

213
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,040
The streamer is good

214
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,590
but she's displaying only
a few sets of clothes

215
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,130
which I think is simply insufficient.

216
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,010
She's right.

217
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,600
We spent the whole day finding just
about 100 pieces of leftover items.

218
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,130
It's not even enough for
today's live stream.

219
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't worry about this.

220
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,190
Rest assured.

221
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,910
We'll find a way.

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,660
I'm already thinking about
the product supply.

223
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,920
It'll be settled soon.

224
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,490
Stop worrying.

225
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,740
I trust you, Mr Duan Jr.

226
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,050
With your leadership, we can't go wrong.

227
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,750
I just love to listen to you.

228
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,940
What's this gathering and talking about?

229
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,010
Where have you been?
We're looking for you.

230
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,520
I attended to some personal matters.

231
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,510
Take this.

232
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
Each person gets one.

233
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,680
What's that?

234
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,590
You didn't even let me
know where you've been.

235
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,670
Coffee.

236
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,490
This is the solution to the problem.

237
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,070
What is it?

238
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,290
Yuanbaobao Bulletproof Coffee.

239
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,880
Bet you all haven't taken your lunch yet.

240
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,220
Try this coffee.

241
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,000
How is it?

242
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,780
Give me some feedback, quick.

243
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,230
What's the feeling?

244
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,330
I somehow feel that
it's quite different

245
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,020
from the usual coffee I have.

246
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,760
But the feeling is not bad.

247
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,840
It's unique.

248
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,510
I don't feel anything special about it.

249
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,230
Try drinking again.

250
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,540
Why aren't you drinking it, Duan Ran?

251
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,450
How is it?

252
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,170
I don't know what's special about it.

253
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,650
That's right.

254
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,310
Let me introduce it to you.

255
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,560
Everyone, let me give you an introduction.

256
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,410
This is bulletproof coffee

257
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,160
which makes you feel full and refreshed.

258
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,410
It even makes us feel full?

259
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,040
-Making us feel full.
-This greasy feeling

260
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,060
makes us feel full without
having to eat.

261
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,180
Ms Qian.

262
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You went out to source for products.

263
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,680
And you brought this back instead.

264
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,120
Are you going to feature coffee?

265
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,610
Exactly.

266
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,990
Tell me your idea.

267
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,610
I think you failed to
see the big picture,

268
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,260
so that's why you could even think of

269
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,060
such low-end product with a meager
profit margin of less than a yuan.

270
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,300
Even a piece of apparel at its
lowest profit margin

271
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,450
could fetch a
return of 30 percent of its value.

272
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,500
Right?

273
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,910
How much is a cup of coffee?

274
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,490
How much is a piece of apparel?

275
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,640
Don't you know the difference?

276
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,840
How many do you need to sell before
you're able to recoup the costs?

277
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,070
Don't touch my coffee.

278
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,230
Cost isn't the only thing,

279
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,120
There's expenditure on operation,

280
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,830
workers and logistics,

281
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,900
as well as after-sales expenses.

282
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,780
Given the choice, I'd like
to sell apparel, too.

283
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,370
But do we have any to sell?

284
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,500
Chen Lang has a foothold on
all the fashion brands.

285
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,700
Where are we supposed to find
a good one?

286
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,890
Selling coffee is our only choice.

287
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,210
If we don't do something different,

288
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,750
how are we going to survive?

289
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,500
What's that supposed to mean?

290
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,840
We couldn't get a broadcaster,

291
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,750
we couldn't get a fashion brand,

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,970
and now you, the CEO,
are thinking of selling coffee?

293
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,140
Why don't you sell baked potatoes?

294
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,860
Anyone can flap their mouth.

295
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,080
Do some serious work if you can.

296
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,430
What did you just say?

297
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,150
-What?
-Say it again.

298
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,700
-I said nothing.
-Who's flapping his mouth?

299
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,310
There they go again.

300
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,200
-Did I say anything?
-It's painful!

301
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,390
Who's flapping his mouth?

302
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,510
No.

303
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,770
Stop the nonsense.

304
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,900
This is what I think.

305
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,350
About the coffee.

306
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,750
Although its profit margin is low

307
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,170
and incomparable to apparel's,
it has big potential.

308
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,130
I want to give it a shot. Seriously.

309
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,790
Yu Shi.

310
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,980
I see you're free.

311
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,800
I usually drink coffee.

312
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,690
Today I'm just feeling extra thirsty.

313
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,400
So I had Coke to quench my thirst.

314
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,790
Do you want one?

315
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,700
No. I just want to get this done.

316
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,010
Could you check this for me?

317
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,390
What's this?

318
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,030
The calculation of the costs and
profit for the sale of coffee.

319
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,480
It's really difficult to sell coffee.

320
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,410
I've referred to many cost models.

321
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,400
This is the range of our costs.

322
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,930
I've calculated the other
parts of the operation.

323
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,370
And this is the final profit.

324
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,400
I'd like you to check it for me.

325
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,990
Ms Qian, are we really
going to sell coffee?

326
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,050
I've done some calculations.

327
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,050
Although the unit price of coffee is low,

328
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,840
its profit margin is really high.

329
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,990
After deducting the operation costs,

330
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,990
we have at least more than
50 percent of profit margin.

331
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,710
As long as the problems of packaging
and logistics are resolved,

332
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,580
and the sales is increased,

333
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,080
it's potential is indeed enormous.

334
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,420
Really?

335
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,140
Fine then.

336
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,210
As for the cost calculation,

337
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,720
especially the packaging and logistics,

338
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,880
I'll confirm with the suppliers.

339
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,180
Then I'll give you the exact figures.

340
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,450
I'm depending on you for this.

341
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,370
Sure.

342
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,520
You're so helpful.

343
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,970
Thanks so much, Yu Shi.

344
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,170
I'll get back to work.

345
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,510
Where are you going?

346
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,040
I'm applying for some cash.

347
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,970
What for?

348
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,140
For entertainment expenses.

349
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,300
Use your own money.

350
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,100
I'll reimburse it later.

351
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,240
I don't mind paying first,

352
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,770
but my current financial situation
doesn't allow me to do that.

353
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,510
Our Mr Duan Jr

354
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,050
is lacking money.

355
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,580
I just want to prove my resolve
to the company.

356
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,530
I've returned my bank
card and credit card

357
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,870
to my dad.

358
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,790
Our company is still new

359
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,820
and we need to get it on track, right?

360
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,400
I can't continue to live a
carefree life anymore

361
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,660
and now I really need
to do some real work.

362
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,150
How much do you need?

363
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,400
1,000 yuan.

364
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,770
1,000 yuan?

365
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,570
That much?

366
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,840
Is that a lot?

367
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,450
Isn't it too much?

368
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,610
Don't you know the current
state of the company?

369
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,810
I need the money for dealing
with Pineapple Xpress.

370
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,920
It's much more productive
than selling coffee, okay?

371
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,110
What's wrong with selling coffee?

372
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,340
Why are you still courting
Pineapple Xpress?

373
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,300
Why don't you look for new clients?

374
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,770
Just mind your own business.

375
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,640
I can see that you're hiding something.

376
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,100
Tell me honestly.

377
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,750
I'll tell you when I close the deal.

378
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,420
Qian Xi Xi is really stingy.

379
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,610
It's so hard to get even a penny from her.

380
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,910
I need your thumbprint.

381
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,520
What's it for?

382
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,900
Your thumbprint.

383
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,860
Haven't I signed the form
for 1,000 yuan?

384
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,160
Ms Qian is now very strict on this.

385
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,690
A thumbprint is needed
for 100 yuan and above.

386
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,680
Just do it.

387
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,240
What kind of rule is this?

388
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,000
Check the money.

389
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,210
Check it.

390
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,040
Any updates

391
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,210
on the transformer fire incident?

392
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,740
I haven't heard from them in a while.

393
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,460
The fire safety system
is being overhauled.

394
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,660
The incident was caused
by old, faulty wiring,

395
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,710
so it wasn't a fire.

396
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,380
They've reported it
to the fire department

397
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,780
and Manager Wang has
resigned two days ago.

398
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,020
I was thinking of calling
the fire department

399
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,750
after settling this.

400
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,120
Then just forget about calling them.

401
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,400
Then what?

402
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,120
Just treat it as a lesson for us.

403
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,600
What are you calculating there?

404
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,130
The profit for selling coffee.

405
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,980
Why are you doing all this?

406
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,640
You're underestimating Ms Qian

407
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,440
and the potential of selling coffee.

408
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,000
The price of coffee may be low,

409
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,140
but it's overall profit is
higher compared to apparel.

410
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,730
This is her calculation.

411
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,950
It's not accurate at all.

412
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,290
What's this?

413
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,500
Yes.

414
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,390
That's why she asked me to check.

415
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,840
Although the work is in progress,

416
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,520
I could see its feasibility.

417
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,200
It's just a tiny difference.

418
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,570
Selling coffee is better than
sitting and doing nothing.

419
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,750
I almost forgot.

420
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,770
I got this from Mr Mu Jr.

421
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,260
You're being invited to the Moon
Viewing and Memorial Event.

422
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,810
I can't make it on that day.

423
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,260
Why don't you go?

424
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,050
I need to deal with Pineapple Xpress.

425
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,080
[Duan Ran, Operations Director]

426
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,020
Operations Director.

427
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,290
You've always kept a low
profile, Mr Duan Jr.

428
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,700
Rui is your family business.

429
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,290
Why are you only an Operations Director?

430
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,560
You should at least be a CEO

431
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,950
cum Chairman.

432
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,000
Others don't know about us

433
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,450
but you should know, right?

434
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,310
It's all Ms Qian's idea.

435
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,010
So that I'll look good
in front of my clients.

436
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,760
Mr Wu, Pineapple Xpress
is entering new territory.

437
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,210
All the designs are based on

438
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,710
the latest and greatest
brands in Europe and America.

439
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,990
It's a product-oriented game,

440
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,050
not a brand-oriented one.

441
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,890
That's what's hot right now.

442
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,320
Hold that thought.

443
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,510
In the last spring special,

444
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,360
Xi Xi helped me sell 5.9 million items.

445
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,210
Jia Yun even helped me sell
all the limited edition items.

446
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,320
I remember it and I'm grateful.

447
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,330
However,

448
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,970
I've signed the contract for the
next season with Chen Lang.

449
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,200
There's nothing I can do.

450
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,490
I'm not here to fight for the contract.

451
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,500
We businessmen have a bottom line.

452
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,810
Let me finish.

453
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,830
I'm sorry.

454
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,770
We're friends.

455
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,490
I saw some problems

456
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,030
in your operations.

457
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,540
What is it?

458
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,810
I heard that after the Nishiyama Yohji
collection was sold out last time,

459
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,830
Perfect Blue launched a
similar style immediately.

460
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,400
They've been copying us.

461
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,270
That Perfect Blue is a thief.

462
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,930
No matter what you call them,
they obviously did well in sales.

463
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,890
They're killing our businesses
by keeping the prices low.

464
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,520
They don't emphasize on quality.

465
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,030
Their products may seem to be
designed for the good of the people.

466
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,480
But no matter how good the sales is,

467
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,590
-I still think those are low-end goods.
-You're right.

468
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,790
There's not much we can do

469
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,470
about vicious competition.

470
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,090
As a CEO

471
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,250
of a young apparel brand,

472
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,570
sometimes sales

473
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,970
is the only criterion for success.

474
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,890
Besides, if you always let them win,

475
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,710
it'd reflect badly on you, too.

476
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,880
Do you have any good ideas?

477
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,820
Now the top priority
of Pineapple Xpress

478
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,340
is to enhance its brand image.

479
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,310
Yuan Bao, are these boxes
all coffee beans?

480
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,630
Aren't you afraid of them turning bad

481
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,890
if you stock up so much?

482
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,880
The beans can be kept for a long time.

483
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,450
As long as the storage
conditions are proper,

484
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,650
that is, the temperature
not exceeding 28 degrees,

485
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,290
and the humidity is controlled at

486
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,220
between 50 and 65 percent,

487
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,360
they can last for at least half a year.

488
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,120
Just leave it and let them do it later.

489
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,940
I'm just exhausted.

490
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,960
Take a break.

491
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,890
Let me tell you a little fun fact.

492
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,640
The coffee you find on the market

493
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,590
usually have a stated
shelf-life of 12 months

494
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,690
which is one year.

495
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,800
Actually, it’s best to drink
it within three months.

496
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,380
Because after a month,

497
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,610
its taste will start to
become...

498
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,120
And after grinding the beans,

499
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,240
-it's best to drink it within a week.
-I see.

500
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,960
In other words, we still have to
drink it within a short time.

501
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,950
Yes.

502
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,520
Now I have so much knowledge on coffee,

503
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,030
I really love it.

504
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,120
Actually, I was not a
coffee lover at first.

505
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,270
But then, I saw the beauty of the bean

506
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,480
and found myself

507
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,840
appreciating coffee.

508
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,090
Also, I think coffee
has a very good future.

509
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,110
You always mention your beloved bean.

510
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,500
Who's that?

511
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,790
It's him.

512
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,730
The dreamboat, Jiang Zhe Yang.

513
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,710
So this is Jiang Zhe Yang?

514
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,510
That's the suitcase of a typical fangirl.

515
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,440
I still have more of them in the house.

516
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,380
Although his head looks
a bit too big to me,

517
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,900
he's still handsome.

518
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,740
I was wondering why he looks so familiar.

519
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,080
It’s normal. He's now the top star
with the most fans.

520
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,610
His face is all over the streets.

521
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,810
-His advertisement is shown everyday.
-No.

522
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,580
It's not because he's an
idol or because of the advertisement.

523
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,550
Then what's it?

524
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,370
It's that kind of familiarity.

525
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,090
What kind is that?

526
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,970
Has he changed his name before?

527
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,140
You're right.

528
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,930
I have liked him since his debut.

529
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,620
I know all about his dark past.

530
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,860
His old name was kind of a mouthful.

531
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,290
It was

532
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,450
Jiang Jin Suo.

533
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,950
How did you know?

534
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,190
He was my primary school classmate.

535
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,520
We used to sit together.

536
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,560
What?

537
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,680
It's true.

538
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,280
How did he grow up to be like this?

539
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,190
I used to bully him then.

540
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,130
He bullied me, too.
Do you know why I bullied him?

541
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,490
-Why?
-Because he was

542
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,100
so...

543
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,000
-What's with him?
-No.

544
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,770
It’s not like that, forget it.

545
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,670
I won't tell you how he was
when he was a kid.

546
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,340
Wait a minute, are you
two still in touch?

547
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,670
Do you have his yearbook

548
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,040
or his phone number?

549
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,490
Do you think we had phones back then?

550
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,740
We had nothing.

551
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,580
It's okay. He might still recognize you.

552
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,250
Anyway, I will rely on you
to follow his latest news.

553
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,010
You two can definitely get in touch again.

554
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,080
You must help me.

555
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,300
Let me have the chance to see him, okay?

556
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,070
I'm so happy. Let me calm down.

557
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,560
-I didn't know he looks like that now.
-Isn't he handsome?

558
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,160
Understood.

559
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,300
Mr Duan Jr, are you trying
to pull something?

560
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,310
No.

561
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,370
Then just tell me.

562
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,220
How are you going to
help Pineapple Xpress

563
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,620
enhance its brand image?

564
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,280
Do a celebrity endorsement.

565
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,060
We get a star

566
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,920
to do a live stream with
one of our broadcasters.

567
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,410
We can convert the star's fans

568
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,460
to ours.

569
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,180
-Sounds good.
-Isn't it?

570
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,730
What's the positioning
of Pineapple Xpress

571
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,070
in the market today?

572
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,340
Young fast-moving consumer goods.

573
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,850
So we need an influential star.

574
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,980
Someone with a large fan base.

575
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,900
The hottest one right now
is Jiang Zhe Yang.

576
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,540
Since you put it that way,

577
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,380
I'll be honest with you.

578
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,110
We're thinking of exactly the same thing.

579
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,080
We're seeking such a star

580
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,110
to endorse our products next season.

581
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,970
And Jiang Zhe Yang
is on the top of our list.

582
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,390
But we had a hard time

583
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,710
dealing with his agency.

584
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,280
Especially their director
by the name of

585
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,060
-Ouyang or...
-Ouyang Mei Xuan.

586
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,020
Yes, that's her.

587
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,770
She said our brand is too low-end.

588
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,220
And that Jiang Zhe Yang

589
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,660
only wears big, designer brands.

590
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,970
Yes, she has this problem.

591
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,840
Just too arrogant.

592
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,340
What if

593
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,510
I make this work for you?

594
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,100
How are you going to repay me?

595
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,090
Don't tell me you have ties

596
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,520
to Ms Ouyang?

597
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,500
We're friends.

598
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,040
If you could help with that,

599
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,320
then the contract for Pineapple
Xpress next season

600
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,710
will be yours.

601
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,620
Mr Wu.

602
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,110
I want the contract for
the next three seasons.

603
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,670
I'll give you what you want.

604
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,180
Fine.

605
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,540
Good.

606
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,130
It's a deal then.

607
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,380
Mr Duan, why are we
suddenly flying to Beijing?

608
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,800
In first class, even.

609
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,410
Ms Qian will be furious if she knows this.

610
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,920
I just received a tip-off.

611
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,890
The important person we're
supposed to meet today

612
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,090
is also flying first class
on the same flight with us.

613
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,150
Who's that?

614
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,570
We'll know soon enough.

615
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,840
Make sure we're meeting a big boss.

616
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,650
Or I'll never hear the end of it
from Ms Qian.

617
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,490
Don't worry, that person
is the boss of bosses.

618
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,060
Besides, I helped you to secure
a loan of 10 million yuan.

619
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,520
I even signed the IOU.
So just give me a break.

620
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,460
I'm just naturally timid, okay?

621
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,610
-I'm scared.
-You're just annoying.

622
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,880
Where is that person?

623
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,930
The tip-off can't be wrong, right?

624
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,540
Mr Duan.

625
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,490
We aren't shelling out for first class

626
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,130
just to wait for that
person to appear, are we?

627
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,640
Where are we

628
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,520
sitting?

629
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,930
Here.

630
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,920
-It's here.
-I'm taking this off, Mum.

631
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,850
Just bear with it.

632
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,560
If a fan sees you and tries to snap you,

633
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,820
it'll be troublesome.

634
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,470
-Fine.
-Come sit here.

635
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,720
I got it.

636
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,600
Jiang Zhe Yang.

637
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,700
Madam, let me help with that.

638
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,900
Okay.

639
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,340
Thank you.

640
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,420
You're welcome.

641
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,590
Sure. No problem.

642
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,670
Thank you.

643
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,410
Why are you here?

644
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,360
I came back last month.

645
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,630
He was my classmate in the UK.

646
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,460
Nice to meet you.

647
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,800
Thanks for your help.

648
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,570
Ouyang.

649
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,300
I have to say it again.

650
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,870
About the incident involving the fans,

651
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,510
you could have handled it better.

652
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,710
How could you

653
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,400
let Zhe Yang issue an apology?

654
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,470
Madam, we've crossed the line

655
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,270
this time.

656
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,450
I suggest we let Yang Yang

657
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,230
clear up the issue himself.

658
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,430
If this gets out of hand,

659
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,250
none of us will have a good time.

660
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,100
The incident started

661
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,390
when the other party provoked Zhe Yang.

662
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,230
Why can't we let his fans

663
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,690
come forward and defend him?

664
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,160
What's wrong with that?

665
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,360
Fans always

666
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,950
bicker among themselves.

667
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,560
We just have to ignore them.

668
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
You're his mother

669
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,620
and you let yourself into the chat room.

670
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,470
Your personal remarks

671
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,220
actually represent Zhe Yang.

672
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,030
You'll only make matters worse.

673
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,770
It won't do him any good.

674
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,520
Can't you be more reasonable?

675
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,120
You're his agent,

676
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,270
yet I'm the one sticking up for him...

677
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,929
Okay, dear. I'll send it
to you the soonest I can.

678
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,909
Let's talk about it later.

679
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,699
[We're arriving in Beijing soon.]

680
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:31,730
[The ground temperature
is 28 degrees centigrade.]

681
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,949
Your professional attire is really good.

682
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,469
I always look good.

683
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,360
Yes.

684
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,239
Why aren't you getting in touch with me?

685
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,720
Why are you going to Beijing?

686
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,930
I'm on a business trip.

687
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,430
Business trip?

688
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,060
What big project are you working on?

689
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,980
I've been free since returning
from overseas.

690
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,110
So I'm helping my dad with his company.

691
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,450
Is she

692
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,490
your boss?

693
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,740
She's Zhe Yang's mother.

694
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,600
She's the empress dowager.

695
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,120
It's difficult to deal with her.

696
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,680
Indeed.

697
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,940
How long will you be in Beijing?

698
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,260
We could go out for a meal.

699
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,150
Sounds good.

700
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,020
Okay, I'll send you a message.

701
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,720
Just take a rest.

702
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,010
Take a rest.

703
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,900
Why didn't you continue the chat?

704
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,290
We're flying first class

705
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,290
just to see her.

706
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,920
Not really.

707
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,950
Don't lie to me.

708
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,810
She's Jiang Zhe Yang's agent, right?

709
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,480
Your relationship

710
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,990
with her

711
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,190
seems to be unusual.

712
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,120
She was my old classmate.

713
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,690
I wonder if you noticed it.

714
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,290
Jiang Zhe Yang can't
decide on his own affairs.

715
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,790
He has to listen to both
his mother and his agent.

716
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,520
Did you hear him utter a word
since the beginning?

717
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,780
So,

718
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:31,990
since his agent is an outsider, he should
be listening to his mother more willingly.

719
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,130
His mother is closer to him, after all.

720
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,030
Are you thinking of using his mother?

721
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,450
That's my best bet.

722
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,100
You're not going to

723
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,600
have lunch with her, are you?

724
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,790
You are?

725
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,800
We're already way over the budget.

726
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,870
Stop mentioning that.

727
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,510
I'm just wondering

728
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,820
if we have enough money to fly home.

729
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,730
Get the cheapest tickets.

730
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,230
You're right.

731
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,320
I'll get it done once we land.

732
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,370
Economy class, right?

733
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,230
Anything as long as it's not
the cargo compartment.

734
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,010
We've shelled out for the tickets,

735
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,380
and got nothing out of Ouyang
at the end of the day.

736
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,590
Stop digging.

737
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,280
You're breaking up the soil.

738
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,450
I was taking care of it for you.

739
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,610
Thanks, Ms Qian.

740
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,770
I haven't seen you and
Duan Ran the whole afternoon.

741
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,330
Where did you two go?

742
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,880
We went to Beijing.

743
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,040
You two went to Beijing in the afternoon?

744
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,530
We left at noon and came
back in the evening.

745
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,650
I almost forgot.

746
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,750
These are the air tickets.

747
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,080
According to the company’s
financial policy,

748
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,810
we can only get a
reimbursement after you sign it.

749
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,280
First class?

750
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,180
I gave Duan Ran 1,000 yuan.

751
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,520
How much is this?

752
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,350
No, look here.

753
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,330
The front is first class.

754
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,560
Look at the back.

755
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,110
The back is economy class.

756
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,320
Why did you two go there?

757
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,220
To look for someone.

758
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,760
Who were you looking for?

759
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,050
Then you have to ask him.

760
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,630
Yu Shi.

761
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,190
You had a share in it, too.

762
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,090
If you don't tell me,

763
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,090
I'm afraid I won't sign it.

764
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,630
Okay, Ms Qian, I'll listen to you.

765
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,560
Actually, I really didn’t want to go.

766
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,790
Mr Duan forced me to go.

767
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,110
I...

768
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,500
We met Mr Wu of Pineapple Xpress.

769
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,920
Mr Duan wanted to talk to him

770
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,850
about our collaboration next season.

771
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,130
Later, Mr Duan brought up

772
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,260
the popular star, Jiang Zhe Yang.

773
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,740
The idea struck a chord with Mr Wu.

774
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,330
Then Mr Duan said he could

775
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,750
persuade Jiang Zhe Yang to help him.

776
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,660
What can he do?

777
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,950
Mr Duan knows Jiang Zhe Yang's agent.

778
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,440
They're acquaintances.

779
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,890
Really?

780
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,030
Okay, that's pretty awesome.

781
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,770
It's amazing that he knows
the agent of a top star.

782
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,490
Right?

783
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,720
Sometimes, I really admire Mr Duan.

784
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,110
He's awesome indeed.

785
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,100
Wait.

786
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:03,070
If she's really an
acquaintance of Duan Ran's,

787
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,480
then why did he buy the tickets
to see her on the plane?

788
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,210
Of all places, why on the plane?

789
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,890
Compared to Mr Duan,

790
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,090
I admire you even more.

791
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,170
Speak.

792
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,830
That agent

793
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,510
is Mr Duan's ex-girlfriend.

794
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,410
So Duan Ran bought a first class ticket

795
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,660
just to see her.

796
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,320
Where's Duan Ran now?

797
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,980
He said the meal in economy
class was terrible.

798
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,930
He's probably making
supper in the pantry now.

799
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,670
Ms Qian, you haven't signed it yet.

800
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,650
No.

801
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,710
You're not signing it.

802
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,990
You're making noodles. Looks
like you're in a good mood.

803
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,930
Is it because you met your ex-girlfriend?

804
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,070
So you've heard.

805
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,450
Yu Shi asked you to
reimburse the tickets, didn't he?

806
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,740
Go get me two eggs.

807
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,200
You just raised some capital,

808
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,190
and now you're squandering it away.

809
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,830
It's fine that you want
to see your ex-girlfriend.

810
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,220
But did you have to drag Yu Shi along
in that first-class cabin

811
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,200
and orchestrate a scene
with your old flame?

812
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,050
What are you, the male lead?

813
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,450
Are you jealous of me?

814
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,850
I should be making dumplings

815
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,120
instead of noodles.

816
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,490
Should go great with that vinegar.

817
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,100
I'm sour? You think too much.

818
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,500
I understand that you
wanted to see your ex.

819
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,390
You must be sad when you
broke up with her

820
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,890
and you're still not over it.

821
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,660
I can accept it if you spent the
money on a business trip.

822
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,430
But you spent it on your private affairs.

823
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,860
That I can't accept.

824
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,240
Don't worry, we're still new and
trying to get the company on track.

825
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,370
Right?

826
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,870
I did everything for the
sake of the company.

827
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,600
Meeting her was part of the job.

828
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,310
Don't feel bad about the money spent.

829
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,240
We'll earn it back many times over.

830
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,210
Many times over?

831
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,760
You mean the endorsement
with Pineapple Xpress?

832
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,660
Mr Wu has given me his word.

833
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,970
As long as I help him get
Jiang Zhe Yang on board,

834
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,720
once he becomes
their spokesperson,

835
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,080
we'll get all their new projects.

836
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,860
So that's your plan?

837
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,050
I was expecting something else.

838
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,780
You made it seem so mysterious.

839
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,860
It's better to keep a low profile.

840
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,130
Why is that?
