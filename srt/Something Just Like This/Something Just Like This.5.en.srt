5
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,580
Mine are all limited edition.

6
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,180
That's too bad.

7
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,289
It's a nice car, isn't it? I like it.

8
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,700
I even went to Shanghai

9
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:36,670
just to meet up with the buyer.

10
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,150
You even lost your way in The Bund.

11
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,710
Goodbye, baby.

12
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,479
I wanted to take a cab,
but you insisted on taking the subway.

13
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,350
I was trying to live a good life.

14
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,470
This feels like selling off
my own flesh and blood.

15
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,090
Then bail Rui out with your own money.

16
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,750
You can have it.

17
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,580
Sure I will.

18
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,229
I'll pack them for you.

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,620
Let's go.

20
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,870
Our group is not suitable to
establish online business.

21
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,150
Our investment in e-commerce fell through.

22
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,510
And now this?

23
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,710
We should just let it go.

24
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,579
We should focus on offline development

25
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,710
and stop messing around.

26
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,230
Our brick-and-mortar shops

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,540
will still be around after 20 years.

28
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,950
It's a safe bet.

29
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,100
The internet gets disrupted
every three to five years.

30
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,500
Who could deal with that?

31
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,830
Dad,

32
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,950
Uncle Shen,

33
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,620
shareholders.

34
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,340
Ran Ran, why are you here?

35
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,150
I know that

36
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,740
the board is going to
discuss the remaining issues of Rui.

37
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,870
I wish to take part in it too.

38
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,380
Ran Ran, about Rui Live,

39
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,540
the board is deliberating over it.

40
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,260
You stay out of it.

41
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,430
I have faith in it.

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,900
That's right.

43
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,270
I've put down six months
of rent for Rui.

44
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,380
1.6 million in total.

45
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,790
I have the confidence and the ability

46
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,230
to turn it around.

47
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,550
Where did you get the money?

48
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,340
I sold my car.

49
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,340
Therefore, I now make a formal request
to the board

50
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,010
that Rui Live be retained

51
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,230
with me at its helm.

52
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,140
How boastful!

53
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,530
It's good for Duan Ran
to have this thought.

54
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,540
Didn't you wish to retain Rui too?

55
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,180
However, Ran Ran,

56
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,740
Uncle Shen has a few questions for you.

57
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,589
-Go ahead.
-You just came back from the UK.

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,470
You aren't familiar with Rui either.

59
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,590
Why are you so optimistic about Rui?

60
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,240
Because someone told me

61
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,750
my future lies in Rui.

62
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,820
I've decided to change
the way Rui operates.

63
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,040
In the next six months, Rui will
match QE's offline results.

64
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,590
Okay. What if you fail?

65
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,380
If I fail...

66
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,010
If I fail,

67
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,630
I'll clean QE's washrooms.

68
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,710
Duan Ran, what makes you think
you can do it

69
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,780
when even Chen Lang can't?

70
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,750
We are different.

71
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,710
What's taking him so long?

72
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,100
It's fine, Mr Duan.

73
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,080
Don't undermine his confidence.

74
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,990
Directors, I suggest

75
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,940
we use Duan Ran's proposal

76
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,220
as a formal agenda for the board's

77
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,260
discussion.

78
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,240
See if we should give him a chance.

79
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,250
I knew Uncle Shen's always on my side.

80
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,590
Duan Ran,

81
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,500
we are having the board here.

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,100
It's not a place where you can
enter and leave freely.

83
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,990
Leave.

84
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,230
-Dad, I'm not finished yet.
-Go.

85
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,220
Okay.

86
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,860
This child...

87
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,190
How is it?

88
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,540
Why are you being so serious?

89
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,980
Did they agree to retain Rui?

90
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,630
I feel none of these people

91
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,310
believe in me,

92
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,080
especially my dad.

93
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,260
But Uncle Shen backed me up.

94
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,920
Uncle Duan didn't support you?

95
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,340
He didn't say that.

96
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,500
He just said

97
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,840
I'm no match for Chen Lang.

98
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,940
Chen Lang may be more experienced

99
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,870
and more professional than you are.

100
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,100
But you do have some strengths

101
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,380
that no one else does.

102
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,030
Which are?

103
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,659
You have yet to reach your full potential.

104
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,300
You just came back from the UK

105
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,750
with a major in economics.

106
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,310
Except for your investment banking
internship,

107
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,380
you have no experience

108
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,060
working in a business or a company.

109
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,590
This is your first
professional experience.

110
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,430
Your ideas and your effort

111
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,260
are vivid, fresh,

112
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,750
and full of passion.

113
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,590
Those are all Rui's values.

114
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,340
Do you understand?

115
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,530
Yes, I understand.

116
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,030
Today, Duan Ran's behaviour
was downright ridiculous.

117
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,960
What did you say?

118
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,820
Use his proposal as our agenda?

119
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,380
Mr Shen,

120
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,540
why did you side with him?

121
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,170
How am I being ridiculous?

122
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,710
I was completely fired up

123
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,150
by Duan Ran's passion.

124
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,090
Being young is great.

125
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,620
He has the passion and the ambition.

126
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,280
We should understand and support him.

127
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,100
But I'm worried.

128
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,240
That kid just got back from abroad.

129
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,740
He is unfamiliar with the domestic market,

130
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,870
including the state of this industry.

131
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,980
Moreover, he'll trip up sooner or later

132
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,540
with his nature and temper.

133
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,140
True.

134
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,320
Actually, I've thought about

135
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,870
Xi Xi, my foster daughter.

136
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,060
She is pragmatic

137
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,190
and hardworking.

138
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,780
I encouraged her to work at
Rui Live a year ago.

139
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,660
If she's willing to

140
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,870
help Duan Ran,

141
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,030
then I'll rest assured.

142
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,570
You've been thinking about this,

143
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,539
right?

144
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,630
Today, Duan Ran barged into
the boardroom.

145
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,280
As his biological dad,

146
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,100
it's tough for me to outright
side with him.

147
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,980
True.

148
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,120
Therefore, Mr Shen,

149
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,920
the reason I asked you over

150
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,900
is to ask you a favor.

151
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,750
About Rui Live,

152
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,990
I'm afraid that you'll have
to take charge of it.

153
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,450
You want me to be the bad cop,

154
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,390
while you be the good cop.

155
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,740
Mr Duan,

156
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,580
you're very smart.

157
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,700
Yu Shi is auditing the fixed asset.

158
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,780
Except for the unwanted

159
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,020
Mini Cooper,

160
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,430
all we have left are these heavy

161
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,800
and worthless things.

162
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,340
Duan Ran, do not throw away my photo.

163
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,990
Keep it in the office.

164
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,540
Keep it.

165
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,070
You know Chen Lang.

166
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,670
He won't let you take advantage of him.

167
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,150
Right.

168
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,930
It's better to empty the room anyway.

169
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,340
We can furnish it with new things

170
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,920
when Mr Duan Jr settles in.

171
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,540
Wait till I settle in.

172
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,650
I'll place all of my action figures here.

173
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,540
Wake up, okay?

174
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,920
Do you still have them?

175
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,290
Didn't you already sell them
to pay for this office?

176
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,870
Can't you talk about something cheerful?

177
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,780
What is this?

178
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,900
Xi Xi,

179
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,130
Mr Shen from QE is here.
He wants to meet both of you.

180
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,660
Yu Shi is taking him up here.

181
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,100
Yu Shi, you've worked hard.

182
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,460
How do you feel after leaving QE?

183
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,510
Thanks for your concern, sir.

184
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,970
Actually, as a treasurer,

185
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,420
I've been doing the same work
wherever I go.

186
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,950
Please wait for a moment,
I'll bring you some drinks.

187
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,540
I would like an iced cola.

188
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,100
No problem.

189
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,950
-Uncle Shen,
-Iced cola, is it?

190
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,100
Uncle Shen, you still drink

191
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,270
Coke with ice at your age?

192
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,830
What's wrong with that?

193
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,990
Do I have to drink
barley malt whiskey with wolfberry?

194
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,190
What's wrong with Uncle Shen
drinking cola?

195
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,070
Nothing.

196
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,150
Am I right?

197
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,870
You only live once.

198
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,390
Uncle Shen is still young.
He can drink whatever he wants.

199
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,870
Look at our Xi Xi, how smart.

200
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,270
Sure. People can drink whatever they like.

201
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,270
This old man still drinks cola?

202
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,950
In fact, that's all he drinks.

203
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,750
He doesn't like to drink
other carbonated drinks.

204
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,860
You even know about that?

205
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,870
I knew it when I was in QE.

206
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,580
Everyone knows.

207
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,780
Duan Ran,

208
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,900
I came here to meet you and Xi Xi

209
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,270
about the proposal that you
mentioned in the boardroom.

210
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,860
This made me cheer for you genuinely.

211
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,360
Thank you, Uncle Shen.

212
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,540
But to tell you the truth,

213
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,760
I'm kind of worried too.

214
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,940
I certainly understand.

215
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,900
Anyway,

216
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,360
it's been 20 years since I started up
the business with your father.

217
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,460
I've watched you grown up.

218
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,830
I feel a special bond

219
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,190
with you.

220
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,250
Uncle Shen, you can rest assured.

221
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,750
Uncle Shen, to tell you the truth,

222
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,990
I'm actually quite worried too,

223
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,430
because Duan Ran...

224
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,430
I'll support Duan Ran for sure.

225
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,140
But he has always been
clueless about money.

226
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,350
However, Duan Ran has
already made the pledge.

227
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,690
If he couldn't make it,
he will have to clean the washrooms.

228
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,760
Alright then, just let him
clean the washrooms.

229
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,050
Are you willing to let him do that?

230
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,400
She'd love to see me
clean the washrooms.

231
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,510
It's understandable

232
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,470
that Xi Xi's worried.

233
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,460
Therefore, I'm going to

234
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,390
meet you both today.

235
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,220
Xi Xi is pragmatic and hardworking.

236
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,340
She has basic sales experience

237
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,220
and is familiar with Rui.

238
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,660
She is perfect for a management position.

239
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,580
If you think I'm up to the task,

240
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,870
I'm willing to help him wholeheartedly

241
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,140
because he surely is impractical.

242
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,820
What do you mean "impractical"?

243
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,270
Don't you have some self-awareness?

244
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,830
Do I need to say it out loud?

245
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,540
I really have no idea.

246
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,580
Just tell me.

247
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,760
Do you really want me to say it?

248
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,020
Fine.

249
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,630
Have you returned the money

250
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,290
that I lent you two months ago?

251
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,190
Did I borrow money from you?

252
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,460
-Have you forgotten?
-Give me a break.

253
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,920
It's you who's been borrowing money
from me.

254
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,340
Alright. Alright.

255
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,700
We can see his sincerity and determination

256
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,070
when he tried to defend Rui
in the boardroom.

257
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,180
Uncle Shen, please trust me.

258
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,830
Of course, we trust you.

259
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,630
But there's something

260
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,070
I need to make it clear.

261
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,600
It takes more than passion

262
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,430
to run a business.

263
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,760
An understanding of the industry

264
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,510
and a grasp of current events

265
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,860
are important too.

266
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,390
Are you clear?

267
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,310
Sometimes, a decision that a manager makes

268
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,340
will determine the
life and death of a company.

269
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,830
No matter what,

270
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,660
you have to fully use every possibility

271
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,830
to improve and develop the company.

272
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,110
Rui's previous performance

273
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,510
has nothing to do with you.

274
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,870
Once you take over Rui,
you'll be starting from scratch.

275
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,750
What you take over is a

276
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,460
battered company.

277
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,180
If you wish to turn it into
the way you'd imagined,

278
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,950
you must give it all you've got.

279
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,310
Uncle Shen, so you're saying

280
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,520
QE will not be selling Rui
for the time being, right?

281
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,510
It might support you for a while.

282
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,810
-Go for it.
-Go.

283
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,780
Go for it.

284
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,130
Okay, Duan Ran,

285
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,340
once you sign the pledge,

286
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,070
you'll have to start working.

287
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,450
Six months isn't a lot of time.

288
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,780
I don't wish to see you
clean the washrooms,

289
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,510
especially the ladies' room.

290
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,140
Uncle Shen, you can rest assured.

291
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,510
I will not let you down.

292
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,780
Good.

293
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,720
-I'll walk you out.
-It's fine.

294
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,250
Starting now,

295
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,140
you should keep at it until you succeed.

296
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,710
Let Xi Xi walk me out.

297
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,310
Right, I need to work.

298
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,950
Xi Xi, walk Uncle Shen out for me.

299
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,220
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

300
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,150
Goodbye, Uncle Shen.

301
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,070
Bye.

302
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,830
Put them down.

303
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,869
That looks much better.

304
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,369
What's this?

305
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,060
Are you having them removed?

306
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,180
These paintings are so tasteless.

307
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,230
Besides, I like how the wall looks.

308
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,450
I've already thought about

309
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,050
how I'm going to renovate Rui
when I sold my car.

310
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,990
Rui is mine now.

311
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,520
You know, "taste" isn't something
you hang on the wall.

312
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,300
Remove and discard them.

313
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,580
What are you going to do tomorrow?

314
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,420
I think tomorrow,

315
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,460
I'll call for a meeting

316
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,790
in order to consolidate
the resources of the company.

317
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,790
Root out the key issues.

318
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,850
See what are the problems that

319
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,470
need to be solved urgently.

320
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,510
I'm talking to you.

321
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,390
I'm listening.

322
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,030
Let me tell you.

323
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,030
I was serious about everything I said

324
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,790
to Uncle Shen in the meeting today

325
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,610
After all, you just came back.

326
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,510
You're not familiar with the environment

327
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,460
here in China,

328
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,670
let alone the live streaming industry.

329
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,990
Have you really figured out

330
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,670
how to turn Rui around?

331
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,940
Although I've studied abroad
for a few years,

332
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,670
I still grew up in this environment.

333
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,550
Besides, I'm a STEM graduate.

334
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,580
I'm the best man for this job.

335
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,090
I can do this.

336
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,400
But you don't have field experience.

337
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,180
Moreover, you spend
money too liberally.

338
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,440
How can I believe that?

339
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,100
It's true that I don't have
field experience,

340
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
but you do.

341
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,670
You're not only experienced
but stingy, too.

342
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,550
Right?

343
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,000
Actually, being stingy is useful at times

344
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,990
and it is an advantage in business too.

345
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,390
Listen.

346
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,060
From now on,

347
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,660
you're this CEO's

348
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,600
most important right hand woman.

349
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,180
Where did you get that confidence?

350
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,390
Let me tell you this,
being overconfident is arrogant.

351
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,870
There's a difference between
confidence and arrogance.

352
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,450
I'm not arrogant.

353
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,580
I'm being ambitious.

354
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,860
As a man, especially a young man,

355
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,460
I must have ambition.

356
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,430
Get it?

357
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,870
If you don't even have ambition,

358
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,300
is there any difference between you

359
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,060
and this fish?

360
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,000
What's the difference?

361
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,080
There's a big difference.
I'm not a salted fish.

362
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,870
No difference.

363
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,910
I'll kick you.

364
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,940
Ran Ran's hotheaded.

365
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,060
Without Xi Xi to keep him
in check,

366
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,460
I'd be very worried.

367
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,550
Why would I put them in the same company

368
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,940
if not to create a bit of

369
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,160
competition between them?

370
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,270
For youngsters,

371
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,550
competing with each other

372
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,940
helps them grow.

373
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,910
In Mr Duan's mind and mine,

374
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,510
you are more suited

375
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,940
than Duan Ran to be Rui's CEO.

376
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,630
Why compete?

377
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,340
Listen, no matter what,

378
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,220
you can't put them together.

379
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,750
Actually, it's reasonable for Duan Ran

380
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,280
to hold the position of CEO.

381
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,190
As a person,

382
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,470
being ambitious is necessary at times.

383
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,750
I'm going.

384
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,140
Binding them tighter and tigher

385
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,490
together isn't going to end well.

386
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,150
Mark my words.

387
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,510
I'm being too naive.

388
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,890
I don't understand what Uncle Shen meant
at the beginning.

389
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,920
It's Uncle Duan who wants me to
compete with Duan Ran.

390
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,590
What are you going to do now?

391
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,070
I'll accept Uncle Shen's arrangement

392
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,760
and compete with Duan Ran
for the position of CEO.

393
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,630
Nothing wrong with that.

394
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,100
I support you. Come.

395
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,860
Do you really support me?

396
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,430
Don't high-five me yet.

397
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,580
Jia Yun, my dear babe.

398
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,600
You haven't looked for a job

399
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,910
since you left Baoqi.

400
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,990
If I wish to compete with Duan Ran,

401
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,190
are you willing to come over and help me?

402
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,730
I may be jobless now,

403
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,460
but I'm still busy.

404
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,910
You know, I've signed up
for a night class at Xiamen University.

405
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,900
It's about time.

406
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,460
I need to go.

407
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,270
You sit right there!

408
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,820
What's the matter?

409
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,550
Darting off just as I
asked you to join me.

410
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,740
What's that supposed to mean?

411
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,820
Look, Xi Xi.

412
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,380
Let me break it down for you.

413
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,690
Look, if you want to be the CEO,

414
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,900
your top priority

415
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,090
is to build your own team.

416
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,380
You need a team to hack away
through all the difficulties.

417
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,990
You need to have your own squad.

418
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,900
You are doing this all alone.

419
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,340
It won't work that way.

420
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,790
Anyway, you have a long way to go.

421
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,480
As your best pal, I'll still support you.

422
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,700
I have to go now.

423
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,420
Zhang Jia Yun, why are you leaving?

424
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,220
Didn't you say you'd support me?

425
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,220
You can't even handle me,

426
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,420
and you still want to become a CEO?

427
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,750
You have a long way to go.

428
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,630
Are you leaving me just like that?

429
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,880
Please take your time, Mr Shen.

430
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
The fact that Rui is back in business

431
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,180
is good news

432
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,300
for employees like you.

433
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,370
Of course, it's also
a direct result of your

434
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,870
persistence and hard work.

435
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,400
Thanks for the compliment.

436
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
But you need to read the situation.

437
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,180
The headquarters

438
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,010
came up with three terms

439
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,630
for your operations.

440
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,100
First, from today onwards,

441
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,420
Rui has to operate independently
and be self-financing.

442
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,990
The headquarters will not
support Rui in any form

443
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,320
or provide any subsidy.

444
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,840
This will cause a
lack of resources in Rui.

445
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,850
We're doomed.

446
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,860
Our last hope is dashed.

447
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,220
Second, they have set
a period of observation

448
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,690
which will be six months long.

449
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,990
If you are not able
to turn loss into profit,

450
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,460
the headquarters will
sell or transfer Rui.

451
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,310
Only six months, Mr Shen?

452
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,300
This is too short, Mr Shen.

453
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,020
This is what I got from bargaining

454
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,620
with the board of directors.

455
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Three months was all we got at first.

456
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,820
What's the third condition?

457
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,380
Third is that the new CEO

458
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,700
will be chosen between Duan Ran and Xi Xi.

459
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,420
Both of you will compete fairly

460
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,870
to provide a business strategy

461
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,030
which can overcome Rui's current
difficulty as soon as possible.

462
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,150
The position of CEO will be given
to the one who did the best.

463
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,740
Why do we need a contest?

464
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,910
I'm okay with it.

465
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,390
Uncle Shen, I accept it.

466
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,150
It's not up to you.

467
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,870
I'm not okay with it.

468
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,900
I am the CEO,
what's with the selection?

469
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,630
What right do you have

470
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,150
to decide you are the CEO?

471
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,030
I think choosing the CEO

472
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,250
through a contest

473
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,220
is rather fair and reasonable.

474
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,870
Are you opposed to it

475
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,790
because you're scared even
before it began?

476
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,520
No, why would I be scared of you?

477
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,060
Then, stop talking nonsense.

478
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,850
-Listen to Uncle Shen.
-I...

479
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,750
Alright then, it's a deal.

480
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,390
Ran Ran, no objection is allowed.

481
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,340
We will decide based on the results

482
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,180
one month later.

483
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,630
What should we eat?

484
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,300
I'm craving for something sweet.

485
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,980
-Let's go.
-This looks good.

486
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,300
Hello.

487
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,870
What is this? It looks nice.

488
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,060
I think what Mr Shen is trying to do
is for your own good.

489
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,870
He's pitting you against Director Qian

490
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,750
to bring out your full potential.

491
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,510
Qian Xi Xi must be clued-in

492
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,910
on such a big decision.

493
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,140
No wonder she's been urging me

494
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,420
to keep Rui.

495
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,180
Where is the store?

496
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,270
Is it this store?

497
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,460
Yes.

498
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,220
Right.

499
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,570
Look.

500
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,940
You are the person assigned by QE.

501
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,210
You have to help me.

502
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,550
I still have you with me.

503
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,410
I'll help you for sure.

504
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,970
Let's sit outside?

505
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,260
We should sit inside.

506
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,070
It's sunny out there.

507
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,310
Why don't you eat it?

508
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,700
The burger here is authentic.

509
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,790
You couldn't get it in Xiamen,

510
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,820
only in Hong Kong.

511
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,240
Come on, don't waste it.

512
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,580
Xi Xi, eat slowly.
I'm not going to steal your food.

513
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,110
There are a lot of things to do
after this meal.

514
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,910
You still have the mood
to enjoy a burger?

515
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,270
No matter where we are,

516
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,580
we should enjoy life.

517
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,560
If not, what's the point in making money?

518
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Are you worrying on my behalf?

519
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,030
I have no choice.

520
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,480
Since I've boarded your pirate ship,
I must go along with it.

521
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,510
What do you mean "pirate ship"?

522
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,820
Sorry, I mean big ship.

523
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,460
Big ship.

524
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,510
You

525
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,870
may not be as crafty as Su Su,

526
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,820
but you are sensible.

527
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,750
If you help me,

528
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,250
we take on Qian Xi Xi and Su Su

529
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,670
without any problem.

530
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,300
Xi Xi, you know something?

531
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,860
You look energetic all the time.

532
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,820
It's great.

533
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,630
You will be the CEO for sure.

534
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,030
Do you really think
I'm suited for this position?

535
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,910
Of course.

536
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,110
Compared to you, Mr Duan Jr...

537
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,100
First, he has no working experience.

538
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,150
Second, he is unfamiliar
with the operation.

539
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,380
Third, he never shows up
in the office.

540
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,710
How can he possibly win?

541
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,610
Once I become CEO,

542
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,660
you'll be the founding general.

543
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,030
Then, you'll realise that

544
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,060
following me

545
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,620
was the right decision.

546
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,620
Thank you, Mr Duan Jr.

547
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,580
I think Duan Ran will win.

548
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,980
I know he's capable.

549
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,400
But I'm also aware of my own strengths.

550
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,070
I'm thinking how I could

551
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,810
use my strengths against him.

552
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,390
You've never thought of

553
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,510
becoming a CEO?

554
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,150
It's true, I've never thought of it.

555
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,670
I thought about it after I went
home last night.

556
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,100
And I made this decision.

557
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,790
I thought, since I'm given a chance,

558
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,060
why not seize it?

559
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,420
That's right.

560
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,610
I thought Qian Xi Xi was going to

561
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,340
to lend me her hand.
I didn't expect

562
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,750
she'd be vying for CEO.

563
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,690
Then again, Director Qian
is quite capable.

564
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,990
If you aren't going to say
something nice,

565
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,300
just eat your burger.

566
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,340
Have you thought about

567
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
how you're going to run the company?

568
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,100
Recruit and stocktake.

569
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,280
Who would you hire?

570
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,510
It's a secret.

571
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,420
Mr Duan Jr, aren't you worried?

572
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,550
Do you know you have to
submit a business strategy this week?

573
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,680
Do you have any idea?

574
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,730
The brands that Rui offered
were too low-grade.

575
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,170
We have to think big.

576
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,060
Find some high-end brands.

577
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,160
Pineapple Xpress?

578
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,430
There's no hope for you.

579
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,300
High-end brands.

580
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,060
Entry luxury, at least.

581
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,520
Do you really think

582
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,220
stocktaking will give you
an idea for your business strategy?

583
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,100
I'm not sure,

584
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,750
but I think it's a way.

585
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,340
Or designer brands,

586
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,150
and make-up products,
skin care products.

587
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,560
These are our targets.

588
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,870
Chen Lang had thought about it
a long time ago.

589
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,460
But those brands hated our live streams.

590
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,420
It was Chen Lang who they hated,

591
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,030
not the live streams.

592
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Besides, he can't

593
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,260
close a deal to save his life.

594
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,420
Eat your burger.

595
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,180
After Mum heard that
my company's boss had run away,

596
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,840
she urged me to change jobs
and go on blind dates.

597
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,940
I told her

598
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,350
our company is a subsidiary of QE Group,

599
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,180
with that we have a strong backer.

600
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,110
A lean camel is bigger than a horse.

601
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,250
With that, she finally
agreed to let me stay.

602
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,420
Relax, we will live.

603
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,630
Babe, I promise you that

604
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,150
I won't let you die of hunger,

605
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
at least not for the next six months.

606
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,940
These need to go in.

607
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,580
What look is this?

608
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,940
Keep the waistline tucked in.

609
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,990
It's got to pop.

610
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,050
This won't do.

611
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,100
No way.

612
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,180
We need to lengthen the laces

613
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,750
by at least 20 cm.

614
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,980
Mr Ma.

615
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Duan Ran,

616
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,900
Your work place is nice.

617
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,300
I really admire you.

618
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,330
You just came back from the UK?

619
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,060
-Yes.
-Any advice?

620
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,410
What advice can I give?

621
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,870
After I came back,

622
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,820
I started a live streaming company.

623
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,950
I'm here to talk about collaboration.

624
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,330
What do you say to giving us
exclusive rights

625
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,390
to promote your products?

626
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,410
To tell you the truth,

627
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,050
Meiluozi is a high-end brand.

628
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,460
We have our concerns.

629
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,850
You see, we wouldn't want

630
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,090
the market to think
we're a cheap brand.

631
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,150
So...

632
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,680
We are old friends.

633
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,080
Don't give me that talk.

634
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,570
Your items only cost around 2000 yuan.

635
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,030
That's not high-end.

636
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,780
-You may go.
-Okay.

637
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,330
The rest of you, follow me.

638
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,100
Duan Ran,

639
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,220
not everyone is born with

640
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,500
a silver spoon in their mouths like you.

641
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,970
To many people,

642
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,850
2000 yuan is considered a lot of money.

643
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,150
Alright, alright.

644
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,580
Don't you have online shops?

645
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,550
We do have two online flagship stores.

646
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,300
And we have nothing against

647
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,920
live streaming platforms.

648
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,940
But because we're a high-end brand,

649
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,400
we're very particular about our streamers.

650
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,580
Who do you have?

651
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,690
We now have Qian Xi Xi,

652
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,460
Rui's leading lady

653
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,390
and the present head of streaming.

654
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,540
Qian Xi Xi?

655
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,300
From what I heard,
she's no match for Yuan Yuan.

656
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,790
Do you have others?

657
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,140
You don't understand.

658
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,820
Besides, why do you
want to know about this?

659
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,390
Duan Ran, it's not that
I don't want to help you.

660
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,990
When Chen Lang left Rui,

661
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,390
he did a live stream

662
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,020
and took away all of Rui's streamers.

663
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,790
Everyone knows that.

664
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,980
Qian Xi Xi is

665
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,260
all you have left now.

666
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,790
Without streamers,
how will you sell the products?

667
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,850
And if you can't sell products,
how can we collaborate?

668
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,180
Sort out your streamer problem first,

669
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,500
then we'll talk.

670
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,290
Okay?

671
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,990
-How did it go?
-He thinks he's so classy in his bathrobe.

672
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,060
This company is unreliable.

673
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,150
We are not going to collaborate with it.

674
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,150
Driver, let's go.

675
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,300
Hello.

676
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,550
How persistent you are,

677
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,470
working out here every day.

678
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,900
I wish I were as persistent as you.

679
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,520
I would've become a famous streamer.

680
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,830
I really don't understand.

681
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,790
Why are you so keen to be a streamer?

682
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,510
Facing a phone and
muttering to yourself everyday.

683
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,510
What's the point?

684
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,110
You are very annoying.

685
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,310
Do you know that?

686
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,830
You clearly don't enjoy being a streamer.

687
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,929
Yet you have so many fans,

688
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:30,860
so much traffic.

689
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,389
Look at me,

690
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,179
I've been working desperately everyday,

691
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,179
but I'm still an ordinary streamer.

692
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,300
It's not fair.

693
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,139
So, it's my fault?

694
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,429
Do you think you are the
only one suffering?

695
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,610
You may never become successful,

696
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,540
but at least

697
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,179
you're doing what you love.

698
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,820
Me?

699
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,889
I don't even know why I get up
in the morning anymore.

700
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,790
To make money?
I've made enough money.

701
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,900
There's nothing about streaming

702
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,350
that I would miss.

703
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,860
You are really annoying.

704
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,180
What do you want?

705
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,200
I want you to come back.

706
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,830
We've reorganised.

707
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,130
Come back and help me. What do you say?

708
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,430
My contract will expire
in less than a week.

709
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,140
I don't plan to renew it.

710
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,860
I don't want to be streamer anymore.

711
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,220
I'm changing careers.

712
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,590
Our company has just reorganised.

713
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,720
It's now a start-up.

714
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,420
Are you just going to walk away?

715
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,550
If I don't walk away now,
I may regret it for the rest of my life.

716
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,790
I knew I couldn't count on you
at this critical moment.

717
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,310
Think on the bright side.

718
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,350
With me gone, you might get
your place in the sun.

719
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,830
Now that's just mean.

720
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,050
Qian Xi Xi,

721
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,380
if you still can't succeed
while I'm gone,

722
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,380
I'll look down on you.

723
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,740
Rest assured.

724
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,810
I won't let you
have the chance to do that.

725
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,620
To tell you the truth,

726
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,510
I'm going to be the new

727
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,640
CEO of Rui Live soon.

728
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,140
Looks like not renewing the contract
is the right choice.

729
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,180
What do you mean?

730
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,810
Are you looking down on me?

731
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,140
Don't come looking for me

732
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,370
when you're jobless.

733
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,900
Mind your own business.

734
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,310
Come find me when you've lost.

735
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,890
I'll buy you dinner.

736
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,990
Good luck.

737
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,590
What's her problem?

738
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,510
Mr Duan Jr,

739
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,990
it's only a meeting.

740
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,550
Why are we making like "Infernal Affairs"

741
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,550
and meeting on the rooftop?

742
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,620
You're asking me?
Didn't you choose this place?

743
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,620
You chose a six-storey building
without an elevator.

744
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,850
I'm not an undercover cop.

745
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,680
[B2]

746
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,870
Are we there yet?

747
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,700
Almost there, almost there.

748
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,390
We really need to get fit.

749
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,270
We're there.

750
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,380
We're there.

751
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,950
-Wen Wen.
-Wen Wen.

752
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,570
Mr Duan Jr, Mr Li.

753
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,590
Long time no see.

754
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,670
Long time no see, Wen Wen.

755
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,530
Mr Duan, just get to the point,

756
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,140
I have to stream for the
entire afternoon.

757
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,460
I'm using my bathroom break

758
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,420
to meet you.

759
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,920
I need to rush back soon.

760
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,870
Alright, I'll make this quick.

761
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,950
I'm here to invite you to
return to the company.

762
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,930
To Rui.

763
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,550
Rui is different now.

764
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,700
-I'm the boss of Rui now.
-Yes.

765
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,310
If you are willing to come back,

766
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,330
you'll be entitled to a salary,

767
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,380
commission and bonus.

768
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,070
Thanks for the invitation, Mr Duan Jr.

769
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,350
But I heard

770
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,520
Chen Lang took away all the streamers

771
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,100
and the clients when he left.

772
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,020
Win some clients first,

773
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,040
then we'll talk.

774
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,370
We'll definitely represent more brands

775
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,460
-than ever before.
-Sure.

776
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,900
Besides, if you join us,

777
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,020
we'll take care of everything for you.

778
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,330
You can rest assured

779
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,860
that the benefits and salary here
will be much better.

780
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,090
Don't you trust me?

781
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,910
-I guarantee...
-Wen Wen, don't you need to work?

782
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,090
What are you doing?

783
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,280
What a surprise, young master.

784
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,450
Are you here to poach my talent?

785
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,180
What do you mean?

786
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,310
I'm here to chat with Wen Wen.

787
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,460
You call that poaching?

788
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,030
The nerve of you!

789
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,590
I could hear it all the way back there.

790
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,420
Why were you eavesdropping?

791
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,420
You are shameless.

792
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,940
Harsh words for someone who
snuck into my company

793
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,900
and...

794
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,720
-Don't do this.
-Let me ask you.

795
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,790
Can't we talk like civilised men?
This suit is expensive.

796
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,130
Mr Chen, we're leaving.

797
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,100
We're leaving.

798
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,880
You came here and now you're running away?

799
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,110
-Who says I'm running away?
-Stay here.

800
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,350
-Back off.
-Stay here.

801
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,710
-Back off.
-Stay here.

802
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,900
-Let's have a talk.
-Go, go.

803
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,450
Wait till you see Rui Live...

804
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,990
Something's wrong with this guy.

805
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,180
How is Rui now?

806
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,350
I'll ask Dad to buy this building
and tear it down tomorrow.

807
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,480
I really dislike it.

808
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,990
Why are you following me?

809
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,620
-Am I following you?
-Stop following me.

810
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,830
I'm waiting to see if you'll
steal my people again.

811
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,700
Alright, let him follow us.

812
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,220
See how long he can last.

813
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,610
Aren't you tired of this ?

814
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,620
-Who's tired?
-Why are you following me?

815
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,220
Why don't you stay here
and have a cup of tea?

816
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,380
You're like a huge fly,

817
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,070
buzzing behind us.

818
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,500
Your place has bad feng shui.

819
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,110
I don't like to stay here.

820
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,990
Wait, what....

821
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,710
What's wrong?

822
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,830
Looks familiar?

823
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,280
I bought a used car a few days ago

824
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,510
for my commute.

825
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,510
It's quite hard to drive.

826
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,690
Let's go.

827
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,660
Didn't I sell it to

828
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,780
a foreign collector?

829
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,180
Why do you have it?

830
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,310
The foreigner you mentioned

831
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,770
is a huckster.

832
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,420
He resold it to me.

833
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,990
Funny you should mention it.

834
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,610
It's the same thing with the streamers.

835
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,220
I now have your people and your car.

836
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,030
You've lost everything!

837
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,020
Okay, okay.

838
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,700
Mr Duan Jr, it's hot outside.

839
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,940
Mr Duan Jr.

840
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,360
Look here, Chen Lang...

841
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,780
Mr Duan...

842
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,550
This means war.

843
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,480
Alright, alright.

844
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,940
Alright, alright.

845
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,070
Mr Duan Jr, it's hot outside. Let's get in
the car where it's cool.

846
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,670
There's air-conditioning.

847
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,110
Let's go, Mr Duan Jr. Just let it go.

848
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,110
You're shameless!

849
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,110
Go.

850
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,660
Mr Chen, you need eight cameras

851
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,790
to cover every corner.

852
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,550
Eight? Is that enough?

853
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,900
Enough for this area.

854
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,620
Here, here, here.

855
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,070
And there.

856
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,680
And these two corners.

857
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,180
I want cameras in all of them.

858
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,590
-Okay.
-How dare he!

859
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,800
Waltzing into our company
and poaching our talent.

860
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,740
What's all this stuff?

861
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:07,990
Totally useless.

862
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,110
What is this?

863
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,030
This denim shirt will do.

864
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,620
Babe, come and take a look.

865
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,260
Su Su, check out this shirt.

866
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,220
Doesn't it look like the one

867
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,830
in "Brokeback Mountain"?

868
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,940
So trendy and cool.

869
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,990
You can't even see your waist in that.

870
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,320
It's nothing like "Brokeback Mountain".

871
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,980
It's leftover stock, after all.

872
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,600
That's why it's sloppy.

873
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,900
But we can focus on the fabric.

874
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,540
Look,

875
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,990
it may not be soft,

876
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,220
but it's sturdy, durable.

877
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,140
No. It has to look fetching.

878
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,510
No.

879
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,220
Say, we have all this leftover stock.

880
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,130
That's at least 3000 pieces

881
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,350
of shirts and jeans.

882
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,310
If we dump them at low prices,

883
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,840
won't we make a lot of money?

884
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,740
These are practically rags.

885
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,140
How much can they sell for?
