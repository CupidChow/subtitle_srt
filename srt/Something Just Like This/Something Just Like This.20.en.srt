00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,520
Ms Qian, hurry up and praise
me for such an achievement.

171
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,540
Oh, you did amazing.

172
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,630
You're very quick witted in
maximizing your connections.

173
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,090
You had foresight and
you were resourceful.

174
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,020
-That's right.
-It's impressive.

175
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,570
-You will be rewarded.
-Great.

176
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,060
How generous, Ms Qian.

177
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,180
It's alright.

178
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,650
Since everything's fine,
I'm making a move.

179
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,920
All right. Thank you so much, Ms Ouyang.

180
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,090
We will not see you off.

181
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,100
-Thanks.
-Hold on.

182
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,900
Stay here and celebrate with us.

183
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,800
She worked hard all day.
It must have been tiring.

184
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,090
Not everyone is as free as you are.

185
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,490
Stop occupying her time.

186
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,950
Yes.

187
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,810
You should celebrate on your own.

188
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,960
Congratulations.

189
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,160
I'm going off.

190
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,440
I'll thank you properly.

191
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,510
You should see me off then.

192
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,220
Of course I will.

193
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,240
-Let's go.
-Sure, I'll see you off.

194
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,170
We're leaving.

195
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,450
-It's only for a minute.
-Go ahead.

196
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,100
Xi Xi.

197
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,020
I'm leaving as well.

198
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,770
Don't stay up too late.

199
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,210
I'll head home first.

200
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,500
Take care.

201
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,530
Thank you for what you did today.

202
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,710
If it wasn't for your idea,

203
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,280
I wouldn't push Yuan Yuan
to climb the charts.

204
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,160
Am I right?

205
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,490
Are we complimenting each other now?

206
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,760
You should take credit for
your courage and boldness.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,380
What are you talking about?

208
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,580
That was blind faith.

209
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,410
Like you said, self-confidence.

210
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,570
-So you're aware.
-Yes.

211
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,560
I'll just see you off here.

212
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,890
Sure. Take care of your sister.

213
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,880
Is she jealous of me?

214
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,780
She's not. She's just mad.

215
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,020
I didn't inform her
beforehand about the surprise.

216
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,820
I helped Yuan Yuan hit the charts

217
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,190
and outdid her.

218
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,900
She's upset.

219
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,060
Why are you so happy when she's upset?

220
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,640
We bicker all the time.

221
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,720
Uncle Qian, are you going home?

222
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,310
Ran Ran, it's windy out there.

223
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,600
Watch your mouth.

224
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,980
What's wrong with my mouth?

225
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
Stay warm.

226
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,700
I'm leaving.

227
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,660
Goodbye.

228
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,830
Watch my mouth?

229
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,580
-I'll mix it for you.
-Wait.

230
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,300
If you mix it,

231
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,680
-the eggs will end up in the bottom.
-It's in there.

232
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,560
There you go.

233
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,270
There's nothing in here.

234
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,900
Have you washed your hands?

235
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,160
No.

236
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,870
Can't I eat without washing them?

237
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,600
-Here, have some potatoes.
-That's unhygienic.

238
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,810
When I was abroad,
all I craved was mustard.

239
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,670
I thought you'd give me some.

240
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,220
Your cravings are satisfied.

241
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,250
By the way,

242
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,360
yesterday,

243
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,560
I saw Duan Ran

244
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,370
flirting with

245
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,210
the director, what's going on?

246
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,180
Nothing is going on.

247
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,420
I don't want you to get hurt.

248
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,240
You're too naive.

249
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,950
As you tolerate and compromise,

250
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,380
over time,

251
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,370
people will take it for granted.

252
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,390
You're the CEO.

253
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,700
The noodles are delicious.

254
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,230
-Don't you think so?
-It's the best.

255
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,950
Of course. I used to run a
noodle house at Chinatown.

256
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,400
This is nothing to me.

257
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,850
I know, when I compliment you,

258
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,270
you will proceed to compliment yourself.

259
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,310
You can cook.
You know how to do everything.

260
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,570
You're great at everything.

261
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,450
Let's eat.

262
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,830
Hello, we noticed your
request to sell your house.

263
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,800
We wonder if you're available.

264
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,610
-Who is it?
-I brought clients to check the place out.

265
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,140
I'll go.

266
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,770
What's the matter?

267
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,520
Requests to sell the house?

268
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
We're not selling our house.

269
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,780
-Are you from the property agency?
-Yes.

270
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,900
What's the matter?

271
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,070
It's a little sudden.

272
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,510
Give me a second.

273
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,660
I'll explain later.

274
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,000
What's going on?

275
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,490
Over here, please.

276
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,460
Hold on.

277
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,970
If you do not explain,
you can't enter my house like that.

278
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,170
Explain everything.

279
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,030
I'm sorry, you didn't pick up
your phone just now.

280
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,830
I decided to drop by in person.

281
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,090
I didn't notice your call.

282
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,730
This is the case. My unit

283
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,610
is a little old.

284
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,520
It has been renovated recently.

285
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,350
It's clean and you can move in anytime.

286
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,990
Everything is working fine.

287
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,090
This house isn't bad.

288
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,350
There are some great schools nearby.

289
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,410
After we have children,

290
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,950
-it'd be easier to send them to school.
-Yes.

291
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,080
It's inconvenient.

292
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,830
This is an old house. It's bad.

293
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,230
-What? You...
-Besides,

294
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,550
he does not have a say over this house.

295
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,280
It's my house. I call the shots.

296
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,030
This house is not for sale.

297
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,570
How could you say that?

298
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,030
This house is not for sale.
Do you not get it?

299
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,100
Why do you have to be so rude?

300
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,920
-Let's go.
-Hurry up and leave.

301
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,680
My apologies. Please excuse us.

302
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,090
What's going on?

303
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,010
I'll tell you after we finish our meal.

304
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,560
What are you trying to do?

305
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,530
Well...

306
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,650
Since you found out, I...

307
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,950
I...

308
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,920
I'm planning to sell this house.

309
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,630
Then,

310
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,990
I'll buy a house overseas

311
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,890
for you to move in.

312
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,730
Then, you don't have to live with them.

313
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,080
You enjoy broadcasting,

314
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,780
you can do that overseas as well.

315
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,820
Have I told you that

316
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,880
I do not want to go overseas?

317
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,690
Did you not understand?

318
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,570
Who gave you the rights
to sell this house?

319
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,090
I only made an inquiry.

320
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,940
I registered.

321
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,240
I didn't expect them to show up so soon.

322
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,160
I wasn't prepared.

323
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,690
Dad.

324
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,070
I made myself very clear.

325
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,190
I'm doing well here.

326
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,319
I've a job,

327
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,300
and a life.

328
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,630
Why should I leave?

329
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,099
Hear me out.

330
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,730
I...

331
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,670
I understand that

332
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,300
you like working in the
broadcasting industry.

333
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,089
I've no objections.

334
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,300
However, I just find that as a CEO,

335
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,880
it's embittering.

336
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,110
You don't have shares of the company.

337
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,210
You don't have a voice as well.

338
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,570
I saw it with my own eyes yesterday.

339
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,280
Duan Ran did not treat you right.

340
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,010
He's obviously just using you.

341
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,230
I can't accept that.

342
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,400
I will not allow you to
suffer, do you understand?

343
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,930
I'm not suffering.

344
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,980
That's my personal issue anyway.

345
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,710
I'm willing to suffer.

346
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,020
Everyone suffers starting
their own businesses.

347
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,340
You'd suffer no matter what you do.

348
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,100
You've contributed too much.

349
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,440
Look at how tired you are.

350
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,110
My heart aches when I see that.

351
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,450
Listen to me. Remember this.

352
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,330
Only your father truly cares for you

353
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,310
unconditionally in this world.

354
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,510
Not Uncle Duan nor Duan Ran.

355
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,610
That's enough.

356
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,690
You've no rights to slander
Uncle Duan and Duan Ran.

357
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,860
I'm telling you one last time.

358
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,820
Without my agreement,

359
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,950
you're not allowed to sell this house.

360
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,030
Can you try to understand
my point of view?

361
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,700
Have you tried to understand mine?

362
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,690
Give it to me.

363
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:40,940
What do you want?

364
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,230
The keys to the house.

365
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,580
Give it to me.

366
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,290
I'll keep it.

367
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,150
Xi Xi.

368
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,660
You will come to realize this one day.

369
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,030
Where are you going?

370
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,170
It's me, Uncle Qian.

371
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,940
Xiao Jiang.

372
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,930
I think you fell in love with this place.

373
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,590
You're drinking alone again.

374
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,530
Just a little.

375
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,570
Why are you here?

376
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,900
My friends and I booked a private room.

377
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,040
I was heading to the washroom

378
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,300
and I saw you drinking.

379
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,080
Where's Xi Xi? Isn't she here with you?

380
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,230
You must be disappointed.

381
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,630
Not at all.

382
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,680
We had a fight.

383
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,060
A fight?

384
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,550
What happened?

385
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,670
It's suffocating here.

386
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,060
Come out with me for a breather.

387
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,290
Sure.

388
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,280
Dad.

389
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,440
Dad?

390
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,160
Jiang.

391
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,850
I'm currently

392
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,850
homeless.

393
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,160
How could that be? Stop kidding me.

394
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,510
It's tiring.

395
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,840
If I'm not home,

396
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,540
she can take a break.

397
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,790
What are you saying, uncle?

398
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,550
You must be drunk.

399
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,240
I think you're great.

400
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,780
Besides, I could tell that

401
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,810
Xi Xi cares about you a lot.

402
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,890
Jiang.

403
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,770
Do you know why I returned?

404
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,660
Back when I was overseas,

405
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,300
I did a medical check-up.

406
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,820
They found a tumour.

407
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,010
It's a malignant one.

408
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,040
[The doctor said
I don't have much time left.]

409
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,660
When I received the news,

410
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,620
I was stunned.

411
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,870
My mind went blank.

412
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,080
I sat on the bench at the park

413
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,420
and watched people come and go.

414
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,260
After toiling all my life,

415
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,280
I realized I did it for myself.

416
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,300
I was too selfish.

417
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,480
Not long after that,

418
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,210
the hospital gave me a call.

419
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,270
Guess what?

420
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,530
It was a misdiagnosis.

421
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,220
Uncle, that was a roller coaster ride.

422
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,290
You scared me.

423
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,930
However, after that experience,

424
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,690
I've a new realization about life.

425
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,190
I only have one daughter.

426
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,930
I thought to myself,

427
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,790
for the remaining time I have,

428
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,610
I want to do something for her.

429
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,190
That is why I came back.

430
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,570
My dad is gone.

431
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,000
[What happened?]

432
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,060
[What's going on?]

433
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,270
I quarrelled with him this afternoon.

434
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,340
He left home mad.

435
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,750
I didn't stop him.

436
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,490
It's really late and he isn't home yet.

437
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,350
He doesn't have a mobile phone.

438
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,930
If I head outside to look for him,

439
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,340
where should I go?

440
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,200
[It's two o'clock in the morning.]

441
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,920
[Where would he go?]

442
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,620
Brother, I wouldn't have
called you if I knew.

443
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,420
Come with me to look for him.

444
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,670
What if the incident happens again?

445
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,350
What should I do if he lights
someone's house on fire?

446
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,510
[Wait for me.]

447
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,920
[I'll pick you up.]

448
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,810
[We will look for him together.]

449
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,180
Hurry up.

450
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,090
Xi Xi is a very

451
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,780
kind child.

452
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,010
She wants to repay those
who were kind to her.

453
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,330
That isn't wrong either.

454
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,960
However, I don't want her to suffer.

455
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,330
Hence, I wanted to take her with me

456
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,710
and give her a new life.

457
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,620
[Look at Old Qian.]

458
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,820
All these years,
he never cared about Xi Xi.

459
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,370
He never asked about Xi Xi.

460
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,610
He suddenly wants to take Xi Xi with him.

461
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,900
Xi Xi would not be able to accept that.

462
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,500
Besides Xi Xi,

463
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,650
you will not be able to take it either.

464
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,770
Of course not.

465
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,880
Xi Xi is my daughter too.

466
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,040
I empathize with Qian.

467
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,060
He isn't expressive.

468
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,190
Life was tough overseas.

469
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,280
He thanked me many times
personally this time he returned.

470
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,880
He dare not say it in front of you.

471
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,430
Old Qian.

472
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,200
No matter what it is,

473
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,420
reconciliation is most important.

474
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,890
Uncle, about this,

475
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,890
I think you made it complicated.

476
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,650
What Xi Xi is doing right now,

477
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,590
is her choice.

478
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,490
She works diligently.

479
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,770
It is tough indeed.

480
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,610
You saw it yourself.

481
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,790
Hardships are inevitable,

482
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,570
but at least she's happy now.

483
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,800
Happy?

484
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,980
She's too naive.

485
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,520
She doesn't realized she's being bullied.

486
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,860
Do you know?

487
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,170
No one can bully Xi Xi.

488
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,560
I believe she's able to

489
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,070
manage personal matters

490
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,920
and business matters well.

491
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,150
You've to trust her.

492
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,050
Of course I trust her.

493
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,110
My daughter is the best.

494
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,340
Exactly.

495
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,020
Look, if you were to

496
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,960
take her away,

497
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,250
that's equivalent to

498
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,270
denying her life and career.

499
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,420
Isn't it?

500
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,510
I don't know how to help her.

501
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,530
This concerns me a lot.

502
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,200
Uncle, you're overthinking.

503
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,090
Actually, to Xi Xi,

504
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,500
you'd be helping her

505
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,840
by supporting and understanding her.

506
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,860
That is enough for her.

507

It's true.

Sure.

Uncle, I think

520
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,040
we should give Xi Xi a call

521
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,360

Yes, give her a call.

00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,540
are on a long waiting list.

676
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,700
She's not a robot.

677
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,970
She needs rest too.

678
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,030
You're right. We compensate for that.

679
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,100
Please complete just one more task.

680
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,800
Alright, I'll talk to her later.

681
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,610
Thanks for the hard work.

682
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,420
I'll be back in two minutes.

683
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,130
Wait for me, darlings.

684
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,290
Yuan Yuan is experienced.

685
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,940
-It must be tough.
-You're here, Mr Duan.

686
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,120
Give me a sip.

687
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,580
Yuan Yuan, stream a little longer today.

688
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,000
Some new stuff arrived.

689
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,520
-Okay, I'll do some touch ups.
-Sure, go ahead.

690
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,060
Thanks for the hard work.

691
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,160
Don't mention it.

692
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,960
Get back to work. Just leave these here.

693
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,020
I'll handle it.

694
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,920
I like watching you finish this.

695
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,290
I wanted to get her a bottle,

696
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,490
but she drank mine.

697
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,030
Yuan Yuan.

698
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,410
I bought you some doughnuts.

699
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,670
They taste amazing.

700
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,870
Thank you.

701
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,420
-I'll eat later. Let me fix my makeup.
-Sure.

702
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,930
Thanks.

703
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,170
Yuan Yuan only has two
minutes to fix her makeup.

704
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,230
I'll hold on to it for her.

705
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,770
She will eat them after she's done.

706
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,390
What are you doing?

707
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,120
Yuan Yuan is so busy,

708
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,210
but the rest of us have nothing to do.

709
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,360
Pass some jobs to us.

710
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,810
What?

711
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,360
-Just pass a little bit...
-Pass them to you?

712
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,540
We signed the written contracts.

713
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,260
As stated on the contracts,

714
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,060
it has to be Yuan Yuan.

715
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,600
Do you know what it means?

716
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,960
Zhang Bin.

717
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,650
I'll suggest this to Ms Qian.

718
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,580
Let's go.

719
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,810
Little Duckling, I'm confused as well.

720
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,830
You knew Yuan Yuan values her figure.

721
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,660
Why would you buy doughnuts
to curry her favour?

722
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,420
The doughnuts taste really good.

723
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,570
I queued up for a long time for them.

724
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,040
I can't afford expensive stuff.

725
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,440
It's fine.

726
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,640
If Yuan Yuan isn't going to eat
them, I will.

727
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,580
I don't have a figure to keep.

728
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,230
Listen to me.

729
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,580
Don't even mention it.

730
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,090
Such a small bag

731
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,890
of doughnuts.

732
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,430
She queued for an hour.

733
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,900
She's an Internet celebrity.

734
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,910
Don't worry, I'll eat them.

735
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,000
I'll take you out for
some good food tonight.

736
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,820
Eating is all you know.

737
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,770
More than half of the
orders belong to Yuan Yuan.

738
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,450
Even Zhang Jia Yun isn't
as occupied as before.

739
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,430
Please use your brains.

740
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,950
Not much will be left for us,

741
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,980
yet you're still in the mood for food.

742
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,880
Don't worry about it.

743
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,700
What should we eat?

744
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,800
What do you want?

745
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,690
Barbecue.

746
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,300
Please raise your standards.

747
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,200
A seafood buffet.

748
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,750
That's it.

749
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,240
How are things with Rui Live?

750
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,600
I gave them a call.

751
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,710
Yuan Yuan is monopolizing.

752
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,850
She's handling half of Rui's clients.

753
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,780
Are the other broadcasters affected?

754
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,640
The secondary ones are affected.

755
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,930
After Yuan Yuan outdid Xiao Xiao,

756
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,780
I'll keep that debt in mind.

757
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,300
However, it's pretty good now.

758
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,830
Let's watch them fight amongst themselves.

759
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,990
Chen Lang.

760
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,100
I heard, at Rui Live,

761
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,540
Mr Five, Yuanbao, Cola

762
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,260
and Sister Jia Yun stopped broadcasting.

763
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,940
Even Jia Yun stopped?

764
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,100
Apparently,
they are working on a side project.

765
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,290
A side project?

766
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,970
What is it?

767
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,140
Yes, and step backwards.

768
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,120
Two steps to the left.

769
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,970
Aunty, you're so smart.

770
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,870
Make a turn. One, two, three and clap.

771
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,190
To your right.

772
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,870
Make a turn.

773
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,590
That's right.

774
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,180
You're doing great.

775
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,300
One, two, three.

776
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,370
What's Jia Yun doing?

777
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,120
All the jobs were given to Yuan Yuan.

778
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,670
Jia Yun and the rest of
them had nothing to do.

779
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,090
Jia Yun always led the staff

780
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,430
to exercise and work out.

781
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,240
She's trying to be productive.

782
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,400
Is that all the projects
the company received?

783
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,280
Jia Yun has time to do aerobics?

784
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,970
Doesn't Qian Xi Xi care?

785
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,290
Ms Qian is very concerned.

786
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,610
She's very worried.

787
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,340
She locked herself in her
office and she's working hard.

788
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,940
She's trying to produce promotions

789
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,650
or events for the employees.

790
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,730
She's short-sighted, as usual.

791
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,930
I warned her before this

792
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,180
to plan things on the long-term.

793
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,540
Am I right?

794
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,960
We've to engage with clients outside.

795
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,240
Well, that depends on you, Mr Duan.

796
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,780
Of course.

797
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,850
They are hopeless.

798
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,200
Contact a few suppliers this afternoon.

799
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,990
Let's attend some business meetings.
