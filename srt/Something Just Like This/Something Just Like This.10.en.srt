4
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,070
Be an intern then.

5
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,490
If you don't want to, just go back to QE
and be a floor manager.

6
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,310
Intern?

7
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,190
I need to go out and discuss
projects with clients, lady.

8
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,080
How will I be able to
do that as an intern?

9
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,160
Well, other people
might not be able to do it,

10
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,860
but you, Duan Ran, are so prestigious.

11
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,000
If you become an intern at Rui Live,

12
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,160
it will show others how ambitious
and confident our company is,

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,220
don't you think?

14
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,979
Stop there.

15
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,600
Qian Xi Xi.

16
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,790
Are you trying to get back at me?

17
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,080
Am I?

18
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,720
Fine.

19
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,210
Duan Ran, if you really
believe you are so capable,

20
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,139
I'll give you three months to
get Pineapple Xpress back.

21
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,940
I'll make you permanent at once.

22
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,880
You can't do it, can you?

23
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,260
So you see,

24
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,340
be it Cambridge or Xiamen graduates,

25
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,680
whether you're a
postgraduate or undergraduate,

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,240
all fresh graduates start
as an intern, understood?

27
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,880
Don't worry.

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,060
You'll get paid.

29
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,870
Do you know how much money my
friend from Cambridge make per month

30
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,810
working at an investment bank?

31
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,210
Do you want me to open my
computer right now and show you

32
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
how much money the company still have?

33
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,690
Fine. I have no other
choice but to give in, right?

34
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,350
I sold my car.

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
I lost my money.

36
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,310
I even sold my figurines.

37
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,300
You're giving me this little
amount of money every month,

38
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,100
it can't even cover my taxi fare.

39
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,930
You may consider taking the bus.

40
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,010
If that doesn't work,
I'll be more generous.

41
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,810
You can ride with Yu Shi or me.

42
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,980
Generous, right?

43
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,310
If that still won't do, go back to
QE and be a floor manager then.

44
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,480
Your choice.

45
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,750
Mr Duan.

46
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,720
I've asked our security
to lodge a police report.

47
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,710
You're in charge of following up.

48
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,280
Report it immediately
if there is any update.

49
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,010
Report?

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,660
Should I report it immediately to

51
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,829
Ms Qian or you?

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,510
To me, of course.

53
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,350
Why should you report it to her?

54
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,880
Where are you going?

55
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,880
It's none of your business.
Get on with your work.

56
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,140
You're just an intern, can't I even ask?

57
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,600
I love it when a
warehouse looks like this.

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,230
Empty.

59
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,040
Almost everything is sold out.

60
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,910
I hate it when a
warehouse looks like this.

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,170
Just these few pieces of clothes are left.

62
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,300
Everything is gone.

63
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,010
We're so out of sync.

64
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,720
With you,

65
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,700
just leave it be then.

66
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,320
Ms Qian,

67
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,790
about money making,

68
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,790
I have a little suggestion.

69
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,700
I wonder if we can agree on this.

70
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,650
Making money?

71
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,320
What suggestion?

72
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,430
I have a friend.

73
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,080
His friend is starting
up his own business too.

74
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,650
They are looking for

75
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,850
a place to set up their office.

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,930
I'm thinking that this warehouse of ours,

77
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,600
you see, it's left unused anyway,

78
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,640
and it's empty enough. Why don't we rent
it to them? Get some cash flow going.

79
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,760
Their offer is quite fitting.

80
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,280
-What do you say?
-No.

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,230
No way.

82
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,990
We're so out of sync.

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,790
It'll be fine, Ms Qian.

84
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,690
In our office,

85
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,600
anywhere will be fine, we just need
to spare 50 square meters.

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,860
Just 50 square meters.

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,950
Okay? Once you say yes,
I can call him right away.

88
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,690
Their men will come and
view it in the afternoon.

89
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,300
At such critical moment, you're the only
one who still thinks for the company.

90
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,660
Of course.

91
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,620
Ms Qian, the company is
going through a difficult time now.

92
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,840
And you're new to your post,

93
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,990
it's my duty to lighten your burdens.

94
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,050
You're quite loyal.

95
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,400
Fifty square meters.

96
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,120
Don't worry, leave it to me.

97
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,310
Well,

98
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,230
call them now.

99
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,850
-Okay.
-Tell them they can come to take a look.

100
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,010
Relax.

101
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,490
Tell them that the price is negotiable.

102
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,690
I got it.

103
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,690
Call them now.

104
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,810
I have a lot to deal with now.

105
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,180
I'll leave this to you then.

106
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,270
Trust me.

107
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,410
Liu,

108
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,580
it's me, Yu Shi.

109
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,020
That friend you told me about last time,

110
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,160
the one who runs an online
sacrificial ritual service firm,

111
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,840
have they found an office?

112
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,480
[B2]

113
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,480
Did it get fixed yet?

114
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,120
Luckily I didn't get you fixed.

115
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,530
Zhu Wan.

116
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,850
Hello, Lang.

117
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,040
That's great.

118
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,910
That means that the sales volume of

119
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,650
Pineapple Xpress has accounted
for half of the online sales this season.

120
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,410
Very pious of you, my friend.

121
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,020
What are all these?

122
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,100
You've suffered, baby.

123
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,799
Such a pity.

124
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,220
He made such a nice car so dirty.

125
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,230
This...

126
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,970
He even ate in his car.

127
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,890
How could a man

128
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,620
make a car so untidy?

129
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,150
Oh my gosh.

130
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,760
I asked you to prepare
a gift for Mr Zhao. Have you?

131
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,780
I've got it prepared, don't worry.

132
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,150
Take it to my office later,
I want to take a look.

133
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,250
Okay.

134
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,260
Talk later.

135
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,230
You shameless man.

136
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,230
You seemed to pick
up the bottle swiftly.

137
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,220
Did you put it there?

138
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,910
What are you doing here?

139
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,250
I'm here to check on my baby.

140
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,430
I feel bad for it.

141
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,220
It used to live with a good family.

142
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,390
Now it's under the care of

143
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,800
a shameless driver who doesn't
care about the environment.

144
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,710
Were you the one who cut the power?

145
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,330
Why didn't I see your baby?

146
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,510
All that I can see is just
my transportation vehicle.

147
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,590
Have you ever heard the saying that

148
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,360
business is war?

149
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,290
Young Master, stop being so childish.

150
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,290
I never even thought that
you would dare to admit it.

151
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,950
That means that you're
still a man on the inside.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,220
Did I admit anything?

153
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,160
Now you're denying it again.

154
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,750
Let me tell you,

155
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,880
I truly despise those
like you who don't dare

156
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,840
to own up to things they did.

157
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,500
It's fine, stop hiding it.

158
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,270
Once I catch the mole from the company,

159
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,580
I'll bring him to you.

160
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,230
And slap him in front of you.

161
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,680
Young Master, stop talking about violence

162
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,500
every time you open your mouth.

163
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,570
You need to use your head sometimes.

164
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,800
Learn from your dad, he's so smart.

165
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,120
So intelligent.

166
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,760
Chen Lang,

167
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,980
be the man that you're meant to be.

168
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,760
Can't we play fair and square?

169
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,950
Stop playing dirty tricks in secret,

170
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,110
okay?

171
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,920
So unrefined.

172
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,890
Don't take this wrongly.

173
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,080
Back then,

174
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,080
I was worried about them working together.

175
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,760
But you insisted putting them together.

176
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,050
Shen is worse.

177
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,670
He actually appointed
Xi Xi as Ran Ran's leader.

178
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,580
Don't you think

179
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,920
it's just going to make them quarrel?

180
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,470
This time, Ran Ran and Xi Xi

181
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,370
are on par with each other indeed.

182
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,880
I heard about it from Shen.

183
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,280
At the current phase,

184
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,170
it's true that Xi Xi is well
suited to the position.

185
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,340
Xi Xi's weakness can be improved through

186
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,290
her own efforts and with Ran Ran's help.

187
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,330
As for Ran Ran,

188
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,850
he needs to start at the bottom

189
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,360
in order to improve.

190
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,140
Right.

191
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,430
These two,

192
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,720
one is competitive, the other is vying,

193
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,650
I've always had doubts about
putting them together.

194
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,770
Now this is great.

195
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,460
Xi Xi has become the leader. There's
no way this won't turn into a disaster.

196
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,190
That's enough, stop worrying.

197
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,530
Let them figure it out themselves.

198
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,980
Dad.

199
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,600
I want to talk to you.

200
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,310
The day of the live stream competition,

201
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,290
we had a power outage.

202
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,930
Do you think that it was an accident?

203
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,120
What did you find?

204
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,140
I checked the surveillance.

205
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,160
I found that someone had tampered with it.

206
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,200
Are you certain?

207
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,920
That footage from the security camera

208
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,430
was copied and pasted to replay
the same image repeatedly.

209
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,880
I knew that Chen Lang
would play such dirty trick.

210
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,900
Currently, Chen Lang

211
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,010
must think of you and Xi Xi
as his greatest competitor.

212
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,400
You have to be careful.

213
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,560
Does Xi Xi know about this?

214
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,610
I haven't told her.

215
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,510
Xi Xi has just become the CEO,

216
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,560
she has got too much on her plate.

217
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,640
Help her out.

218
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,150
Also, you must keep an eye out for her

219
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,740
in future.

220
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,840
Keep an eye out for her?

221
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,890
Why don't you let me be the CEO instead?

222
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,980
Ran Ran, do you think
Xi Xi isn't qualified for it?

223
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,820
Dad, do you really believe
that she's better than me?

224
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,340
At the current phase,

225
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,990
we've examined yours and Xi Xi's
capability and experience.

226
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,050
It's true that I favoured Xi Xi more.

227
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,040
Son,

228
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,480
I hope that you can

229
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,320
accept this decision with an open mind.

230
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,890
It's not that I don't accept it, Dad.

231
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,350
All the crises that the company

232
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,480
had encountered recently

233
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,830
were taken care of by me.

234
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,080
Yet I got nothing in the end,

235
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,610
while she became the CEO.

236
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,870
Do you know what position she gave me?

237
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,320
An intern.

238
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,070
She appointed me as an intern.

239
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,170
Start at the bottom. That sounds right.

240
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,320
Dad, are you guys working in collusion?

241
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,680
Xi Xi and I have been competing
against each other since childhood.

242
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,080
She never beat me in anything significant.

243
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,880
But I lost this time.

244
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,380
I'm unwilling to accept it.

245
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Well, I don't think it's a bad thing.

246
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,990
When God places a great
responsibility on a great man,

247
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,580
He always first frustrates
his spirit and will,

248
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,800
exhausts his muscles and bones,

249
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,350
exposes him to starvation and poverty.

250
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,100
Dad, I get that.

251
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,020
Son, just do it accordingly if you get it.

252
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,900
A man shouldn't be bound by his ego.

253
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,850
Don't be a slave to your emotions.

254
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,420
I hope that you can
stand on your own two feet.

255
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,560
You and Xi Xi have to put in all
your efforts to manage Rui well.

256
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,080
Rest early, I'm going now.

257
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,110
[Shapowei Art Zone]

258
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,319
Here's the thing, you see.
You reported it to me.

259
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,890
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

260
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,040
These seven persons

261
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,839
are our permanent crew.

262
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,480
Don't replace them easily.

263
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,819
You have to inform me in
advance if there is any changes.

264
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,930
Okay.

265
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,430
What are you doing?

266
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,140
Name tags.

267
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,990
They can't come in without name tags.

268
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,790
Also, take note on the schedule.

269
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,110
Your time is the afternoon of
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

270
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,480
Morning of Tuesday and Thursday.

271
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,080
Do not come on Saturday and Sunday.

272
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,660
This place is close, no one
can open the door for you.

273
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,590
What's all this?

274
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,640
Mr Duan.

275
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,780
-What's all this?
-Talk later. Okay.

276
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,300
Mr Duan,

277
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,070
allow me to explain.

278
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,660
The company has just
been reopened.

279
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,990
The cash flow is insufficient.

280
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,070
So Ms Qian discussed with me that

281
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,980
this space, which belongs
to our company, is quite empty.

282
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,680
We can take advantage of it.

283
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,510
So we rented it to an online
sacrificial ritual service company.

284
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,840
The contract is signed.

285
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,430
Aren't you just messing around?

286
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,100
What is this place?

287
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,050
This is a live streaming company.

288
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,120
So many staff are watching.

289
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,530
Is this the right way
to take advantage of it?

290
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,670
Am I here to work or
pay respect to the death?

291
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,690
Mr Duan,

292
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,930
we have to cut cost and
earn some additional income.

293
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,730
Since this space is left unused,

294
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,280
it's just right that we
take advantage of it.

295
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,770
You guys are out of line.

296
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Did Qian Xi Xi come up with this idea?

297
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,300
You're obviously used
for being a rich kid.

298
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,510
You know nothing about the
costs of running a household.

299
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,850
You know we have many staff
in the company.

300
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,020
So many mouths to feed.

301
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,230
They all need to get paid.

302
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,040
We need to cover their insurance as well,
not to mention they need the Internet.

303
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,640
We need to pay for utilities like
water, electricity and maintenance...

304
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,870
That's enough.

305
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,650
Let me tell you, it's true that
our company is out of money,

306
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,530
but this is not the right
way to make money.

307
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,060
What's this?

308
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,150
This is preposterous.

309
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,300
I'll talk to her.

310
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,660
Mr Duan, Mr...

311
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,610
Any updates from the building management?

312
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,320
I just talked to him on the phone.

313
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,450
Mr Wang said he's gathering evidence.

314
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,500
Make them stop.

315
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,570
Qian Xi Xi.

316
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,180
Qian Xi Xi, what on earth have you done?

317
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,980
This is a company,
a live streaming company.

318
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,620
Not a cemetery, okay?

319
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,670
Get out.

320
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,590
Get out, me?

321
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,800
I said, get out.

322
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,270
Are you being snooty, now
that you've became the boss?

323
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,270
I'm not being snooty.

324
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,670
I'm asking you to get out first.

325
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,790
Knock and only come in when I tell you to.

326
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,300
Go out and knock.

327
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,620
Come in only when I ask you to.

328
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,150
Come in when you hear
me say, "Please come in."

329
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,600
Fine.

330
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,710
Ms Qian.

331
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,770
Please come in.

332
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,540
Why do you want to see me? I'm busy.

333
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,260
You're showing off your power
just days after becoming the boss?

334
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,100
No one else is here. Stop the act.

335
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,640
How many times do I have to tell you?

336
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,120
Cast your sight further.

337
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,650
Look at the big picture
when you do things.

338
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,850
Did you listen to me?

339
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,630
You're doing this again.

340
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,820
We haven't even solved the current
problem. What bigger picture?

341
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,950
We haven't learned to walk
yet, and you want to run.

342
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,350
When will you change
this bad habit of yours?

343
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,810
I can't be bothered with this right now.

344
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,470
How much money does
the company still have left?

345
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,820
After paying this month's wages.

346
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,060
Less than RMB100,000.

347
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,810
Less than RMB100,000?

348
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,180
What can we do with less than RMB100,000?

349
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,180
It's true that we can't do anything.

350
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,970
But this confirms

351
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,870
a sentence you taught me before.

352
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,060
What sentence?

353
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,030
Inventory and cash flow

354
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,240
decide the life or death of a business.

355
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,980
Are you trying to make
me eat my words now?

356
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,490
That's not what I meant.

357
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,010
But since you're so proud,

358
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,100
surely you can't bear to
watch the company fall apart.

359
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,310
Before thinking about
how to live a good life,

360
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,040
you should first think
about how you can survive.

361
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,770
Before thinking about how you can survive,

362
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,610
you should think about
what you can do to live on.

363
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,710
Xi Xi, Singles' Day is a few months away.

364
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,530
We have to seize this opportunity and
recruit streamers to expand the market.

365
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,870
What do those need?

366
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,310
-Money.
-I know those things need money.

367
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,610
But we don't have it.

368
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,690
Haven't I already given you a solution?

369
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,010
Talk to my dad.

370
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,240
No.

371
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,030
I don't like to owe money.

372
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,450
I don't feel comfortable with it.

373
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,630
I won't be able to sleep at night.

374
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,220
You are the boss of a company.

375
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,100
So what if you're uncomfortable?
You need to save the company.

376
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,650
But I can't bring myself to ask for it.

377
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,960
Who else can do it if it's not you?

378
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,010
Well, you.

379
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,410
You can do it.

380
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,900
Wait, Qian Xi Xi.

381
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,130
You hired me as an intern

382
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,810
for only RMB3,000 per month.

383
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,130
This is how much an intern is worth of.

384
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,890
I'm running errands for you every day.

385
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,530
I worry about everything.

386
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,320
I even have to ask for money?

387
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,350
Fine, I'll do it for Rui.

388
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,340
I have no issue with asking for money.

389
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,010
But you have to be there to help,
you can't hide behind the curtain.

390
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,820
You said this will work, right?

391
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,970
I'm not sure whether it will or not.

392
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,190
Actually, your dad

393
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,110
is usually easy to talk to.

394
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,260
But he won't listen to anyone
during critical moments.

395
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,260
Can you speak nicely?

396
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,440
I don't know what has gotten
into those kids.

397
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,680
They insisted on planning
for this birthday celebration.

398
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,150
Ran Ran has just returned from England,

399
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,780
he's a gentleman.

400
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,410
-He still cares about you.
-Yes.

401
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,760
He wants to show
filial piety to me, is it?

402
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,070
It's nice enough as long
as he can stop upsetting me.

403
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,220
You see.

404
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,010
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

405
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,410
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

406
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,990
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

407
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,620
Careful, careful.

408
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,040
Okay.

409
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,780
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday, Uncle Duan.

410
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,380
Since it's your birthday today,

411
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,540
I'm going to let you off
for talking behind my back.

412
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm not afraid to talk bad
about you in your presence too.

413
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,040
Happy birthday, Uncle Duan.

414
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,080
Blow out the candle.

415
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,170
-Make a wish.
-Yes, make a wish.

416
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,930
Done.

417
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,300
Finished.

418
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,370
-Cheers.
-Cheers, happy birthday.

419
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,180
-Thank you, thank you.
-Happy birthday.

420
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,330
Cheers.

421
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,630
Ran Ran,

422
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,830
you insisted on celebrating my birthday.

423
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,430
There must be something
you want to ask from me.

424
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,380
Tell me now, what do you want?

425
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,800
Since you've figured it out,

426
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,170
I'll cut to the chase.

427
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,020
I'll speak it out then.

428
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,630
Xi Xi and I

429
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,280
are facing some troubles.

430
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,940
We've taken over Rui for
more than a month now.

431
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,150
Everything has been great,

432
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,300
the operation has been smooth,

433
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,970
except that we've been

434
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,930
a little bit short on cash flow.

435
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,340
So after Xi Xi and I discussed it,

436
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:54,410
we hoped that you, Mr Duan, could
support us on our cash flow.

437
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,270
You see, did you hear him?

438
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,640
What did I say?

439
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,030
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

440
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,170
What does this mean?

441
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,170
After I received something from him,

442
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,580
I have to invest in Rui.

443
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,830
Come on, Dad. We really wanted

444
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,720
to celebrate your birthday today.
Make you happy.

445
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,730
Go on.

446
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,520
Invest a little bit then.

447
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,550
Uncle Duan,

448
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,700
we really want to celebrate your birthday.

449
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,500
We didn't do it to ask
for your investment.

450
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,750
Because when we wanted
to reopen Rui,

451
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,030
you guys had said that

452
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,350
we have to assume all responsibilities.

453
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,680
We still remember that.

454
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,930
However, it's true that we're
going through a difficult time now.

455
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,340
We hope that,

456
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,860
regardless of calling it a loan

457
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,100
or collateral loan, or
any other types of loans,

458
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,300
you can help us out.

459
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,580
Xi Xi,

460
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,540
regardless of calling it a loan,
or collateral loan

461
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,590
or any other types of loans,

462
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,210
you need to offer equivalent pledges

463
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,770
like stakes or assets, do you understand?

464
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,710
Like I said back then,

465
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,020
since you were so
passionate to reopen Rui,

466
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,110
you're on your own to save yourself.

467
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,030
Our hands are tied.

468
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,650
Come on, let's eat.

469
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,310
Ran Ran, Xi Xi,

470
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,840
you two know about QE's situation.

471
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,680
Don't put us in a difficult position.

472
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,920
Listen to your father, eat your dinner.

473
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,430
-Let's eat.
-Happy birthday.

474
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,280
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Here, happy birthday.

475
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,580
-Happy birthday, here.
-Here.

476
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,590
Thank you, Uncle Duan.

477
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,580
Aunt Zhou, what should we do?

478
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,010
Uncle Shen, stay a little longer.

479
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,950
At my age, I need to get
to the bed before midnight.

480
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,590
I'm not the same like you youngsters.

481
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,210
Such healthy lifestyle.

482
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,160
It's been tough for Xi Xi to be the CEO.

483
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,210
About your cash flow problem,

484
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,060
here's an idea.

485
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,670
What is it?

486
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,410
Although I'm QE's director

487
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,860
as well as Rui's regulator,

488
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,550
I'm also your elder.

489
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,490
I watched you grow up.

490
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,090
Duan sounded so determined just now.

491
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,550
It made me feel kind of bad.

492
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,730
It's good to see young people
starting up their own business.

493
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,820
So passionate.

494
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Just like how we used to be back then.

495
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,990
Since he won't help you,

496
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,570
I'll help.

497
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,550
Really?

498
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,570
But,

499
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,120
I can't help you through
official channels.

500
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,550
I intend to make the investment

501
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,920
with my personal savings.

502
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,180
Be your angel investor.

503
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,950
You're a man of discernment.

504
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,470
-Man of discernment indeed.
-Alright, keep your voice down.

505
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,710
I got you.

506
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,330
How about this?

507
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,140
I know about Rui's net worth anyway.

508
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,710
Let's cut to the chase.

509
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,330
I'll throw in five million,

510
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,660
in exchange for 10 percent of
your stakes, what do you say?

511
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,390
Uncle Shen,

512
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,410
I'm really, really glad that
you want to invest in me.

513
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,830
But five million

514
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,410
seems a bit too little.

515
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,540
You want more?

516
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,210
It's hard to save up this much.

517
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,680
Are you asking me to give them all to you?

518
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,730
Uncle Shen, listen to me.

519
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,590
You can keep some, keep some of it.

520
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,080
Keep some of it.

521
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,910
While for the rest, invest in me.

522
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,030
I assure you I won't let you down.

523
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,020
Don't worry, I'll succeed.

524
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,170
-Can I trust you?
-You have my word.

525
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,360
With what you just said,

526
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,840
and for your ambition,

527
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,390
I'll throw in ten million,

528
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,140
in exchange for 20 percent of your stakes.

529
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,680
But currently, 80 percent of Rui's shares

530
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,890
are held by QE,

531
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,310
while Chen Lang has 20 percent.

532
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,070
I need to come up with an explanation.

533
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,270
We still have to go through your father.

534
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,240
No problem. Uncle Shen,
talk to my dad first.

535
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,750
I'll talk to Xi Xi.

536
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,960
Give us some time to think about it.

537
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,110
You have to guarantee it's safe.

538
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,780
It hasn't been easy for me to
save up those personal savings.

539
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,080
Don't you trust me?

540
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,280
Alright, go now.
Otherwise, we'll get caught.

541
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,350
-I'll walk you out.
-Let's go.

542
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,250
-Keep up the good work.
-I will, I will.

543
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,660
[Office, Duan Ran]

544
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,900
Close the door, hurry up.

545
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,310
-Why do I need to close the door?
-Hurry up, it's noisy.

546
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,460
-They're hard at work.
-Hurry.

547
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,880
It's noisy for you?

548
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,400
Fine. Is it quiet now?

549
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,170
Are you satisfied now?

550
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,150
Tell me what you think.

551
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,800
What do you mean what I think?

552
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,570
Should we agree to Shen Jiang Tao's term?

553
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,540
I'm calculating the stakes.

554
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,530
How did it go? Tell me.

555
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,760
Move your legs.

556
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,830
Tell me, what have you got?

557
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,470
Let me tell you,

558
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,760
if Uncle Shen takes away

559
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,930
20 percent of Rui's shares

560
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,690
in exchange for ten million,

561
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,150
our net worth would be 50 million.

562
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,500
There is something
wrong with this calculation.

563
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,730
Which part is wrong?

564
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,690
Uncle Shen takes 20 percent.

565
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,860
Chen Lang currently has 20 percent.

566
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,910
QE is holding 60 percent.

567
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,060
Investors of start-up usually
hold only 20 percent of the shares.

568
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,480
Entrepreneurial team
must hold major shares.

569
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,520
But look at us,

570
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,800
we hold nothing.

571
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,820
Rui's management
hasn't got a single share.

572
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,730
This means we work for others
not starting our own business.

573
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,390
Where did you learn it from?
You know quite a lot.

574
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,480
Are you complimenting me?

575
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,780
I learned it in secret, everyday.

576
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,540
I've thought about the stakes.

577
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,430
No matter what,

578
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,800
QE is still the major shareholder
with 60 percent stakes,

579
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,600
there is no issue with that part.

580
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,470
Duan,

581
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,980
lately, I've been thinking

582
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,270
about those kids' request for funding.

583
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,659
I'm thinking about it too.

584
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,460
Ever since Chen Lang ran away,

585
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,030
the losses were covered thanks to Ran Ran
and Xi Xi have sold out the inventories.

586
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,889
Although they've lost the fight,

587
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,500
it was a glorious defeat.

588
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:22,969
Therefore, they are asking
for money for a good reason.

589
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,300
I intend to throw in ten million.

590
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,560
But QE holds Rui's stakes.

591
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,409
Follow the rules.
I'll increase my investment

592
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,199
and then use the money on Rui.

593
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,440
How about this, Shen?

594
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,170
We each invest five million.

595
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,610
I have another idea.

596
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,040
My son is not interested
in an archaic thing like QE.

597
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,690
Just put everything in Rui.

598
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,220
The stakes will belong
to them in the future.

599
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,370
Ran Ran and Xi Xi
don't have any stakes too.

600
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,830
Okay, Shen.

601
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,000
It's a deal then.

602
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,200
Let's make an investment together.

603
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,350
Leave the stakes to the children.

604
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,640
We're both fathers, let's do this.

605
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,880
Yes, let's do this.

606
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,700
Marketing department, sales department

607
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,990
and some cosmetic...

608
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,840
Xi Xi, I've posted

609
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,790
the talent information and
job requirements we need

610
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,070
on 58.com like you asked.

611
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,730
Bigger platforms are more reliable.

612
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,620
We received dozens of
resumes in less than a day.

613
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,970
It's highly efficient.

614
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,250
I took a good look at it.

615
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,720
The credentials are pretty good.

616
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,310
We can certainly find the best talents

617
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,810
in the shortest time.

618
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,500
Everyone, come on out, come on.

619
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,680
Come out, everyone.

620
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,740
Listen up.

621
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,040
Our miseries are over.

622
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,110
Those who are streaming, pause it.

623
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,380
Come out now, come out.

624
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,770
-What happened, Mr Duan?
-Allow me to announce a good news.

625
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,000
You, announce it.

626
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,260
What is this?

627
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,400
Ten million!

628
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,300
Ten million!

629
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,610
How did you find so much money?

630
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,830
I found us an investor.

631
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,160
How should we use this 10 million?

632
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,210
Upgrade and replace all
live streaming equipment.

633
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,430
What are they doing?
Having a meeting?

634
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,110
New dressing room.

635
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,550
New lounge.

636
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,520
New decoration for everything.

637
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,100
Better meals for everyone.

638
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,150
Let me know if you need to
add anything in your office.

639
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,820
I've been waiting for
this day for so long.

640
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,630
-What's wrong with Duan Ran?
-Let's check it out.

641
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,660
-He...
-Take a look.

642
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,750
Let's celebrate

643
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,570
-tonight.
-Absolutely.

644
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,860
Bar or KTV?

645
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,800
-Bar, one-stop entertainment.
-KTV.

646
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,860
Bar? Bar it is then.

647
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,700
Duan Ran.

648
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,260
Come here, Xi Xi.

649
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,540
Why are you talking about KTV or bar?

650
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,270
What are you doing?

651
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,370
-A celebration.
-For what?

652
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
-We have money now.
-Listen.

653
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,240
This is a life-saving
fund for the company.

654
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,270
-That's right.
-You aren't allowed to spend a cent of it.

655
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,470
But I brought back the investments.

656
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:21,950
I wanted to let every one know,
share the happiness together.

657
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,620
They work so hard everyday.

658
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,860
Right? We should celebrate a little.

659
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,750
The equipment will be upgraded eventually.

660
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,900
Hope you guys can be patient.

661
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,330
-Wait a while more.
-So Mr Duan can't make the call on this.

662
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,610
Alright then, we appreciate your effort.

663
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,040
It's okay.

664
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,240
Our CEO makes the call on the money.

665
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,270
That's right.

666
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,440
But it's the gesture that counts, Mr Duan,

667
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,260
we all appreciate it,

668
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,600
don't we?

669
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,830
Thank you for your understanding.

670
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,570
They still favour me.

671
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,750
You all get it, right?

672
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,920
We had only RMB100,000
in our account yesterday.

673
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,810
Today, we get some money
and you already want to screw around?

674
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,470
The company needs to hire more staff

675
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,050
and more streamers.

676
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,690
-Everything needs money.
-That's right.

677
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,790
Besides, investment is like

678
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,140
lending an umbrella in fair weather and
asking for it back when it begins to rain.

679
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,340
You get it, right?

680
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,460
But I'm the one who got these funding.

681
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,610
You get it, right?

682
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,370
Well done then, Mr Duan.

683
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,160
Should I reward you with
a title of Outstanding Intern?

684
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,360
Sure, Outstanding Intern sounds good.

685
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,220
We need to celebrate this.

686
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,230
It's worth celebrating.

687
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,990
How about this? We have ten million.

688
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,170
Let's use 20,000 of it
for everyone to have some fun.

689
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,220
To chill.

690
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,390
No.

691
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,060
I'm in charge here.

692
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,250
Before the new products and
new supply chains are settled,

693
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,490
you'll get nothing.

694
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,300
Singles' Day is just two months away.

695
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,930
Let's plan for the next phase of our work.

696
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,280
Meeting, now.

697
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,670
Alright.

698
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,980
Scatter, everyone.

699
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,400
Let's go to the meeting.

700
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,900
Let's throw a small party
for ourselves tonight.

701
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,850
Small party? Don't...

702
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,160
Stop fooling us.

703
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,440
Just a small...

704
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,350
Such cowards.

705
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,830
Isn't this last season's?
Why is it still here?

706
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,760
Take care of it. This can't be seen
on the live stream.

707
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,770
-Where is your assistant?
-I have no idea.

708
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,270
You can't live stream without
an assistant, find her now.

709
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,180
Okay.

710
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,370
Mr Chen.

711
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,660
How many times do I have to tell you?

712
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,990
Don't fool around during the live stream.

713
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,550
-I want the robber shown on stream.
-Got it.

714
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,620
Mr Ding.

715
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,650
All right, I got it. I'll be there soon.

716
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,960
Mr Ding,

717
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,160
how about I tell you about

718
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,380
Cloud Live's recent developments?

719
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,980
You're so eager to brief me.

720
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,110
I don't need to ask, I'm sure
the results are satisfying.

721
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,740
It's all thanks to you.

722
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,740
The power cut came just in time.

723
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,200
I just wanted to have some fun.

724
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,060
Let me ask you something.

725
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,120
Go ahead.

726
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,480
Pineapple Xpress has signed their dress
section contract with Rui, right?

727
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,790
They've only taken the dress section.

728
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,950
The rest of the products are with us.

729
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,010
We've made our best effort.

730
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,700
Pineapple Xpress' remaining 90 percent of

731
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,270
orders are in our hands.

732
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,890
There should be no problem.

733
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,160
Chen Lang, let me give you
a piece of information.

734
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,980
Rui has obtained ten million in funding.

735
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,710
Their cash flow crisis has ended.

736
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,460
They survived.

737
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,390
I'll be abroad in the next few months.

738
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,340
Just stop fighting with
Duan Ran for a while.

739
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,070
Focus on Cloud's business first.

740
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,220
We'll talk about it when I get back.

741
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,630
Okay, I got it.

742
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,970
Listen to me, steel the
business for retaliation.

743
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,210
Don't worry.

744
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,490
I'm not done with Duan Ran.

745
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,970
Liu, bye-bye.

746
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,350
All right.

747
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,040
Hurry up.

748
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,590
I'm here for the interview.

749
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,710
Give it to me.

750
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,590
[Rui Live]

751
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,160
The company's future development
seems very promising to me.

752
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,790
I've always wanted a
career in brand marketing.

753
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,890
When I saw the recruitment posting
on 58.com,

754
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,680
I knew immediately
that I'd like this job.

755
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,790
After I sent in my resume,

756
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,830
I received a call for
an interview invitation.

757
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,450
I was really excited.

758
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,700
From your resume,

759
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:45,450
I can see that you have a lot of
experience in live stream branding.

760
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,200
Hold on.

761
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,790
That's it for today.

762
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,620
We'll give you a call soon.

763
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,510
-Okay.
-Your resume, thank you.

764
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,260
Those who are waiting in line for
the interview, please give us a minute.

765
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,860
How was it?

766
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,190
You don't say.

767
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,260
58.com is quite efficient.

768
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,590
It meets our company's
needs for various positions.

769
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,840
At this rate, we should be able to
get those positions filled in no time.

770
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,790
What about your task? How did it go?

771
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,920
Don't even.

772
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,940
You're lucky that you didn't go.
It was a wasted trip.

773
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,300
Three warehouses,
none of them are up to par?
