I'm really happy for Yuanbao.

7
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,250
You know, during the Singles' Day sales,

8
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,120
we made quite a fortune.

9
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,060
The most important thing is,

10
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,920
Yuanbao reconciled with her dad.

11
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,650
Anyway, we've fulfilled our wish.

12
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,420
After signing this paper,

13
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,880
Rui and Hualu

14
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,900
will establish
a long-term strategic partnership.

15
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,310
It's not too late to back out now, Ms Bai.

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,620
I won't regret it. It's a win-win.

17
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,770
Let's join forces.

Anything else you want to say?

19
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,710
As a matter of fact,
I have something to tell you, Xi Xi,

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
but I don't know how to start.

21
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,770
Is it about your resignation?

22
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,010
How did you know?

23
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,130
I guessed it.

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,670
I don't want to go back so soon either.

25
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,160
But you know how busy it is
since we increased production.

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,920
There's not enough help at home,
so my dad said I must go back and help.

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay.

28
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,460
Congratulations.
We hope you'll do even better.

29
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,810
Okay. Thank you, Mr Duan.

30
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,640
Come, Director Qian.

31
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,100
Thank you, Ms Bai.

32
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,880
I appreciate your guidance.

33
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,630
Well, I've actually
prepared a gift for you.

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,030
There are two horns.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
It's an axis deer.

36
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,850
This is so adorable.

37
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,330
Are these coffee capsules?

38
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,320
Exactly.

39
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,170
There are six of them,

40
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,400
just enough for one week.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,350
Exactly.

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,500
Now I won't get to see you at work
every morning

43
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,450
and drink the coffee that you make,

44
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,600
I'll have a hard time adjusting to it.

45
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,920
Don't say that, Xi Xi.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,370
Do you remember the first time we met?

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,000
I remember that back then...

48
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,780
It was my old house.

49
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,060
After we put up the rental notice,
she was the first one who came.

50
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,530
Is that all you remember?

51
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,540
What else?

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,600
I even remember what you were wearing

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,560
and what you said.

54
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,510
You're the first person who made me think

55
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,579
that even an ordinary
but independent person

56
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,010
can be so remarkable.

57
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,950
So I'm really grateful

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,550
that you never rushed me to pay the rent.

59
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm also really grateful
that you took me into Rui

60

63

You're always smiling,

66

but you're actually quite mature.

Why are you worried about me?

You always keep things to yourself.

123

You have to learn to speak up,

124
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,630
so that they can share it with you,
alright?

-Get it?
-Alright, alright.

You think I'm long-winded?

130

Then I'll leave now.

131

-Good.

guarantee of success.

141
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,290
Hold it.

142
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,130
I wish I could go back.

143
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,910
I want to bid her farewell.

144
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,190
Bid farewell?
I guess you just want to dine together.

145
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,010
How much weight did you gain
from hanging out with her?

146
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,070
Your clothes are now one size bigger.

147
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,620
You're right.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,179
Hanging out with Yuanbao

149
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,120
was an indulgence.

150
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,560
Have you completed your workout today?

151
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,290
Go! Why are you still sitting here? Go.

152
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,780
-I'm going now, I'm going now.
-Your phone.

153
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,930
See you.

154
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,110
It's been three days and two nights.

155
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,730
You've worked your socks off.

156
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,370
First,

157
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,870
I'd like to thank you for your hard work.

158
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,390
For the past half year,

159
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,650
Rui has made great achievements.

160
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,670
Duan Ran, you also fulfilled your promise
to the board of directors.

161

As the person in charge,

162
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,380
I feel really proud.

163
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,240
Besides,

164
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,670
the stock option that all of you

165
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,800
have been looking forward to

166
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,040
has been approved
by the board of directors.

167
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,180
Enough.

168
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,290
Rui bought

169
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,390
35 percent of shares from this group.

170
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,310
In the future,

00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,530
all of you will be shareholders of Rui.

172
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,870
I have another important announcement.

173
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,440
Yesterday,

174
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,930
Jia Yun submitted her resignation to me.

175
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,480
Deep down, I feel very sorry about it,

176
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,170
but I understand.

177
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,660
In view of Qian Xi Xi’s

178
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,340
recent excellent performance,

179
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,180
-You can do it.
-the board and I have decided

180
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,680
that Qian Xi Xi will continue

181
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,160
to serve as the CEO of Rui.

182
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,010
That's all I'd like to say today.

183
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,680
Next, I'd like to hear about

184
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,930
all of your plans

185
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,620
after Singles' Day.

186
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,970
Xi Xi, you should start first.

187
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,040
Okay.

188
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,080
Here's my idea.

189
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,180
From the alliance negotiation,

190
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,230
I realised the importance

191
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,710
of broadening our reach.

192
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,210
I hope that in the future,
we can extend our collaborations

193
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,220
to beauty products, furniture,

194
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,920
food and other areas.

195
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,000
In other words, to establish a safe,

196
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,880
stable and win-win sales model
with our partners.

197
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,680
Xi Xi just came back,

198
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,040
and she's already impressed us.

199
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,640
There's another good news

200
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,830
I'd like to announce.

201
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,130
We've signed a
strategic partnership agreement

202
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,560
with Hualu Coffee.

203
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,860
Great!

204
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,870
Good. Xi Xi

205
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,720
has a very strategic vision.

206
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,850
Right.

207
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,500
I'll give you a thumbs up.

208
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,600
Thank you, Uncle Shen.

209
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,210
Hello, Mr Ding.

210
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,630
You had the upper hand on Singles' Day,

211
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,910
how could you
let Duan Ran clean your clock?

212
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,740
Can you explain yourself?

213
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,660
I lost.

214
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,080
There's no excuse.

215
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,540
We've lost our pride.

216
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,680
Now you tell me you've lost, is that all?

217
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,910
Mr Ding,
I've been wondering about something.

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,340
You kept asking me
to undersell Rui shares.

219
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,090
What beef do you have with Duan Ran?

220
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,490
[Or do you have an issue with QE?]

221
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,890
Can you tell me?

222
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,010
It has nothing to do with you.

223
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,700
I am your investor,

224
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,500
you'll do whatever I say,

225
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,800
[do you hear me?]

226
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,160
[Chen Lang, I'll give you three days.]

227
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,030
Find a solution to solve it.

228
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,020
This isn't about time.

229
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,990
I just want to be a businessman.

230
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,830
As for those despicable things,

231
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,410
I've had enough.

232
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,740
I won't do it anymore.

233
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,040
Deputy Director Ms Ouyang,

234
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,640
tell us your plan.

235
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,240
My plan would be
establishing a self-owned brand.

236
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,660
Because I think up until now,
live broadcasting companies

237
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,560
have always operated downstream
of the brands in the supply chain.

238
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,660
This is the contractor I found.

239
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,430
-Merely selling wares for factories
-I've found one.

240
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,670
-isn't a good position to be in.
-Use this. It's reliable and hassle-free.

241
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,700
[58.com]

242
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,570
Since Rui has come this far,

243
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,580
it should have its own brand.

244
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,800
I think this is absolutely necessary.

245
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,250
I think after our company

246
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,200
has our own brand,

247
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,230
we will not be out of stock

248
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,920
and be in a passive position.

249
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,220
Yes, and the resources for our own brand

250
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,730
are readily available.

251
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,710
Besides, this self-owned brand

252
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,170
is not just a new brand.

253
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,740
It's Jiang Zhe Yang's clothing brand.

254
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,390
A star with tens of millions of views.

255
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,040
I guess investment and client
won't be an issue.

256
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,470
Nice.

257
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,700
Jia Yun, what's your plan for the future?

258
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,180
Mr Shen, you also know

259
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,760
that I was recruited
during critical times.

260
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,660
Now I guess it's time for me to retreat.

261
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,770
I will take a short break,

262
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,310
then apply for business school abroad

263
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,790
or study MBA of some sort.

264
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,180
Studying is a good thing,

265
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
you have my support.

266
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,500
Thank you, Mr Shen.

267
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,800
With such capable staff and leaders

268
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,930
in our company,

269
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,900
I'm the one who should retreat.

270
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,660
I am going to do
a minor renovation in my office.

271
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,670
I will install a clean,

272
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,130
tidy,

273
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,490
refreshing, elegant

274
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,080
lavatory.

275
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,860
What are you talking about?

276
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,160
What? Lavatory?

277
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,240
Duan Ran.

278
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,330
What are you thinking?

279
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,980
It's fine.

280
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,430
Mr Chen.

281
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,430
She has resigned from Rui,

282
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,710
but she hasn't signed her termination.

283
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,000
You have to sign it soon,

284
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,430
it's compulsory.

285
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,990
That's not it.

286
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,920
You see, Mr Chen...

287
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,580
There's a penalty
to breaking the contract.

288
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,010
I'd like to discuss with you

289
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,760
to see if there's a workaround

290
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,490
such as a salary advance.

291
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,510
You want to pay the penalty
with your advance?

292
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,020
Then how long will you have to work?

293
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,550
It's okay.

294
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,010
The company will pay for you.

295
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,910
Really?

296
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,120
Thank you, Mr Chen.

297
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,100
Thank you, Mr Chen.

298
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,570
Back off, back off.

299
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,790
Thank you, thank you.

300
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,950
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

301
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,820
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

302
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,000
You must be exhausted.

303
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,520
They are so enthusiastic.

304
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,790
Sorry to keep you waiting.

305
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,900
No, they're the ones who waited.

306
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,500
Fans are our lifeblood.

307
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,650
You do have high self-awareness now.

308
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,000
-Shall we talk?
-Sure, let's talk.

309
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,930
Say,

310
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,270
I'll talk with Ms Ouyang for a while,

311
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,859
later I'll meet you upstairs.

312
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,990
Just a few minutes, it won't take long.

313
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,950
Alright then, make it short.

314
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,470
-I'll go up first.
-Sure.

315
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,760
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

316
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,109
This is quite a good idea,

317
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,390
working with Rui
to create a clothing brand.

318
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,599
Do you have any candidate
for the designer?

319
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,329
As for the designer,

320
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,140
I have a great candidate.

321
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,380
He's very talented,

322
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,820
I think he suits us very well.

323
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,600
He's a friend of mine in England,

324
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,260
a renowned designer.

325
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,630
He's very influential in Europe.

326
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,410
I think he is perfect.

327
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,970
It's him then.

328
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,690
But if we want to hire him,

329
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,910
there will be two issues.

330
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,450
First of all, he's famous.

331
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,310
Can we cover the budget

332
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,910
and the expenses?

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,610
That's an issue.

334
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,160
Second, we're not sure if his style

335
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,830
is to your liking

336
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,090
or if it will

337
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,750
meet both of our requirements
and needs.

338
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,410
This is also an issue.

339
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,070
You know that my mum takes care
of most of my money.

340
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,850
If there's no choice,

341
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,190
I will use my own savings.

342
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,010
We'll start first, okay?

343
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,940
Okay?

344
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,280
I've tallied up what I have.

345
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,490
But since I've been making
some investments,

346
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,340
I don't have that much cash.

347
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,650
But I can sell my house first.

348
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,010
Stop joking with me.

349
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,580
I'm the one who should sell her house.

350
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,110
It's my brand,
why should you sell your house?

351
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,240
Why are we arguing over this?

352
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,610
We'll see what we can do later.

353
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,760
Okay.

354
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,780
Let's talk about the second issue.

355
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,210
As for the style,

356
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,790
I think you should talk to him first.

357
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,870
Let him design something for us,

358
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,960
then we'll see if they suit me.

359
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,910
You're right.

360
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,490
I'll ask him for a draft proposal first.

361
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,660
-Yes, a proposal.
-You'll take a look

362
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,450
and we'll discuss what to do.

363
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,940
Let's go along with that.

364
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,620
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,700
Something came up, that's why I'm late.

366
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,820
It's alright.

367
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,120
This is for you.

Little Duckling's termination fee?

369
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,300
I was supposed to give it to Jia Yun,

370
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,250
but she wouldn't answer my calls.

371
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,470
I reckon

372
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,510
she doesn't want to see me any more.

373
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,220
So I'll give it to you first.

374
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,630
What's the matter, Chen Lang?

375
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,360
I guess you didn't ask me here
just to give me this.

376
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,870
In fact,

377
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,510
regarding the counterfeit goods,

378
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,680
I know no one will listen to me

379
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,550
no matter what I say.

380
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,750
I just want to let Jia Yun know

381
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,950
that I didn't do this.

382
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,680
You know Jia Yun very well.

383
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,430
You know what she's like, don't you?

384
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,960
She only believes in the fact
that she sees.

385
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,690
Show her your proof.

386
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,660
I don't have any proof.

387
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,000
Since I'm meeting you today,

388
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,420
there's something that I should tell you.

389
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,350
Jia Yun is going to study
at the Cambridge Judge Business School.

390
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,770
I'm not in the position to say this,

391
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,920
but Jia Yun and you
should make a clean break.

How about some creamer to make it a latte?

Yu Shi complained to you, didn't he?

As our CFO, he ought to

435
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,510
tell me about these issues.

436
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,870
I've done the math.

437
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,940
A human being spends three
to five years of his life in lavatories.

438
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,880
So the environment of the lavatory
is very important.

439
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,990
When you have a comfortable

You learned that from Mr Duan, didn't you?

Ms Ouyang,

469
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,440
we shouldn't make this kind of joke.

like an outsider.

476
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,630
and it's terrific.

477
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,380
I don't know much about it,
but I do seem to recall

478
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,400
that Su Su likes them.

479
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,970

480
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,560
ask him to send one over.

481
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,990
Then you could give it to Su Su.

482
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,170
-But if she doesn't like them...
-She does!

483
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,220
She's very wild
about these things, I think.

484
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,090
In that case, I'll ask my friend
to send one over.

Whether it's training, ideation
or marketing,

505
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,020
she's just amazing.

506
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,160
Ms Ouyang is amazing,

507
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,730
but Mr Duan is awesome too.

508
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,700
Look, he really went to town
with the renovation.

509
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,670
Did Mr Duan engage these contractors
from 58.com?

510
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,320
They got here so soon.

511
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,260
Look at their outfits and equipment.
So professional.

512
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,970
I'm really happy

513
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,230
that Xi Xi returned to her position.

514
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,930
And Mr Duan gets to install his lavatory.

515
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,740
Everyone gets to make money happily.

516
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,920
I guess things are getting better now.

517
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,190
Hi, excuse me.

518
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,690
May I know where Mr Yu Shi is?

519
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,210
-There.
-Mr Yu.

520
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,370
The quotation for the office
and lavatory is ready. Here.

521
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,280
Okay, thank you.
You can proceed with your work.

522
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,490
Thank you.

523
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,690
We were interrupted just now.

524
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,860
Where were we again?

525
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,060
I said, didn't we agree last time?

526
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,880
You'll take advantage of this recruitment
to find a husband for me.

527
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,260
You'd better do a good job.

528
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,080
My lifelong happiness
is in your hands.

529
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,390
[Duan Ran's Office]

530
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,230
Sir, I don't want to build the wall here.

531
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,590
Can we build it somewhere else?

532
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,650
Sure. Just tell us whatever you want.

533
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,390
You'll definitely be happy
with the quality of the result.

534
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,310
Okay, build the wall here.

535
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,940
Move the entire wall here.

536
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,560
Move it here horizontally.

537
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,250
Move it here

538
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,900
and tear down this wall.

539
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,030
Then I'd like to have

540
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,900
a 1.5 metre wide door.

541
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,410
-A double door.
-Okay.

542
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
A 1.5 metre door is too small.

543
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,330
Make it 1.85 metres.

544
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,580
You can roll yourself inside.
It's absolutely comfortable.

545
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,660
No, listen.

546
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,160
If you make a double-door lavatory,

547
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,560
you'd have to push the doors
to go into the lavatory everyday.

548
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,240
Isn't that too much?

549
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,610
What are you doing?

550
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,320
Do you want to put the lavatory
in the middle of the office?

551
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,980
You're way too much.

552
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,210
Or do you want to use half your office

553
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,780
for a lavatory?

554
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,260
It's not even half, it's just one third.

555
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,400
Listen, lavatory is crucial.

556
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,100
It has to be big and grand.

557
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,600
We must install a high-quality lavatory.

558
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,880
Check out the third guy from there,

559
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,330
that guy who's stretching.

560
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,560
What do you think?

561
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,400
He has pretty good muscle definition.

562
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,720
What do you think?

563
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,380
That one with the green hat?

564
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,510
No, I mean the one with the green shirt.

565
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,140
He's a personal trainer.

566
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,950
He's a personal trainer at a gym.
I read his bio.

567
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,640
You have to watch out.

568
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,620
He's been through six jobs

569
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,420
within half a year.

570
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,060
It's too difficult to be with someone
who has no staying power.

571
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,210
You know.

572
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,740
That's really bad.

573
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,690
I can't lay up trouble for myself.

574
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,000
What about the one at the back?

575
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,320
That guy with the suit and glasses.

576
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,800
He has a yuppie vibe to him.

577
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,360
Him?

578
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,520
He does seem young,

579
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,530
but I don't see

580
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,310
any professionalism.

581
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,470
That's amazing.

582
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,230
Our company had over 10 million
in turnover on Singles' Day.

583
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,170
Don't be stingy with the lavatory.

584
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,310
That's the company's money.

585
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,290
-I don't care. I want to install it.
-Do you know how much it costs?

586
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,620
No. I want to install it.

587
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,140
-Then how dare you install it?
-I want it.

588
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,060
You can't!

589
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,400
Excuse me.

590
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,680
Ms Ouyang.

591
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,920
I overheard your conversation.

592
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,220
Come on in, come on in.

593
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,180
Don't you think lavatories and washrooms

594
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,820
are important

595
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,910
to a company?

596
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,450
Of course it is important.

597
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,580
It is essential.

598
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,010
There's a saying

599
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,890
that the quality of the lavatory

600
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,020
represents the quality of a company.

601
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,750
Besides, a comfortable lavatory
is also beneficial to the staff.

602
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,630
See?

603
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,640
You have to take care of your employees
in every detail.

604
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,250
-Right, Mr Duan?
-Exactly.

605
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,450
It's a representation of my standards.

606
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,660
I have to expand it.

607
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,800
Expand this wall by two more metres.

608
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,670
Two metres, you say?

609
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,310
If Mr Duan and Ms Ouyang
are fine with the budget,

610
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,240
just renovate it. It's fine.
I've no issue. Go ahead.

611
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,410
Do it.

612
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,660
It's just a lavatory renovation,

613
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,000
don't be mad.

614
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,600
I have a big heart.
I won't be mad so easily.

615
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,680
Okay, as long as you're not mad.

616
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,760
He keeps looking at his phone
to check himself out

617
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,890
and stroke his hair.

618
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,100
It shows he's superficial.

619
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,240
He writes those motivational articles.

620
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,950
Every night, he talks to his audience

621
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,800
on a motivational radio station.

622
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,400
He'll call you his soulmate

623
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,680
when in fact, everyone is his soulmate.

624
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,300
I just happened to read his bio.

625
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,330
Now I get it, Yu Shi.

626
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,630
So you mean

627
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,240
in this world,
there is no man suitable for me?

628
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,950
No, no.

629
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,910
You see,

630
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,980
when God created you,

631
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,950
he also created

632
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,240
your other half.

633
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,710
He may be right under your nose.

634
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,110
It's just that God doesn't want
you to find him yet.

635
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,510
Who knows, after going around in circles,

636
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,600
you just might find him.

637
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,320
I think you're quite good
at talking nonsense.

638
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,020
Why don't you work at
a motivational radio station?

639
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,100
It might be more promising and lucrative

640
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,130
than being a CFO.

641
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,840
You should think about it.

642
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,910
I...

643
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,710
I talk nonsense.

644
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,960
That's all because of you.

645
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,100
Do you think talking nonsense is easy?

646
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,480
160 thousand?

647
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,150
Ms Ouyang's budget is fine.

648
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,580
But Mr Duan's lavatory renovation
is way off budget.

649
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,110
Introduce yourself.

650
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,160
You can call me Lai.

651
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,470
I'm a fine arts graduate

652
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,800
skilled at celebrity inspired makeup.

653
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,860
I have quite a few followers on Weibo.

654
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,380
I often post makeup videos.

655
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,080
I have a bold style.

656
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,660
I've always wanted to be a
professional streamer.

657
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,350
And I also know domestic
and foreign cosmetic brands quite well.

658
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,750
As for the videos that you sent,

659
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,270
I've watched them.

660
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,190
The views aren't bad,

661
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,980
but what's the sales like?

662
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,450
I've promoted products
for Taobao sellers before.

663
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,860
So I have the basics down.

664
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,760
-That's it for today then.
-Okay.

665
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,730
-We'll update you.
-Sure.

666
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,810
Thank you.

667
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,800
What do you guys think?

668
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,970
I don't know much about makeup.
You girls decide.

669
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,120
Then I'll be frank.

670
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,790
I don't think
he has the potential to be a streamer.

671
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,850
I've watched his videos.

672
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,140
They are neither audience-oriented,
individualistic,

673
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,170
nor engaging.

674
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,650
The most important quality to look for

675
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,940
in a streamer

676
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,230
is the ability to make the viewers think

677
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,230
that the clothes will look nice on them

678
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,760
or that stuff will work well on them.

679
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,010
But I don't see that in his videos.

680
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,220
That's right.

681
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,540
I think,

682
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,640
making videos or tutorials

683
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,060
is actually different from live streaming,

684
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,960
am I right?

685
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,730
But I think he has the foundation,

686
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,330
so it shouldn't be an issue
after training.

687
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,370
Don't worry.

688
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,660
Training is useless.

689
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,970
This is a matter of pizazz
and personality.

690
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,240
If we're going to whitewash the
candidate's characteristics,

691
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,250
what's the point?

692
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,150
We could simply hire anyone.

693
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,560
That's not what I meant.

694
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,790
I didn't mean to eliminate
his personality

695
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,940
but to develop it and turn it into

696
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,230
an individual style.

697
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,320
You think pizazz and gusto still work

698
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,450
in this day and age?

699
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,120
We're choosing a streamer, not an artist.

700
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,650
The ability to communicate
is a top priority.

701
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,270
I think...

702
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,890
I think that young man is not bad.

703
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,980
Why don't we keep his resume on file?

704
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,040
For the time being.

705
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,060
Let him try out a pilot some time,
see how it works out

706
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
and go from there.

707
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,420
No pilot for him.

708
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,760
I've been a streamer
for such a long time.

709
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,400
I can tell
who is a good fit and who is not.

710
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,890
I second Duan Ran's idea.

711
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,930
I think he's not bad, give him a chance.

712
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,280
Keep his resume on file?

713
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,449
Sure...

714
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,409
And the pilot?

715
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,230
Fine. So it's two versus one?

716
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,449
Nice.

717
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,670
So we'll keep his resume on file, then.

718
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,100
We've met 13 of them.

719
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,710
Shall we vote for it?

720
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,050
The result will be determined
by the votes.

721
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,390
No one can object.

722
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,590
Sure, I agree.

723
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,670
There are three of us here.

724
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,070
Each of us chooses three candidates, okay?

725
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,930
I'll go first.

726
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,200
Done.

730
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,300
Three candidates.

[Duan, 3]

732
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,680
I think number three is not bad.

733
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,250
He's a young guy

734
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,110
and has sales experience.

735
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,010
At least

736
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,440
he'll balance out the company's
gender ratio.

737
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,600
That's only one.

738
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,110
What about the other two?

739
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,710
Then, there's...

740
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,680
Number six.

741
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,300
Number six.

742
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,970
She's... She's not that suitable.

743
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,840
Number eight is better.

[Duan, 3, 8]

745
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,140
Number eight is not bad.

746
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,700
She's a model,

747
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,490
has her own Wechat Store,

748
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,800
a big fanbase, and high EQ.

-We can keep her.
-Not bad. I think she's good.

750
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,740
What about the last one?

751
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,320
Number five.

752
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,370
You like number five.

753
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,240
She's the best candidate today.

754

Okay?

Mr Duan,

come on. You think too much.

770
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,490
We're choosing candidates and talents.

771
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,980
It's normal to have different opinions

772
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,030
when it comes to tastes and preferences.

773
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,620
But as management,

774
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,850
we ought to be on the same page

775
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,120
about the big decisions.

00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,650
At least that's my opinion.

Don't you agree, Director Qian?

778
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,760
I do.

779
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,490
I hope we didn't misjudge anyone.

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,700

Don't mention him.

Tell me. Are you guys fighting again?

It's because of the lavatory renovation.

He asked for my opinion.

815

I told him lavatory renovation
is not necessary.

816

It's really not necessary.

She supported Duan Ran right away.

822
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,140
Now I'm in a difficult situation.

823

They're definitely in league.

824
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,430
They are conspiring,
working hand in glove

825
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,020
in their own little clique to thwart me.

826
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,190
That's it.

827
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,730
Nice one.

828
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,810
I was right, wasn't I?

829
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,940
Look at you, Xi Xi.

830
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,310
I see you're quite eloquent

831
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,660
when it comes to berating Ms Ouyang.

832
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,860
Are you making fun of me?

833
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,310
No.

834
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,210
From your point of view,

835
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,150
don't you think he's gone too far?

836
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,820
Are you hesitating?

837
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,510
When it comes to a couple's issues,

838
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,000
us outsiders wouldn't dare
comment or ask anything.

839
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,500
Zhang Jia Yun, you're not supporting me.

840
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,980
Am I wrong?

841
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,110
It's Duan Ran.

842
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,660
Should I not answer his call?

843
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,940
I'll let him call.
Let's see how long he can call.

844
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,060
Enough, princess.
Stop acting. Just answer the call.

845
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,920
-No way.
-If you don't,

846
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,160
he's going to hang up.

847
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,430
Hurry up, hurry up.

848
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,790
Hello, Qian Xi Xi.

849
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,140
What are you doing?

850
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,530
Nothing much.

851
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,540
I'm just

852
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,410
sleepy. I'm going to bed soon.

853
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,160
You left right after the meeting.

854
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,440
I wanted to take you

855
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,050
to a very nice Japanese bar.

856
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,880
He wanted to take me to a Japanese bar.

857
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,090
It's fine. I wasn't hungry.

858
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,910
Just make it up for me tomorrow.

859
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,180
Are you mad at me?

860
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,860
No.

861
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,970
I have a big heart.

862
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,280
I won't be mad at you

863
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,700
just because you ganged up with Ms Ouyang.

864
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,950
I knew it was because of Ms Ouyang.

865
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,520
Xi Xi, Ms Ouyang and I
have long broken up.

866
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,920
[It's all in the past, okay?]

867
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,520
Now we're only colleagues.

868
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,810
You have to trust me.

869
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,440
You're the only girl in my heart now.

870
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,790
I can open it up and show you
if you want to.

871
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,320
So you know you're wrong.

872
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,700
I'll take you
to the Japanese bar tomorrow.

873
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,000
Deal. You'll take me there tomorrow.

874
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,490
One more thing.

875
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,060
I won't renovate the
office's lavatory any more.

876
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,020
[I've checked the budget]

877
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,420
[and asked the contractor.]

878
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,290
[It will be a major project.]

879
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,730
That's my baby's hard-earned money.

880
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,350
How can I waste it?

881
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,780
I have to save it for you.

882
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,820
[It's okay.]

883
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,750
[You don't have to be sad
because you can't renovate the lavatory.]

884
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,930
What's wrong?

885
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,170
I'm so jealous.

886
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,110
Good.

887
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,470
I don't want to eat sushi.

888
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,440
What's so nice about white rice?

889
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,790
It tastes awful.

890
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,580
The soup isn't any better either.

891
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,700
I have to drink it with the rice,
otherwise it's too salty.

892
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,910
Go inside.

893
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,890
Go inside. I can't stand you two.

894
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,940
I'm so jealous.

895
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,310
So jealous.

896
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,440
What's the big deal
about having a boyfriend?

897
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,780
So jealous.
