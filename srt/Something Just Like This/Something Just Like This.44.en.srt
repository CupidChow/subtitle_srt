[We Are Young]

00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,610
[Episode 44]

4
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,580
How I wish I could be the person

5
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,080
who brings you joy and sunshine.

6
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm happy to be with you too.

7
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,410
You can also bring me sunshine,

8
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,440
because you're my best buddy.

9
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,539
Okay, I just got friend-zoned.

10
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,700
I've met someone in my life

11
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,970
whom I'm willing

12
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,830
to give warmth and sunshine to.

13
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,150
Seriously, Xi Xi.

14
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,729
Back then, Uncle Qian told me

15
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,660
that you and Duan Ran had no chance.

16
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,670
But every time, I can see
that you're really firm.

17
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,150
With you,

18
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,810
I can't make you that happy.

19
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,890
That is why I...

20
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,100
You are Jiang Zhe Yang.

21
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,200
You have so many fans who adore you.

22
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,340
You are their superstar,

23
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,610
the best guy.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,229
It's just that both of us

25
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,120
are not meant to be together.

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,510
You see,
the girl I like doesn't like me back.

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,970
What's the point
of having tens of thousands of fans?

28
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,350
You don't want them?

29
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,329
So will you give them to me?

30
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,300
I mean it.

31
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,460
You will meet a great girl.

32
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,730
When you, a superstar dates someone
in the future,

33
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,329
remember to tell me.
I want to know your gossip.

34
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,920
Sure, I'll inform you right away.

35
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,600
Best buddy.

36
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,660
Best buddy.

37
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,220
How was the live stream?

38
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,750
Not bad, it went quite well.

39
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,300
There, number 7, stay here.

40
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,050
Do a pilot live,

41
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,730
the result will be out later.

42
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,180
Number 6, this is you.

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
Work hard. You can do it.

44
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,420
This is our company contract.

45
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,480
It includes your salary, benefits,

46
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,360
salary payment method

47
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,450
and shares as additional reward.

48
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,530
This is the best contract
I've ever came across.

49
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,610
There's no unfair clause.

50
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,320
Everything is so clear.

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,840
You will know in the future,

52
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,190
Mr Chen is not a penny pincher

53
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,790
when it comes to this aspect.

54
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,030
In fact, the unfair clauses you mentioned

55
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,190
are called unconscionable contract.

56
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,860
They're against the law.

57
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,910
As for me,

58
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,340
I work my hardest

59
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,640
to provide you with this platform

60
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,700
in hopes that your effort all this time

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,450
can be reflected in reality.

62
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,550
Dad, why are you video calling me again?

63
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,610
What's the matter?

64
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,830
[When I went for a jog yesterday,]

65
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,670
[I saw a house.]

66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,170
[It's a double-storey white house,]

67
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,370
[really beautiful.]

68
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,500
[I think you'll love it.]

69
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,500
[This house happens to be for sale.]

70
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,960
[It's quite affordable.]

71
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,050
[It's the price of a two-bedroom
in Xiamen.]

72
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,620
[I think it's nice.]

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,450
That sounds nice.

74
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,740
Go on.

75
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,860
[I'm thinking]

76
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,900
[I have enough savings.]

77
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,140
[I want to buy it for you.]

78
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,860
[Do you think]

79
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,290
[that if I move back with you,]

80
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,220
[will everything get better?]

81
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,950
[If that's the case,
I'll be able to get over Duan Ran.]

82
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,290
[Am I right?]

83
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,900
I'm afraid that you'll fall back in love
with Duan Ran.

84
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,870
But I know,

85
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,330
it's not easy

86
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,860
to take control of our feelings.

87
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,870
When you are sad,

88
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,430
it's making me even more sad.

89
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,400
[A lot of words have been said]

90
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,900
[about relationships.]

91
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,370
[But none is better than
when you figure it out yourself.]

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,660
But, you know,

93
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,020
you need time to figure it out.

94
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,380
You need time and space.

95
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,210
Actually, these two days
I've been thinking

96
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,950
whether I should go over for a bit.

97
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,650
Duan Ran found a new job recently.

98
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,300
He just got himself together

99
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,980
and is starting over.

100
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,590
In a new environment,

101
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,900
he needs to deal with lots of new stuff.

102
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,100
There are many things he has to adapt to.

103
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,180
I don't want to tell him now.

104
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,550
He will have a hard time
facing me and Aunt Zhou.

105
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,110
[That's right.]

106
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,950
[I'll pay the deposit
for that house later.]

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,640
Wait. So fast?

108
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,860
[I still have a lot of things
that I haven't dealt with.]

109
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,690
After I settle my stuff here

110
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780
and get my visa,

111
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,870
I'll inform you, alright?

112
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,830
[Alright. Tell me when you're ready.]

113
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,580
[I'll be waiting for you.]

114
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,110
Whose boyfriend is this?
Such a handsome man.

115
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,900
You finally showed up.

116
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,680
You didn't answer my calls

117
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,450
and my messages.

118
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,060
Were you expecting me to call the cops?

119
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,670
I was busy.

120
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,820
I'm busy launching
the second season of Vine.

121
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,880
It's your fault.

122
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,120
You told Ouyang to leave
the independent brand to me.

123
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,250
Now I'm drowning.

124
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,970
The first day Vine was launched,

125
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,299
Ding Ding snatched it from you, didn't he?

126
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,289
How did you know that?

127
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,270
Why not?

128
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,940
I'll take you around.

129
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,700
Where to?

130
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,060
Buy you a gift in the mall.

131
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,500
I saw a nice ring.

132
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,640
I'll buy it for you.

133
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,150
Duan Ran,

134
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,850
you just found a job

135
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,400
and you're buying me
such an expensive gift?

136
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,460
How hard can earning money be to me?

137
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,450
Forget it. I don't want it yet.

138
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,140
What's wrong?

139
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,740
Nothing. It's just that
I haven't been feeling myself recently.

140
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,150
Too many things happened at work.

141
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,550
When I feel better,
I'll take my time and choose one, alright?

142
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,940
That's an excuse.

143
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,710
Fine. Then what do you want to do?

144
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,790
I'm hungry, are you?

145
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,240
You brought food?

146
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,460
Fish balls!

147
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,000
Who told you my favourite is fish balls?

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
Then what's your favourite?

149
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,650
Egg tarts.

150
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,180
Let's share a box.

151
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,130
We only kept talking about me.

152
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,640
How about you? You got a new job.

153
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,100
Have you gotten used to it?

154
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,290
Every day has been productive.
I've many things to do.

155
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,820
I get to see many types
of people in the mall.

156
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,910
It's quite nice.

157
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,420
Everyday, I watch so many people

158
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,030
going back and forth.

159
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,730
They have different emotions,

160
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,980
different conditions

161
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,420
and different expressions.

162
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,350
As I listen to them
telling different stories,

163
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,350
I can also experience many stories.

164
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,540
I thought you're working in QE
as a floor manager

165
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,200
so that you get to experience life
in the future.

166
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,830
I am experiencing life.

167
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,850
If I tell you

168
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,050
that you're making excuses,

169
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,170
will you admit it?

170
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,560
You're running away from it.

171
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,830
Back in Rui,

172
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,700
we worked so hard
and put all our efforts in.

173
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,280
But no matter how hard we worked,

174
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,480
Shen Ding Ding took everything from us
with just one word.

175
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,410
But what if you were there?
What if you had stayed?

176
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,410
If you had stayed,

177
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,360
things could've been different.

178
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,350
At least I'd feel happy
seeing you everyday.

179
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,110
You give me energy.

180
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,410
Xi Xi.

181
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,620
Please understand my feelings.

182
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,210
What happened to Rui

183
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,950
had opened my eyes to the world.

184
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,980
Give me some time to find my way,
will you?

185
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,890
Should I go abroad for a while?

186
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,010
My dad told me

187
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,030
he wants me to spend some time with him.

188
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,470
Should we

189
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,700
take a break?

190
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,470
It's because of me.

191
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,230
When I was down,

192
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,740
what did you do?

193
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,080
You'd stay by my side every single day.

194
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,260
You talked to me and reasoned with me.

195
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,790
You brought me hope

196
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,700
and let me see the sunlight.

197
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,950
But now you're feeling down.

198
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,710
Why can't I do the same for you?

199
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,480
I can't calm you down

200
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,100
or make you feel better.

201
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,590
Besides, I affect you with my negativity.

202
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,960
I'd ignore your calls,

203
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,170
or like what I did earlier,

204
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,970
I'd mention these things again.

205
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,620
Xi Xi.

206
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,000
I know what you're feeling.

207
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,840
I also know

208
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,830
that everyone
has different attitudes and expressions

209
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,590
while facing the same things. I get it.

210
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,790
I know you're doing this for my own good.

211
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,490
I think I failed terribly
as your girlfriend.

212
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,660
Up until today, I've failed terribly.

213
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,700
Go ahead.

214
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,500
Uncle Qian has been staying abroad
for so many years.

215
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,830
He wants you to go there.

216
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,590
I get it.

217
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,950
I totally get it.

218
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,940
You should go.

219
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,410
But don't you mention breaking up.

220
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,250
Don't you ever say that again.

221
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,990
Duan Ran.

222
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,310
Let's go home for dinner next week.

223
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,180
I'll ask my mum to cook something nice.

224
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,510
We'll hold a farewell party for you, okay?

225
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,880
Be good.

226
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,290
If you're ready,

227
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,980
put up a sign.

228
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,980
Okay, let's start.

229
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,840
It's been a while
since I last stood on this platform.

230
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,060
After our account was suspended,

231
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,410
I kind of missed this place.

232
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,460
Look.

233
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,120
My mental support during live stream

234
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,390
is all in here.

235
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,290
I used to put a high stool here.

236
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,490
I'd squat on it.

237
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,870
At times, I'd stand up, squat or sit down,

238
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,270
-I'd instruct them from here.
-Really?

239
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,150
Yes.

240
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,950
But I don't need it today,

241
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,750
because my mental support
is standing right next to me today.

242
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,540
You just hired a new batch
of broadcasters.

243
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,360
It's just the first step
of your moon landing plan.

244
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,410
After that, you have to train them,

245
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,080
build them an image,

246
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,580
build up their fans circle,

247
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,650
and look for a suitable direction

248
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,060
and brands for them.

249
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,790
Look.

250
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,400
I've achieved
the first step of moon landing.

251
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,460
Aren't I getting closer
to conquering the universe?

252
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,710
Jia Yun,

253
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,910
are you free this weekend?

254
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,670
I have a classmate reunion this weekend.

255
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,150
In fact, I can skip it.

256
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,460
Can you?

257
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,300
I guess so.

258
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,010
When I was talking to Mr Wu back then,

259
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,590
I have so many mixed feelings.

260
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,490
We talked about the supply chain.

261
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,470
I think,

262
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,060
I should invite our Miss Zhang here

263
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,790
to the clothing market with me,

264
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,220
so that you can advise me
on the supply chain.

265
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,870
I can't decide by myself.

266
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,569
Then I guess

267
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,630
I have to learn from Mr Chen as well.

268
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,900
Uncle Duan,

269
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,900
Aunt Zhou.

270
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,060
After I leave,

271
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,460
I guess I won't be seeing you

272
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,829
for quite some time.

273
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,990
Here.
I brought this protein powder for you.

274
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,420
Keep this at home

275
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,829
and make a cup for yourself every morning.

276
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,380
Xi Xi is such a good girl.

277
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,780
Okay, I'll take it.

278
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,940
Xi Xi,

279
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,650
Aunt Zhou and I are very sad
that you're leaving.

280
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,320
Back then, when Duan Ran went to England,

281
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,660
Xi Xi was dying to go too.

282
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,540
But she didn't say it, right?

283
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,410
I wasn't being so obvious, right?

284
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,400
You didn't show it,

285
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,880
but I felt it.

286
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,680
Mothers are always sensitive.

287
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,780
That's expected.

288
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,920
Besides, my dad is abroad alone.

289
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,930
-I'm quite worried.
-Yeah, yeah.

290
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,260
I think it's time for me
to take care of him.

291
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,230
You're right.

292
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,540
I am also worrying.

293
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,110
Someone needs to take care
of my parents as well.

294
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,420
After you leave,

295
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,770
how can I live by myself?

296
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,420
Just get yourself a girlfriend.

297
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,260
Even Aunt Zhou is worried about you.

298
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,620
You have to take the initiative
and be positive.

299
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,140
Girlfriend?

300
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,230
People always say,

301
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,770
first be independent, then start a career,

302
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,440
and lastly, start a family, right?

303
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,710
I have nothing.

304
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,360
How can I find a girlfriend?

305
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,520
Dad, Mum, I won't find a girlfriend.

306
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,510
I won't.
I'm afraid that Xi Xi will be upset.

307
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,380
Son,

308
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,500
it goes,
get married and then start a career.

309
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Start a family and then career.

310
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,700
Your mum and I

311
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,890
had you after we got married.

312
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,290
After that, our business eventually grew.

313
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,480
-Exactly.
-Am I right?

314
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,540
Your mum is more anxious than me.

315
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,670
She can't wait to have grandchildren.

316
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,750
Xi Xi,

317
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,860
you're leaving all of a sudden.

318
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,720
Is it because
you've encountered problems at work?

319
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,230
No, Uncle Duan.

320
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,010
Duan Ran told me

321
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,780
that Ding Ding transferred you
to R&D Department.

322
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,350
Are you not happy there?

323
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,230
No, Uncle Duan.

324
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,420
Ding Ding is quite nice.

325
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,090
This time,

326
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,830
there were some issues
with our brand's samples.

327
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,890
He suggested to destroy the samples.

328
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,950
I tried my best to recover it.

329
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,990
He also gave me the green light
at the company

330
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,510
and helped us find various resources.

331
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,170
This is his responsibility
as a company leader.

332
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,740
Ding Ding that brat

333
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,990
is pretty smart in business.

334
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,650
That brat is too naughty and annoying

335
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,460
when he was young.

336
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,220
But when it comes
to business management,

337
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,140
I think he has his own idea.

338
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,940
-Okay.
-Don't you worry.

339
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,010
I believe Rui will get better
under his management.

340
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,860
I hope so.

341
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,840
Hopefully.

342
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Actually, today,

343
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,630
besides bidding farewell,

344
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,050
I'd also like to thank you

345
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,370
for raising me all these years.

346
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,870
It has been tough.

347
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,270
Besides, I'm leaving at this moment.

348
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,790
I feel

349
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,620
really bad.

350
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,610
I also think it's bad.

351
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,610
Then just stay.

352
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,670
Let's take care of them together.

353
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,490
Right? I can't take care of other people,

354
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,740
I'm bad at it.

355
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,780
By the way, bring Uncle Qian back.

356
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,090
We'll take care of three of them, alright?

357
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,410
Now our country

358
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,560
is much better than other countries.

359
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,570
Duan Ran, cut it out.

360
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,980
I'll go to the kitchen.

361
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,490
Okay.

362
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,830
Xi Xi, I'll help you out.

363
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,770
Jia Yun,

364
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,140
there is still a long way to go.

365
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,590
Should I play some music for you?

366
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,870
I'm listening to it now.

367
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,360
You're listening?

368
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,250
No, you're not.

369
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,420
I'm listening to the sun, wind and spring.

370
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,820
Aren't you romantic?

371
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,850
Alright. Just spit it out.

372
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,260
Once you got in the car, I could tell

373
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,190
you have so many things to say.

374
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,970
How did you know?

375
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,610
Can you tell me

376
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,250
if there's any imperfection

377
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,330
or problem

378
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,950
in our company management?

379
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,160
Frankly speaking,

380
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,910
I think the management of Cloud now

381
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,540
is so much better than Rui back then.

382
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,060
Especially the process management

383
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,420
and details,

384
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,660
they are on point and precise.

385
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,780
I have no choice.

386
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,950
That's the best part of a science geek.

387
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,890
Don't be so full of yourself yet,

388
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,140
I haven't finished.

389
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,970
But every process has its flaws.

390
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,770
I think the time efficiency

391
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,770
of those processes can be improved.

392
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,810
However,

393
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,730
there's also some waste of labour.

394
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,310
For instance,

395
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,130
you don't have to assign two assistants
to one broadcaster.

396
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,190
You also don't have

397
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,160
to plan out their time slots

398
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,760
and their fan management

399
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,440
during live streaming.

400
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,030
When you lay out a plan,

401
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,500
you can also

402
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,920
be more open.

403
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,560
Generally speaking,

404
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,640
I think you can be more flexible.

405
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,240
You're right.

406
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,850
But, I'm more of

407
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,160
a strict person.

408
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,160
I'd prefer a stronger sense of form,

409
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,010
creating a competitive environment

410
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,790
so that they're more competitive.

411
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,920
In this case, they'll be more cohesive

412
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,680
and fight their way out.

413
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,400
Do you know Antoine,

414
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,850
the author of The Little Prince?

415
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,610
Yes, I do.

416
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,650
For real?

417
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,400
He said something like this.

418
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,280
He said,

419
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,880
if you want to build a boat,

420
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,150
don't drum up the men to gather wood.

421
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,040
Instead, teach them

422
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,840
-to yearn for the sea.
-to yearn for the sea.

423
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,660
So you really read it.

424
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,250
Xi Xi.

425
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,490
I'm genuinely grateful
for what you've done.

426
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,060
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

427
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,320
Aunt Zhou.

428
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,350
This time, I will go abroad

429
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,770
and won't be coming back for some time.

430
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,000
As for Duan Ran and me...

431
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,120
I will gradually distance myself from him.

432
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,720
Anyway, I guess time will ease everything.

433
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,200
I will also control myself.

434
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,690
Don't worry.
I won't do anything which bothers you.

435
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,080
I'm sorry, Xi Xi.

436
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,910
Don't be.

437
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,260
Actually,
I'm quite worried about Duan Ran.

438
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,590
He has just started his career

439
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,280
and hasn't found his way yet.

440
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,970
After he finds his way,

441
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,740
he'll be busy
and have no time to take care of you.

442
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,200
You and Uncle Duan
must take care your own health,

443
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,910
especially Uncle Duan.

444
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,160
Xi Xi.

445
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,650
Do you think

446
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,650
that I'm being too selfish?

447
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,060
What are you talking about?

448
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,200
This is a little something

449
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,030
that Duan and I got for you.

450
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,180
I don't want it. Why are you doing this?

451
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,530
-I don't want it.
-You know it,

452
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,730
we're not like how we used to be any more.

453
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,730
When we were
in a better condition last time,

454
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,680
I'd have given you more, right?

455
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,150
You'll be abroad.

456
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,490
We'll worry about you too.

457
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
Take it.

458
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,250
Aunt Zhou.

459
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,720
Jia Yun,

460
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,750
what do you think about this?

461
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,580
Not bad.

462
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,720
Although they are all basic items,

463
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,280
but they're essentials.

464
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,160
I think, during live streaming,

465
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,560
you can mix and match.
That'll do the trick.

466
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,770
I'll bargain with the boss.

467
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,770
Okay.

468
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,890
Boss,

469
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,910
how much stock do you have left?

470
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,970
I want all of them.

471
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,100
Each of them has hundreds of pieces.

472
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,020
Look around.

473
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,970
Anything else that you want?

474
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,440
What are you doing?

475
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,480
Come here.

476
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,850
This... This really can't work.

477
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,190
This is even worse.

478
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,070
Mr Chen,

479
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,680
look how cute your girlfriend is.

480
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,640
Stand properly and let her take a photo.

481
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,680
We're not yet... No.

482
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,770
Hurry up. Turn around.

483
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,690
Can you stop sticking your tummy out?

484
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,780
I don't have a tummy.

485
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,660
No.

486
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,730
How about this?

487
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,740
Good. This is nice.

488
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,770
Look.

489
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Mr Chen,

490
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,280
your wife is so capable and beautiful.

491
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,520
Why didn't you take her out sooner?

492
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,600
I...

493
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,400
Alright. I sent you the photo.

494
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,940
Take a look yourself.

495
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,390
Remember to pay the bill.

496
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,790
I'll go to the next store.

497
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,650
You can do it.

498
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,960
Are you hiding something from me?

499
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,270
Two days ago when I told my mum
you're going abroad,

500
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,270
my mum also pulled my dad aside

501
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,920
and talked behind my back
for quite some time.

502
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,200
Duan Ran,

503
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,410
I think you should join Cloud Live.

504
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,770
Uncle Duan is also
their major shareholder after all.

505
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,000
Let me take you home later.

506
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,390
No.

507
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,480
You don't have to send me.

508
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,940
I'm meeting Jia Yun later.

509
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,280
Jia Yun hasn't left yet?

510
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,400
She's leaving tomorrow.

511
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,450
Anyway, I've met Uncle Duan and Aunt Zhou.

512
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,650
It's getting late.

513
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,340
I should leave now.

514
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,600
Stay here for a while.

515
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,250
Stay here for a while before leaving.

516
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,400
I have things to do later.

517
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,330
Jia Yun,

518
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,190
I'm really happy today.

519
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,230
-I've never thought...
-Me too.

520
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,310
Besides,

521
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,680
I know what you're trying to say.

522
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,150
But this time,

523
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,730
will you let me start first?

524
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,920
Okay.

525
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,270
Back then, I kept turning you down,

526
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,330
turning Xi Xi down,

527
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,260
refused to start a business with you guys.

528
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,440
I was a hypocrite and said,

529
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,340
I wanted to marry a rich man.

530
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,850
I didn't want to work,

531
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,600
I wanted to go home and retire.

532
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,000
But deep down, I knew.

533
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,790
I had been

534
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,810
running away from my true self.

535
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,490
Her life wasn't easy at all.

536
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,070
Actually, I know it very well.

537
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,850
People like us

538
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,330
who came from a small town

539
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,970
and work in a big city.

540
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,970
Who doesn't want to take root here?

541
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,820
But that's really difficult.

542
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,280
It's too stressful.

543
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,740
That's why I'm grateful
for Xi Xi and Duan Ran.

544
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,170
They never gave up on me

545
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,180
and never stopped fighting for me.

546
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,720
You know, back then, you and Xi Xi

547
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,270
kept persuading me,

548
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,570
but I never agreed.

549
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,390
Do you know how Duan Ran
finally made me agree?

550
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,290
Xi Xi.

551
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,040
After you leave,

552
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,100
I don't know when we can meet again.

553
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,340
You must take good care of yourself.

554
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,950
Promise me.

555
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,620
After you get there,

556
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,620
you have to call me every week.

557
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,840
Not just every week.

558
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,260
I'll call you whenever I miss you.

559
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,140
Good.

560
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,520
Xi Xi.

561
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,260
I will do a check-up soon.

562
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,220
If everything goes well with the check-up,

563
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,580
Aunt Zhou and I

564
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,240
will visit you and your dad.

565
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,320
That's great.

566
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,620
You should go there soon.

567
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,540
My dad will be thrilled.

568
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,220
Alright, you don't have to see me off.

569
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,610
Come, give me a hug.

570
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,120
I'm off.

571
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,700
After leaving,

572
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,420
you have to take care of yourself.

573
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
If something happens, don't worry.

574
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,970
Your brother's here.

575
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,570
Call me if there's anything.

576
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,440
Did you hear me? Did you hear me?

577
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,780
Be gentle, I heard you.

578
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,570
A brother should do his duty.

579
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,450
Stay here with Uncle Duan and Aunt Zhou.

580
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,810
Take good care of them.

581
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,850
Don't worry about me.

582
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,020
Just take good care of yourself.

583
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,110
I will take good care of myself.

584
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,240
Alright, I have to leave.

585
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,090
Okay. Go ahead, go.

586
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,270
See you.

587
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:22,460
[Bank card]

588
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,840
Have you received the admission letter?

589
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,060
I will leave tomorrow.

590
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,330
You seemed to be concerned

591
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,750
about Cloud Live and me.

592
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,000
I thought

593
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,889
you would stay here and manage it with me.

594
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,830
Chen Lang,

595
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,270
I came to see you today

596
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,110
to bid you farewell.

597
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,200
You'll be on your own from now on.

598
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,160
In fact,

599
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,110
we are not meant to be together.

600
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,590
I know.

601
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,720
I really don't want
to burden you any more.

602
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,870
Just like what you said,

603
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,220
we are young people

604
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,760
who came from a small town.

605
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,550
Life has given us

606
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,750
way too many burdens.

607
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,240
I can no longer be a burden in your life.

608
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,030
For example, the incident
with our own brand.

609
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,180
If it weren't for me,

610
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,270
you wouldn't have been so easily used
by Ding Ding.

611
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,400
You're still upset about this, aren't you?

612
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,320
You know,

613
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,660
if you keep pursuing

614
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,550
things that don't belong to you,

615
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,510
hankering over tons of things,

616
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,000
you will be trapped by these things

617
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,110
and never find happiness.

618
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,310
Jia Yun,

619
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,690
we were talking about The Little Prince
in the car earlier.

620
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,750
Do you remember?

621
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,310
Although I'm not a prince,

622
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,480
I really consider you my rose.

623
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,380
I will stay by you my whole life.

624
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,510
By all means, just go to England.

625
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,570
No matter how long,

626
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,520
I'll wait for you.

627
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,160
Look, the sunset is beautiful.

628
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,810
But, no matter
how beautiful the sunset it,

629
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,500
it's just an ordinary event.

630
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,040
It's an ordinary event
which you can never change.

631
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,400
We have to learn to give up.

632
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,350
Otherwise, how can we find happiness?

633
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,560
Jia Yun.

634
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,680
Do you know why I like sunsets so much?

635
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,350
It's just like my feelings for you.

636
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,620
I know it will sink little by little,

637
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,440
but it will rise as usual the next day.

638
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,790
That's how much I like you.

639
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,280
There's no way I can change it.

640
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,740
What's the matter? Why did you ask me

641
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,510
to such a romantic place?

642
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,680
I want to enjoy the sea breeze
and relax a little.

643
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,960
Did something happen?

644
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,960
Xi Xi rejected me again.

645
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,440
This time, she completely rejected me.

646
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,830
There are certain things

647
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,160
which you have to let go

648
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,640
when you have to.

649
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,660
I think, letting go

650
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,550
means you stop competing with it

651
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,740
and also stop being hard on yourself.

652
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,020
Sometimes, just giving
is already enough.

653
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,720
But this kind of devotion

654
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,150
is also a kind of tribute to your love.

655
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,230
If she rejects you or turns you down,

656
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,590
that's normal.

657
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,860
It's not her fault.

658
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,720
But I think,

659
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,220
what if fate comes

660
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,430
and I find someone whom I love even more?

661
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,830
Besides, you're so young, right?

662
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,100
Tens of thousands of girls like you.

663
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,480
What are you afraid of?

664
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,510
Who knows,
you might even meet the right girl

665
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,440
when you're on your way back later.

666
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,200
That is why I said,

667
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,300
when it's time to move on,
then you should.

668
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,840
Ouyang, you're really carefree.

669
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,750
Actually, I was thinking about something.

670
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,550
It's actually quite easy

671
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,000
to figure them out.

672
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,750
Never underestimate
the power of companionship.

673
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,440
They grew up together
and lived together since young.

674
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,040
Now they're working together
and starting a business together.

675
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,060
Rain or shine,

676
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,160
they went through so many things together.

677
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,680
To be honest,

678
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,560
I think it's hard for others
to stand in their way.

679
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,150
Then,

680
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,440
if they can do it, why can't we?

681
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,870
Do what?

682
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,600
Start a business!

683
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,830
How can you jump from this topic to that?

684
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,110
Starting a business?

685
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,150
You have no idea.

686
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,160
After you left,
the whole team has lost its unity.

687
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,550
When you were there,
I didn't have to worry about a thing.

688
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,510
But now,

689
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,040
I even have to teach them.

690
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,060
So, seriously, the best thing for me

691
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,800
is to work together with you.

692
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,480
But Yang Yang, I mean it.

693
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,590
There can only be one decision maker
in a company.

694
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:40,110
If I go back, won't things be the same?

695
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,920
Ouyang, listen to me.

696
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,710
I listened to my mum

697
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,960
because I wanted to be a good son.

698
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,240
You know it too.

699
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,440
So, if you really do come back,

700
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,880
I will talk to my mum.

701
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,390
So,

702
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,760
you don't plan to tell Duan Ran
about Aunt Zhou?

703
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,470
You're afraid that he'll be guilty

704
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,640
and your relationship
won't be so simple any more.

705
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,790
Only Jia Yun knows me best.

706
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,830
Seriously, when I heard

707
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,400
that Aunt Zhou indirectly
caused my mother's car accident,

708
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,550
I felt like the sky was falling.

709
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,470
I can't imagine what Duan Ran would think

710
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,350
if he finds out.

711
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,030
It concerns the two of you.

712
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,280
It might be better
if both of you solve it together.

713
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,240
Look. What you just said

714
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,190
was the assumption you made
about Duan Ran.

715
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,110
In fact, you don't really know

716
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,790
what he will do.

717
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,960
I dare not ask him.

718
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,530
I'm not confident as well.

719
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,710
I love Duan Ran.

720
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,440
He is like my other life.

721
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,870
But I really can't face
Aunt Zhou's predicament.

722
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,350
I don't know what to do.

723
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,570
So you chose to run away from it.

724
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,480
No.

725
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,150
Now, I chose

726
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,410
to let time tell me the answer.

727
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,660
Such a passive attitude

728
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,880
is not that Qian Xi Xi
whom I'm familiar with.

729
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,100
I can be impulsive and direct,

730
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,250
but I can't hurt other people.

731
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,880
If I stay,

732
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,550
Aunt Zhou will definitely be very sad.

733
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,010
Uncle Duan will be in a dilemma.

734
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,700
And if Duan Ran finds out,

735
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,880
I really have no idea

736
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,590
what choice he will make.

737
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,400
Anyway, I made my choice.

738
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,060
What about you?

739
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,920
I've also talked things over with him.

740
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,700
Anyway, this is life.

741
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,720
There are ups and downs,
meetings and farewells.

742
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,920
Just go with the flow.

743
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,270
As for you,

744
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,690
I'll just stay with you.

745
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,660
What's wrong?

746
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,830
Xi Xi.

747
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,200
You are my best friend.

748
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,180
I mean it. I think

749
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,540
you're always so straightforward,

750
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,230
brave and direct.

751
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,550
You made a passive person like me

752
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,570
improve a lot.
