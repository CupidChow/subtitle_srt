Say, were we terrible when we were kids?

00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,000
How so?

25
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,180
Kids fool around all the time.

26
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,070
Right? How were we terrible?

27
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,400
Besides, it's so fun to trick Ding Ding.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Sometimes, I just can't help myself.

29
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,090
He can trick me too.

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,139
Can you stop it?

31
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,970
Now he's back with a vengeance.

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,640
Did you see how smug he
was in the company?

33
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,400
I never knew

34
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,930
he had such a good memory.

35
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,160
He remembered everything.

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,329
He's just petty.

37
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,550
Now, he even got his old man
mixed up in this.

38
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,880
Why didn't I see Uncle Shen's
true colours before?

39

Didn't your father tell you just now?

40
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,940
Uncle Shen and him have
fundamental differences.

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,290
Yes.

42
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,060
Didn't we establish our own brand?

43
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,900
Now Ding Ding is getting involved
in the company.

44

Do you think he'll try to sabotage us?

45
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,170
I don't even think

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,100
he'll get Rui's controlling interest.

47

-I'll go have a look.
-No! It's fine.

He got away.

No! I got away!

You can't let him step all over you.

-It's fine.
-You can't wait until he's hit you!

if anyone in this company, especially you,

were to be bullied,

86
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,490
it'd be by me.

87
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,580
No outsider can bully any one of you.

88
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,530
I'll show them what I got if
they do anything to you.

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,160
That's very kind of you.

Find some time to work out.

93
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,400
Go to the gym or learn some martial arts.

94
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,400
Look how thin you are.

95
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,680
Did you starve yourself?

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,990
Anyone can bully you then.

97
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,320
You're practically asking to be bullied.

98
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,800

99
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,210

Please speak your mind, Mr Shen.

101
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,620
Sure.

102
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,070
I'm here today

103
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,180
on behalf of the board of QE Group

104
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,870
to meet with every one of you.

105
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,540
Right now, our company isn't satisfied

106
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,240
with Rui Live's

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,050
management.

108
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,810
So, after our discussion,

109
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,290
we've decided to re-elect

110
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,020
Rui Live's CEO.

111
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,250
Rui Live doesn't have any
management problems.

112
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,570
Besides, I never heard anything

113
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,590
from QE and the board about Rui.

114
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,170
Think about it from the Group's

115
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,870
perspective.

116
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,620
Mr Shen Sr recently assumed his position.

117
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,040
His responsibility is to revamp QE.

118
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,710
And Rui Live should re-elect someone

119
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,510
who shares the same ideals as he does.

120
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,450
As a subsidiary of the group,

121
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,230
Rui Live should support his mission.

122
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,390
We have shareholders in our staff.

123
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,940
Although you represent Mr Shen and QE,

124
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,560
which account for 45 percent
of Rui's shares,

125
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,680
you don't have the final say in this.

126
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,380
We have to go through a majority vote

127
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,040
for all plans and big decisions.

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,260
Fine. If that's the way
you want to play...

130
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,880
Of the remaining 55 percent,

131
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,730
how much do you own?

132
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,050
Then do you agree

133
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,340
to let me hold your six percent of shares

134
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,380

[to not rest in peace, right?]

I'm sorry, Mr Duan.

147

I'm sorry.

148

Good.

149
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,820
As the majority shareholder,

150
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,230
I hereby announce

151
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,310
a re-election of Rui Live's CEO.

152
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,090
The new CEO is

153
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,770
Yu Shi.

154
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,930
No!

155
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,190
I supported Mr Shen as you requested.

156
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,400
I even gave you my six percent.

157
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,840
Don't appoint me as the CEO!

158
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,590
I think Mr Duan and Ms Qian

159
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,010
did pretty well as CEOs!

160
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,040
Is it necessary for you to
elect a new one?

161
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
It's totally necessary!

162
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,440
Look, Yu Shi.

163
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,540

have left the room

170

00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,130
But let's continue our meeting.

172
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,610
Su Su! Su Su!

173
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,250
Come back! Come back!

174
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,340
Listen to me! Don't be mad, Su Su!

175
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,710
Su Su, listen to me!

176
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,460
Su Su, don't leave!
Listen to me, Su...

177
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,910
Don't look at me that way.

178
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,660
-Su Su.
-Please explain.

179
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,930
Su Su.

180
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,340
There's a lot of things
that you don't know.

181
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,600
I had a master.

182
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,740
He took care of me

183
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,700
and took me into the trade.

184
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,500
He even sponsored my education.

185
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,810
Then, he was sent to jail for a mistake

186
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,400
and died inside.

187
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,440
He left behind a huge debt

188
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,400
for his family.

189
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,340
His wife.

190
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,550
His daughter.

191
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,420
They were not going to make it

192
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,110
and they were almost ruined.

193
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,900
But then, Shen Jiang Tao offered to help.

194
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,010
Mr Shen Sr helped my master's wife
and her family.

195
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,150
He helped me as well.

196
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,010
He took me into QE.

197
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,010
He's our great benefactor.

198
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,540
I must repay him

199
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,130
by serving the Shen family.

200
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,930
-I have no other choice!
-Yu Shi!

201
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,590
Do you know how serious this is?

202
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,180
Don't you know Xi Xi and
Duan Ran will lose Rui

203
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,440
if you give up your six percent of shares?

204
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,090
I know, Su Su.

205
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,390
What I'm saying now

206
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,960
may sound ridiculous

207
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,240
and unbelievable.

208
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,900
But I really did it for my master!

209
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,880
He was my greatest benefactor!

210
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,950
Greater than your friendship
with Duan Ran?

211
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,750
Greater than our relationship?

212
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,550
Greater than your friendship
with everyone?

213
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,460
Listen here, Yu Shi.

214
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,450
You've betrayed everyone today.

215
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
I'll never forgive you!

216
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,090
You're worse than all the
guys I blind dated!

217
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,850
-Su Su!
-I'm warning you!

218
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,720
Don't come near me! We're through!

219
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,750
Do you hear me, big shot CEO?

220
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,380
Duan Ran, Qian Xi Xi.

221
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,800
I think you two are not capable

222
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,170
of working at the management
level anymore.

223
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,820
You're both suspended.

224
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,320
Qian Xi Xi, you'll go back to being
a broadcaster.

225
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,290
Duan Ran, since you enjoy working
with her so much,

226
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,920
you'll be her manager.

227
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Shen Ding Ding, you've gone too far!

228
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,620
How so?

229
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,610
Shen Ding Ding.

230
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,330
I said nothing

231
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,120
when you took QE away.

232
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,980
If you have any problems

233
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,340
you can come right at me.

234
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,080
But don't you lay a finger
on this company!

235
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,700
Why are you creating a mess?

236
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,090
This company,

237
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,050
the place you're sitting in.

238
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,780
Everything here is Qian Xi Xi's

239
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,430
blood, sweat and tears.

240
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,090
What are you doing here?

241
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,930
Who are you to sit here?

242
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,930
Who are you to speak to us?

243
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,740
Duan Ran, I'll tell you.

244
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,370
I learned how to be a bully from you.

245
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,710
You should reflect on your mistakes.

246
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,830
[Shapowei Art Zone]

247
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,110
Don't speak about Duan Ran
and Qian Xi Xi to me!

248
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,490
I'm not hearing it!

249
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,860
Let me tell you.

250
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,670
From the moment you vote for me,

251
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,370
you're a traitor.

252
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,330
You have no way back.

253
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,480
Why don't you fulfill your potential?

254
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,500
Well, I think being a CFO is my life's

255
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,790
highest potential.

256
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,730
Look at you, so unambitious.

257
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,060
People should strive to
climb higher in life.

258
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,780
You're now the CEO.

259
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,840
We can work together and take
Rui to the next level.

260
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,230
Why not?

261
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,190
Why don't you become the CEO yourself?

262
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,030
I have an investment firm myself.

263
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,690
And I have a fund to care about.

264
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,110
I have to wake up at night
to look at American stocks.

265
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,200
Become the CEO myself?

266
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,460
Do I have the time?

267
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,630
Let me tell you something.

268
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,180
To put it nicely,

269
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,940
this promotion to CEO is a reward.

270
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,190
To put it harshly,

271
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,380
it's a bargain

272
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,050
considering how much my family

273
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,870
has done for you.

274
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,180
Be appreciative, alright?

275
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,840
Let's not be enemies.

276
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,260
Hello? Mr Five?

277
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,930
I never thought

278
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,070
Yu Shi would join forces

279
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,820
with that jerk Shen Ding Ding.

280
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,980
I was so blind.

281
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,950
Yu Shi betrayed us and
Ding Ding took the office.

282
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,530
Duan Ran and Xi Xi are demoted
as employees.

283
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,470
Why don't we all just resign?

284
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,240
We'll start up a new company instead
of suffering here.

285
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,900
That's easier said than done.

286
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,740
You can't start a company just like that.

287
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,020
Rui wouldn't have gotten this far

288
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,930
without our collective effort

289
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,070
and perseverance.

290
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,730
So let's not give up so soon, okay?

291
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,770
Ms Ouyang, you're finally back.

292
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,020
I heard about the situation.

293
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,650
So I rushed back from the airport.

294
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,800
The company is now a war front.

295
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,300
We must do our best to secure it.

296
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,740
Ding Ding has more shares.

297
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,260
That's why he can speak with authority.

298
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,670
We should bear with it for now

299
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,490
and strike when the time comes.

300
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,410
Well said.

301
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,430
Well said indeed.

302
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,140
I've heard so much about you, Ms Ouyang.

303
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,079
I haven't seen you these two days.

304
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,829
I finally get the chance to see you now.

305
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,940
Nice to meet you.

306
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,369
So you're the legendary Mr Ding?

307
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,600
That's me.

308
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,600
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,020
I took a few days off and
went on a vacation.

310
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,860
I should be the one apologising.

311
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,220
If I knew you were coming back,

312
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,170
I would've fetched you at the airport.

313
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,630
After all, you're Rui's pillar
of strength.

314
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,420
I must take good care of you.

315
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,750
You're too modest.

316
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,120
Alright. Shouldn't you be working

317
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,770
this early in the morning
instead of chatting?

318
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,970
We have this tradition of planning
our day in the morning.

319
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,990
Sure, I'll join in then.

320
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,960
I'll sit here and listen to your plans.

321
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,580
Please continue.

322
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,200
I have something else on.

323
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,270
Su Su, wait for me.

324
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,470
Su Su!

325
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,800
You...

326
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,890
I bought you some breakfast.

327
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,150
There you are.

328
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,080
There's your favourite sunny side up eggs

329
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,270
and dumplings.

330
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,390
Come...

331
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,650
No need.

332
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,530
I called you last night.

333
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,770
Why didn't you pick up?

334
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,560
-Last night I...
-Yu Shi.

335
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,390
Can you stay away from me?

336
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,660
Stop coming here.

337
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,000
Okay.

338
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,710
Please calm down.

339
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,200
Don't forget your breakfast.

340
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,980
You're back?

341
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,170
I'm back.

342
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,050
What are you doing?

343
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,750
I'm tidying up Qian Xi Xi's
dressing table.

344
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,150
Xi Xi is going live today.

345
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,070
I don't want any mistakes.

346
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,360
I want everything to be perfect for her.

347
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,190
What a warm guy!

348
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,840
You're really good to Xi Xi.

349
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
I know what happened to your family.

350
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,980
And I know it's hard for you

351
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,200
right now.

352
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,930
You must be very worried and anxious.

353
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,150
But don't be disheartened.

354
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,780
I know you'll bounce back someday.

355
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,470
You have our support.

356
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,250
Ouyang.

357
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,700
It may not be appropriate
to say this out loud,

358
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,750
but still, I must let you know.

359
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,720
Right now,

360
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,040
Rui isn't what it used to be anymore.

361
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,600
And I'm not the man I was.

362
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,100
You're free now.

363
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,370
If you wish to leave

364
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,320
or if you have other options,

365
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,810
you can leave without any guilt

366
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,460
or worry.

367
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,880
As for me,

368
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,750
I can no longer

369
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,120
give you opportunities

370
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,170
to develop professionally.

371
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,130
Besides,

372
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,380
-Xi Xi and I are both...
-I know.

373
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,630
I'm staying here

374
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,370
because I want to

375
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,480
make my mark here.

376
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,280
To start a business.

377
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,460
To change the world while I'm young.

378
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,570
But now,

379
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,260
we can only hang on together.

380
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,980
Then hang on we shall.

381
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,300
Hello? Hello?

382
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,930
Hello, everyone.

383
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,080
This is our first meeting.

384
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,500
I'll introduce myself.

385
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,330
My name is Shen Ding Ding.

386
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,920
I'm Rui Live's new captain.

387
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,510
From now on, you'll be braving

388
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,840
the waves of the internet industry

389
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,300
under my leadership.

390
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,000
I can bring to the table

391
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,850
not only the vast resources
and support of QE,

392
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,980
but also my financial background.

393
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,290
I'll follow in Mr Shen's footsteps

394
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,970
-and revamp QE.
-What?

395
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,850
No more selling leftover stock.

396
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,380
No more selling low class garments

397
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,080
from little workshops in
lower-tier cities.

398
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,850
We'll only sell top brands.

399
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,600
Rui Live will only sell high end products.

400
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,810
I will also introduce Baoqi, Maya,

401
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,850
and various top brands to Rui Live.

402
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,870
-Very soon, we'll...
-Hold your thought, Ding Ding.

403
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,400
What did you say, Qian Xi Xi?

404
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,240
Do you know that you're daydreaming?

405
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,750
You've only just come back from abroad.

406
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,780
You don't know about the market here.

407
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,480
China's internet industry is thriving

408
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,820
only thanks to the mass market,

409
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,410
not the high-end consumers like you said.

410
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,530
Understand?

411
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,190
Listen here, Qian Xi Xi,
spare me your smart talk.

412
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,940
I make more in a week than
you do in a year.

413
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,840
Listen to Xi Xi about the company.

414
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,540
You're inexperienced.

415
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,720
We've been doing it for ages.

416
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,450
You can ask if you don’t know.

417
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,980
What are you two up to?

418
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,730
Do you know how important today is?

419
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,290
This is my first meeting and
you're sabotaging it?

420
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,590
What do you mean?

421
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,250
I'll tell you.

422
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,750
Yes, my father and I took Uncle Duan down.

423
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,730
You must've felt uncomfortable.

424
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,710
But QE is getting weaker every year!

425
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Why don't you let my father have a go?

426
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,010
Perhaps QE might be saved

427
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,790
from this difficulty, right?

428
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,310
Your father is not a problem.

429
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,720
I meant that managing this company

430
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,190
in this industry

431
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,750
is not your forte, right?

432
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,180
Listen to Xi Xi.

433
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,450
Listen to Yu Shi. It's good for you.

434
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,880
We built Rui Live from the ground up.

435
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,660
It's like our child.

436
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,860
Do you know Rui well enough?

437
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,750
Do you understand the industry?

438
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,880
Cloud Live was my previous investment.

439
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,900
From the fight with Pineapple Xpress
to personal branding,

440
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,790
could they only be Chen Lang's

441
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,660
own ideas?

442
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,650
Of course, I couldn't have done this

443
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,210
all by myself as well.

444
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,000
[Are you Director Yu?]

445
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,970
[I'm looking for you.]

446
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,610
[You're Mr Shen's son?]

447
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:13,690
[Yes.]

448
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,400
[You remember me?]

449
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,960
[Of course I do!]

450
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,400
[Mr Shen sent you here?]

451
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,370
[I'll do whatever you request me to do.]

452
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,370
[Good.]

453
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,660
[About the competition between
Rui and Cloud,]

454
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,190
[you know about the power
breakdown, right?]

455
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,980
[I did that.]

456
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,290
[I have some aftercare work
for you to do now.]

457
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,440
[Can you help me?]

458
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,560
[Don't you say you're going]

459
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,690
[-out with your girlfriend?]
[-Yes.]

460
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,520
[Don't worry, leave here to me.]

461
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,510
[You can go.]

462
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,630
[Hurry!]

463
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,390
[Hurry and go!]

464
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,830
[Yu Shi?]

465
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,570
[You're Yu Shi?]

466
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,460
[Mr Ding's friend?]

467
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,330
[Okay, come with me.]

468
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,300
[Hurry!]

469
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,010
[Central Control Room]

470
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,640
[Yes, that's right!]

471
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,980
[This part.]

472
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,470
The electric discharge cabinet
won't cut off itself.

473
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,270
The design draft can't get to
Chen Lang itself.

474
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,520
[Where did you get it?]

475
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,320
[You don't have to care about it.]

476
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,660
[I'll get you the pieces]

477
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,930
[from the country you want.]

478
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,090
[I'll get you whatever]

479
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,610
[material you want.]

480
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,250
You're all being fooled around by me.

481
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,180
Yu Shi!

482
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,860
You're the CEO now.
You're their supervisor.

483
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,910
Tell them your stand.

484
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,880
Duan Ran.

485
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,290
Duan Ran!

486
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,380
-I didn't do it on purpose.
-Scram!

487
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,660
-Duan Ran! Duan Ran!
-Please endure it!

488
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,100
Yu Shi!

489
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,900
Yu Shi!

490
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,190
I'm sorry to all of you.

491
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,340
I must've disappointed all of you today.

492
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,860
Tell me the truth.

493
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,170
The blackout during our face-off
against Cloud Live.

494
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,100
The high imitation goods scandal.

495
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,260
The deleted footage

496
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,480
and the leakage of Mr Five's design.

497
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,870
Did you do it with Ding Ding?

498
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,090
I didn't cause the power breakdown!

499
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,350
Not the high imitation goods as well!

500
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,650
I deleted the footage.

501
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,290
How can you do this?

502
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,720
How can you do all this?

503
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,770
Let go!

504
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,910
-Why?
-What are you doing?

505
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,500
I'm sorry, Mr Five.

506
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,570
I leaked your design.

507
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,790
I won't speak to you if
you're not crippled!

508
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,180
I was forced to do it!

509
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,630
I have my reasons!

510
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,110
What reasons do you have?

511
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,810
Hold this yourself!

512
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,020
Duan Ran.

513
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,340
Are you sure you have nothing else to say?

514
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:59,800
[Su Su: What's wrong, Mr Duan?
Why did you quit?]

515
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,710
[Xiao Wu: Yu Shi said you're fired.
Is it true?]

516
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,020
Duan Ran, help me check my phone.

517
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,730
Who is it?

518
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,400
Jia Yun.

519
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,440
[Yu Shi]

520
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
The news spread fast.

521
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,800
You know Ding Ding.

522
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,330
He'll let everyone know right away.

523
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,520
I trust Yu Shi the most.

524
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,830
I trusted him so much.

525
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,400
What did he give me now?

526
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,530
What answer did he give me?

527
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,690
I'm really left behind.

528
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,530
Don't be so depressed, Duan Ran.

529
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,080
It's better now that I'm swept
out of the company.

530
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,090
Ding Ding will not mistreat you all

531
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,880
after I leave.

532
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,390
What should I do?

533
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,730
Can you bear to leave me
alone in the company?

534
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,510
You'll be fine with what you have.

535
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,340
That's it.

536
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,120
Tell them when you're home.

537
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,820
Don't call me. I'm fine.

538
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,720
I know.

539
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,590
Duan Ran, it's time to eat!

540
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,100
We'll eat first.

541
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,780
He'll come when he's hungry.

542
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,870
Say, is Duan Ran not going to work

543
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,260
at Rui Live anymore?

544
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,690
Don't you always wish that

545
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,179
he won't work with Xi Xi?

546
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,310
What's wrong with you?

547
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,480
Why get worried?

548
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,330
He didn't push the guy down the stairs.

549
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,659
Why didn't he explain it to
Shen Jiang Tao?

550
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,389
He's stubborn.

551
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,130
Just like me in the past.

552
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,250
Morning!

553
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,260
Young man, are you sure you're not
going back to the company?

554
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,219
Why should I go now that I'm fired?

555
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,080
What is your plan

556
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,190
after leaving Rui?

557
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,880
I don't know, I didn't plan anything.

558
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,820
I woke up

559
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,830
naturally today.

560
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:15,900
It felt great.

561
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,250
It's been a while
since I slept that well.

562
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,050
I feel peaceful

563
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,360
and not troubled.

564
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,590
It's nice.

565
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,270
Really?

566
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,190
I

567
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,490
didn't manage Rui Live well.

568
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,860
It's my responsibility.

569
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,920
I'm problematic.

570
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,490
I always want to prove myself.

571
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,180
Then I got smacked hard by reality.

572
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,640
I'm really okay.

573
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,490
[Xi Xi, don't be nervous.]

574
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,660
[I'll tell you.]

575
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,240
[You're like the great heroine
in a martial arts film]

576
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,580
[who returned to the countryside]

577
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,560
[and came back to the martial world.]

578
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,960
[The one who walks with background music.]

579
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,660
That's it, you can do it if
you're that talkative.

580
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,990
Prepare for countdown.

581
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,630
[Five, four, three,]

582
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,370
[two, one.]

583
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,070
Hello, babies!

584
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,430
How do you do?

585
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,090
It's been a long time.

586
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,670
Are you surprised to see me?

587
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,760
I'm the broadcaster who went into hiatus,

588
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,220
Qian Xiao Xi Xi.

589
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,260
Are you all surprised by my presence?

590
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,190
Hurry and give me your applause

591
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,590
and shout-outs to welcome my return!

592
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,150
Hurry and comment below!

593
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,820
Hurry and buy the clothes!

594
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,460
Today...

595
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,380
[Is she a new broadcaster?]

596
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,120
[Isn't that Qian Xiao Xi Xi?]

597
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,780
It's really as you said.

598
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,130
As the new wave rises, the old wave falls,

599
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,530
crashing on the beach.

600
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,420
[Babies, it's just for a while that I]

601
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,690
[didn't do any live stream.]

602
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,880
[You've forgotten me.]

603
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,250
[Reading your comments]

604
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,260
[made me a little sad.]

605
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,570
[But it's fine!]

606
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,160
[I'm a very sociable girl who likes]

607
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,510
[to become best friends with all of you.]

608
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,100
[Firstcomers to my live stream]

609
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,630
[can subscribe to me right now.]

610
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,760
[I like the western styling
of the dress.]

611
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,530
[Come to Xi Xi's live stream!]

612
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,460
[The price is worth it.]

613
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,480
[Don't you miss it for anything!]

614
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,550
This one colour dress

615
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,800
is Roro's spring and summer
collection in 2018.

616
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,180
[Today in my live stream,
this dress is worth for]

617
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,860
[two thirds of the actual price]

618
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,560
[for you to get it! Isn't it a good deal?]

619
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,190
I hope the statistics can be better later.

620
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,810
It's alright now.

621
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,830
There's a Four-Wheel Drive Tycoon

622
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,310
swiping plenty of orders.
It's not bad.

623
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,760
That's Mr Duan.

624
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,590
I'll tell you.

625
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,530
This is his Taobao account username.

626
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,990
Four-Wheel Drive Tycoon.

627
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,790
Why are you here?

628
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,710
I'm concerned about Director
Qian's statistics

629
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,670
and how she is coping.

630
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,020
That...

631
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,140
That Mr Ding gave her leftovers.

632
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,070
Stop being pretentious here.

633
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,090
Get out.

634
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,240
I just want to be concerned about her.

635
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,180
Are you leaving or not?

636
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,420
I'll leave! I'll leave!

637
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,690
I'll leave.

638
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,920
So disturbing!

639
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:58,940
Five, six, seven, eight.

640
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,590
Ms Ouyang?

641
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,390
Ms Ouyang!

642
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,980
Can we get some rest and continue later?

643
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,550
Sure! Get some rest.

644
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,040
Okay, let's take a break.

645
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,080
Here, place the sofa here.

646
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,410
Face it that way.

647
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,280
Place the drinks there for them.

648
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,460
Drink some water! Have some rest!

649
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,930
Ouyang.

650
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,970
I bought you a personal sofa just for you.

651
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,960
Is it nice?

652
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,120
Don't underestimate it,
it's comfortable.

653
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,050
I personally went to ZaoZuo for it.

654
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,760
Mr Ding bought it for my personal use?

655
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,160
The whole company is being thrifty now

656
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,220
and you wasted the company resources
by buying me a personal sofa?

657
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,990
Do you think it's appropriate?

658
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,050
How can this be a waste?

659
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,500
You're worth it.

660
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,440
Every day, I see you standing here

661
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,480
the whole day in your high heels.

662
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,190
It really breaks my heart.

663
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,990
Have some water and sit down.

664
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,640
I'm working.

665
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,420
-Try sitting down.
-Time's up.

666
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,590
Can you try it out?

667
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,090
Okay, I'll sit down.

668
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,110
Can I have a look?

669
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,200
One, two, three, four,

670
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,140
five, six.

671
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,250

673
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,710
Hurry and eat!

674
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,490
Let me get some rest.

675
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,550
I'm so tired!

676
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,610
Great! Hurry and replenish your energy.

677
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,690
Here.

678
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,900
Open it for me, I'm too lazy to do it.

679
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,410
Smells good.

-This chicken chop rice is...

681

Didn't Shen Ding Ding say

00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,120
we can't have takeout?

684
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,740
He'll deduct our salaries!

685
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,180
Why should I care? I'm quitting anyway.

686
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,640
Don't mind him, let's eat.

687
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,910
Why are you quitting?

688
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,610
Look.

Come here!

Girl, you're simply amazing.

I know, right?

696
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,760
Congratulations!

697
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,290
Honestly, I didn't think you'd make it
on the first try.

698
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,420
I thought you'd reapply.

699

You're so great!

I can finally fulfill my childhood dream.

702

I'm so happy for you.

703
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,040
But I can't bear to part with you.

704
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,770
I've approved your resignation.

705
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,130
When are you leaving?

706
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,820
I'm in no hurry.

707
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,250
I have one important thing to do.

708
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,030
To see Chen Lang?

709
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,030
I'll go to Cloud Live

710
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,280
and arrange with Chen Lang
an asylum for you people.

711
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,810
So that

712
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,330
if, and I mean if,

713
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,480
this company is no longer hospitable

714
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,970
and you guys want to start anew,

715
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,670
you'll have somewhere to go.

716

Touch wood! What do you mean "asylum?"

Rui is our precious little baby.

It won't be easy for him to chase us out.

719
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,490
Okay, just think of it as
a contingency plan.

720
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,260
You just want to see Chen Lang.

721

-Let's eat! Why are you so talkative?
-Alright.

722
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,670
You eat first.

723
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,920
I'm so hungry.

724
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,710
I can't get up!

725
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,400
Mr Wu.

726
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,780
You scared me!

727
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,600
Look at you.

728
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,020
You never text back,

729
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,780
you never call back.

730
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,900
Aren't you forcing me to visit you?

731
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,240
It's better to meet you in the flesh.

732
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,200
You're a rare visitor.

733
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,560
In a relationship, it's called

734
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,190
"giving your partner some space."

735
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,790
We can't be glued together
all the time, can we?

736
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,720
That's an interesting analogy, Mr Wu.

737
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,930
But in the Art of War,

738
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,020
it's called "watching the fire
across the shore."

739
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,640
At least I'm not attacking you
during the fire.

740
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,480
Mr Wu, I'm here with a proposal for you.

741
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,470
What's there to talk about?

742
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,420
When you survived the account suspension,
the broadcasters' resignation,

743
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,390
and the investor's withdrawal,

744
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,080
we were amazed.

745
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,910
For some reason, Mr Duan Sr

746
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,820
even tried to help you

747
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,870
and got dethroned in the process.
