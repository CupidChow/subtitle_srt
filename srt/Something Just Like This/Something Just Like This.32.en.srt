4
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,060
Yang Yang got his heart broken by you.

5
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,090
I do not blame him for relying on

6
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,380
his mother right now.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,030
Wait, this has nothing to do with me.

8
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,620
I've known Yang Yang a long time.

9
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,220
You're the first girl

10
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,000
he was ever attracted to.

11
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,830
Are you serious?

12
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,400
What do you think?

13
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,400
Well, I...

14
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,090
You know.

15
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,050
You've feelings for someone else, right?

16
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,670
I know.

17
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,720
Don't worry. I'll talk to
Jiang Zhe Yang personally.

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,729
There's no need.

19
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,670
Feelings cannot be forced.

20
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,740
All of us are entitled to our own choices.

21
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,870
He makes his own choices. It's normal.

22
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,920
Ouyang, did you know?

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,820
I admire this the most about you.

24
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,210
You know exactly what you want.

25
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,610
You're strong and decisive.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,900
It seems like nothing in this world

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,090
could ever hurt you.

28
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,390
Well, I'm quite flattered.

29
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,510
However, right now,

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,920
I want to be a princess.

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,200
I want to find true love.

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,930
It's so nice to be taken care of.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,590
What a coincidence.

34
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,540
That's what I desire
in a relationship too.

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,140
I'll get one of these
as a form of support.

36
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,400
Choose one more, Ouyang.

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,900
I'll find you something.

38
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,740
What about this? It suits you well.

39
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,140
I'll give you a discount.

40
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,630
It fits you.

41
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,040
I'm sure everyone is aware

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,079
that QE Group runs a retail business,

43
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,200
and at the same time,
the biggest shareholder of Rui.

44
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,880
Thus, we're in a complicated position.

45
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,340
We should keep

46
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,450
a more neutral stance.

47
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,530
Unexpectedly, the negotiation today

48
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,610
has made things difficult for me.

49
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,950
Since this is a negotiation,

50
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,370
we should all settle down
and come to an agreement.

51
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,590
Disregard any bias.

52
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,810
Express the difficulties you've faced

53
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,870
and we will come together

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,380
to form solutions.

55
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,660
It's alright to take time
to devise an agreement.

56
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,560
However, sudden attacks and coercion

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,760
are not allowed.

58
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,440
We need to obtain

59
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,260
a decision and a solution

60
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,670
benefiting all three parties.

62
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,050
We were competitors in the
market for over 30 years.

63
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,060
After today, I've come to realize how

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,820
scheming and conniving one can truly be.

65
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,780
Mr Song, what do you mean?

66
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,630
I'll tell you what I mean.

67
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,880
On the surface,
you're part of the Entity Alliance.

68
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,460
In actuality,

69
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,520
you only seek the interest
of Live Streaming Alliance.

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,980
You're colluding together
for personal interests.

71
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,630
You're sitting on the fence.

72
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,010
We're being cornered, but you
on the other hand,

73
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,310
you're safe either way.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,080
How clever.

75
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,230
I'm impressed.

76
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,000
Mr Song, let's discuss this civilly

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,450
without obstructing peace.

78
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,180
There's no way this would work.

79
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,480
Mr Song, you're the
chairman of Entity Alliance.

80
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,350
You must be present.

81
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,190
If you'd like to negotiate,

82
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,890
all stakeholders must withdraw.

83
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,940
Wait for the decision outside.

84
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,560
Mr Song, we would like to

85
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,220
continue our discussion.

86
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,490
There's nothing left to discuss.

Mr Duan, I've nothing but respect for you,

88
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,780

All right.

90
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,850
I'll step aside.

Mr Wu, watch your manners.

92
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,480
He's being polite enough.

93
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,150
It's obvious.

94
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,620
We established an alliance,

95
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,330
but he's defending the
Live Streaming Alliance.

96
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,159
He's being a servant to two masters.

Mr Song, since you put it this way,

98
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,180
I've a question for you.

99
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,290
What does it mean?

100
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,909
That means he's double-dealing.

101
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,190
Is it wrong to be fair?

102
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,590
You came to me but you
accuse me of being insincere.

103

Where's your sincerity? Show me.

Where is your sincerity?

105

Do not be rude to Mr Song.

108

Yes, I shouldn't speak
to Mr Song this way.

109

It is my fault.

Don't worry,

He's no longer in danger.

Under such circumstance,

he has to undergo angioplasty.

125

Due to his uncommon condition,

126
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,830
if the procedure is done at our hospital,

127
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,200
it poses a certain risk.

128

Thus, I would suggest to opt
for conservative management.

129
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,960
You should arrange to get the procedure

Beijing or Shanghai.

Do you two remember back then,

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,700
I sneaked out and

Yes, we do.

Mum divided the monthly allowances

into 30 parts before spending it.

to eat the following month.

149

Back then, a roujiamo cost RMB5.

150

The both of you were growing,
so your appetites were huge.

You ate double portions sometimes.

Mum was reluctant to spend the money.

153

I secretly took out
some of my allowance

You were out late.

170
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,240
You didn't even pick up calls

171
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,220
or reply texts. What's going on?

172
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,900
I'm re-enacting Home Temptation again.

173
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,690
Sister, give me a break.

174
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,460
I was at the hospital the entire night.

175
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,520
My phone ran out of battery
so I couldn't receive calls.

176
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,400
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

177
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,840
Not me, it's Uncle Duan.

178
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,680
He had a heart attack
during the negotiation.

179
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,990
I kept Aunt Zhou and Duan Ran company
at the hospital the entire time.

180
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,570
-Is he...
-He's alright.

181
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,920
The surgery was a success. He's fine now.

182
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
That's a relief.

183
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,010
Do you know about the negotiation?

184
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,250
Of course.

185
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,410
How long were you two
planning to keep this from me?

186
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,780
It wasn't my idea, it was Duan Ran's.

187
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,390
He insisted to keep it from you.

188
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,680
Why wouldn't he tell me?

189
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,780
Is it because he doesn't trust me?

190
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,460
He probably thinks I'm too short-sighted

191
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,320
and I'm not any help, right?

192
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,660
Not at all.

193
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,960
You're a smart girl.

194
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,680
You have many great ideas.

195
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,140
Of course you'd be a great help.

196
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,370
Do I really have great ideas?

197
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,880
Yes.

198
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,840
I didn't know.

199
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,330
For example, the last time you...

200
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,700
Qian Xi Xi.

201
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,680
You're tricking me into complimenting you.

202
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,890
Come on, hurry up and compliment me.

203
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,360
I had a long night. Come on, enlighten me.

204
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,130
All right. That one time

205
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,810
the company was facing a crisis,

206
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,770
you suddenly had the idea of
Factory Rejects Denim Special.

207
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,750
The tables literally turned.

208
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,090
It was such a great idea, don't you agree?

209
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,090
Do I pay you to do this?

210
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,500
Did I pay you to be my supporter,
Zhang Jia Yun?

211
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,210
Hurry up and pay me.

212
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,430
Here you go.

213
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,480
I'm sure it's going to cost a lot.

214
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,080
On a serious note,

215
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,070
we couldn't achieve an agreement

216
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,390
with the Apparel Alliance.

217
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,030
Thus, I would like to imitate what you did

218
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,740
and encourage Mr Five to broadcast again.

219
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,490
What do you think?

220
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,350
-Is that what you want?
-Yes.

221
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,920
How are you going to do that?

222
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,330
Check this out.

223
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,250
She sent me some samples today.

224
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,140
Let me have a look.

225
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,560
The outfit Mr Five has on right now

226
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,720
is a niche product.

227
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,080
It will not appeal to the majority,

228
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,640
but her fans will love it

229
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,620
because it's her own style.

230
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,300
You complimented me,

231
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,060
but your head is filled with great ideas.

232
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,680
Well, this wasn't

233
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,800
exactly my idea.

234
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,550
Guess who suggested it to me?

235
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,430
Who did?

236
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,750
Chen Lang.

237
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,240
There's no way he'd be so nice.

238
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,180
Today, Duan Ran told me that

239
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,480
he chickened out from the negotiation.

240
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,470
He probably doesn't want to get on
the bad side of Entity Alliance.

241
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,740
Forget it.

242
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,860
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

243
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,750
Boss.

244
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,390
RMB32 per metre or we will not buy it.

245
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,590
I'm not selling it for less than RMB35.

246
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,260
I'm Mr Five.

247
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,200
Mr Five, the vendor of the
night market at Cat Street?

248
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,840
I'd sell it to you at RMB32.

249
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,820
Thank you, sir.

250
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,650
Bring me the best cotton fabric
in your store.

251
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,910
Everything is here.

252
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,370
Did you exceed the budget?

253
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,630
We're talking about a deal of 1000 units.

254
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,040
It seems like you're uninterested.

255
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,830
I'm sorry, what?

256
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,160
Of course not. We saved a lot too.

257
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,150
Since we're producing sweaters,

258
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,090
we need cotton.

259
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,720
But we have less cotton material
that the last time.

260
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,430
First, we bought the raw materials.

261
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,550
Then, we told every store owner

262
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,040
that we'd like 1000 units of denim fabric.

263
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,020
Jia Yun, is this a

264
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,830
trick of yours?

265
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,110
She's setting a trap.

266
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,690
The denim textiles you asked for

267
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,580
are all ready.

268
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,940
We will head to the market today.

269
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,660
-Guess what happened?
-Come on in.

270
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,760
Sure, let's go.

271
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,250
You're here.

272
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,370
The denim material you asked for,

273
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,640
I ordered them from Shenzhen.

274
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,790
Come and check it out at our store.

275
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,670
Ma'am,

276
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,020
did you order denim too?

277
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,540
Did you order them too?

278
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,100
Everyone would welcome you then.

279
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Exactly.

280
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,470
The lady and I clicked very well.

281
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,920
Can I sell it to you?

282
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,190
Don't listen to him.

283
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,790
The entire market knows

284
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,920
my goods are the best.

285
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,930
You can't do this.

286
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,750
Good job, Jia Yun.

287
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,650
You're very shrewd.

288
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,780
[Ouyang, we scheduled an appointment with]

289
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,620
[Dr Xu, the one you recommended.]

290
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,080
[I'm going to Beijing
with my dad tomorrow.]

291
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,150
-A cup of latte.
-Sure.

292
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,110
A cup of latte.

293
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,800
Don't mention it.

294
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,690
I'm glad everything is settled.

295
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,020
I hope the surgery goes well.

296
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,590
Let me know if you need help.

297
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,530
Hello, who's speaking?

298
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,140
Jiang Zhe Yang isn't on scene?

299
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,030
Can you...

300
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,100
I'll send you a number later.

301
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,590
Give them a call.

302
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,110
I'll send you a phone number.

303
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,210
You should reach out to them.

304
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,740
There's no point asking me.

305
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,280
Miss, what's going on?

306
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,600
Miss, what's wrong?

307
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,080
Are you alright?

308
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,940
My stomach aches.

309
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,210
Mei Xuan.

310
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,400
-Why are you here?
-It's me.

311
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,890
I injured my hand during the shoot.

312
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,350
I sprained it. It's minor.

313
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,840
Wait, the filming crew called me just now.

314
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,690
They were all looking for you.

315
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,670
What happened? Where's Meng Meng
and your mum?

316
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,800
Why are you alone?

317
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,030
I didn't tell them.

318
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,160
I came alone.

319
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,020
You're so irresponsible.

320
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,400
Are you suffering from
gastric pains again?

321
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,440
Ouyang Mei Xuan.

322
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,250
You cannot delay this any longer.

323
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,569
You need to undergo
gastroscopy immediately.

324
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,640
If you did not have breakfast,
we will schedule it in the afternoon.

325
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,170
Are you opting for the painless one?

326
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,230
Sure.

327
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,970
You need a signature for the procedure.

328
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,290
I'll sign it.

329
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,530
I'm right here.

330
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,900
No, you need to return to the set.

331
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,870
It's fine.

332
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,520
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

333
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,150
I didn't expect

334
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,890
your dad to be in such great shape.

335
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,420
He has so much to talk about.

336
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,330
Yes, have a seat.

337
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
Are you tired?

338
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,440
I'm relieved now.

339
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,730
I've to go to Beijing for his operation.

340
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,180
My mum will not be able to
handle everything alone.

341
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,980
Aunt Zhou is too independent.

342
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,470
She doesn't want to affect my job.

343
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,400
I should go instead.

344
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,550
What? I'll go.

345
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,710
No, I mean,

346
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,540
you head to Beijing with
Uncle Duan and Aunt Zhou.

347
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,240
I'll go to the negotiation.

348
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,160
No.

349
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,090
Do you think I'm not capable?

350
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,740
It's not that.

351
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,750
It's not appropriate
for you to handle this.

352
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,630
No.

353
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,680
You think you can handle it,

354
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,740
but I can't.

355
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,530
Xi Xi.

356
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,660
I don't want you to bear
the stress and strain.

357
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,570
Listen to me.
I'll handle it after I return.

358
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,030
Duan Ran, are you Sun Wu Kong?

359
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,290
Can you clone yourself?

360
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,540
You've too much on your plate.
You can't handle it alone.

361
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,920
When you get back, you'd be overloaded.

362
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,860
You are aware of how much
I need to do.

363
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,860
So don't add more pressure, alright?

364
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,050
That's not what I mean.

365
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,510
I just want to figure this out with you.

366
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,200
Honestly, I've no confidence

367
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,530
in handling the negotiation.

368
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,710
However, I want to give it a shot.

369
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,220
I can't stand by and watch

370
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,820
the situation worsen.

371
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,380
Are you planning to return as Rui's CEO?

372
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,980
That's great news.

373
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,620
After I settle everything,

374
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,300
clear this mess,

375
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,560
and pave the way,

376
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,860
you should return with pride as the CEO.

377
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,710
No, I don't want that.

378
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,470
I don't want this at all.

379
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,300
Duan Ran, I'm able.

380
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,420
I don't need you

381
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,770
to arrange or provide everything for me.

382
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,840
I just want to go on your
stead as the representative

383
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,870
and resolve this dispute.

384
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,440
I'm doing it for Zhang Jia Yun,
for Uncle Duan, for Rui

385
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,470
and most importantly, for you.

386
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,020
Xi Xi.

387
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,880
It's not as simple as you imagine.

388
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,570
The people are not easy to deal with.

389
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,830
You're like a little sheep.

390
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,450
I can't leave you in the wolves' den.

391
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,210
Listen to me. Don't go.

392
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,920
You don't trust me.

393
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,580
Xi Xi.

394
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,870
Xi Xi.

395
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,020
Duan Ran.

396
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,270
I don't care what you say.

397
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,590
I might be a sheep to you,

398
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,300
but they have a temper too.

399
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,020
Let's just do this.

400
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,170
It's decided then.

401
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,010
I'll help you while
you're away at Beijing.

402
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,610
-No.
-Why would you disagree?

403
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,210
I'm very clear with my stand.

404
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,410
I just want to help
you and Uncle Duan out.

405
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,830
-Why can't you accept that?
-What about you?

406
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,370
-No.
-You were left alone all these while.

407
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,370
No, it was an accident.

408
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,110
Would you like anything else?

409
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,820
Is uncle alright?

410
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,800
His condition is stable now.

411
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,130
All that is left is his surgery
in Beijing.

412
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,750
I need to thank you for that.

413
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,580
Don't mention it.

414
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,900
You wanted to treat me to a meal.

415
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,260
You should pay for this.

416
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,330
Sure, it's a small matter.

417
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,300
Why are you guys at the hospital?

418
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,920
Yang Yang injured his hand.

419
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,620
This is minor.

420
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,790
Your gastric perforation
is a serious matter.

421
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,600
I told her to take care of her stomach.

422
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,060
She wouldn't listen to me.

423
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,200
Gastric perforation?

424
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,670
You need to take care of your stomach.

425
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,910
It can't be cured in a few days.

426
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,200
You need to watch out before it recurs.

427
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,690
Doctors

428
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,490
always exaggerate.

429
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,840
Well, I'm on prescription now.

430
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,060
The gastroscopy is done. I'm fine now.

431
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,750
You should hurry up and eat.

432
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,510
You need to return to the set after this.

433
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,960
They must be anxious.

434
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,720
Okay.

435
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,560
You should eat more.

436
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,420
After working for a period of time,

437
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,440
I realized health is everything.

438
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,130
You're right.

439
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,830
Are you going to the set with him?

440
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,880
Sister Ouyang and I

441
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,580
terminated our contract.

442
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,170
What?

443
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,460
Yes, it's a long story.

444
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,730
It was my problem.

445
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,120
Let's put this aside. Hurry up and eat.

446
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,100
Let's eat.

447
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,300
I need some congee. I'm starving.

448
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,360
Since your job has been so taxing,

449
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,560
you should take this time off.

450
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,860
Don't you think so?

451
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,950
What do you plan to do?

452
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,210
You're right. I'll take it easy.

453
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,870
The last two years was hectic.

454
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,920
I'll give myself a break.

455
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,550
Yes.

456
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,950
You should eat.

457
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,520
Look at you.

458
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,500
Why didn't you tell me
you injured your hand?

459
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,040
You didn't tell me about the
contract termination too.

460
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,090
Explain that.

461
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,040
Am I still a friend to you?

462
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,950
You rarely call me these days.

463
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,980
I've been busy with work.

464
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,220
After our conversation at the music store,

465
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,780
I gave it some thought.

466
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,330
I don't know how to

467
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,500
treat you normally as a friend.

468
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,300
If you're not friends,

469
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,790
what else would you be?

470
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,130
Brothers.

471
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,280
What's the difference?

472
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,310
Brothers, close friends,

473
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,970
good friends, they are all the same.

474
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,560
That's our relationship.

475
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,760
What happened was,

476
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,350
Jiang Zhe Yang released
a new album that day.

477
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,840
He wanted to show it to me.

478
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,280
What was so important

479
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,910
that you'd ignore all my calls?

480
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,380
You knew I was in a bad mood.

481
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,080
Is that a reason to ignore phone calls?

482
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,090
Duan Ran.

483
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,810
This congee is pretty good.

484
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,470
I would like a refill, please.

485
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,090
Thanks.

486
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,060
Their congee is pretty good.

487
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,390
Do you not trust me?

488
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,140
Of course not.

489
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,460
What's with the attitude?

490
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,780
What do you mean? I'm just asking.

491
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,240
Stop being unreasonable.

492
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,940
Stop accusing me of being unreasonable.

493
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,910
I'm sorry.

494
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,800
Yang Yang has to return to the shoot.

495
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,610
-We're leaving.
-Yes.

496
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,190
Please excuse us. Enjoy.

497
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,200
Bye, Xi Xi.

498
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,400
I'm discussing an issue with you.

499
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,050
I'm being reasonable.

500
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,600
This is exactly what I was talking about.

501
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,940
Why didn't you pick up my calls
when you were out with him?

502
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,960
Give me a reason.

503
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,380
You just don't trust me.

504
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,200
You don't trust me no matter what I do.

505
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,560
This is similar

506
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,900
to my request to represent
you at the negotiation.

507
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,030
No matter what I say,

508
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,490
you'd think I'm not capable.

509
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,630
I can't do it right.

510
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,920
It's the same thing. You don't trust me.

511
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,870
They are different things.

512
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,870
They are fundamentally different.

513
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,420
Please be reasonable then.

514
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,320
That's what I'm doing right now.

515
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,520
You went out late at night

516
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,340
without picking up your phone.

517
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,650
I found out about this today.

518
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,130
How can I trust you?

519
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,330
Give me a reason for me to trust you.

520
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,550
Say something.

521
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,660
You've nothing to say.

522
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,130
That's the problem.

523
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,320
Wow, you made yourself at home.

524
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,480
Yes, that's what I'd like.

525
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,780
I passed the application to you.

526
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,440
It's awaiting your approval.

527
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,790
What's the matter, Mr Chen?

528
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,150
Well,

529
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,220
I'm here to drop you a visit.

530
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,390
We can no longer promote branded clothes.

531
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,280
We've nothing much to do anyway.

532
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,210
Xi Xi told me about the negotiation.

533
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,390
It isn't going well.

534
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,060
The conditions they offered

535
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,300
are unsatisfactory.

536
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,100
You should speak up then.

537
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,970
Duan Ran went to Beijing
for his dad's surgery.

538
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,160
If you do not participate,

539
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Live Stream Alliance would
lose its representative.

540
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,780
Honestly speaking,

541
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,500
I'm not concerned about Singles' Day.

542
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,140
I've my own resources even
without cooperating with them.

543
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,340
I'm not worried about the live streams.

544
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,370
On the contrary,

545
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,480
I participated

546
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,520
partially for the negotiation,

547
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,320
but mostly, for Rui.

548
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,660
To be frank, I'm doing it for you.

549
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,940
You're smart and intelligent.

550
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,280
You're beautiful too.

551
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,990
You're more impressive now.

552
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,830
You're good in everything you do.

553
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,030
You can pretty much do everything.

554
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,790
However,

555
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,150
you're still young.

556
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,050
Things aren't that simple.

557
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,020
In my opinion,
you should hurry and join Cloud Live.

558
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,100
We will achieve greatness together.

559
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,070
Anything else, Mr Chen?

560
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,330
If you're not leaving, I am.

561
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,650
If you act like this,

562
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,930
I'll cooperate with Apparel Alliance.

563
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,990
Go ahead.

564
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,060
You're hopeless.

565
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,760
How's it going?

566
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,020
Why do you look so upset?

567
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,560
No, I'm fine.

568
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,730
Did you argue with Xi Xi again?

569
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,260
There's no one else to argue with.

570
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,410
Why did you guys argue?

571
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,810
Xi Xi found out I'm going to Beijing.

572
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,310
She wants to handle
the negotiation for me.

573
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,180
I can't let her do that.

574
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,000
You're still doubting her abilities.

575
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,330
Xi Xi left Rui.

576
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,750
She's unwilling to return as the CEO

577
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,930
mainly because of you.

578
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,510
Stop blaming everything on Duan Ran.

579
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,460
All right?

580
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,150
Xi Xi is a little girl.

581
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,930
It's not easy being the CEO.

582
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,450
As for this,

583
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,140
I'll have to disagree.

584
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,900
Fine.

585
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,080
I'll leave you two. I don't care.

586
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,720
Dad.

587
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,430
The negotiation is an important matter.

588
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,980
Are you going to send Xi Xi?

589
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,360
Ran Ran, from certain perspectives,

590
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,600
I think Xi Xi is better than you are.

591
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,760
Xi Xi is more persistent and determined.

592
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,840
At the same time, I believe

593
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,980
you two youngsters

594
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,260
are more motivated
and driven when together.

595
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,300
Your minds are better than ours.

596
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,490
On issues like these,

597
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,810
people of your age

598
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,760
are more flexible and adaptable.

599
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,620
Honestly, I couldn't be bothered
with Entity Alliance.

600
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,820
I agreed with Song to join the negotiation

601
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,090
solely because of you and Xi Xi.

602
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,170
Sadly, my body is failing.

603
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,960
This happened all of a sudden.

604
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,460
Dad, about that,

605
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,880
it's not that I do not
trust her abilities,

606
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,700
it's mainly because she's a girl.

607
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,640
I don't want her to be

608
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,930
bullied and oppressed at the negotiation.

609
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,180
My heart aches.

610
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,820
Son.

611
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,560
There's a folder in the drawers.
Take it out.

612
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,790
[Portfolio]

613
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,560
Is this it?

614
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,810
What is this?

615
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,600
It contains two documents.

616
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,360
One is for you.

617
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,660
The other is for Xi Xi.

618
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,820
Open this up together.

619
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,110
After that, you'd understand what I mean.

620
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,750
All right.

621
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,590
Chen Lang.

622
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,870
What did you find out?

623
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,390
Nothing much.

624
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,420
Jia Yun is a tough nut to crack.

625
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,260
Are we signing the contract then?

626
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,820
I'm not sure yet.

627
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,980
You missed it again.

628
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,650
Forget about the contract then.

629
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,490
Are you insulting my aim?

630
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,070
It's not that.

631
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,270
We're not in a rush.

632
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,660
We've the goods.

633
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,280
There's no need to worry.

634
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,480
Let's see how it goes.

635
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,890
Your judgment never misses.

636
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,790
However, I think

637
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,190
it's better to sign the contract soon.

638
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,410
If we do,

639
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,310
the Apparel Alliance will
increase our benefits.

640
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,410
I don't know why I'm hesitating.

641
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,100
I feel like I'm sailing without direction.

642
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,890
It doesn't feel right
no matter where I go.

643
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,810
Are you concerned about
betraying Duan Ran?

644
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,150
You're supposed to be rivals.

645
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,670
You're only working with him

646
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,390
due to the circumstances.

647
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,510
It's something Jia Yun said.

648
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,490
It confused me.

649
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,290
When we are used to focusing
on advantages and disadvantages,

650
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,050
we forget our primary goal.

651
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,480
In business, we only look at advantages.

652
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,380
Even if you sign the contract

653
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,730
and withdraw from Live Stream Alliance,

654
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,440
it's for the sake of the company.

655
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,040
It isn't wrong.

656
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,040
You should leave me. I need to think.

657
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,280
This colour isn't formal enough.

658
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,139
What do you want?

659
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,770
I'm sent by Mr Duan

660
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,739
to bring you a gift

661
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,469
and an apology to your doorstep.

662
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,130
What did Uncle Duan get me?

663
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,750
My dad exerted himself

664
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,560
to pave the way for us.

665
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,100
What else do you want from him?

666
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,220
Yes, Uncle Duan dotes on me.

667
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,940
During a critical moment like this,

668
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,790
I should step up.

669
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,760
You're right.

670
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,340

I don't know.

Is this from Uncle Duan?

A document?

Does that mean Uncle Duan

683
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,020
wants to transfer his equity to us?

684
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,210
Is that his intention?

685
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,760
Yes, we're getting the same amount. Look.

686
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,110
Like I said, my dad

687
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,860
should have given this to us sooner.

How can you say that?

What did I say?

692
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,250
You're badmouthing him.

-I want to punch him.

-Pull it out.
-I don't have a needle.

774
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,730
You need to fold it this way.

775

It went in just now.

If you didn't remind me,

Besides, about this,

811
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,110
honestly, it's not because
I don't want you to do it.
