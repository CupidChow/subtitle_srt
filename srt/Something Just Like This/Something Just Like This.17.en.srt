00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,360
this place is simply uninhabitable.

6
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,860

Uncle Qian just feels

that he owed you too much
when he was young.

26

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,210
when I was a kid, on every birthday,

37
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,970
I'd wish for him to come home

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,760
to keep me and Mum company.

39
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
I was always wondering

40
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,910
why Dad couldn't

41
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,710
pick me up from school?

42
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,330
Why couldn't I

43

Will he miss me?

48
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,750
I'll wonder if it was
because I wasn't good enough

49

alone. I'll handle it.

Why on earth are you
installing the wallpaper?

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,980
I had a broken leg.

344
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,300
There's a metal rod inside it.

345
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,960
I couldn't walk fast since then.

346
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,480
Wait for me.

347
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,140
Can't you stop giving me trouble?

348
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,860
You always do things as you please.

349
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,310
No matter when,

350
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,450
no matter where,

351
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,270
you have to do something shocking.

352
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,230
Just to prove that you're special.

353
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,800
I wanted to give you a surprise.

354
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,930
Didn't I damage the drawing

355
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,540
that your mum made for you?

356
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,880
I just wanted to hang some pictures
of you and your mum on the wall.

357
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,400
I wanted to make it up to you.

358
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,110
I know you hate me.

359
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,930
Since the day I came back,

360
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,250
you haven't called me "Dad" once.

361
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,300
If you want me to call you "Dad",

362
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,830
then let me ask you.

363
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,960
In all these years,

364
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,990
how many times have we met?

365
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,030
When Mum was sick

366
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,630
and she needed you the most,

367
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,050
where were you?

368
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,630
You suddenly appeared out of nowhere

369
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,080
and broke into my life.

370
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And now you want me to call you "Dad"?

371
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,530
How dare you?

372
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,360
When you were a kid,

373
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,050
I was never there for you.

374
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,100
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,060
You should hate me.

376
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,110
So long as you're happy,

377
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,930
I will do anything.

378
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,850
You can hit me,

379
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,800
slap me,

380
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,260
anything you want

381
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,030
to vent your anger.

382
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,200
Hitting you wouldn't help.

383
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,600
Can you stop it?

384
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,060
Can't you have more sense?

385
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,660
What can you do besides fighting?

386
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,800
I've wronged your mum.

387
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,540
-It's my fault.
-Stop it.

388
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,550
It's my fault.

389
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,140
-I've wronged both of you.
-Stop it.

390
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,280
I've wronged your mum.

391
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,090
-Stop it.
-I've wronged her.

392
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,290
-Stop it.
-I've wronged you.

393
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,770
I've wronged both of you.

394
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,540
I've wronged you.

395
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,810
I've wronged you.

396
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,930
I've wronged both of you.

397
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,600
Stop it, Dad.

398
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,130
Can't you just stop it?

399
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:55,950
What's up?

400
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,940
[How's the situation?]

401
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,450
It's all over.

402
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,820
What about the police?

403
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,130
[I've been warned.]

404
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,940
If you ask me,

405
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,310
it may be better to put him up at a hotel.

406
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,850
Less trouble, right?

407
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,460
It's alright. We should
let him save some money, too.

408
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,230
Yes.

409
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,380
Mum

410
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,090
has been worrying about you.

411
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,250
You should go home early

412
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,010
and keep her company.

413
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,480
Sure. I'll have a word with Yu Shi.

414
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,170
before I head home.
You head home too, okay?

415
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,310
See you.

416
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,680
Take a bite.

417
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,010
No, I'm on a diet.

418
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,210
Get some sleep.

419
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,800
Xi Xi.

420
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,160
I'm extremely happy today.

421
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,030
Just be happy.

422
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,700
The past couple of days
was certainly eventful.

423
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,790
Go to bed.

424
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,070
I'm leaving.

425
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,060
Take care.

426
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,890
Xiao Xiao is the head broadcaster

427
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,150
over at Chen Lang's company?

428
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,490
Is she really good?

429
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,640
She bought her position.

430
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,330
However,

431
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,570
even if it's bought,

432
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,240
the money was well spent.

433
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,440
She's now at the top, after all.

434
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,470
One day his company
may decide to get listed.

435
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,270
Then they can brag however they like

436
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,030
and boast about how great they are.

437
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,200
But we're not doing as well as them.

438
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,300
Don't worry.

439
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,940
People don't care about quality anymore.

440
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,800
They only care about the Talent Chart.

441
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,280
You're right.

442
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,640
I heard Chen Lang

443
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,260
is making a persistent effort

444
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,630
and actively stocking up

445
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,870
in anticipation of Xiao Xiao
topping the Talent Chart.

446
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,940
If she can make the top 30,

447
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,860
then she'd become a bona fide
queen of broadcasters.

448
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,060
Chen Lang sure is ambitious.

449
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,400
It depends on who his opponent is.

450
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,930
Compared to you,

451
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,090
no matter how great his ambition is,

452
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,890
he's still inferior to you.

453
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,800
Stop bragging.

454
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,310
Sorry, I'm late.

455
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,040
There was a traffic jam.

456
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,620
You asked me out.

457
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,440
I should have arrived earlier.

458
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,140
Have you ordered?

459
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,150
Not yet.

460
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,500
Let's look at the menu.

461
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,460
Mr Chen, I've invited you to this dinner

462
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,090
to ask you a question.

463
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,210
Ask away.

464
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,180
Do you think you're a despicable person?

465
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,930
Are all young people nowadays

466
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,260
as direct as you?

467
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,280
You're using me to disrupt
Yuan Yuan's career

468
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,090
by sending me incriminating leaks
about her.

469
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,370
Or should I say,

470
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,360
you want to prevent Rui from
having an excellent streamer

471
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,890
who can compete with Cloud,
isn't that right?

472
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,680
Looks like I'm despicable indeed.

473
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,970
When you sent me the leaks,

474
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,990
I forwarded it to Ms Ouyang
without a second thought.

475
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,580
I was just jealous of Yuan Yuan

476
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,180
for always being better than me.

477
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,050
Well, in that case,

478
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,210
we're not that different.

479
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,640
Since there are so many
broadcasters in Rui,

480
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,240
it's impossible for you
to send it to everyone.

481
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,320
That's right, I sent it to you alone.

482
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,220
Why?

483
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,670
Cola, as far as I know,
when you first joined Rui,

484
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,790
you were using a public
persona similar to Yuan Yuan's.

485
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:06,400
Because you had the same look
as Yuan Yuan, isn't that right?

486
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,700
And you also relied on
the name "Little Yuan Yuan"

487
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,850
to build up your fan base, didn't you?

488
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,470
But you didn't seem to like that name.

489
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,150
You preferred to be called "Cola".

490
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,190
I noticed something.

491
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,870
In your live streams,

492
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,710
whenever a fan types the name "Little
Yuan Yuan" on public chat,

493
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,510
you would look displeased.

494
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,050
Is that so?

495
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,640
I'm very sensitive.

496
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,800
When you're free,

497
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,970
you can get the video from Su Su.

498
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,590
That won't be necessary.

499
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,720
Mr Chen, I heard you're shrewd
like a devil. Seems like it's true.

500
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,450
Shrewd like a devil?

501
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,440
I take it as a compliment.

502
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,340
Cola, actually in a sense,

503
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,320
I admire your talent.

504
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,739
And I understand

505
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,530
how hard it must be

506
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,230
for you to bear the name
of "Little Yuan Yuan".

507
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,090
You listened to me, praised me

508
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,210
and even grasped
my deepest insecurities

509
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,580
so you could use me to your advantage?

510
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,739
I have no such intention.

511
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:39,100
It's true that I sent you the leaks.

512
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,920
But I wasn't sure

513
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,989
who you would send it to.

514
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,710
Cola.

515
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,330
We're so similar.

516
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:57,060
We crave for success.

517
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,080
We can

518
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,020
work so well together.

519
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,060
Mr Chen.

520
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,020
I don't want to become someone I despise.

521
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,560
Cola.

522
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,930
You have my number.

523
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,180
Just call me anytime.

524
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,110
Let me tell you.

525
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,140
At the beginning of this video,

526
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,250
there's only one man playing the piano.

527
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,190
Yuan Yuan and Jiang Zhe Yang joined in

528
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,550
and formed a piano trio.

529
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,980
It's said that this video
was on Weibo yesterday.

530
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,790
Many influencers forwarded it.

531
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,000
And the number of views
has exceeded 10 million.

532
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:07,410
Ke Ke, don't you think
Lady Luck is smiling on Yuan Yuan?

533
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,870
She was supposed to replace Jia Yun.

534
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,820
Then her fame skyrocketed
thanks to this video.

535
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,150
She was just lucky.

536
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,780
I didn't realise

537
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,850
Yuan Yuan had a hidden talent.

538
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,610
Nowadays,

539
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,510
a streamer can't hack it

540
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,890
without some kind of special talent.

541
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,950
What's so special about playing the piano?

542
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,600
As streamers,

543
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,610
we should concentrate
on our live streaming skills.

544
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,760
Jia Yun.

545
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,500
How have you been?

546
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,680
Jia Yun.

547
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,020
What are you up to?

548
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,640
I wonder if I should tell my boss

549
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,950
that it's cruel to disturb an
employee during lunch break.

550
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,510
Why are you so blatant?

551
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,040
Alright. I'm fine, actually.

552
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,530
Thanks for asking, boss.

553
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,860
What are you watching?

554
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,500
A Japanese drama.

555
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,410
It's called
"I Want to Get Off Work On Time".

556
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,950
It's about a girl

557
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,370
who wants to get off
work on time every day.

558
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,430
And she's against working overtime.

559
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,800
Is that so?

560
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,270
You're now in the office,

561
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,400
lying here with a drink
and watching Japanese dramas,

562
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,330
and you want to get off work
on time?

563
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,750
Come on, Mr Duan.

564
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,950
It's lunch time now,
yet you expect me to work.

565
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,100
Can't you just give me a break?

566
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,530
That's not what I meant.

567
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,160
If you want to watch a show,

568
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,980
there's nothing wrong with it.

569
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,990
Fine, Mr Duan.

570
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,330
I just hate it when my boss takes
an interest in me.

571
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,330
Tell me, are you here for something?

572
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,440
Yes.

573
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,720
Well, Jia Yun,

574
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,580
look at our company

575
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,310
and how big it's grown.

576
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,700
What is it still missing?

577
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,030
If I'm not mistaken,

578
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,050
you're talking about

579
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,600
the position of head broadcaster.

580
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,740
I like smart people like you.

581
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,420
Now our company

582
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,140
needs a head broadcaster.

583
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,520
We have several candidates.

584
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,700
Yuan Yuan

585
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,780
just came back to us, right?

586
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,540
Xi Xi

587
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,820
is busy mending a
relationship with her father.

588
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,660
The rest of them

589
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,900
such as Yuan Bao and Little Duckling

590
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,320
are not up to mark yet.

591
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,840
I stay up every night, thinking,

592
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,140
"Who should be our head broadcaster?"

593
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,690
Who?

594
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,690
Then it hit me. Jia Yun.

595
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,500
You're the girl, Jia Yun.

596
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,660
You're merely choosing the
best of a bad bunch, Mr Duan.

597
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,950
Not at all.

598
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,580
That's not what I meant.

599
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,090
Sure, I'm not among the bad bunch.

600
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,950
But you know me well.

601
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,670
I'm used to a more relaxed pace.

602
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,020
When it comes to competitions and whatnot,

603
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,840
I have absolutely no interest.

604
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,950
I know you well.

605
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,570
We have grown considerably,

606
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,020
haven't we?

607
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,910
Now the company needs you.

608
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,290
It's time you step up.

609
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,810
Otherwise, look around you.

610
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,580
There's nobody else, right?

611
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,610
So you haven't heard.

612
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,510
This morning, a miracle happened

613
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,400
to one of our employees.

614
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,390
Who's that?

615
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,600
Take a look at this.

616
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,790
What's Yuan Yuan doing?

617
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,530
What's this?

618
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,860
[Cat on the Roof]

619
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,280
A piano trio?

620
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,360
Hello, Uncle Qian.

621
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,240
You look busy.

622
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,920
I've been waiting for you.

623
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,270
Lunch for Xi Xi.

624
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,030
I got the address from your dad.

625
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,350
I know. My dad asked me

626
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,540
to wait for you here.

627
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,600
What are you watching?

628
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,050
It's a piano video.

629
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,860
Isn't that me?

630
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,740
No wonder that person looks like you.

631
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,800
It really is you.

632
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,280
I was passing by that day.

633
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,240
I heard you used to be a pianist.

634
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,620
It's all in the past.

635
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,690
I need to give this to Xi Xi.

636
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,750
She's inside. Come with me.

637
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,640
Xi Xi.

638
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,240
Not only have I slept in a container,

639
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,430
worked in a factory,

640
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,430
I have also worked in many kitchens.

641
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,710
So I made some dishes for you.

642
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,730
You're really talented, Uncle Qian.

643
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,840
Let's eat together.

644
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,940
Dig in, guys.

645
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,570
-Thanks, Uncle Qian.
-Jia Yun, Duan Ran.

646
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,300
Everyone is welcome to join us.

647
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,230
This is the benefit of
having him as a father.

648
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,770
Give me a break.

649
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,330
-Isn't it overcooked?
-No.

650
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,020
Are these buns?

651
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,230
They're shumai.

652
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,810
-Try it.
-Look, wotou.

653
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,050
Let's try the dim sum.

654
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,450
Let me help you.

655
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,420
I just want to say...

656
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,330
Uncle Qian.

657
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,400
It's so delicious.

658
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,730
You ate a lot.

659
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,140
It's really good.

660
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,570
There are still plenty more.

661
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,200
Mr Duan.

662
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,460
The broadcasters
are waiting for you.

663
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,270
-The workforce mobilisation meeting.
-Okay.

664
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,330
Just a moment.

665
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,700
What meeting is that?

666
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,890
Mobilise what?

667
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,370
Don't you know?

668
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,410
Mr Duan wants our broadcasters
to vie for the Talent Chart.

669
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,470
We're having a meeting to discuss it.

670
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,600
Duan Ran.

671
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,450
Are you kidding me?

672
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,810
The Talent Chart?

673
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,570
Only head broadcasters stand a chance.

674
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,570
We don't have one.

675
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,500
We'll discuss it in the meeting.

676
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,670
Can't you wait?

677
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,880
We'll be there in a moment.

678
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,660
