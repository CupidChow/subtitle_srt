Don't make her feel so inferior.

104

Anyway,

105
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,550
it's my fault.

106
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,930
I didn't give her a sense of security.

107
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,180
But I'm confident

108
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,880
I can win her back.

109
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,750
Having confidence is not enough.

110
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,940
You have to act.

111

And take action.

112

00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,710
and build an ice-skating rink

344
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,100
and a KTV.

345
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,660
Also a cinema

346
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,340
and a childcare centre.

347
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,940
Well,

348
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,980
times have changed.

349
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,780
Everything we need can be found online.

350
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,380
Why do we need physical stores?

351
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,460
Right?

352
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,740
Social activities, parenting,
family fun and education.

353
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,350
These are great business opportunities.

354
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,420
Anyway, QE Night is very important.

355
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,690
You must prove that

356
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,260
customers don't shop
at physical stores now.

357
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,980
Then my proposal

358
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,260
will have a good chance
of getting approved.

359
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,350
I'll definitely prove it to them.

360
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,150
We must make sure that nothing goes wrong.

361
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,270
When you go back,

362
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,470
check the programme rundown again.

363
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,040
The news says a typhoon is coming.

364
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,240
Hello, friends.

365
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,730
I just got off the boat.

366
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,620
My boat is loaded with seafood now.

367
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,360
Before I went to the sea,
I've set up a crab trap.

368
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,610
Let's see if I've caught anything.

369
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,510
Here we go.

370
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,460
It's full.

371
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,600
I have a good eye for talent.

372
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,570
I knew he's the one we wanted
when I got to the fishing village.

373
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,690
What?

374
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,780
Duan Ran, say it again.
Who has a good eye?

375
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,720
I recommended him, okay?

376
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,040
Never mind.

377
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,690
I didn't treat it as work,

378
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,880
but rather a one-day-trip at the farm.

379
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,310
[Not 180.]

380
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,580
[Not 150.]

381
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,960
[66 and it'll be delivered to your home.]

382
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,530
I think the screen looks very blurry.

383
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,880
A bit blurry? I'll wipe it clean then.

384
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,690
This won't do.

385
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,490
We need to get Hai

386
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,290
a set of waterproof equipment.

387
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,550
Okay?

388
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,970
I'll take care of it.

389
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,240
Six, six, six.

390
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,290
Those comments make me drool.

391
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,880
We're doing so well now.

392
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,280
I want to show off to Chen Lang.

393
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,650
Quickly do it.

394
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,620
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr Chen.

395
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,700
Check out our live stream.

396
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,130
You have around 40 streamers.

397
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,810
Which one do you want me to watch?

398
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,570
Which one's the highlight?

399
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,630
What are you doing?

400
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,250
Studying small-town markets?

401
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,190
Writing a paper?

402
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,580
What paper?

403
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,100
I'm shopping.

404
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,040
Tell me honestly, what are you doing?

405
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,700
I'm telling you the truth.

406
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,220
I met Mr Wu today.

407
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,920
He told me about

408
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,910
Don Quijote in Japan.

409
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,100
I've checked.

410
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,910
They have a sophisticated

411
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,370
and standardised management structure.

412
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,970
It's impressive.

413
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,400
I'm thinking

414
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,100
if we can integrate it

415
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,000
into our live streaming
e-commerce business,

416
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,280
maybe we can create

417
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,700
an online excess goods retail chain.

418
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,320
Big data streaming?

419
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,330
[That's right.]

420
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,490
[You think about it.]

421
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,760
We have to standardise
and refine the content

422
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,210
and the roles of the broadcasters.

423
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,130
What are they going to sell

424
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,040
and who are the target audience?

425
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,880
Everything is referable, trackable,

426
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,610
and specific.

427
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,450
Doesn't it sound like a great service?

428
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,860
Don't we always aim to provide

429
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,280
what the customers need?

430
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,860
I know.

431
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,330
But we can do better.

432
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,730
I just used Pinduoduo.

433
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,490
They really did

434
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,690
a lot of research.

435
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,860
I browsed for a short while

436
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,820
and my cart is almost full.

437
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,210
You see,

438
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,050
they provided me with excellent service,

439
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,090
so I repay them with my purchasing power.

440
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,090
What have you bought?

441
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,040
Some mosquito repellent, Florida Water,

442
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,250
toilet paper...

443
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,100
All the daily necessities.

444
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,570
By the way, I've bought
a yellow peach for 17 yuan.

445
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's quite cheap.

446
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,520
I thought you don't eat imported fruit?

447
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,840
I have to see what an expensive fruit

448
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,160
tastes like.

449
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,120
Alright, I've got to go. Bye.

450
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,610
My mum is calling.

451
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,970
Mum.

452
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,210
[Hello, Duan Ran.]

453
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,700
How's everything going?

454
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,810
Not bad. Everything is going smoothly.

455
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,610
We'll go back tomorrow morning.

456
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,090
What do you mean, "we?"

457
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,270
You and who?

458
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,280
Mum, don't be so suspicious.

459
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,010
I've promised you and Dad.

460
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,250
I won't be in a relationship

461
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,290
until I achieve success.

462
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,130
I have an appointment
with a shrink tomorrow morning.

463
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,490
I've got to go now.

464
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,650
Alright, hope the shrink helps.

465
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,040
Rest early.

466
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,410
[Okay, Mum.]

467
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,090
Goodbye.

468
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,210
It must be rough for you
during this period of time.

469
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,610
No, it's rough for you.

470
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,280
You have to promote
the on-site live stream,

471
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,890
and put on an act for my Mum
at the same time.

472
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,010
I didn't know she

473
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,730
had a serious sleeping problem.

474
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,590
And she's under a lot of pressure.

475
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,880
Aunt Zhou is seeing a doctor now.

476
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,250
She'll get better.

477
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
I'm just worried that

478
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,810
she

479
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,420
doesn't know that we're still together.

480
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,860
If she finds out that we lied to her,

481
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,810
won't we upset her even more?

482
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,970
Let's see how it goes.

483
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,800
I'll talk to her

484
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,400
when appropriate.

485
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:03,860
Ms Zhou,

486
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,500
I invited you,

487
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,970
so don't treat me as your shrink.

488
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,160
Just open up

489
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,520
and let's have a chat.

490
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,740
What does your husband think about it?

491
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,000
He said it's not my fault.

492
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,070
Right, it's an accident.

493
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,770
It's not your fault.

494
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,690
Of course it's my fault.

495
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,360
My foster daughter promised me

496
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,080
she won't fall for my son.

497
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,070
My son also said
he won't be in a relationship

498
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,100
until he has a successful career.

499
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,090
But they're starting a business together.

500
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,690
They see each other

501
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,240
everyday.

502
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,780
Both of them are so young.

503
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,820
I don't think I can stop them.

504
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,930
Ms Zhou,

505
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,450
maybe you don't realise it.

506
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,410
You don't really want

507
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,000
to break them apart

508
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,810
because they're not related by blood.

509
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,260
They are not really brother and sister.

510
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,530
You're just beating yourself up

511
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,240
for that accident.

512
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,760
You don't want to face it.

513
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,840
So when you find out that

514
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,800
they have feelings for each other,

515
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,590
you want to stop them.

516
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,000
Ms Zhou,

517
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,080
it's like

518
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,490
you're covering your ears

519
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,020
because you don't want
to listen to others.

520
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,440
You want to punish yourself.

521
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,850
But you end up

522
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,870
punishing those two young people.

523
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,790
Do you really want to go on like this?

524
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,680
Can we put this here?

525
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,220
Have they signed
the supplementary agreement

526
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,350
to share the QC fees?

527
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,240
Yes.

528
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,580
Duan Ran, you're so stingy now.

529
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,520
You used to spare no expense.

530
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,490
We have to be clear about money.

531
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,240
You're so tight-fisted.

532
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,130
You're even more stingy than me.

533
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,820
Don't praise me yet.

534
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,400
We've been so busy

535
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,120
for the past six month.

536
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,880
Although we don't make big money,

537
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,880
we have so many talents.

538
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,850
They are our invaluable assets.

539
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,690
You should try to increase your assets.

540
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,220
I saw the annual return report
prepared by Chen Lang.

541
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,790
If we maintain the business this way,

542
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,290
we're unlikely to grow.

543
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,250
You've become ambitious now.

544
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,250
Who did you learn it from?

545
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,610
Don't you think our values
are more similar now?

546
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,000
Is it because we're dating?

547
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You've become bold.

548
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,410
Not shy anymore?

549
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,370
I'm serious.

550
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,980
I think we need a bigger platform.

551
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,450
It's hard to do it on our own.

552
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,240
Actually, my goal has always been

553
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,500
working with the mall.

554
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,000
So?

555
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,890
I hope we can work with QE.

556
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,420
Do we have no other options?

557
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,670
I don't think so.

558
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
I won't do it.

559
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,190
This is business.
You should set your ego aside.

560
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,210
I think,

561
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,790
only by turning Cloud Live into
a booming success

562
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,090
can we salvage the pride
we've lost

563
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,090
to Shen Jiang Tao and Shen Ding Ding.

564
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,210
You gave me a fright.

565
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,930
I didn't hear you coming in.

566
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,760
What are you shooting?

567
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,530
Selfies.

568
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,850
See?

569
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,500
What are you doing?

570
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,770
You seldom work overtime.

571
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,250
It's very late now.

572
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,409
And you're reading the QE Night rundown.

573
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,380
Why?

574
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,820
Mr Liang from the Red Wine Association
called me.

575
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,719
He said they have a special

576
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,730
on Cahors wine.

577
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,360
I turned on the computer at once

578
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,929
to change the wine list.

579
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,080
Not bad.

580
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,889
You're so meticulous.

581
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,650
Thank you.

582
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,000
As an accountant,

583
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,219
I should be meticulous.

584
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,420
Can you give me back...

585
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,739
But you've overlooked something.

586
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,920
I'm very disappointed in you.

587
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,480
You're leaking confidential information.

588
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,540
We can sue you.

589
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,230
Mr Shen,

590
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,880
what are you talking about?

591
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,130
Everyone in the company

592
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,810
has a copy of the rundown.

593
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,890
It's not confidential.

594
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,690
Alright. Alright.

595
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,280
I'll fess up.

596
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,290
I shared the QE Night rundown

597
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,360
with other people.

598
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,760
You can punish me as you see fit.

599
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,050
Don't look at me like that.

600
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,770
If you really trust me,

601
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,520
you wouldn't take away my phone

602
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,890
and check it.

603
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,120
Once a traitor, always a traitor.

604
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,750
You're a traitor.

605
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,810
What did Cloud Live give you?

606
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,160
I'm sorry, Mr Shen.

607
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,570
I can't be bribed

608
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,600
with money.

609
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,890
Well,

610
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,040
then tell me.

611
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,650
What do they want the rundown for?

612
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,060
Tell me and I'll forget about everything.

613
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,440
How?

614
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,980
This is Rui's rundown for QE Night.

615
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,410
Look at the scale of it.

616
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,850
They are so ambitious.

617
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,530
Glad to know that Yu Shi
still has a conscience.

618
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,850
He is taking a risk to help us.

619
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,740
Did you plan this long ago?

620
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,020
Duan Ran, think about it.

621
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,850
If QE Night works out,

622
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,220
Rui will have QE all to itself.

623
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,250
Then we'll have no chance
of entering that market.

624
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,490
Can you accept it?

625
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,710
The old Duan Ran once taught me,

626
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,650
the business world is like a battlefield.

627
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,850
Fight with rationality, not emotions.

628
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,720
Where is Duan Ran now?

629
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,280
Su Su,

630
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,280
it's so late now.

631
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,290
Let's go.

632
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,820
You have dark circles under your eyes.

633
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,160
I've been staying overnight
to help Duan Ran

634
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,310
write a programme.

635
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,230
I've heard.

636
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,970
They needed help.

637
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,640
I could only do it

638
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,640
after work.

639
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,430
I'm Rui's employee after all.

640
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,530
I'm hungry.

641
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,620
Hungry?

642
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,500
Let's go and have supper.

643
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,820
Come on.

644
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,320
Wait.

645
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,330
I need to get this.

646
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,330
Yu Shi, listen.

647
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,010
You're leaving the company
due to personal reasons.

648
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,400
The company won't compensate you.

649
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,880
Shen Ding Ding, you're so unreasonable.

650
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,300
You think I don't know my rights
because I'm new?

651
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,880
I'm a senior finance executive.

652
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,170
And I was clearly fired.

653
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,420
You have to pay me three months' salary
as compensation.

654
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,680
If not, I'll lodge a complaint
to the Ministry of Manpower.

655
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,280
Yu Shi, what happened?

656
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,120
Yu Shi is a traitor.

657
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,760
He leaked information

658
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,720
to our competitor, Cloud Live.

659
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,840
This is

660
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,050
utterly despicable.

661
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,690
The company has decided to fire him.

662
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,850
No, he resigned.

663
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,160
Yu Shi, are you crazy?

664
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,010
I want to help Qian Xi Xi.

665
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,280
It's my choice.

666
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,890
I'm very happy to do that.

667
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,970
I'll give you three months' salary.

668
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:39,900
You get lost now.

669
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,820
Mr Shen Jr.

670
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,840
Yu Shi is QE's senior staff.

671
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,450
Besides, he has a stake in Rui
from his stock options.

672
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,910
You need the board's permission
to fire him.

673
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,210
You're funny.

674
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,400
Last time, you dumped him

675
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,830
for betraying Rui.

676
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,650
Now, he's betraying Rui again.

677
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,480
Why are you standing up for him?

678
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,850
That's my business.

679
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,190
You can't fire him now.

680
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,700
Su Su is right.

681
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,440
Who's going to take care of our finances?

682
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,160
You're ganging up

683
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,090
against me, aren't you?

684
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,730
Fine, I've had enough with you.

685
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,720
You.

686
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,180
You've been helping

687
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,660
Qian Xi Xi behind my back.

688
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,410
And you. You've been secretly watching
Cloud's streams after work.

689
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,300
Do you think I don't know?

690
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,430
"Secretly?" I was very open about it.

691
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,730
Alright.

692
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,460
Since you have such a close relationship
with Duan Ran,

693
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,780
I'll let you go then.

694
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,330
You're all fired!

695
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,030
Don't be rash.

696
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,550
Mr Five is the main designer for Vine.

697
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,320
Are you not...

698
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,800
I have the money.

699
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,360
I can easily find a designer

700
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,230
like her.

701
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,850
Of course.

702
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,850
Rui has a lot of money.

703
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,890
Since that's the case,

704
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:01,970
we should just go.

705
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,250
Let's not be an eyesore.

706
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,980
Su Su, let's go.
Yu Shi, let me help you.

707
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,650
Hurry!

708
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,070
Your plant is so heavy.

709
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,480
-Su Su, I'll help you pack.
-What?

710
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,530
You want to join them

711
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,730
and go to Cloud?

712
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,930
The broadcasters there

713
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,250
are farmers

714
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,760
and fishermen.

715
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,320
Is that what your fans

716
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,640
want you to do?

717
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,930
The colour even matches my cubicle.

718
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,350
What extravagance!

719
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,010
How did you get fired?

720
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,110
It's because of him.

721
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,310
Never make but always break.

722
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,130
You even failed as a traitor.

723
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,330
He was caught red-handed
by Shen Ding Ding,

724
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,040
and now we're all unemployed.

725
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,310
I was actually very alert.

726
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,060
When I saw Shen Ding Ding
from the corner of my eye,

727
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,190
I quickly deleted all of our messages.

728
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
But he...

729
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,280
He used my phone to set a trap for you.

730
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,210
And then everything fell apart.

731
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,970
Shen Ding Ding sent
that message to test me?

732
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,780
Right, it wasn't sent by me.

733
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,250
I really appreciate

734
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,450
your help.

735
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,100
Sorry that you got fired because of me.

736
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,250
No worries.

737
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,070
What about you two?

738
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,740
You know the programme
I was secretly writing?

739
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,270
He discovered it, too.

740
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,750
But I was innocent.

741
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,330
All I did was watch your live streams.

742
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,170
You're not innocent.

743
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,610
Everyone knows

744
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,810
you care about Cloud

745
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,130
more than Vine.

746
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,270
I don't care about Cloud. I...

747
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,680
Forget it. Shen Ding Ding said

748
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,730
he has the money
to find a better designer.

749
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,670
No designer can compare with you.

750
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,530
You're the designer
that created his brand image.

751
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,560
I know you all care about me.

752
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,770
But you shouldn't be so rash.

753
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,650
You know?

754
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,130
It's too late.

755
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,280
We've turned against Shen Ding Ding.

756
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,650
Xi Xi,

757
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,650
everyday, we helped you in fear.

758
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,930
We might as well help you openly now.

759
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:12,940
Right?

760
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,090
Here is the beer.

761
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,210
Let's celebrate your unemployment.

762
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,260
Okay.

763
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,510
You all were doing fine at Rui.

764
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,490
But you lost your jobs because of me.

765
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,370
Thank you!

766
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,490
We've talked about it

767
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,470
on the way here.

768
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,530
None of us regret it.

769
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,930
Rui isn't the same

770
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,310
without you two.

771
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,530
We're very happy that we've resigned.

772
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,120
Cloud Live owes you.

773
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,590
I'll give you a toast
on behalf of the company.

774
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,810
If you really think you owe us,

775
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,930
beat Rui

776
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,970
and hire us again.

777
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,380
-Cheers!
-With Mr Duan and Ms Qian's help,

778
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,520
we'll start a business again.

779
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,500
And achieve success!

780
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,460
To a wonderful future.

781
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,760
Let's go for it!

782
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,400
Go for it!

783
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,170
Mr Shen, Jiang Zhe Yang cannot come.

784
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,660
Do you have a backup plan?

785
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,040
The new product launch for our own brand

786
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,490
has also been cancelled.

787
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,050
What are you going to do

788
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,850
to fill up the 40-minute void?

789
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,800
Everyone, please calm down.

790
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,410
Rui Live has been
in the industry for years.

791
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,290
They have a lot of experience.

792
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,420
It's an unexpected situation
caused by the weather.

793
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,650
As far as I know, Rui is making
last-minute adjustments to the show.
