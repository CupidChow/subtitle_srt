The one who gets to stream
with Yang Yang is you.

I'll get back to work.

Get back to work. I'll
inform you if anything happens.

Why must you oppose me?

I did not.

21

What's wrong with Yuan Yuan?

24
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,740
She has experience, the ability to
sell and a huge fan base.

25

What's wrong with her?

26
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,360
She lacks one thing
compared to Zhang Jia Yun.

Which is?

I created for Jiang Zhe Yang.

I can't believe I was chosen instead.

30

Don't you think

32
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,950
Yuan Yuan has changed

33

34
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,320
I hope she doesn't overthink.

35
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,550
Should I give up the project for her?

36
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,000
You can't do that.

37
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,310
Yuan Yuan wouldn't accept that.

38
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,620
Giving her the spot? Forget it.

39
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,240
I think it's meaningless

Jiang Zhe Yang is already very popular.

It doesn't matter who streams with him

47

because viewers will be there for him.

48

Not for anyone else.

why didn't you pick Yuan Yuan?

I'll be frank.

54

Don't you think Yuan Yuan looks

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,240
just like an internet celebrity?

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600

-It's Yuan Yuan.
-Yuan Yuan.

What do you mean?

66
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,390
Duan Ran is probably the cause of that.

Don't bear high expectations.

73
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,950
I've always wanted to
find Yang Yang

74
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,290
a smart, intelligent,

75
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,670
but spontaneous girl.

76
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,560
I think you're pretty suitable.

77
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,450
Thank you.

78
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,920
Ms Qian, don't forget the venue.

79
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,020
All right.

80
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,810
By the way, on the day of the stream,

81
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,700
please make your broadcaster

82
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,670
look prettier.

83
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,940
Buy her better looking clothes.

84
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,750
What does she mean?

85
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,940
She thinks you don't look good.

86
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,520
Don't worry, Ms Ouyang.

87
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,560
Since you made requests,

88
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,780
I'll fulfill them.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,570

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,600

She wanted Yuan Yuan to return.

98
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,950
She pulled the rug out from under you.

99
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,280
Look buddy, today was a misunderstanding.

100
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,250
Don't worry. I'll figure
something out for Yuan Yuan.

101
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,260
Alright?

102
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,630
What else can you do?

103
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,480
The manager has made her decision.

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,130
I... Yuan Yuan.

105
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,810
I'd never go back on my word.

106
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,700
I discovered something.

107
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,640
What is it?

108
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,310
Everything related to Jiang Zhe Yang

109
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,159
is the result of an agreement

110
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,050
between his mother and manager.

111
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,650
Ouyang did not choose you today,

112
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,080
but it is okay.

113
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,480
That doesn't mean we can't change that.

114
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,670
What should we do? I'll listen to you.

115
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,880
Alright, just enjoy your meal for now.

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,530
Let's put it aside. Enjoy your food.

117
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,190
Don't worry and leave it to me.

118
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,420
Enjoy your meal.

119
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,530
Zhang Jia Yun, I'm very happy today.

120
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,790
I have to hand it to you.

121
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,040
You're brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

122
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,350
In my opinion,

123
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,820
the more arrogant or narcissistic one is,

124
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,909
the more one tries to please others.

125
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,310
She has great ideas,

126
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,180
but she's too opinionated.

127
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,640
So I corrected her

128
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,950
and it all worked out.

129
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,620
Jia Yun.

130
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,880
You're the female version of Zhuge Liang.

131
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,850
Forget it. You called me
the female Li Dan too.

132
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,500
Give me a break.

133
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,390
It's the same.

134
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,870
Anyway, to me,

135
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,180
you're the smartest one among us.

136
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,580
I'll take that.

137
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,510
It's my treat today.

138
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,090
One more order of grilled scallops.

139
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,170
Sure.

140
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Isn't that enough?

141
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,180
Grilled lobsters?

142
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,910
It's fine.

143
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,720
Is that enough?

144
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,580
You...

145
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,210
-That's enough.
-You can't eat anymore.

146
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,060
This is enough.

147
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,080
Don't get us the grilled lobster.

148
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,170
-Just the grilled scallops.
-Okay.

149
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,290
Don't scare me like that.

150
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,280
Go on.

151
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,220
You're the best.

152
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,299
Your diet would never succeed.

153
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,200
What are you talking about?

154
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,750
His ex-girlfriend showed up.

155
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,010
Go on. How do you feel?

156
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,480
Before this, I thought of her as a myth.

157
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,330
And now?

158
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,590
It has turned into reality.

159
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,410
You're scared.

160
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,980
Yes.

161
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,360
Listen, Zhang Jia Yun.

162
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,320
When I walked into the office today,

163
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,290
right before her,

164
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,740
when she announced her decision,

165
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,660
I was hoping

166
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,730
she'd make an unfair decision,

167
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,830
to appoint Yuan Yuan

168
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,150
just to please Duan Ran.

169
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,520
That way, I'd have

170
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,430
a reason to belittle her.

171
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,610
She did not do that.

172
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,130

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,690
What are the boxes doing there?

341
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,080
Stop wasting time.

342
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,390
Place them with Su Su.

343
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,140
Su Su is the one with glasses.

344
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,800
Quick, bring it into the live stream room.

345
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,080
Jia Yun, follow Cola
and Little Duckling

346
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,130
to the dressing room.

347
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,310
-Okay. I'll get ready.
-Do your best.

348
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,090
How is it going?

349
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,510
Everything is ready.
We're just waiting for Jiang Zhe Yang.

350
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,840
Good job.

351
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,680
Rui Live's comeback
all depends on this event.

352
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,330
I believe we'll definitely win.

353
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,290
I believe we'll win, too!

354
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,970
Have you seen Duan Ran?

355
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,060
That's weird.

356
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,380
He isn't answering my calls.

357
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,100
We couldn't find him in the mall.

358
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,490
I'll call him.

359
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,480
Why would he pick up your
calls when he ignores mine?

360
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,390
Am I right?

361
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,480
Ms Qian.

362
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,700
Jiang Zhe Yang is here.

363
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,350
We're coming.

364
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,690
-Jiang Zhe Yang is here. I'll pick him up.
-Okay.

365
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,450
-Be careful.
-Sweep the area once more.

366
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,410
Let's do this!

367
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,560
Su Su!

368
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,530
Let's do this!

369
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,990
Attention! Jiang Zhe Yang
is arriving soon.

370
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,850
All departments, pay attention.

371
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,310
Come on in.

372
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,500
This is your personal dressing room

373
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,580
and lounge.

374
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,190
I went through the entire mall

375
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,790
and this is the biggest room.

376
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,930
If you would like to eat or drink,

377
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,330
things like coffee or whatnot,

378
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,260
just let me know.

379
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,830
I'll get them ready for you.

380
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,450
Set up over there.

381
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,360
Have a look, Ms Ouyang.

382
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,420
Are you satisfied?

383
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,690
Is there anything you'd like to add?

384
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,570
It's not bad.

385
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,810
Of course we're satisfied.

386
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,870
I'm satisfied with
everything you've prepared.

387
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,040
Trust me.

388
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,490
Of course.

389
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,510
Yang Yang, put on makeup first.

390
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,830
I'll check out the venue with Ms Qian.

391
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,900
Okay.

392
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,980
Come and meet me when you're done.

393
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,640
Okay, I'll drop by later.

394
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,710
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

395
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,280
Get them some water.

396
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,470
Mi Ke.

397
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,080
Place a box of bottled water

398
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,150
in Jiang Zhe Yang's dressing room.

399
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,880
Prepare a box of beverages too.

400
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,290
This is the live stream room where Jia Yun

401
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,740
and Yang Yang will be interacting.

402
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,120
This is the backdrop.

403
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,600
Have a look, Ms Ouyang.

404
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,140
This is the control room.

405
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,460
There will be a screen here

406
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,660
to monitor the live stream in real time.

407
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,930
They are testing out the
lighting and sound system here.

408
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,450
Please align the placement

409
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,020
of both light no. 2 and light no. 3.

410
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,320
Su Su, how is it going?

411
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,460
It's almost done.

412
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,380
Double check the sound
system and opening music.

413
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,130
A lot of fans came today.

414
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,020
I saw a lot of them at the entrance.

415
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,270
This level of security isn't enough.

416
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,790
Do you have more guards?

417
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,390
Yang Yang is exceptionally popular.

418
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,320
Don't worry, Ms Ouyang.

419
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,360
The security department

420
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,460
has set up a cordon.

421
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,490
When the live stream begins,

422
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,780
QE's security department
will provide assistance.

423
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,990
Okay.

424
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,850
Where's Duan Ran?

425
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,800
It's been a while since I arrived.

426
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,320
Why haven't I seen him?

427
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,190
I don't know. He's probably busy.

428
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,530
He will show up later.

429
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,550
What can be more

430
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,350
important than Jiang Zhe Yang and I?

431
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,360
We arrived some time ago,

432
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,060
yet he hasn't come to greet us.

433
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,220
Ms Ouyang.

434
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,550
If you find the venue alright,

435
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,920
you should return to
Yang Yang's dressing room

436
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,660
to check on his makeup.

437
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,250
If you'd like to meet Mr Duan,

438
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,760
you can give him a call.

439
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,880
Do you have his contact number?

440
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,310
Ms Qian.

441
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,420
You don't have to come with me
to the dressing room.

442
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,490
No problems would occur on our side.

443
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,850
When it is time for program briefing,

444
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,920
I'll ask someone to call you over.

445
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,340
You should hurry up
and supervise the other areas.

446
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,360
This is Yang Yang's first streaming event.

447
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,950
I don't want any problems to occur.

448
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,110
Don't worry.

449
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,990
She is so arrogant.

450
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,790
Yang Yang is the star, not her.

451
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,740
Keep it down.

452
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,610
If she hears you,

453
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,160
she might stop Yang Yang
from attending the event.

454
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,420
Actually, to be able to

455
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,710
obtain Jiang Zhe Yang's cooperation

456
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,790
wasn't easy at all.

457
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,940
Our priority is to make sure
the live stream goes well.

458
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,490
Help Su Su out. She is busy.

459
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,920
I'll go over then.

460
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,670
Warn her not to make mistakes.

461
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,980
Go ahead.

462
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,290
Where is he?

463
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,210
Is everything okay?

464
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,100
Yes, it's fine.

465
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,360
I'll help you out.

466
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,320
This has to be adjusted to zero.

467
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,850
Wait, try adjusting this to zero.

468
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,750
How's the preparation?

469
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,300
-We haven't tried.
-Hurry up and try them on.

470
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,010
Zhang Jia Yun, what about you?

471
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,790
-I bought you the perfect outfit.
-Really?

472
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,080
-It's super pretty.
-Let me have a look.

473
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,360
Are you done?

474
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,070
-Yes.
-Forget it.

475
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,300
Hurry up and try it on if you're done.

476
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,180
Listen to me.

477
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,810
Jiang Zhe Yang's makeup is almost done.

478
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,400
-You're the only one left. Hurry up.
-Okay.

479
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,630
What, Xi Xi?

480
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,010
Has Yang Yang arrived?

481
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,470
He's in the next room.

482
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,110
Can I ask him for a photo?

483
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,530
Right now?

484
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,790
I look good right now.

485
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,320
I would like a photo with him right now.

486
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,630
You're pretty all the time.

487
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,040
He's going to like you anyway.

488
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,110
You haven't tried your outfits on yet.

489
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,400
-Have you memorized the dance moves?
-No.

490
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,000
I want a photo with Yang Yang.

491
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,270
That's adorable!

492
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,800
-You're too cute.
-Your hair is all messed up.

493
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,930
Forget about that and
focus on your stream.

494
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,490
Ask for a photo later, okay?

495
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,540
-Come on.
-I hate you.

496
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,540
-Go on.
-I'm done!

497
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,030
Is this okay?

498
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,730
Zhang Jia Yun.

499
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,150
Not choosing you for this event

500
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,070
is a huge mistake.

501
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,510
How are you so pretty?

502
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,190
Of course. I'm always pretty.

503
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,420
-So pretty.
-Do you feel pressured?

504
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,340
Hurry up, Little Duckling and Cola.

505
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,770
Ms Qian.

506
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,360
Mr Duan is here.

507
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,540
Duan Ran.

508
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,470
I've been looking for you all day.

509
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,790
-Xi Xi.
-I've been looking...

510
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,070
Yuan Yuan.

511
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,010
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

512
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,240
Madam, let me introduce her.

513
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,000
This is Qian Xi Xi.

514
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,440
She's the CEO of our streaming company.

515
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,870
Who is she?

516
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,360
Jiang Zhe Yang's mother.

517
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,230
Hello, madam. I'm Qian Xi Xi.

518
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,220
Hello.

519
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,200
Where's Yang Yang?

520
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,220
He's in there. I'll take you there.

521
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,520
He's in the lounge.

522
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,290
Hello, madam.

523
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,210
[QE]

524
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,490
Leave this spot out.

525
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,570
Hello.

526
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,300
Madam.

527
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,910
Mum, why are you here?

528
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,010
She's the best broadcaster at Rui Live.

529
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,930
She ranks first in terms
of sales and fan base.

530
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,970
Yang Yang should partner
with a broadcaster like her.

531
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,530
We can't employ an amateur, can we?

532
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,330
That's my conclusion
after much consideration.

533
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,340
What do you think?

534
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,470
You should wait outside.

535
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,920
She's not bad.

536
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,060
Yuan Yuan.

537
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,250
I didn't know you
persuaded Jiang Zhe Yang's mum.

538
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,500
Hats off to you.

539
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,160
Xi Xi, I had no choice.

540
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,280
I'm tired of failing.

541
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,210
From now on,

542
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,780
I'll fight for what I want.

543
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,190
What are you doing?

544
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,640
You scared me.

545
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,160
What are you doing?

546
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,350
To deliver the event schedule.

547
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,810
Madam, every arrangement today,

548
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,370
from our preparation

549
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,380
to theirs,

550
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,430
was tailored specifically

551
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,680
to Zhang Jia Yun.

552
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,920
That includes the entire schedule. Thus,

553
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,890
there's no need to
make new adjustments.

554
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,230
Madam.

555
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,870
I came to give you the event schedule.
Have a look.

556
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,490
Madam, I don't think we should do this.

557
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,740
Yuan Yuan is great,
but in terms of

558
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,420
image and persona,

559
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,460
she does not suit Yang Yang at all.

560
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,650
You set different identities for him

561
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,800
each day.

562
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,270
I don't get it.

563
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,910
I think Yuan Yuan is great.

564
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,670
I really like her.

565
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,470
We click so well.

566
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,050
Mum.

567
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,630
Have some water.

568
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay.

569
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,740
Ms Ouyang.

570
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,580
I'll head over with Ms Qian

571
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,560
to coordinate our schedules.

572
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,860
Sure.

573
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,970
What are you talking about?

574
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,560
What's going on?

575
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,320
Why must we switch Yuan Yuan out?

576
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,120
You were in there the whole time.

577
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,710
Let's go.

578
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,340
Stop looking.

579
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,210
I finally escaped.

580
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,990
Luckily you showed up.

581
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,160
How did it go?

582
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,270
After our meeting at the stadium,

583
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,380
I heard the coffee sold out pretty well.

584
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,450
Yes, the sales were great.

585
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,650
I should thank you personally.

586
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,900
Thanks a lot.

587
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,150
Why did your mum show up suddenly?

588
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,690
I don't know. She's always like that.

589
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,270
When her heart is set on something,

590
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,730
she'll do it immediately.

591
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,770
Despite her opinion,

592
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,820
we had already decided on the host.

593
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,880
We can't change it at the last minute.

594
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,460
This is nothing to her.

595
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,910
This one time,

596
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,520
I had a mini concert at Shenzhen.

597
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,760
She accepted a last-minute
commercial for me.

598
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,520
There was a time clash.

599
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,850
I had no choice but to leave
after singing two songs.

600
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,640
The fans cursed me.

601
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,840
She can't do that.

602
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,880
Ouyang spent half a year trying

603
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,250
to manage the situation.

604
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,410
Imagine that.

605
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,070
That means Ouyang
listens to your mother too?

606
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,290
Well, she's my mum.

607
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,200
We shouldn't bother.

608
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,350
Just leave it to them to figure it out.

609
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,420
Honestly,

610
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,280
it's been a long time
since I could walk about alone.

611
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,780
Such a rare moment of freedom.

612
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,640
I have to record it down. Let's go.

613
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,780
Aren't you going to put on your mask?

614
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,400
-It's fine. Let's go.
-There's a crowd.

615
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,480
Madam, this is about Yang Yang's career.

616
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,500
We have to be professional

617
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,000
and put aside our personal gain.

618
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,060
Don't you think so?

619
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,130
Ouyang.

620
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,030
In terms of experience

621
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,640
and number of fans,

622
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,090
Yuan Yuan is the most
professional broadcaster at Rui Live.

623
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,660
Are you teaching me
to be professional now?

624
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,990
I'm aware of the

625
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,620
statistics you're referring to.

626
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,400
That is too biased.

627
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,580
I choose Zhang Jia Yun

628
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,150
purely for professional reasons.

629
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,540
I will not agree to this.

630
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,970
I know.

631
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,380
It's not easy for you

632
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,770
to fix Yang Yang up

633
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,470
with jobs and movie deals.

634
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,420
We acknowledge

635
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,400
your effort and hard work.

636
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,560
However, on this matter,

637
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,450
you have to listen to me.

638
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,740
Do you know why?

639
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:45,020
Did you forget our agreement?

640
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,810
I obtained the deal with Perfect Blue.

641
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,550
We had an understanding.

642
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,500
Whoever gets the deal has the final decision.

643
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,850
You have to abide by the rules.

644
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,900
If you violate them so easily,

645
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,190
no one would work with you in the future.

646
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,210
Furthermore,

647
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,010
you allowed Yang Yang
to help his schoolmate

648
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,880
to sell coffee.

649
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,060
That incident...

650
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,930
Forget it, it's in the past.

651
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,620
I don't want to bring it up.

652
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,130
Wasn't that the girl named Qian?

653
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,520
Madam.

654
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,080
The girl who sold coffee

655
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,760
is actually Yang Yang's ex-schoolmate.

656
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,390
I should explain...

657
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,570
Ran Ran, this has
nothing to do with you.

658
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,780
Her negligence is to be blamed.

659
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,460
Luckily nothing bad resulted from that.

660
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,500
I will let it go,

661
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,610
but don't let it happen again.

662
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,360
Before we do anything,

663
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,150
we need to think it through.

664
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,430
That's enough.

665
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,400
This isn't a big deal.

666
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,190
Stop arguing with me.

667
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,230
I'll go check on Yang Yang.

668
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,470
Where did they go?

669
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,790
I'll go and check it out.

670
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,810
Don't take it personally.

671
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,900
Are you going to take a photo here?
Stop it.

672
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,170
You're in public without your mask on.

673
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,710
Madam.

674
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,930
Mum.

675
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,280
Why didn't you put on your mask in public?

676
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,730
-Seriously?
-I was taking a photo so I removed it.

677
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,490
-Hurry up and put it on.
-You don't need shades, Mum.

678
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,620
What if someone recognises me?

679
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,510
It's not easy being your mother.

680
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,910
Hello, madam.

681
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,850
Hello again.

682
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,980
Mum, let me introduce her.

683
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,570
She's Qian Xi Xi, my primary schoolmate.

684
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,350
What a coincidence.

685
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,370
Were you two really schoolmates?

686
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,500
Yes.

687
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,350
Back when Jiang Zhe Yang

688
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,130
was known as Jiang Jin Suo.

689
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,130
We were desk mates from the same class.

690
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,960
Both of you shared a close bond.

691
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,210
Have you guys not met after that?

692
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,190
Not at all.

693
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,410
When I first saw you,

694
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,220
I thought you looked familiar.

695
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,810
You haven't changed at all over the years.

696
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,530
Thank you.

697
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,440
You're young and pretty.

698
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,930
Don't walk around in public
for no good reason.

699
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,040
If someone uploads a photo of you here,

700
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,750
who knows what rumours it might spark?

701
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,780
Mr Duan.

702
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,860
Mr Duan.

703
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,230
Mr Duan.

704
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,199
You're doing your makeup.

705
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,580
Yes.

706
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,150
That's a lot of products.

707
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,050
We're girls.

708
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,760
What's the matter, Mr Duan?

709
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,030
I have to inform you about something.

710
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,810
There are some slight changes

711
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,270
with the stream today.

712
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,590
What is it?

713
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,270
Jiang Zhe Yang's mum
brought Yuan Yuan over.

714
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,260
She wants

715
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,940
Yuan Yuan to be the
one interacting with Jiang Zhe Yang.

716
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,190
Jiang Zhe Yang's jobs

717
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,150
are mostly decided by his mother.

718
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,730
Are you saying that

719
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,580
I'm not allowed to host
the live stream later?

720
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,280
No, you're just not the main host.

721
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,970
You're still the
representative broadcaster

722
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,660
of Rui Live.

723
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,530
Mr Duan, you should have told me earlier.

724
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,220
When I was chosen for the event,

725
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,810
I was so nervous
I couldn't sleep for days.

726
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,000
Look at my eye bags.

727
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,000
I could barely conceal them.

728
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,190
You said it yourself.

729
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,720
You can't change your mind.

730
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,120
Of course not.

731
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,880
That's great.

732
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,860
You...

733
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,470
You...

734
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,300
You seem pretty happy.

735
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,300
Of course I am.

736
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,370
I was so nervous for the past few days.

737
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,160
Mr Duan, you know how much I hate

738
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,350
the pressure and responsibility of
meeting a sales quota.

739
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,540
Don't worry though.

740
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,870
I'll still do my best

741
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,580
to promote the products.

742
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,790
Good job.

743
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,770
Jia Yun.

744
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,220
This is great.

745
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,400
You...

746
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,320
You deserve it.

747
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,290
Well...

748
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,730
You should continue.

749
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,620
I'll get Yuan Yuan here for the makeup.

750
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,560
Do I still need to memorise the script?

751
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,870
You don't have to.

752
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,090
That's great.

753
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,350
Thanks, Mr Duan.

But I don't think we should risk

844
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,750
having incriminating leaks

845
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,530
of Yang Yang on the internet.

846
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,120
What do you mean, Ouyang?

847
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,230
Are you going to switch Yuan Yuan

848
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,150
out over a mere article?

849
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,050
Yes.

850
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,780
Ouyang.

851
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,540
Mrs Jiang is right here.

852
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,940
I'll be honest with you.

853
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,880
The reason I was so confident

854
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,490
and adamant about Yang Yang

855
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,660
was simply because

856
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,780
Yuan Yuan is the best
broadcaster at our company.

857
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,930
If you think

858
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,680
Yuan Yuan isn't qualified
for this live stream,

859
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,350
then no one is.

860
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,880
You can't just dismiss Yuan Yuan

861
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,290
because of a minor article.

862
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,560
You can't judge Yuan Yuan

863
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,170
based on a mere article.

864
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,330
Yuan Yuan has worked very hard.

865
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,900
We can't deny her hard work.

866
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,510
You can't do that, can you?

867
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,010
Duan Ran, the way you describe me

868
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,810
makes me seem so narrow minded.

869
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,420
I did not deny her hard work.

870
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,150
Since Yuan Yuan is the best

871
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,780
in the industry,

872
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,180
she must be capable.

873
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,900
But do you think it's easy for me,

874
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,920
as Yang Yang's manager,

875
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,750
to keep him scandal-free

876
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,430
up until now?

877
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,100
We go to great lengths every day

878
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,880
to avoid any slip-ups.

879
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,320
Once a celebrity is stained,

880
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,810
he is ruined.

881
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,270
Ms Ouyang.

882
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,270
I'll withdraw from the
live stream this time.

883
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,520
Mr Duan.

884
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,070
Thank you very much.

885
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,670
Thanks for your trust,

886
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,420
but the rumours aren't true.

887
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,770
The reason I switched to e-commerce

888
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,520
is to avoid all the slanderous lies.

889
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,010
Unlike entertainment platforms,

890
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,590
e-commerce is not as toxic.

891
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,510
Here, I make money with my own ability,

892
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,290
not other people's generosity.
