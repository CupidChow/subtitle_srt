The sun is scorching hot in the seas.

173
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,550
But I feel refreshed.

174
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,180
My skin doesn't feel hot at all.

175
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,190
On the windy and sunny sea,

176
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,380
isn't it nice to wear something like this?

177
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,860
This red sun and wind proof jacket

178
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,860
is made from the same fabric as
the previous piece.

179
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,880
It's really soft and comfortable.

180
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,220
You won't feel stuffy even
if you're sweating.

181
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,300
You'll be relaxed

182
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,000
instead of feeling the wind
blowing on you.

183
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,610
Here!

184
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,880
Over here!

185
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,650
Over here!

186
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,050
Yuan Yuan.

187
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,360
Take the streamers.

188
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,410
We'll catch the yacht by speedboat.

189
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,970
Let's go.

190
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,860
Don't go anywhere, babes!

191
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,490
I'll be right back!

192
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,620
With Qian Xi Xi alone,

193
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,660
the sales can only get this far.

194
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,780
Where are the others?

195
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,410
Where's Yuan Yuan?

196
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,970
Come on, show up!

197
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,900
Focus on the live stream.

198
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,410
You're totally right.

199
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,880
Almost, almost!

200
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,090
Hurry up!

201
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,570
-We're set.
-Don't stop, guys.

202
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,990
Take your clothes and get in.

203
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,690
-Go upstairs and start streaming.
-Hurry!

204
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,040
Hurry! Keep it up!

205
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,000
There's a time lapse over there.

206
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,440
It's a signal problem.

207
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,420
Qian Xi Xi, you've spent so much time,

208
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,850
yet the sales are still so low.

209
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,120
I can't count on you. I'll do it.

210
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,110
I really can't take it anymore.

211
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,450
I'm counting on you, Yuan Yuan.

212
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,120
Hurry up!

213
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,560
-They're here!
-It's up!

214
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,180
What did I say? What did I say?

215
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,360
They're coming up one by one.

216
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,970
It's done.

217
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,290
Oh my gosh.

218
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,410
What's wrong?

219
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,920
Nothing.

220
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,490
Not bad.

221
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,810
-Well done to you, too.
-You're great!

222
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,610
Well done to you, too!

223
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,740
Let go! I'm seasick.
Stop shaking me.

224
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,300
I'm in beautiful Sanya now.

225
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,300
Let me show you the beauty of the sea.

226
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,870
Ever been to Sanya before?

227
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,250
Hello, babes.

228
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,010
Now I'll show you guys
the second piece.

229
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,760
This is a bright colour.

230
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,320
Wear it with our...

231
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,050
Wear it with a pair of black shorts.

232
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,170
And the sun rays are warm.

233
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,060
It's sleeveless on the outside.

234
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,880
You could call it a singlet.

235
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Yuan Yuan! Yuan Yuan!

236
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,920
She has the highest sales! Not bad!

237
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,490
Bad news, Duan Ran.

238
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,530
What should we do? Look!

239
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,740
The colours bled out

240
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,910
while these were soaked.

241
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,410
We can't present them.

242
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,850
These are all the Nishiyama Yohji
collaboration pieces.

243
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,410
Not bad.

244
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,920
Not bad.

245
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,650
It's gorgeous.

246
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,300
This is the highlight of the day.

247
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,450
Many of them are tuning in

248
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,610
because of it.

249
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,970
But now, we can't even show it live.

250
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,450
Okay, don't worry.
Why worry?

251
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,570
I signed a contract with Mr Wu.

252
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,670
What if I don't get paid?
Besides, I...

253
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,810
I really want to kill Chen Lang!

254
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,860
Let's find a way, okay?

255
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,050
We'll find a way.

256
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,550
What's the matter, Mr Wu?

257
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,250
Where's the limited edition
Nishiyama Yohji?

258
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,980
I made this special live stream

259
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,760
just for this series.

260
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,880
Don't worry.

261
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,370
You see, Mr Wu,

262
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,900
these are just the teasers.

263
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,210
We're saving the best for last.

264
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,420
Trust me, it'll show up soon.

265
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,610
Where can we get these pieces?

266
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,610
It's sold out in Sanya.

267
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,530
Are there any in Xiamen?

268
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,920
I suddenly thought of someone.

269
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,290
She's in Xiamen.

270
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,730
Hey beautiful, care to give
me some advice?

271
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,660
Sir, this suit

272
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,490
is the last piece of the series.

273
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,420
They are all hand-sewn

274
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,000
by Florentine artisans.

275
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,370
-Florence? I went there before.
-Really?

276
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,440
The most exciting thing I ever did

277
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,970
was crashing a car in the mountains.

278
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,010
It still haunts me to this day.

279
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,880
That's really dangerous.

280
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,930
What is she doing?
Why won't she pick up?

281
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,880
Dropping the ball at the last minute.

282
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,300
What is she supposed to be doing now?

283
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,320
She's working at the counter.

284
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,860
Are you sure she's there?

285
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,010
I'm sure she's now chatting away with

286
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,850
some handsome guy by the counter.

287
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,050
The most exciting thing I
ever did is probably

288
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,550
not putting up the tray

289
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,050
when the plane landed.

290
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,930
If that's true,

291
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,060
I think your encounter

292
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,850
is even more exciting than mine.

293
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,210
Is that so?

294
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,550
Sir, what do you think of the suit?
Do you want to...

295
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,840
Why don't you show me something else?

296
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,680
Sure.

297
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,780
-Hello, how can I help?
-Is Zhang Jia Yun here?

298
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,990
She's over there.

299
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,050
Are you Zhang Jia Yun?

300
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,930
You are?

301
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,170
I'm from Pineapple,
a friend of Qian Xi Xi's.

302
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,120
What's up?

303
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,120
We want you to go live.

304
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,690
I've set up a live stream room for her.

305
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,560
The purchase link has been set as well.

306
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,920
She's not picking up.

307
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,750
She's online! Is this her?

308
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,050
It's her, right?

309
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,410
Ms Yun?

310
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,860
Yes, that's her!

311
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,490
She's finally going live!

312
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,120
Hello, everyone! How are you?

313
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,010
This is my first live stream.

314
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,210
So you may not know who I am.

315
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,580
But those of you who frequent
Qianjiang Forum should know

316
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,930
that I'm Ms Yun.

317
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,430
So let's cut to the chase.

318
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,860
I'll be showing you today

319
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,340
the final piece of the Pineapple special,

320
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,020
which are the limited edition,

321
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,180
collaborative pieces from Pineapple
and Nishiyama Yohji

322
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,430
that I'm wearing now.

323
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,340
[This piece incorporates]

324
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,340
[Nishiyama Yohji's design philosophy.]

325
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,530
[It comes in this black
and white combination,]

326
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,990
-Not bad
-[with a sleek and flattering cut.]

327
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,180
[Let me show you.]

328
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,420
[Its top and bottom...]

329
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,760
Our clothes are nice, aren't they?

330
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,290
[The shirt on top...]

331
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,610
Oh my gosh.

332
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,810
There are two unique designs
at the bottom.

333
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,740
A traditional black and white tone

334
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,570
combined with a streamlined, modern cut.

335
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,690
Look, everyone.
For my top, I'm wearing a shirt.

336
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,180
A white shirt.

337
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,610
She's good at this.

338
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,570
Her live stream is on the first page.

339
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,700
[There's a drawstring design
on both sides.]

340
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,760
The first piece was sold out.

341
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,730
Look, Yuan Yuan's sales are rising.

342
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,210
[Do you guys like Sanya?]

343
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,700
[Have you all been to Sanya?]

344
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,339
[Sanya is really beautiful.]

345
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,890
[The breeze is blowing nicely on my face.]

346
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,329
Limited edition yellow jacket.

347
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,180
Did you know I exchanged my bag

348
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,250
for this outfit at a roadside?

349
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,730
Which bag?

350
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,940
The one I gave you?

351
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,210
What choice do I have?

352
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,910
Yuan Yuan is great.

353
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,090
Of course.

354
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,460
Our company's number one
streamer is no joke.

355
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,130
This is your company's true strength.

356
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,770
Quick, check out Jia Yun.

357
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,540
The second piece is halfway sold out.

358
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,130
Okay, babes!
I saw your questions!

359
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,610
[How about this?
I'll try on all three pieces for you.]

360
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,680
What great reception.

361
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,730
I'm back!

362
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,340
And the third piece

363
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,430
is a one-piece dress.

364
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,780
There's a dress outside.

365
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,370
A wide belt.

366
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,120
You can tie it into a nice pattern.

367
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,790
Told you we should ask Pineapple's
staff to approach Jia Yun.

368
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,250
She's too good at this!

369
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,550
She's a professional!

370
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,010
Duan Ran, well done!

371
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,820
-You're a genius!
-I must praise you!

372
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,730
Why, I'm a genius.

373
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,020
I'm a genius too! And you, Su Su.

374
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,540
You're a genius! You're amazing!

375
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,780
Everyone's a genius.

376
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,960
Well done!

377
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,090
[That's it for today's
special live stream]

378
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,770
[on the limited edition Nishiyama
Yohji x Pineapple collection.]

379
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,580
[That's it for Pineapple's live stream.]

380
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,760
Bye!

381
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,800
Live streaming during working hours?

382
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,730
Your side hustle is going well.

383
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,250
Manager, I...

384
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,800
My friend was in trouble,
so I gave her some help.

385
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,210
You are paid to work here.

386
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,130
Not to help your friend.

387
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,370
Manager, these are only worth
a few hundred dollars.

388
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,010
But our shop sells clothes for
a few thousand dollars.

389
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,330
There's no competition here, right?

390
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,270
So you think it's justified?

391
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,280
You can sell them because
there's no competition?

392
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,130
Duan Sheng Yun's son went
right to the island

393
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,850
and squabbled with me.

394
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,370
He even found the three
limited edition pieces.

395
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,090
[So we can't underestimate the
younglings of the Duan family.]

396
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,160
[In that case,]

397
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,580
[be careful when you deliver
the coup de grace.]

398
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,040
Wait, Mr Ding.

399
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,730
I have one other little request.

400
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,910
[What is it?]

401
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,160
Can I name the company

402
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,890
"Yun"? As in "cloud"?

403
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,800
[Why?]

404
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,610
Just a little personal touch.

405
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,520
[Decide it yourself.]

406
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,610
Thank you.

407
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,130
Do you think it's right

408
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,180
to sell apples and watermelons
for others if you work

409
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,250
in a roast duck shop?

410
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,400
I understand, Manager. Just drop it.

411
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,800
You can deduct my salary.

412
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,890
What? I can't give you feedback
as the manager?

413
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,250
Your parents may pamper you at home.

414
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,090
But I won't pamper you here.

415
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,890
You're here to work.

416
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,660
Look, you can stay and work or leave.

417
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,640
Don't waste my time.

418
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,730
Sure, I'll leave.

419
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,010
Can't you take a little criticism?

420
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,090
On behalf of Xi Xi,

421
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,210
I'll report to everyone

422
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,700
on our results today.

423
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,890
Okay?

424
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,900
We've sold a total of 31,000 pieces

425
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,680
of Pineapple's apparels.

426
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,730
Our final turnover is 5.09 million.

427
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,580
Listen to me!

428
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,770
Out of the 5.09 million,

429
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,490
Yuan Yuan alone

430
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,210
sold a million.

431
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,920
Well done, Yuan Yuan!

432
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,090
I have to thank one person.

433
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,820
Xi Xi has made plenty of preparation

434
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,090
before the live stream.

435
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,000
And she went live on the yacht

436
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,760
for half an hour by herself.

437
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,440
Xi Xi is great.

438
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,680
Xi Xi?

439
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,740
Xi Xi?

440
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
What's wrong, Xi Xi?

441
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,210
Xi Xi! Xi Xi!

442
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,280
Xi Xi?

443
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,800
Are you okay, Xi Xi?

444
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,550
-What's up with her?
-She's too tired.

445
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,510
Let her rest and get some sleep.

446
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,010
She can sleep while standing.

447
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,320
Xi Xi?

448
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,280
I'll carry her downstairs.

449
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,320
Qian Xi Xi, you're so heavy now!

450
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,900
You look skinny.

451
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,320
But why are you so heavy?

452
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,730
My god.

453
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,640
She's cute when she's sleeping.

454
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,400
But deadly when she's awake.

455
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,130
Wearing your shoes on bed?

456
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,010
I'll take a short nap also.

457
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,730
You helped Duan Ran a great deal.

458
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,850
Is it because he is QE's young master?

459
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
Young master or not,

460
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,250
he has nothing to do with me.

461
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,850
Then why?

462
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,490
Chen Lang treats you well.

463
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,610
He treats me well

464
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,770
because I can make money

465
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,210
and sell products for him.

466
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,090
Does he treat other people
the same way?

467
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,130
That's right.
With your capability,

468
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,770
Chen Lang has to rely on you.

469
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,090
Since I became a streamer

470
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,640
for the past 1 year,

471
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,220
I've made a lot of money.

472
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,480
But I'm getting further away
from my dream.

473
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,850
Wait a moment, Xi Xi is sleeping.

474
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,980
I'll see if I can ask

475
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,890
Mr Duan to speak with Mr Wu.

476
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,580
Yu Shi,

477
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,250
they're both unavailable now.

478
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,090
How about this?
Please inform Mr Wu.

479
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,320
I'll ask Xi Xi to call him immediately.

480
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,520
Okay, bye.

481
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,130
God, my phone is ringing again!

482
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,370
Pass me the phone! Pass it to me!

483
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,160
Why did you sleep here?

484
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,890
Where am I? Why am I sleeping here?

485
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,370
Hello, Mr Wu.

486
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,560
-Slowly.
-Xi Xi.

487
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,560
I'm impressed. Great reception.

488
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,130
-Thank you.
-[Thanks for the trouble.]

489
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,590
It's no trouble at all.

490
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,210
[It wasn't quite polished.]

491
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,900
Yes, it couldn't be helped.

492
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,250
A lot happened today.

493
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,440
[Still, I'm happy.]

494
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,250
[But why did you go to Sanya
out of the blue?]

495
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,280
I'll tell you next time we meet.

496
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,800
Sure.

497
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,560
See you then.

498
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,920
Goodbye, Mr Wu!

499
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,040
Are you asleep?

500
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,140
I'm dead beat.

501
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,680
Dad.

502
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,520
Yes, the live stream is settled.

503
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,930
I guess you can call it a success.

504
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,730
I appreciate you and Xi Xi's hard work.

505
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
It's nothing.

506
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,700
We're staying in Sanya for the day.
We'll be back tomorrow.

507
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,460
Okay, no problem.

508
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,970
Remember, don't fool around.

509
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,320
Don't worry.

510
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,680
Where's Chen Lang?

511
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,730
Chen Lang?

512
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,090
I haven't seen him since I got onboard.

513
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,060
As for Chen Lang,

514
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,130
the board of QE will deal with him.

515
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,130
[Forgive and forget.]

516
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,460
[Don't get too mad at him.]

517
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,660
Okay, got it.

518
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,330
I'm hanging up, Dad. Bye.

519
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,520
Great job guys. Let's unwind.

520
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,010
We're not returning to Xiamen today.

521
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,180
We'll stay in Sanya.

522
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,730
We'll go back tomorrow by plane.

523
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,490
Great job. Right this way.

524
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,330
There's a bus waiting by the pier.

525
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm going with them, Xi Xi.

526
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:01,990
See them off, Su Su.

527
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,100
Sure.

528
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,160
Xi Xi.

529
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,800
We sure won the day, didn't we?

530
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,060
Why the long face?

531
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,820
Give us a smile. Smile.

532
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,490
I can't smile.

533
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,770
What's wrong?

534
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,610
You know.

535
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,040
I signed a contract with
Mr Wu for 5.2 million.

536
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,490
You're only 110,000 yuan short.

537
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,770
It's no big deal.

538
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,320
No.

539
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,730
It's not just about money.

540
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,160
Then what is it?

541
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,800
Cleaning the bathroom?

542
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,400
It's fine, think of it as a workout.

543
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,250
You want a workout?

544
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,550
Then help me.

545
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,180
-Do it in my stead.
-No way.

546
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,860
-Have a workout.
-No way.

547
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,320
Clean it yourself. Come on.

548
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,250
So I still have to go.

549
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
-Why, you...
-Stay back.

550
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,800
-You're laughing instead of helping!
-Clean it yourself. Count me out.

551
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,050
Take that!

552
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,360
You go first.

553
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,850
Don't worry, I'm not that petty.

554
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,210
Jia Yun?

555
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,100
Hey sister! I was just about to call you!

556
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,420
What happened just now?

557
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,970
You and Chen Lang must've messed up
real bad

558
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,850
for you to be asking me for help.

559
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,770
[It's a very long story.]

560
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,920
[We nearly failed because of Chen Lang!]

561
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,120
I'm in Sanya now.

562
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,340
It's hard to explain.

563
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,850
Sanya? What's going on over there?

564
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,250
I'm so mad!

565
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,550
[I've witnessed]

566
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,640
[a side of Chen Lang you
don't even know exists!]

567
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,010
Enough about me. How are things
on your end?

568
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,610
[I'm done. I've returned the clothes
to Pineapple's staff.]

569
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,160
How was it? How much did I sell today?

570
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,060
[You sold more than 800 pieces!]

571
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,440
[You're marvelous!]

572
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,280
[I think you'll get a lot of commission.]

573
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,250
That's better.

574
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,130
At least it makes up for my loss today.

575
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,630
[What? What did you lose?]

576
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,440
I was fired.

577
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,970
What happened?

578
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,490
She said I was promoting other
brands during working hours.

579
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,460
She even said that a spoiled girl

580
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,450
and that I'm useless.

581
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,040
She told me to leave.

582
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,090
So I left.

583
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,800
I say, Zhang Jia Yun,
did you flip out again?

584
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,240
You can't take your job so lightly.

585
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,800
Go back and apologise.

586
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,560
Forget it. I've quit and that's that.

587
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,800
What is your plan?

588
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,090
[I'll look for a new job.]

589
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,580
A new job? Will you consider

590
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,270
[working for us as a streamer?]

591
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,210
[Look at your first stream today.]

592
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,850
What a great impact!

593
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,850
You've won many fans

594
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,920
and made a bunch of sales.

595
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,770
All of us were flabbergasted.

596
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,490
[But of course.]

597
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,460
[I was forced by circumstances.]

598
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,090
I used to be quite popular

599
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,730
in Qianjiang Forum, okay?

600
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,280
But count me out of your start-up.

601
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,960
I'll let you be the keen whippersnapper,

602
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,850
while I lead an idle, carefree life.

603
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,440
Nice and easy, just the way I like it.

604
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,250
[Won't you consider it?]

605
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,280
Why are you so unambitious?

606
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,180
[I wish I could lead]

607
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,280
an ambitious life like you do.

608
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,520
I'm so jealous.

609
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,580
[Fine.]

610
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,200
[Let's talk when I return.]

611
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,400
We're here. Slowly.

612
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,370
Go and check-in at the front desk.

613
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,040
I've booked rooms for everyone.

614
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,440
Xi Xi!

615
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,250
That girl today sure has potential.

616
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,090
It's a pity she's not joining us.

617
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,490
Of course, she's my best friend.

618
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,820
She's a natural beauty.

619
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,610
Back in university,

620
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,660
talent agencies would wait
by the school gate

621
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,620
and approach her for acting gigs.

622
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,800
But she didn't care for it.

623
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,780
Sounds like

624
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,490
she's detached from reality.

625
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,090
Since I became a streamer at Rui Live,

626
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,970
I've asked her to join me several times.

627
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,010
But she wanted to work behind a counter.

628
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,210
She said it's not as stressful.

629
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,610
Go figure.

630
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,130
If I ever start a streaming company,

631
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,640
I'll recruit her for sure.

632
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,780
You share the same view as Chen Lang.

633
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,590
But he worked on it for a year

634
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,000
without any result.

635
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,850
He's weak, but I'm not.

636
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,040
Why not?

637
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,460
Today I gave you an

638
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,560
unprecedented live stream at the sea.

639
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,330
Your platform was on the first page.

640
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,610
Shouldn't we celebrate tonight?

641
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,140
-Let's celebrate!
-I agree!

642
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,920
Let's celebrate!

643
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,010
Your treat.

644
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,010
I'd be glad to.

645
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,250
Your treat!

646
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,240
Seriously, I must give you a toast.

647
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,320
We couldn't have done it
without your awesome performance.

648
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,420
Why me?

649
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,780
You're the one who took
the clothes.

650
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,010
Otherwise, we'd all be toast.

651
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,370
Let's not talk about clothes.

652
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,850
I'm so sick of them.

653
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,850
-Come.
-Mr Duan.

654
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,090
Your mojito.

655
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,060
Yours is still being prepared.

656
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,610
Let's find a place to sit.

657
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,560
Tell me about your past with Mr Duan.

658
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,700
Your childhood.

659
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,960
Us?

660
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,260
It's ready?

661
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,970
When I was little, my mother
had a general store

662
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,400
that also rented toys.

663
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,610
We would drum up business

664
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,980
and do odd jobs for her

665
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,690
in exchange for pocket money.

666
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,090
It's too bland.

667
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,310
That means you two

668
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,510
have been entrepreneurs
from a very young age.

669
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,640
From a young age? There's more to it.

670
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,130
Your drink.

671
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,190
What?

672
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,380
Duan Ran!

673
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,280
I didn't spike it.
That's regular strength.

674
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,820
You call that regular strength?

675
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,370
I wanted you to be happy.

676
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,480
That's too much.

677
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,160
He's been bullying me since
we were kids.

678
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,040
You should hang out with guys
more often.

679
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,890
Then you can drink every day.

680
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,860
Are you implying

681
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,830
you want to join our start-up?

682
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,490
Today on that yacht,

683
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,560
I saw all the streamers giving their all.

684
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,250
When the live stream began,

685
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,660
I was totally amazed.

686
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,760
Now do you know why we've
been working so hard?

687
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,160
Our trip to Sanya really paid off.

688
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,850
You're awake.

689
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,560
You're a great leader, Xi Xi.

690
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,640
It's been a long day.

691
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,990
How about some water?

692
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,240
Sure.

693
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,960
Duan Ran, why don't you do us ladies

694
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,310
a little favour?

695
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,280
Sure. I'll get you some water.

696
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,680
What a drag.

697
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,560
Keep an eye on him.

698
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,320
Water.

699
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,450
Here, a toast to Mr Duan.

700
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,640
I can't drink this, I'm not drinking it.

701
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,990
Drink mine.

702
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,920
What a wimp.

703
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,300
Down the hatch!

704
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,780
It is rather boozy. It's quite strong.

705
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,500
It's strong, isn't it? It's extra strong.

706
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,020
Su Su was asking me

707
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,890
if we've been entrepreneurs
since we were little.

708
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,500
Back then,

709
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,970
I was in charge of

710
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,010
asking her mother to buy new toys.

711
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,580
She's in charge of marketing
and publicity.

712
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,090
We were a great team.

713
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,880
I thought

714
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:11,090
as long as I had Qian Xi Xi,

715
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,480
I'd surely create a successful business.

716
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,830
Then?

717
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,389
Then Duan Ran decided to become
a high-rolling pig

718
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,370
and squandered away all the funds

719
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,850
we had made from my mother.

720
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,020
Don't listen to her.

721
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,570
Later on, because Qian Xi Xi
was a little wuss

722
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,770
who couldn't think big,

723
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,730
her family's business was ruined.

724
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,800
Come.

725
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,179
Let's have a toast!

726
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,810
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

727
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,489
To our success today.

728
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,790
This drink is too strong.

729
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,290
Can you carry me properly?

730
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,530
I can walk more steadily than you.

731
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,980
I'm not fat! How dare you?

732
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,810
Even on my back you're not
as tall as me.

733
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,290
211.

734
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,680
Hold me properly!

735
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,800
Come on! Let's drink!

736
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,430
-Is everything ready?
-Yes.

737
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,960
[Duan Ran, my mother gave me
15 yuan yesterday.]

738
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,770
[I'll take eight and you take seven.]

739
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,500
[Why? Don't we get seven
and a half yuan each?]

740
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,090
[Who told you to run away with my money?]

741
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,160
I was kidding. Did you actually
believe me?

742
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,640
To each according to his contribution.
Understand, Duan Ran?

743
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,400
Do you have to be so shrewd?

744
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,950
[Thank you, Xi Xi.]

745
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,920
Do come again.

746
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,190
[Goodbye!]

747
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,920
See you next time.

748
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,090
[Goodbye, Xi Xi.]

749
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,280
[Let's go.]

750
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,080
[Xi Xi!]

751
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,030
[Stop playing, it's time to eat.]

752
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,370
Xi Xi, come home for dinner.

753
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,690
[Ma Li's General Store]

754
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,570
[Duan Ran took our money!]

755
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,440
[I was looking at you two.]

756
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,640
[Duan Ran was playing with you.]

757
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,300
Eat first. Then you can go see him.

758
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,710
Xi Xi, hurry up!

759
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,510
Our plane is scheduled at noon.

760
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,270
What time is it?

761
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,790
It's 10:30 now.

762
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,370
So late? Why didn't you
wake me up sooner?

763
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,530
I just woke up.

764
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,390
I called them but no one picked up.

765
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,640
Call the front desk then.

766
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,990
They'll remind them.

767
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,520
Hello.

768
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,400
Could you remind the guests in C212
to hurry up?

769
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,640
What?

770
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,870
Okay, thanks.

771
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,080
Xi Xi, the front desk said they
left in the morning.

772
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,700
Where did they go?

773
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,780
Did they go home?

774
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,600
Call and ask that Yu Shi of yours.

775
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,810
Hello, Ms Qian?

776
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,070
Hello, Yu Shi?

777
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,960
Are you at work?

778
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,130
Did our people return?

779
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,990
[I'm not at work, I'm fishing.]

780
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,510
Fishing?

781
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,160
Isn't today a work day?

782
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,160
Yes, it is.

783
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,640
But Mr Chen called me last night

784
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,050
and told me to take the day off.

785
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,550
Chen Lang approved it?

786
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,770
Forget about fishing. Go take a look-see
at the office

787
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,160
and report back to us.

788
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,290
Okay.

789
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,150
It's not even a Sunday. What is Chen Lang
giving out leaves for?

790
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,120
Something's definitely wrong.

791
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,220
Did Chen Lang take the girls away?

792
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,290
If Chen Lang could bring them here,

793
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,830
he could take them away.

794
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,240
What does he want?

795
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,200
Don't mind him.
Let's return to Xiamen.

796
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,200
We'll know when we get back.

797
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,220
I've booked the tickets.
Let's go.

798
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,310
Wise guy.

799
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,050
Zhu Wan, call everyone over.

800
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,130
I have things to say.

801
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,240
Sure.

802
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,640
Come, everyone!

803
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,240
Stop what you're doing.

804
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,990
Mr Chen has something to say.

805
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,900
Everyone.

806
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,400
I apologise for asking all of you

807
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,740
to pack up overnight.

808
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,480
The truth is, I had plans

809
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,030
for this place all along.

810
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,440
But due to some unresolved matters

811
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,870
in the business,

812
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,840
I didn't dare to tell anyone.

813
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,370
Starting today,

814
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,550
we're no longer Rui Live.

815
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,950
I named the new company Cloud Live.

816
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,090
We're not affiliated to Rui Live

817
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,470
or QE anymore.

818
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,130
-You're finally here.
-What's up, Yu Shi?

819
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,080
I believe all of you

820
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,570
What is this?

821
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,440
had been striving alongside me

822
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,920
since the very beginning.

823
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,470
We were there when Rui went from
a nonentity to a key player.

824
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,330
From a key player to an industry leader.

825
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,230
I've asked the guards.

826
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,530
Early this morning,

827
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,880
Chen Lang and his people
came and emptied the place.

828
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,360
Thank god they weren't too beastly

829
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,750
and left my little flower unharmed.

830
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,400
Is he trying to tear down the company?

831
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,290
Oh my god.

832
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,890
[We may be an e-commerce company,]

833
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,700
[but we're backed]

834
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:03,160
by a Big Brother from
the traditional retail industry.

835
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,950
What's a Big Brother you ask?

836
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,230
When Big Brother's happy,
he'll give you candy.

837
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,600
And you'd better smile
and pretend to be happy.

838
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,810
Because if he isn't pleased,

839
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,190
he just might kick you out.

840
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,830
And you'll have no say in it.

841
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,940
And for what?

842
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,750
We're the ones who built Rui

843
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,950
piece by piece, step by step.

844
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,200
[Why are we putting our fate]

845
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,290
[in someone else's hands?]

846
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,710
What is this?

847
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,770
[I don't want this to happen.]

848
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,110
So I named the new company Cloud,

849
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,120
hoping that one day

850
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,160
we could stand atop the clouds

851
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,120
overlooking the industry.

852
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,270
What is Chen Lang doing?

853
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,700
[I have raised a considerable sum
of money.]

854
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,570
25 million yuan of angel investors' funds.

855
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,720
I believe with this money,

856
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,920
we can be even better

857
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,440
than Rui Live.

858
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,400
I'll ask Zhu Wan

859
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,360
to give you two contracts.

860
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,710
One, a termination contract
with Rui Live.

861
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,310
The other, an employment contract
with Cloud Live.

862
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:18,080
If you believe that I, Chen Lang,

863
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,880
can lead you to another victory,

864
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,270
Cloud Live's door is always open.

865
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,240
But we have to compensate
if we breach the contract.

866
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,550
That's right.

867
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,910
That's right.

868
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,200
Don't worry about the
contract termination fee.

869
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,390
The company will take care of it.

870
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,310
Mr Chen, why are Qian Xi Xi
and Yuan Yuan absent?

871
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:47,000
Don't you know? Qian Xi Xi is the foster
child of QE Group's Mr Duan.

872
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,610
She won't come here.

873
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,590
You all know what kind of person I am.

874
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,640
I'm a serious person.

875
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,290
I'm decisive and thorough.

876
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,400
I have my way of doing things.

877
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,270
Going forward,

878
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,360
I will take all of Rui Live's

879
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,610
talent and resources,

880
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,600
and transfer them to the new company.

881
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,290
As for Rui Live,

882
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,030
it won't be streaming anything
anytime soon.

883
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,880
Why did you join this industry?

884
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,960
Is it not to work hard and make money,

885
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,200
so that you can eat better food,
wear better clothes,

886
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,160
and provide your families
with a better life?

887
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,110
Join Cloud Live now,

888
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,390
and you'll receive a salary increment.

889
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,370
An increment?

890
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,470
Great! Great!

891
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,760
Great!
