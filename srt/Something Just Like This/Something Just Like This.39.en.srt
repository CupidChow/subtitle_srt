We have to thank Jia Yun for this.

I wonder whether it was his conscience

or gratitude that made Chen Lang
give us the patent.

177

I just hope Chen Lang

Don't just look at the negative side.

This incident may be a nuisance,

The key is pre-sales strategy.

First, we must act fast.

192

We should go all out for sale while
we're still hot from the incident.

193

Second, we must focus
on our target market.

After every sale,

195

we need to do a data collection
and analysis on the customers.

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,390
for Vine right after New Year.

338
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
You'll be the first one to get it.

339
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,100
Sure.

340
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,950
I'm ending this call, bye.

341
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,780
Hurry up, Mr Duan. Otherwise,
Su Su is going to discover it.

342
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,650
I'm coming.

343
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,110
Didn't you see I have a handful?

344
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,850
Ms Ouyang left for a holiday

345
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,520
and passed me her work.

346
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,120
She usually has a lot of work.

347
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
They don't call her
a workaholic for nothing.

348
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,250
Where's Xi Xi?

349
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,340
She went to a shop that's
all the rage on the internet

350
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,720
to get something for the Weiya Festival.

351
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,080
She won't be long.

352
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,950
Jia Yun.

353
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,040
Is he ready for his mission?

354
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,590
Don't mention it.

355
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,650
He's almost ready and wants to be alone.

356
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,800
And now he's nowhere to be seen.

357
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,130
Most likely he's hiding
somewhere, rehearsing his speech.

358
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,470
Just received his message.

359
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,490
What's it about?

360
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,820
[Mr Duan.]

361
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,400
[I need your help.]

362
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,890
[I couldn't unlock
the door in the toilet.]

363
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,310
Yu Shi.

364
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,090
Mr Duan.

365
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,210
Are you in there?

366
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,290
Luckily, you came to my help.

367
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,940
Help me unlock the door.

368
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,190
How could this happen?

369
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,460
I'm just curious.

370
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,980
Stop kidding, Mr Duan.

371
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,010
I have no idea.

372
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,430
Step aside. I'm trying to open it.

373
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,700
Sure.

374
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,020
It appears to be stuck.

375
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,190
I'll need to call the locksmith.

376
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,940
Hold it, Mr Duan.

377
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,040
-Don't do that.
-Why?

378
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,600
If you do that,

379
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,270
everyone will know about it.

380
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,130
I'll be a laughing stock then.

381
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,620
I don't want Su Su to see me

382
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,170
locked in the toilet.

383
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,520
It's so embarrassing.

384
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,750
What's there to be embarrassed about?

385
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,800
It's not your fault that you're
locked inside.

386
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,850
It's the toilet's fault.

387
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,510
I just feel embarrassed.

388
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,800
Great things don't come easy, you know.

389
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,840
This is no time for jokes.

390
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,990
I'm about to confess to Su Su.

391
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,040
I finally mustered my courage,

392
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,070
and now I'm stuck in the toilet.

393
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,860
Why am I so unlucky?

394
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,250
Why don't you confess

395
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,750
through the door?

396
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,140
Mr Duan.

397
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,970
I don't think today
is a good time for this.

398
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,580
Today is the best day for this.

399
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,990
You can forget about doing it,
if you miss it today.

400
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,750
I've checked the lunar calendar.

401
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,730
You sure will succeed if you do it today.

402
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,430
-Okay.
-I'm locked in the toilet.

403
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,230
Today can't be a good day.

404
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,480
What are you doing, Mr Duan?

405
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,030
-Yu Shi, calm down.
-I'm listening.

406
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,960
-Okay.
-It's time to open your heart.

407
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,900
Come on.

408
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,070
Duan Ran.

409
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,930
Why is he locked inside?

410
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,140
The men's room?

411
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,750
Can't unlock it?

412
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,410
You can try.

413
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,310
I'll do it. Step aside.

414
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,850
Is that you, Ms Qian?

415
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,660
I'm here to save you, Yu Shi.

416
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,210
Ms Qian.

417
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,360
Ms Qian.

418
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,200
Even Mr Duan couldn't unlock it.

419
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,250
Are you all right?

420
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,630
I'm not at all.

421
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,430
I'm giving up.

422
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,910
Just calm down.

423
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,460
Any idea, Duan Ran?

424
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,950
I would have already
unlocked it if I could.

425
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,210
Just calm down.

426
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,960
We'll come up with something.

427
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,650
What's going on?

428
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,580
Su Su is here.

429
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,910
You need to queue up.

430
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,230
I'm queuing up.

431
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,140
This is the men's room.

432
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,630
I'm keeping him company.

433
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,070
Stop hiding from me. I already know it.

434
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,020
I saw the light sign this morning.

435
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,730
We wanted to give you a
surprise, but never expect

436
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,400
this mishap could happen.

437
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,700
Let me talk to him.

438
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,000
Go ahead.

439
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,040
Yu Shi.

440
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,750
Su Su.

441
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,300
Is that you?

442
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,500
-Yes.
-Getting emotional.

443
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,730
You're here, too.

444
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,340
I'm going to die of embarrassment.

445
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,480
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm sorry.

447
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,860
Are you feeling sorry for not
having the guts to confess to me,

448
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,590
or being so stupid to
lock yourself in the toilet?

449
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,760
You already knew it.

450
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,590
I'm truly sorry.

451
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,050
I wanted to give you a surprise.

452
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,520
I just couldn't figure it out

453
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,550
why the toilet locked me inside.

454
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,230
It's so embarrassing.

455
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,610
I'm sorry, Su Su.

456
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,090
It was my fault.

457
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,080
I've prepared a speech.

458
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,260
I've included something
good about you in it.

459
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,590
And everyone else helped
me with famous quotes

460
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,920
which they downloaded from the internet.

461
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,200
But I can't remember a word now.

462
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,660
Su Su.

463
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,330
I really

464
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,790
like you, Su Su.

465
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,440
I like you, Su Su.

466
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,080
I know.

467
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,620
In my current situation,

468
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,000
I don't meet

469
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,130
the criteria you've set for me.

470
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,890
But I'll work hard, Su Su.

471
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,800
I'll do my best.

472
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,320
I'll turn myself into the man

473
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,650
you want me to be.

474
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,200
What?

475
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,370
Will you be my girlfriend?

476
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,730
He did it.

477
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,440
Think about it.

478
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,960
Listen, Yu Shi.

479
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,160
You may be timid

480
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,270
and kind of dumb.

481
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,490
And possess many undesirable traits.

482
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,000
However,

483
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,630
I'm willing to be your girlfriend.

484
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,700
It's done.

485
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,110
What did you say?

486
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,830
I said I'm willing to be your girlfriend.

487
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,080
Are you just kidding with me?

488
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,580
Even if you're just kidding,

489
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,020
I'm more than willing to accept it.

490
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,670
-Love.
-It's successful.

491
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,780
This is love.

492
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,710
He actually confessed through a toilet.

493
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,310
-This is the power of love.
-It's done without facing each other.

494
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,860
So romantic.

495
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,140
Let's get him out quickly,
so he can see her.

496
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,470
I'm happy even if
you lock me here forever.

497
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,560
-I'll go look for help.
-Are you fool?

498
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,190
Calm down, Yu Shi.

499
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,020
Help is on the way.

500
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,340
I'll just wait.

501
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,490
I'm cool.

502
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,680
I'm fine.

503
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,210
Ms Zhang.

504
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,450
You're Chen Lang's assistant, right?

505
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,340
That's right.

506
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,600
What do you want?

507
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,100
I've something to tell you.

508
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,550
I've kept this for long.

509
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,830
There's something I want to clarify.

510
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,970
He didn't mix the leftover
stock with imitation goods.

511
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,700
It was me who did it,
on the order of my secret boss.

512
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,170
Chen Lang asked you to come?

513
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,110
He didn't know I came here.

514
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,300
He's very bad lately.

515
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,360
He's in a bad mood and
locks himself in his office.

516
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,250
He's completely isolated
from everyone else.

517
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,660
I've been with him for so many years.

518
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,320
I'm really worried about him.

519
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,750
Can you visit him if you’re free?

520
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,360
It’s almost the New Year
and everyone's busy.

521
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,070
I really don't have time.

522
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,570
It was all my fault. Don't blame Mr Chen.

523
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,010
I'm sorry.

524
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,150
Ms Zhang.

525
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,140
Today

526
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,210
is a happy day

527
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,150
and a day we should celebrate.

528
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,420
First of all,
today is our company's annual

529
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,040
Weiya Red Packet Event.

530
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,890
Do you know what these are?

531
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,330
Red packets.

532
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,470
These are the clinking red packets.

533
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,680
Everyone will get one of these.

534
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,860
There's another thing we should celebrate.

535
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,940
The two of them.

536
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,360
Yes, we're talking about you both.

537
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,180
Today we celebrate Yu Shi's

538
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,240
successful confession!

539
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,860
Let's congratulate them on
their sweet and long-lasting love.

540
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,370
Let's wish them a sweet
and long-lasting love.

541
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,570
And I also appreciate their
contribution to the company.

542
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,940
Thanks, Ms Qian.

543
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,130
For you, Su Su.

544
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,830
You really worked hard, Su Su.

545
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,410
-Thanks.
-It's my job.

546
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,880
-It isn't easy for you.
-It's okay.

547
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,980
Keep up the good work.

548
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,960
-For you.
-Thanks, Ms Qian.

549
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,710
You'll get one, too, Mr Five.

550
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,470
Here's yours.

551
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,650
Thanks, Xi Xi.

552
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,710
You did well this year. Keep it up.

553
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,780
-Boss.
-What's it?

554
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,160
Aren't you from the same family?

555
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,090
Each family shall
only have a red packet.

556
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,360
I want a red packet.

557
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,630
Hey.

558
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,030
Thanks for your generosity, boss.

559
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,040
Don't be smug.

560
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,310
We must use the money wisely.

561
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,720
Save it for your mum's medical expenses.

562
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,090
Then you shall keep it.

563
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,190
Okay.

564
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Keep it up for next year.

565
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,830
You're awesome this year.

566
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,370
Thanks, boss.

567
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,240
-Thanks, boss.
-Wait for your turn.

568
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,100
Where's Jia Yun?

569
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,540
-Jia Yun.
-Jia Yun.

570
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,340
-No idea.
-She left after answering a call.

571
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,270
Doesn't she want this?

572
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,610
Just give it to me.

573
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,790
-I'll keep it for her.
-You're the boss.

574
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,610
-I appreciate your hard work.
-Thanks.

575
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,110
Everyone else gets one.

576
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,300
-So many.
-Aren't these for me?

577
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,100
-Not for you.
-I just want it all.

578
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,320
-These are for everyone.
-Stop being bossy.

579
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,230
-Return them to me.
-They're mine.

580
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,660
Stop it.

581
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,920
He's taken all of them.

582
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,100
Watch him, Yu Shi.

583
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,770
Don't try to run away.

584
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,820
[B2, Live for You, Cloud Live]

585
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,210
Chen Lang.

586
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,270
You're still sleeping during the day.

587
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,930
Never expect you would come.

588
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,950
Help me carry these.

589
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,080
What are those?

590
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,100
They're heavy.

591
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,530
What have you brought?

592
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,290
My hands are now red.

593
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,240
Are you all right?

594
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,290
What are these?

595
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,420
Bamboo shoots?

596
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,650
You just came back from hometown?

597
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,790
Last time I went back,

598
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,880
didn't you refuse to
give your mum your address?

599
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,140
So she got mine instead

600
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,920
and sent me lots of delicious goodies.

601
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,980
She's wanted you to have a share, too.

602
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,810
That's why I never
give my mum this address.

603
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,170
Didn't expect she'd send them to you.

604
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,240
Thanks.

605
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,270
It's nothing.

606
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,450
The bamboo shoots

607
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,270
are best for hot pot.

608
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,470
I also bought lots of meat and vegetables.

609
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,260
Let's have hot pot today.

610
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,760
Oh my.

611
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,590
Sure.

612
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,860
The door was open when I came in.

613
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,290
What if the thieves sneaked in?

614
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,430
What's there to steal?

615
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,750
I have nothing now.

616
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,910
Except for my body, if they want it.

617
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,810
Not bad, you still could joke.

618
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,790
I didn't bring a pot.

619
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,190
Do you have one?

620
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,670
I may have one in the kitchen.

621
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,690
Okay.

622
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,710
Make yourself at home.

623
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,080
Why do you think

624
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,160
we left our depressing hometowns

625
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,610
for the big city?

626
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,030
It's to make money

627
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,160
and make our folks

628
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,850
and ourselves proud.

629
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,390
And to retire in style.

630
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,910
No wonder you'd rather stay here

631
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,130
during the festival

632
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,550
than to go back.

633
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,870
I wish to be back, too.

634
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,370
See what I've done to my company.

635
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,340
It's now ruined beyond repair.

636
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,890
I won't be able to face them.

637
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,810
On the contrary.

638
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,070
Your family is still proud
of you no matter what.

639
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,800
That's even a more valid
reason for me not to do so.

640
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,880
I think you're totally wrong.

641
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,850
You were able to pull yourself up

642
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,150
by your bootstraps.

643
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,030
That's already an amazing feat.

644
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,970
After visiting your home,

645
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,440
I'm now able to find out
who you really are.

646
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,600
I saw your childhood and
your track of growing up.

647
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,200
I had the very first attempt to understand

648
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,960
your desire for success.

649
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,820
You're carrying too many
missions on your shoulders.

650
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,130
That's why

651
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,350
your pressure got increasingly huge.

652
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,270
How's your grad school application?

653
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,270
So-so, I guess.

654
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,660
Anyway, the processes are complicated.

655
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,990
We'll see.

656
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,650
No rush.

657
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,410
Here.

658
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,570
Your mum wants you to have this.

659
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,750
My mum dug this bamboo
shoot with her own hands.

660
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,790
And you put it in my bowl.

661
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,200
This is so delicious.

662
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,140
So

663
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,020
you should visit her more often.

664
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,340
Anyway, the old folks won't
have much material needs.

665
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,500
What about you?

666
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,910
You hardly go back to hometown, too.

667
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,340
Tell me.

668
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,990
Just tell me honestly.

669
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,820
You love me all along, don't you?

670
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,230
That's why you're here.

671
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,250
Stop being smug.

672
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,810
I'm only here to deliver
your mum's bamboo shoots.

673
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,060
Like I said, they go bad quickly.

674
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,130
I see.

675
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,120
You usually make acquaintance

676
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,690
with the rich and powerful.

677
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,460
You'd never visit a small fry like me,

678
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,060
especially now that I've hit rock bottom.

679
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,580
I'm not that kind of person.

680
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,219
I only make friends with people

681
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,199
that deserve my friendship.

682
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,610
I must thank my mum.

683
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,429
Otherwise, I won't get
to have this hot pot today.

684
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,429
I think

685
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,570
your folks haven't had an easy life.

686
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,420
They'll surely miss you.

687
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,280
Just give them a call when you're free.

688
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,000
Why do you think I strive so hard?

689
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,489
I just want a better life.

690
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,800
I'm building a foundation
for my future family.

691
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,350
And to give my folks a comfortable life.

692
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,730
Our industry.

693
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,230
The e-commerce industry.

694
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,350
Today we may have the edge.

695
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,930
Who knows

696
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,700
what will happen tomorrow?

697
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,060
As a new wave rises, an old wave falls,

698
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,160
crashing on the beach.

699
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,950
I'm like the old wave, dying in the sand.

700
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,500
I think this is the
best thing about mankind.

701
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,830
You see, one wave succeeds another.

702
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,390
Each generation has its innovations.

703
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,340
We continue to advance
and evolve this way.

704
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,380
For me,

705
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,500
I believe the best always survives.

706
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,980
It's all about the
survival of the fittest.

707
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,660
I think it's the opposite.

708
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,790
I wonder why humankind is
divided into different classes?

709
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,970
That's why

710
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,300
there are so many wars and disasters.

711
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,440
Why can't we all

712
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,720
get along and prosper together?

713
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,200
Do you agree?

714
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,740
I like your kindness

715
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,980
but it's too idealistic.

716
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,790
People like us are beaten up by life.

717
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,630
I shudder to think about it.

718
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,720
Actually, I didn't say this.

719
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,910
I heard this from a friend.

720
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,960
And he said it better than me.

721
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,250
Really? What did he say?

722
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,650
This is what he said.

723
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,200
In this world,

724
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,860
everyone is like a rabbit.

725
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,420
Some are black while the others are white.

726
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,250
However, when the black rabbit
runs, the white rabbit must run, too.

727
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,930
We're using our gifts

728
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,280
to make it in our lives.

729
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,410
So there's no such thing as
the survival of the fittest.

730
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,130
I like this statement.

731
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,250
This person should be quite interesting.

732
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,300
Then do you want to see him?

733
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,270
Today?

734
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,540
Sure.

735
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,880
I suggest

736
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,300
-we have a toast.
-Sure.

737
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,630
I'm drinking water instead of wine today.

738
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,100
Only water for you.

739
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,640
I wish you all in the new year,

740
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,530
health and good luck.

741
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,600
Work harder for a successful career.

742
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,280
-Thanks Uncle Duan.
-Here's to it.

743
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,860
Happy new year.

744
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,000
-Xi Xi.
-Happy new year, Aunt Zhou.

745
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,860
-Happy new year.
-Happy new year, Duan Ran.

746
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,320
Shen.

747
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,740
Thanks for everything.

748
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,080
I know you like fish.

749
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,230
So I specially ordered a fish for you.

750
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,240
Aren't you too kind to me, Sister Zhou?

751
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,960
Xi Xi and Ran Ran absolutely
had a challenging time previously.

752
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,150
Please help yourselves.

753
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,560
It's okay.

754
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,910
Don't worry. We'll take care of ourselves.

755
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,080
He usually eats a lot.

756
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,180
He'll have rice and noodles.

757
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,460
He likes rice so much.

758
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,920
Just don't worry about us.

759
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,460
Xi Xi.

760
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,730
You've only been CEO for a year,

761
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,650
and you've gotten so thin.

762
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,100
I got thinner?

763
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,040
-I think so.
-Really?

764
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,090
No, Dad.

765
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,320
She was never fat.

766
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,470
I think she's malnourished.

767
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,600
My figure is perfect, okay?

768
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,010
Young people these days have it tough.

769
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,380
I've seen it all.

770
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,430
By the way, the rascal

771
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,540
has lost weight. You'll see.

772
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,940
-He's back?
-Ding Ding is back?

773
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,490
He suffers

774
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,720
from jet lag.

775
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,670
He couldn't wait to see Ran Ran and Xi Xi.

776
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Looks like he's now a changed person.

777
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,380
Didn't expect he'd take
the initiative to meet us.

778
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,410
Ding Ding.

779
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,100
You've become thinner.

780
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,920
Hello, everyone.

781
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,060
-Dad.
-You look handsome.

782
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,220
Your hairstyle is really nice.

783
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,340
Help yourself, Ding Ding.

784
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,700
Shouldn't you inform us

785
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,150
that you're back?

786
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,040
Well,

787
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,500
you should have at least

788
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,910
informed us, right?

789
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,740
What? Are we not important enough?

790
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,180
I think so.

791
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,680
That must be it.

792
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,510
Look at Ding Ding.

793
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,130
Now he's just like Ran Ran

794
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,250
when he returned from overseas then.

795
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,830
You like the local food better, right?

796
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,340
I don't think he's become thinner.

797
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,180
Mind your words.

798
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,030
You two always bullied Ding Ding
when you were kids.

799
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,010
Now you've grown up and yet
you're still doing the same thing.

800
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,880
No, we didn't. Have some more.

801
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,120
Don't mind them, Ding Ding. Eat up.

802
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,420
I'm done.

803
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,300
Are you kidding?

804
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,170
Eat some more.

805
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,670
You could use more weight.

806
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,120
That's enough.

807
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,550
Say,

808
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,960
Chubby Ding.

809
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,710
You've been a finance guy in the UK
for quite a while now.

810
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,500
You must've made a lot of money.

811
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,720
You should have visited
the Chinese restaurants

812
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,210
in Chinatown more often.

813
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,770
His little deals are nothing

814
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,660
compared to Duan Ran's business.

815
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,670
and Xi Xi.

816
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,180
You're too humble.

817
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,240
I heard

818
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,190
Ding Ding set up an
investment company overseas.

819
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,350
How can we even compare?

820
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,880
Meanwhile, we have to work so hard
to solicit funding

821
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,140
unlike this genius.

822
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,460
Is that so?

823
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,560
Don't you have QE Group to back you?

824
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,200
Why do you need to solicit funding?

825
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,120
So dishonest.

826
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,700
Who'd invest in you?

827
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,430
Xi Xi is trying to be modest.

828
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,970
Can't you tell?

829
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,560
He still lacks experience.

830
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,280
Where are you taking me?

831
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,410
Who are we seeing?

832
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,940
You'll know when we reach.

833
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,030
Just trust me.

834
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,880
I've always trusted you.

835
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,390
What kind of setup is this?

836
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,350
Why are there four sets of tableware?

837
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,670
How many of them?

838
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,700
The couple is having a meal here.

839
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,720
I've invited them to
come after their meal.

840
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,950
A couple?

841
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,070
It's unexpected.

842
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,690
Jia Yun.

843
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,270
You're here.

844
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,760
-We're late.
-It's okay.

845
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,660
We've some snacks and tea here.

846
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,340
-Jia Yun.
-Please take a seat.

847
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,540
-Chen Lang.
-Mr Duan.

848
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,610
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

849
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,940
Take a seat.

850
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,680
Jia Yun has arranged today's meeting,

851
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,610
I thought I'm going to see Duan Ran.

852
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,430
I didn't expect it to be you two.

853
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,180
Why?

854
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,020
Is seeing me making you uncomfortable?

855
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,140
Not at all.

856
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,670
I'm flattered.

857
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,080
I'm just flattered.

858
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,550
Well, I actually have an
appointment with a couple of friends

859
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,690
next door.

860
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,920
I'm going over to meet them.

861
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,250
Please excuse me.

862
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,570
Let me walk you to the door.

863
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,150
No, I'm fine.

864
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,660
Bye.

865
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,020
-Thanks for coming.
-Bye, Jia Yun.

866
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,120
Okay.

867
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,690
What's going on with you?

868
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,290
You should have informed me
when you invited Mr Duan Sr.

869
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,000
I feel guilty meeting them.

870
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,220
It's so embarrassing.

871
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,820
No matter what, we're already here.

872
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,550
Stop muttering in front of me.

873
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,080
Let's sit down and chat.

874
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,220
Mr Duan, I heard

875
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,050
that you fainted during the negotiation.

876
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,770
How are you now?

877
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,210
It's just an old bug.

878
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,790
I'm quite used to it.

879
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,150
Chen Lang.

880
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,330
If I'm right,

881
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,240
after the Sanya incident,

882
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,630
this is our second meeting, right?

883
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,540
Mr Duan,

884
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,200
actually I don't deserve to meet you.

885
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,420
I understand.

886
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,360
I've done some pretty bad things.

887
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,610
I'm a real jerk.

888
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:15,870
It takes time

889
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,950
to become a jerk, and it takes time

890
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,410
to turn over a new leaf.

891
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,510
Even if I'm remorseful,

892
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,850
I can't redeem myself.

893
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,790
Don't be so hasty to draw conclusions.

894
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,050
In this world,

895
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,400
there's always a chance for redemption.

896
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,790
First of all,

897
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,860
let me dispel your

898
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,670
misunderstanding about us.

899
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,280
You, Ran Ran and Xi Xi.

900
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,260
To me, you three

901
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,240
are like my children.
