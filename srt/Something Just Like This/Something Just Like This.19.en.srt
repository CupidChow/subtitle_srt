4
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,260
You broke up with me.

5
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,370
And you didn't even inform me.

6
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,810
How could you do this?

7
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,970
It's unacceptable.

8
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,490
Well...

9
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,120
Too bad he doesn't appreciate you.

10
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,610
You fall short of his expectations.

11
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,100
Did you purposely did it
for our meeting today?

12
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,970
Yes, if you say so.

13
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,320
I...

14
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,690
I still want to drink.

15
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,080
I had enough of it.

16
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,250
What am I supposed to do now?

17
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,940
Stop the fuss. Go home

18
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,450
when your ride comes.

19
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,930
I can barely hold up.

20
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,240
Do you think the workflow is fine?

21
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,410
It's all fine.

22
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,930
Did you have a good time yesterday?

23
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,400
I haven't had a good time for so long.

24
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,079
Jiang Jin Suo.

25
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,350
There's something

26
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,760
that I want to tell you.

27
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,960
What's that?

28
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,730
We were hugging each other
while singing and dancing

29
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,220
at the music performance yesterday night.

30
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,570
I wasn't drunk then.

31
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,600
I know you were just pretending.

32
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,240
Was my acting that bad?

33
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,840
There's a reason for that.

34
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,730
I wanted us to look intimate.

35
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,730
Intimate?

36
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,930
That's all I wanted.

37
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,930
I was just merely using you.

38
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,120
You had a motive.

39
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,650
That was a good meal.

40
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,170
You're finally here.

41
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,260
This is my best friend, Li Mi.

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,140
She's also the producer and host

43

You're my favorite host.

Something's on?

53

We need to talk.

54

You're totally back to normal.

61
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,560
You didn't drink much, did you?

62
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,220
We stayed out late last night, remember?

63
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,880
I can't stay up late nowadays.

64
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,500
You drank a lot.

65
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,410
You talked so much
that you made me nervous.

66
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,000
What have I said?

67
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,810
Didn't you remember at all?

68
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,920
I mean...

69
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,450
I have totally forgotten
everything after getting drunk.

70
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,500
Is it that serious?

71

you to inspect the site.

I won't remember even if you did.

80

Just get going.

81

I had a temporary memory loss.

86
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,370
Do you think I'm impractical,

87
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,690
a nuisance?

88
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
No.

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,300
if you decline my offer.

175
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,240
I will waste no time on you.

176
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,800
I can provide you with more resources

177
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,280
than your company could give.

178
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,170
Now I have big funds backing me up.

179
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,610
I think you need me.

180
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,760
One more thing.

181
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Even if you've decided to join us,

182
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,320
you won't be joining immediately.

183
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,290
Does that mean

184
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,290
that you want me to be your spy?

185
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,990
Don't worry.

186
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,700
You won't violate the law.

187
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,530
It won't affect your future.

188
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,560
You'll be one of us on the day Rui falls.

189
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,490
I'll invest everything on you.

190
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
You'll become our top broadcaster.

191
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,170
Is that a deal?

192
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,640
It's a deal.

193
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,220
I prefer having an equitable trade

194
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,850
to being promised the stars.

195
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,650
It's confirmed then.

196
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,340
Now that you're here,

197
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,950
would you like to take a look

198
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,210
at our new facilities?

199
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,800
They're better than Rui's.

200
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,660
This can wait until I join.

201
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,140
I want a red carpet welcome.

202
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,240
I'm leaving now.

203
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,410
One more thing.

204
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,250
Since now I'm your spy,

205
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,340
let's not meet here,

206
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,850
so as not to raise doubts.

207
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,800
Silly kid.

208
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,650
It's blinking again.

209
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,870
[Shapowei Art Zone, Art, Life, Live]

210
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,490
I've done the math, Mr Duan.

211
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,510
We've sourced a huge number
of products for Yuan Yuan.

212
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,250
There are ten big products

213
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,660
and 81 small products.

214
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,210
There are different varieties of products.

215
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,900
There's a positive effect

216
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,490
from her last variety show.

217
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,010
Lots of brand owners

218
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,900
are now keen to work with us.

219
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,800
That's why we have a mountain of products.

220
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,090
This is our chance.

221
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,540
We have to make good use

222
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,900
of her popularity

223
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,660
from the piano performance

224
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,690
and make her

225
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,760
our head broadcaster.

226
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,360
I have a little doubt.

227
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,210
I agree with Ms Qian's concerns.

228
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,590
Warren Buffett said

229
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,220
never put all the eggs in one basket.

230
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,780
We have several good broadcasters here.

231
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,610
Jia Yun, Mr Five and even Ms Qian

232
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,690
are all good broadcasters.

233
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,540
Is is worthwhile to put

234
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,960
all our resources just on Yuan Yuan alone?

235
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,450
Do you know

236
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,760
that a leader always thinks differently?

237
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,730
The leader has to know his team well.

238
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,290
Let me just tell you.

239
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,300
Xi Xi is the CEO,

240
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,810
so she shouldn't be a top broadcaster,

241
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,000
right?

242
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,680
As for Jia Yun,

243
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,850
her mind is always wandering around.

244
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,180
She's not ambitious.

245
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,830
She's just happy-go-lucky.

246
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,010
I can't force her on this.

247
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,210
It'll make matters worse

248
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,090
if I force her to do it.

249
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,880
And now Yuan Yuan.

250
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,410
Let me say this.

251
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,360
Yuan Yuan is a career woman.

252
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,040
She's climbing the ladder of success.

253
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,540
The more we push her,

254
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,580
the more she advances.

255
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,510
We're giving her the opportunity
and resources to succeed.

256
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,270
She'll even be more loyal to company

257
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,490
because of this.

258
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,360
I didn't think that much.

259
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,870
Su Su.

260
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,650
Come over here.

261
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,000
Over here.

262
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,810
Don't take my lunch box.

263
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,300
I haven't had breakfast.

264
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,870
I'm not taking your lunch box.

265
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,660
About the matter yesterday.

266
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,970
Any news?

267
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,570
That one?

268
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,140
I've checked the account.

269
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,020
The account belongs to Chen Lang.

270
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,320
I've made a report.

271
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,850
Don't let Ms Qian know about this.

272
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,530
It's too late.

273
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,810
She knew about it.

274
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,440
I've told her all about it.

275
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,680
And now she's here.

276
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,610
Duan Ran.

277
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,650
I'm looking for you.

278
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,810
What's going on with her?

279
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,210
Aren't you going to grab her lunch box?

280
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,610
Why should I do that?

281
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,800
Aren't you?

282
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,910
Have you ordered a takeaway?

283
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,900
Today we're vying for spots

284
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,750
on the Talent Chart from noon
to midnight.

285
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,730
Each person will need three meals.

286
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,220
Yes. It's your job.

287
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,579
Let me handle this.

288
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,770
Just go.

289
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,930
It'll be a busy day.

290
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,250
I'll get down to work.

291
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,440
Wait.

292
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,970
Tell me something.

293
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,079
What's that?

294
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,890
About Yuan Yuan's anti-fan incident,

295
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,329
any idea who did it?

296
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,680
I think it was Chen Lang.

297
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,210
Just cool it.

298
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,560
It's normal for this to happen.

299
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,730
Not one but two anti-fans.

300
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,580
Usually when this happens,

301
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,270
Su Su will resolve it quickly.

302
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,630
Yuan Yuan has a big fan base.

303
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,910
If there are hundreds or even

304
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,180
thousands of them,

305
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,600
it'll become a handful.

306
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,770
Then what?

307
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,970
How is that possible?

308
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,660
You must have faith.

309
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,140
Most people are good in the world.

310
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,550
You'll get what you want

311
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,250
only if you trust the world.

312
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,700
Don't worry.

313
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,220
It's easy just for you to say.

314
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,320
Just tell me what to do.

315
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,160
-If something bad...
-Xi Xi.

316
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,610
Dad.

317
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
-Uncle Qian.
-What brings you here?

318
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,370
Your dad made you lunch.

319
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,970
Hold it right there.

320
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,730
Our discussion isn't over yet.

321
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,040
I'm listening.

322
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,920
Just a moment, Dad.

323
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,010
From this month on,

324
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,660
the monthly results shall be included

325
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,760
in the Singles' Day's results.

326
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,490
What should we do,

327
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,680
if something bad happens?

328
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,420
I've told you.

329
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,420
Never put

330
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,150
all resources on Yuan Yuan alone.

331
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,490
I've said it many times.

332
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,370
You're right.

333
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,090
What if it happens?

334
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,780
Stop worrying anymore.

335
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,090
where there's a will, there's a way.

336
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,610
Then our company

337
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,670
will finally have a head broadcaster.

338
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,700
Calm down.

339
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,820
Your dad is waiting.

340
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,090
Just move it.

341
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,970
What nonsense were you talking about?

342
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,280
I'm coming.

343
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,540
-Dad.
-Xi Xi.

344
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,040
Did you have an argument?

345
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,800
No.

346
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,320
We had some disagreement over work.

347
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,030
Aren't you the decision maker

348
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,240
since you're the CEO?

349
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,610
Take a seat.

350
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,180
Why are you bringing me lunch again?

351
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,380
Isn't today the last day of the month?

352
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,640
I'm here to visit you and bring you lunch.

353
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,680
I'll take the lunch box.

354
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,490
Today will be a busy day.

355
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,980
I can't keep you company.

356
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,560
Don't worry about me.

357
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,210
Can I just stay

358
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,730
and see you work?

359
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,020
Sure.

360
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,030
I'll ask someone to keep you company.

361
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,320
I'm fine just by myself.

362
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,890
Okay.

363
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,360
Wait.

364
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,130
If anyone ask who you are,

365
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,160
tell them you're Qian Xi Xi's father,

366
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,150
-Let's go.
-Okay.

367
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,400
Sort the items by this colour.

368
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,800

369
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,200
Thanks.

370
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,130
It's too oily, try to eat less.

371
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,120
I need a full meal to keep
myself going until the evening.

372
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,730
Then eat as much as you can.

373
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,050
If not, I'll finish it.

374
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,320
It's your fault if I put on weight.

375
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,130
You

376
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,770
are in my care.

377
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,710
-Give her ample water.
-Sure.

378
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,090
Tighten the cover.

379
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,320
Sure.

380
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,100
Hello, babes. Nice to see you.

381
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,260
I'm Yuan Yuan.

382

It's now 12 noon.

383
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,950
I'm bringing you the live again.

384
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,610
Today's weather is just great.

385
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,770
There's blue sky out there.

386
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,330
So today I'm bringing you

387
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,700
a special live stream
for our monthly challenge.

388
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,250
Let's take a look at
the clothes I'm wearing.

389
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,720
The live is on?

390
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,620
[The skirt]

391
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,760
[has a length that covers your knee.]

392
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,920
[And there's...]

393
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,200
How's it going?

394
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,190
-It's just started.
[-The skirt isn't too simple.]

395

[It has a gradient colour.]

396
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,580
[-Look here.]
-Move over there.

397
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,450
[At the bottom edge of the skirt...]

398
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,580
What are you doing?

399
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,060
[It's center is white.]

400
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,150
[Then the upper...]

401
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,060
[Just remember, the clothes should not]

402
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,460
[have a combination of
more than three colours.]

403
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,260
[This is the fashion standard.]

404
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,400
[And the white...]

405
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,220
-Where're the numbers?
[-Take a look.]

406

[There's a slit.]

410
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,440
Yuan Yuan is killing it today.

411
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,410
Probably due to our previous
promotional efforts.

412
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,280
The video has a big influence on this.

413
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,210
The live streaming will be
running for 12 hours.

414
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,240
Hope she can take it.

415
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,020
Why don't you and Jia Yun replace her?

416
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,180
Let her take a break.

417
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,680
Have some snacks.

418
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,890
I have no problem with it.

419
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,490
You have total confidence in Yuan Yuan.

420
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,060
We shouldn’t worry about her.

421
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,330
You know nothing at all.

422
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,410
What's the most crucial thing
about today's challenge?

423
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,490
Tell me.

424
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,680
It's the products.

425
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,420
We spent a fortune

426
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,920
on a roomful of products.

427
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,730
Thanks to that promotional video,

428
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,580
we've managed to source

429
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,130
a huge variety of products

430
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,710
which are simply dazzling.

431
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,130
Now we don't have to worry
about sales.

432
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,370
Better start thinking about

433
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,640
how to write the quarterly report.

434
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,580
[This is the set of clothes]

In the afternoon, office wear
will be the focus.

business attire for women.

[Sure, Mr Duan.]

447

Do you like my combination of clothes?

450
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,510
It looks great.

451
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,300
And this skirt with the lace.

452
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,900
There's a tassel down there.

453
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,990
Doesn't it look great?

454
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,340
Looking at these clothes

455
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,610
I'm being dazzled by my attractiveness.

456
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,300
Are these catalogs for the live streaming?

457
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,460
Yes. Send one copy to Zhang Bin

and the control room, too.

459
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,820
Both Ms Qian and Mr Duan

460
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,040
could stay in the control room all day.

461
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,090
12 hours non-stop without any rest.

462

It's really tough.

463
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,900

513
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,010
Doesn't it look sweet?

514
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,330
Will the tight dress make
your backside look big?

515
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,710
Not at all, babes.

516
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,890
Take a whiff.

517
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,090
It's a super bargain.

518
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,770
I'll put it here.

519
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,550
Take a break.

520
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,920
You need a rest and some food.

521
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,620
I'll order a takeaway.

522
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,640
It's a tough battle today.

523
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,160
Duan Ran is well prepared for this.

524
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,640
He's going against us.

525
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,960
Yes, you're right.

526
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,230
He forgot one thing.

527
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,810
Although products are important,

528
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,760
the broadcaster is crucial, too.

529
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,920
Broadcaster?

530
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,890
Let me ask you something.

531
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,180
You've been with me for a while.

532
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,170
So tell me,

533
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,390
what are the two most important
traits of a broadcaster?

534
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,880
I don't know.

535
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,710
Haven't you learned anything?

536
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,380
Let me tell you.

537
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,600
Just remember this.

538
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,040
"Protect" and "public persona".

539
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,230
Yuan Yuan's public persona

540
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,330
accounted for

541
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,680
70 percent of the company's sales.

542
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,130
So the best sales tactics

543
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,520
is customer-oriented.

544
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,040
I'm still worried.

545
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,960
Yuan Yuan once stopped working.

546
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,170
This has a huge effect

547
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,860
on her audience and fan base.

548
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,760
Don't worry.

549
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,710
The problem with Rui is

550
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
their broadcasters are too pretty.

551
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,310
This will create a
distance between people.

552
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,300
We're e-commerce, not entertainment

553
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,800
live streaming.

554
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,190
We make profit by selling products.

555
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,830
Xiao Xiao is different.

556
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,590
She's not good looking,

557
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,610
but not too bad either.

558
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,010
She's just normal.

559
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,160
That is likability.

560
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,050
She's highly approachable

561
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,540
to anyone from young people

562
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,160
to elderly folks.

563
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,890
Do you know what's this?

564
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,040
This is down to earth.

565
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,760
They have many product discounts.

566
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,960
Xiao Xiao's numbers are increasing.

567
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,440
What about us?

568
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,200
Nothing changes.

569
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,130
Zhang Bin.

570
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,160
You may speak.

571
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,640

573
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,370
I'm recommending this suit of clothes

574
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,120
and it's a super bargain.

575
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,120
Today is our monthly challenge.

576
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,070
You may be asking for free gifts,

577
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,830
or coupons.

578
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,410
[Coupons are too normal.]

579
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,540

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,430
Thanks, babes.

585
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,030
[Is that the latest style?]

586
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,920
This is the blouse

587
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,160
[You have my support!]

588
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,280
and this is how it looks.

589
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,930
[Any recommendations for shoes?]

590
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,760
There are two straps over here.

591
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,400
It's really chic.

592
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,340
[Xiao Xiao (orange), Yuan Yuan (blue)]

593
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,640
Jiang Zhe Yang's name is so effective.

594
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,180
Now the online volume

595
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,760
is even greater than
the last live stream.

596
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,160
The blouse looks like this.

597
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,860
The half-circle skirt has a laced design.

598
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,130
It's like a mesh skirt.

599
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,520
You'll get a small leather belt for free.

600

Ms Qian.

601
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,070
Are you happy with her performance?

602
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,430
She does well.

603
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,490
The round is going to end soon.

604
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
The real battle hasn't started yet.

605
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,330
Why don't you go replace her?

606
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,710
Let her take a break.

607
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,040
Okay, I'll do it.

608
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,110
-Good luck.
-Xi Xi.

609
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,760
You should eat something.

610
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,190
When were you here?

611
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,920
I think you better get down to work first.

612
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,210
She hasn't eaten yet.

613
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,430
We usually don't eat on time
during a live streaming.

614
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,120
I'll eat after finishing my job now.

615
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,180
It'll become cold.

616
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,070
I don't feel like eating yet, Dad.

617
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,330
Babes, I need to take a break.

618
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,880
I'll be back very soon.

619
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,930
I'll go get something to eat.

620
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,190
I'll see you all in a short while.

621

Don't leave yet and wait for me.

622
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,000
Great job.

623
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,370
Now it's five o'clock.

624
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,420
I'll rest for an hour.

625
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,580
The next one hour

626
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,570
is all yours.

627
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,800
Just leave it to us.

Today you did really well.

You were simply awesome.

630
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,180
A little reward for you.

631
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,920
A bowl of soup from my dad.

632
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,640
My goodness.

633
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,930
Uncle Qian is so kind.

634
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,810
I discovered this the other day.

635
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,250
Now I need a bowl of soup.

636
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,070
-Take a break.
-Then I...

637
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,480
Just go.

638
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,110
It's our turn.

639
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,160
I want the soup, too.

640
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,760
You can have it after this.

641
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,230
Hello, babes. We meet again.

642
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,830
Now we're going to show you

643
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,610
how to match outfits with your best friend

644
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,640
when going shopping.

645
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,430
Don't we look like sisters?

646
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,760
Oh, yes!

647
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,210
For the next one hour,

648
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,400
Qian Xi Xi and I will bring you...

649
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,430
Just eat as much as you like.

650
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,810
Today's a battle.

651
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,800
You and Yuan Yuan are equally matched

652
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,510
in terms of skills and equipment
as well as other resources.

653
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,010
The next round is all about stamina.

654
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,110
And oral skills.

655
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,160
Whoever has the advantage
on these shall win.

656
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,490
Yuan Yuan and I are aiming

657
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,660
for the 28th and 29th spots

658
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,120
on the Talent Chart.

659
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,540
It's not too ambitious.

660
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,700
But anything can happen in this bracket.

661
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,670
You could drop out of
top 30 just like that.

662
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,640
I know.

663
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,580
You just do your job and not to worry.

664
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,370
I have several back up plans.

665
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,800
-Sure.
-You'll know when the time comes.

Duan Ran.

667
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,120
Our battle

668
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,830
starts from this moment.

669
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,400
Thanks.

670
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,520
-Do you still want this?
-Someone hasn't eaten yet.

671
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,000
Thanks.

672
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,010
Wait for me.

673
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,410
How is it?

674
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,640
You're back.

675
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,310
Not bad. The numbers are pretty stable.

676
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,970
You need to eat.

677
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,250
Let's eat.

678
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,430
There you go.

679
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,860
-Thanks, Uncle Qian.
-Yours.

680
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,960
What's this?

681
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,830
Didn't you say you'll
bring something nice?

682
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,180
I know you dislike this.

683
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,420
I didn't make this.
It's your takeaway order.

684
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,160
Here's the soup.

685
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,430
I want the soup.

686
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,000
It's delicious.

687
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,010
Hello, babes.
You must be waiting for me.

688
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,090
I'm back.

689
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,500
[Hello, babes. I'm back.]

690
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,920
[Today there are lots of discounts]

691
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,770
for everyone.

692
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,530
Take a look at this.

693
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,800
Do you like the shoes

694
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,430
I'm wearing?

695
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,700
I'll let everyone to guess

696
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,850
its advantages.

697
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,530
I want you to put them on the screen.

698
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,000
Someone asked me

699
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,640
if the high heels can increase her height.

700
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,340
Are you teasing me, babe?

701
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,630
All high heels can increase your height.

702
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,180
[Stay away from Jiang Zhe Yang,
you evil girl!]

703
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,310
It's bad.

704
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,210
The anti-fans have appeared.

705
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,670
The anti-fans have appeared.

706
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,270
[Stay away from my Yang Yang!
You're really sinister.]

707
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,420
I've never seen these accounts before.

708
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,790
[Who wants to unfollow, too?]

709
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,780
[I'm disgusted with you! Unfollowed!]

710
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,590
[What will happen next? We'll see.]

711
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,760
[Who's unfollowing?]

712
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,850
[What a shameless girl.]

713
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,179
It's moving too fast.

714
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,830
I can't read the comments.

715
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,270
There are too many people.

716
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,420
Must be all the internet ghostwriters.

717
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,489
If I continue to hide their comments,

718
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,179
my administrator's rights
will be suspended.

719
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,350
Hide them.

720
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,760
What...

721
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,400
I just said it,

722
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,140
and now it's suspended.

723
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,040
Did I tell you

724
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,520
not to rely on Yuan Yuan alone?

725
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,010
This is Chen Lang's work.

726
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,640
He's trying to sabotage us.

727
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,070
His target is not only Yuan Yuan

728
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,820
but our company as well.

729
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,090
Can't you see?

730
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,480
Just calm down.

731
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,900
Don't blame it all on me.

732
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,820
In just a moment,

733
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,900
how many viewers and fans that we lost?

734
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,510
Don't worry.

735
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,810
-We're not dead.
-No!

736
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,120
Isn't this damaging enough?

737
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,090
Stop worrying.

738
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,690
Just finish your soup.

739
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,040
Are you crazy?

740
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,040
Wake up!

741
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,160
-Cool it.
-Are you nuts?

742
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,190
Xi Xi.

743
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,080
What's Yuan Yuan doing?

744
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,550
She's sitting down.

745
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:31,130
Since everyone is so interested
in my scandal,

746
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,480
I'll spend some time today

747
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,520
to set the record straight.

748
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,710
Have you notice that I call you

749
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,210
a different name?

750
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,760
I usually call you "babes"

751
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,590
during the live streaming.

752
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,670
I prefer to call you "everyone"

753
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,990
in our daily chats.

754
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,160
If life is a river,

755
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,990
then I've been swimming upstream
all my life.

756
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,750
Why?

757
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,550
Lots of people live in the city.

758
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,440
Many of you may prefer

759
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,350
a simple life

760
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,990
and yearn for nature.

761
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,690
You don't know

762
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,850
the kind of life I had

763
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,520
when I was little.

764
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,000
I didn't like it one bit.

765
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,960
I don't aspire to live that way.

766
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,040
Why?

767
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,690
My family was poor at that time.

768
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,190
We would use plastic
sheets to cover the windows.

769
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,080
When it snowed,

770
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,520
we would huddle together for days
on the stove-bed.

771
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,400
Do you know what a stove-bed is?

772
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,960
Have you slept on one?

773
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,080
Only one side of it is warm.

774
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,030
Lying on it

775
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,530
feels as if your backside is burning.

776
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,090
Meanwhile, your face is exposed

777
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,440
to the freezing cold.

778
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,370
The anti-fans

779
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,280
are attracted by her story.

780
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,990
They're totally engrossed in her story.

781
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,480
I was pretty since I was a kid,

782
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,080
and I was tall, too.

783
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,350
So my grandma often nagged.

784
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,880
She always said,

785
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:40,000
if I was born into a better family,

786
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,310
she'd give me whatever I want.

787
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,250
I spent about 20 years

788
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,720
to try to understand the meaning
of this sentence until now.

789
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,810
Now I know

790
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,880
why I couldn't get what I wanted.

791
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,680
Later, I want to be an actress.

792
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,200
I got the first place

793
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,830
in the nation-wide art school examination.

794
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,440
I had reached the peak

795
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,800
of my life then.

796
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,840
Do you want to know how I was admitted?

797
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,470
For my middle school exam,

798
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,070
I was given a topic.

799
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,130
It was "The Tragedy of an Earthquake".

800
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,730
[Let me tell you.]

801
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,240
Go find Xiao Xiao,

802
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,320
tell her

803
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,820
to take this moment

804
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,900
to destroy her.

805
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,960
We must widen the gap.

806
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,590
Xiao Xiao.

807
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,470
The boss wants you to go all out.

808
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,440
Go find her now.

809
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,220
Tell her in person.

810
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,550
There were six of us.

811
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,600
[Some were crying.]

812
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,920
[Some were beating their chests.]

813
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,650
[Some cried until their
voices became hoarse.]

814
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,340
Do you know what I did?

815
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,350
I took off my shoes.

816
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,170
Sat on the ground.

817
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,930
I hugged my knees with my hands.

818
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,760
Just like this.

819
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,050
Getting number one got me nowhere.

820
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,350
I acted in many roles.

821
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,060
I jumped over mud ponds,

822
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,890
and got hit trains.

823
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,420
I even wore special effect makeup

824
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,390
for 48 hours straight.

825
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,800
That was the norm.

826
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,410
Have you experienced that?

827
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,380
Even though I tried so hard,

828
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,100
it was all in vain.

829
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,470
I have worked so hard.

830
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,960
But because of one scandal,
all my effort went down the drain.

831
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,230
When I was entertainment broadcaster,

832
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,000
I got to know a rich fan.

833
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,820
His wife wanted to divorce him,

834
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,510
and she wanted a share of his assets,

835
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,650
so I was framed for this.

836
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,300
Xi Xi, I didn't expect
Yuan Yuan had a bitter life.

837
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,690
My life story may sound

838
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,580
even more melodramatic
than a soap opera.

839
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,930
But this is my real life.

840
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,970
I underestimated Duan Ran.

841
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,210
Where did that come from?

842
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,170
That was so sudden.

843
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,130
That was definitely not impromptu.

844
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,070
She has studied acting after all.

845
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,180
Thanks for taking the time

846
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,730
to listen to my story.

847
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,010
My story was not really interesting.

848
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,060
It may disappoint you.

849
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,970
For those who choose to believe me,

850
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,370
please stay and continue
watching this live.

851
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,210
If you think I did well,

852
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,210
then please place more orders.

853
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,470
Trust in my recommendations.

854
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,890
Trust that I have your
best interests at heart.

855
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,880
Thank you, everyone.

856
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,110
I saw her twice before.

857
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,450
She kept to herself and played the piano.

858
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,630
She's good at storytelling.

859
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,450
She was trying to touch everyone's heart.

860
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,970
There are many anti-fans.

861
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,300
There's a saying,

862
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,600
"win the people's hearts,
and you conquer the land."

863
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,210
The same applies here.

864
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,730
Everything is different

865
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,900
on the internet.

866
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,800
Back in the days of infomercials,

867
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,060
no one had to do

868
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,230
this.

869
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,340
Times have changed.

870
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,860
This is the era of the internet.

871
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,660
Things are more unpredictable

872
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,790
but more interesting at the same time.
