00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,920
-Great.
-Thank you.

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,200
Mr Mu.

7
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:18,690
Your company is located
at such a good area.

8
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,690
Could I take a tour of your office?

9
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,320
With pleasure.

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,370
Good.

11
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,360
-Keep this, Ouyang.
-Okay.

12
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,039
Good.

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,420

15
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,770
Now you're a happy man, Mr Duan.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,560
For this,

17
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,500
I'd really like to thank you.

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,780
If not for you,

19
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,450
I'd never thought of a way

20
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,120
to deal with your boss.

21
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,680
Aren't you being overly humble?

22
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,000
You understand her needs well.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,720
So she was simply receptive to you.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,050
All I did was just giving
you a little hint.

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,280
Nothing else.

26
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,690
Now you're too humble.

27
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,590
You've given me a great help.

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,310
I'm just grateful to you.

29
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,160
Really?

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,120
Then treat me to a meal.

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,240
Yes, I must.

32
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,470
I'll book a place in another two days.

33
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,669
I just can't express my gratitude enough.

34
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,690
Two days are just too long.
I happen to be free today.

35
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,020
There's a restaurant nearly which I like.

36
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,079
Today I need to report back to company.

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,420
To your dear CEO?

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,390
She's my boss.

39
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,630
I'm just working for her.

40
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,000
I need to report to my superior

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,530
immediately after an
important deal is made.

42
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,970
It's fine then.

43
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,560
Let me just remind you

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,680
about Yang Yang's
upcoming live streaming.

45
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,170
I want you to check the workflow.

46
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,579
And I also need you to record a video

47
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,310
for each of your broadcasters.

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,400
You do the shortlisting first.

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,579
We'll do the confirmation together.

50
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,300
No problem. Leave it to me.

51
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,320
I'll ensure everything goes well.

52
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,560
Aren't you leaving now?

53
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,040
Too bad you don't have time for us.

54
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,880
Ms Qian.

55
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,520
What's with you?

56
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,380
I'm asking for a praise.

57
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,850
What's going on?

58
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,460
Have you signed the
contract for Perfect Blue?

59
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,220
Yes, it's done.

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,160
You relied on your ex-flame
to get the contract.

61
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,820
So you don't deserve a praise.

62
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,560
You're also relying on your
old schoolmate's popularity

63
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,610
to sell your coffee.

64
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,070
How much different are we?

65
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,710
An ex-flame and an old
schoolmate are incomparable.

66
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,310
Aren't they similar? They're
our old acquaintances.

67
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,440
So you want a praise.

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,550
Okay, so be it.

69
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,810
Here's your reward.

70
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,310
A bubble gum for you.

71
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,420
I'm not a kid.

72
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,160
Then forget it.

73
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,610
Okay.

74
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,800
Now I want it.

75
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,700
You scared me instead.

76
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,440
Qian Xi Xi.

77
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,130
You're childish.

78
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,790
Grow up.

79
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,730
Come on, you're an adult

80
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,920
and you're still afraid of a cockroach.

81
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,380
You're as timid as a mouse.

82
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,310
Where did you get this?

83
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,250
I went to my old house because
Yuanbao has moved out of it.

84
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,940
I also wanted to renovate it.

85
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,140
Then I found it at the edge of a wall.

86
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,700
What's with the renovation?

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,610
You want to move back there?

88
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,880
Actually,

89
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,770
the old house is run down.

90
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,380
It needs a renovation.

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,510
This will fetch a higher rent, too.

92
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,590
Fair enough.

93
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,290
Stop playing with it.

94
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,490
Give it back to me.

95
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,830
No, I'll keep it.

96
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,380
You're always trying to scare me with it.

97
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,320
You might get scared by it
if you keep it with you.

98
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,850
Don't you worry about that.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,540
Suit yourself.

100
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,659
Playtime's over.

101
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,620
What now?

102
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,770
Let's do a video recording.

103
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,920
Not on me.

104
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,370
What time is it now? Stop doing it.

105
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,750
-It's for work.
-No, I won't do it.

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
-I'm serious.
-Take it away for me.

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,660
Perfect Blue

108
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,770
will be having an interactive live
streaming with Jiang Zhe Yang.

109
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,270
Jiang Zhe Yang's agent wants
to select a broadcaster,

110
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,450
and each of our broadcasters

111
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,130
is required to do a selfie video.

112
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,920
Make a pose, quick.

113
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,220
-It's on now.
-I need to put on some makeup.

114
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,450
You look best without the makeup.

115
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,560
-I'm still wearing my pyjamas.
-You look really sexy in that.

116
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,370
Sit up, quick.

117
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,870
Just remain there,
let me take a good shot.

118
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,380
Hello, darlings.

119
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,230
I'm Qian Xi Xi.

120
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,470
[I'm almost 165 cm tall,]

121

[I'm less than 54 kg.]

123
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,430
[I like selling]

124
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,409
[and designing clothes, and
just about everything on them.]

125
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,780
Now you all have seen it.

126
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,340
I want everyone of you

127
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,230
to do a self introduction video.

128
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,580
We'll select one among you

129
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,090
to do a live streaming
with Jiang Zhe Yang.

130
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,910
Is this necessary at all?

131
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,330
Aren't you and Jiang Zhe Yang
old schoolmates?

132
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,930
He will definitely want you.

133
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,000
I give myself up.

134
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,540
I have zero chance anyway.

135
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,430
I think Yuanbao has a better chance.

136
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,530
-You can do it.
-Me?

137
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,430
Listen. Everyone has a fair chance.

138
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,660
For this event,

139
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,920
the best five among broadcasters

140
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,520
will be shortlisted.

141
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,800
Jiang Zhe Yang will then
personally choose

142
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,700
the one he likes the best

143
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,380
to partner with him in the live streaming.

144
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,780
Does that mean I'm eligible, too?

145
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,630
Everyone is given a chance to do it.

146
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,430
I'll give my best, Mr Duan.

147
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
-You can do it.
-Yes.

148
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,600
We're emphasizing

149
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,800
a fair and just contest for all,

150
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,600
and there will be no cheating.

151
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,600
-I can do it.
-Everyone has a chance to be selected.

152
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,290
Even if you're not selected,

153
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,270
all is not lost.

154
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,750
-There'll be chances as assistants.
-What's that?

155
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,980
What's that?

156
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,210
Isn't it a bear?

157
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,750
Yes, it is.

158
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,100
Don't you feel stuffy?

159
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,350
This bear

160
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,340
will also be one of the broadcasters.

161
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,100
At least

162
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,190
one of you have a chance of
being the bear in the stream.

163
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,040
But what's this

164
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,870
supposed to mean? It's uncomfortable
and nobody gets to see our faces.

165
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,190
That's for sure.

166
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,730
It's all up to you to work around it.

167
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,620
You could put your live stream
ID on the head costume

168
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,620

in view of his contribution
to the company.

The company is now promoting him

173
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,990
from the post of trainee
to project manager.

174

He'll be fully in charge of all matters

175
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,630

Nothing actually.

339

I was just wondering.

340
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,310
You mentioned that the broadcasters
who'll be selected in the contest

341
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,540
are based on their performance.

The higher the expectation,
the greater the disappointment.

349

The more you hope for,

350

the more you become upset.

What's the most important thing
of being a CEO?

364
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,319
Fairness.

365

There's no information on the cup.

Duan Ran's silence on the

No.

-Give it some air.

Just try holding it for a second.

Return it at once.

-Be careful.

It's just that there's no news about
the matter regarding Yuan Yuan.

It's confidential.

Confidential?

Having a guilty conscience?

461

You're thinking too much.

Didn't you say I'm fully in charge
of Perfect Blue's projects?

Then stop asking.

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,410
Isn't everyone's effort in vain?

505
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,120
And we thought there's fairness.

506
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,140
Isn't it too much?

507
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,350
Aren't you furious?

508
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,340
I'll seek justice for everyone.

509
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,470
What's the main function of a CEO?

510
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,200
It's to look after every one
of the broadcasters.

511
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,660
He's decided on Yuan Yuan.

512
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,430
Then I'll recommend everyone.

513
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,170
I'll fight until the end.

514
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,130
So everyone's here.

515
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,530
A week has passed.

516
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,090
Everyone must be anxious to know

517
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,130
who'll be the candidates for the host

518
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,940
and who'll get the chance
for the other jobs.

519
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,680
But now I have something else to say.

520
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,850
What's he up to now?

521
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,960
For the past week, I've seen

522
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,910
your efforts and determination.

523
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,090
Some of you managed
to double up your sales.

524
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,830
Some has their fan base
increased tremendously.

525
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,460
And some

526
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,010
even have dark circles under their eyes
like pandas

527
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,740
from staying up late everyday.

528
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,060
Your hard work

529
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,960
is not only for the contest,

530
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,710
it's also getting yourselves ready

531
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,850
to fight for better opportunities

532
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,280
and becoming your better selves.

533
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,590
There's a long way ahead.

534
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,520
I hope all of you can keep your enthusiasm

535
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,060
and continue to move forward.

536
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,720
The company will always
be your strong backing.

537
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,300
Just announce the results now, Mr Duan.

538
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,900
Yes, make the announcement now.

539
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,660
I can't reveal too much right now.

540
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,960
But everyone must believe

541
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,200
that Jiang Zhe Yang will definitely

542
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,750
make the fairest choice.

543
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,780
Start.

544
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,560
The water is replenished internally
and maintained externally.

545
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,050
Inglemirepharm's Hyaluronic Acid.

546
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,300
Moisturising and repairing
muscle foundation.

547
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,230
Water and light energies,
revitalises new muscles.

548
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,710
Okay, cut.

549
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,780
Ouyang.

550
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,830
The last shot.

551
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,860
The original afternoon shooting plan
was completed ahead of schedule.

552
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,090
Yang Yang should leave
early to take a rest.

553
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,190
-Okay, thanks.
-You're welcome.

554
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,510
-Thanks for your effort.
-It's nothing.

555
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,390
See you.

556
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,660
Zhou Qian.

557
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,630
Ms Ouyang.

558
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,520
Have Rui sent the video to us yet?

559
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,060
I've sent it to your studio this morning.

560
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,310
You can go through it.

561
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,370
Send it to my email.

562
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,550
I'll do it now.

563
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,350
Yes, but today Rui

564
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,570
has sent over more than 50 candidates.

565
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,490
More than 50?

566
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,910
More than 50.

567
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,170
Take care of Yang Yang. I need to go out.

568
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,350
Sure.

569
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,160
Hello, Duan Ran.

570
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,710
Why on earth did you send
me so many candidates?

571
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,030
Didn't we agree on just five?

572
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,490
I sent you five only.

573
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,080
It's five plus a zero at the back, right?

574
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,940
Couldn't you narrow it down?

575
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,480
It's too many candidates.

576
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,030
Listen.

577
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,230
I'll send it to her again.

578
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,290
Okay.

579
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,830
I'm near your company right now.

580
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,360
I'll go over and do it there.

581
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,260
Just make it easy.

582
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,730
Hello.

583
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,620
Hello, Yuan Yuan.

584
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,780
Come to my office, now.

585
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,410
Come now.

586
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,650
Just make it quick.

587
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,570
Yu Shi.

588
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,430
Yu Shi.

589
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,230
How can I help you, Mr Duan?

590
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,420
Ms Ouyang will be here soon.

591
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,860
Ask the candidates to wait
in the small meeting room.

592
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,260
Keep it low-key.

593
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,650
Don't let others know about this.

594
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,220
Got it.

595
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,830
Stay clam.

596
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,680
I'm sorry. Could you tell me

597
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,210
where Duan Ran's office is?

598
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,330
It's upstairs.

599
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,600
Thanks.

600
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,770
Who's that?

601
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,230
Mr Duan.

602
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,350
Ms Ouyang.

603
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,290
What's going on?

604
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,140
Didn't we agree on just five candidates?

605
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,540
Why 50 now?

606
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,260
We made a mistake.

607
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,670
It's just five.

608
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,860
They're all here.

609
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,040
See, one, two, three, four.

610
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,280
One more's on the way.

611
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,000
Fine. While I was coming to your room,

612
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,770
I roughly took a look at your company.

613
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,300
The environment's not bad.

614
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,280
However, I just thought about it.

615
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,890
I still hope Yang Yang's
event is held outside.

616
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,950
Like a press conference.

617
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,490
Don't make him look like
an Internet celebrity.

618
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,760
Got it.

619
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,810
Understood.

620
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,050
We will try our best

621
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,630
to satisfy your demand.

622
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,440
You may also let us know
if you have other demands.

623
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,300
-It's the ones that I mentioned that day.
-Duan Ran.

624
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
I'd like to see you.

625
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,130
Just step out for a while.

626
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,270
Sure.

627
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,150
Hi, babe.

628
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,790
Find a place for yourself and sit down.

629
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,510
Well,

630
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,140
come over here and take a look at them.

631
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,870
Introduce yourselves.

632
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,070
No, I'll just wait for you to
come back before we start.

633
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,390
I'll bring the last one to see you.

634
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,310
Quick.

635
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,890
Come with me.

636
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,190
Couldn't you let me have some dignity?

637
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,700
Hi, Ms Ouyang.
I'm Xiao Nan, Rui's beauty blogger.

638
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,710
Come over here.

639
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,240
What's going on?

640
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,260
What do you want?

641
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,750
What do you mean?

642
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,340
Have you secretly decided on Yuan Yuan?

643
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,670
I want to hear the truth.

644
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,410
Let me explain.

645
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,460
I had promised Yuan Yuan

646
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,130
to let her be the host of the event.

647
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,660
So she agrees to work for us.

648
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,340
If we choose her,

649
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,190
I'll make her the top broadcaster

650
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,520
on the Internet.

651
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,910
I disagree.

652
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,940
Why?

653
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,480
We can't put all our resources
just on one person.

654
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,960
We've recruited so many
broadcasters recently.

655
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,980
If we put everything

656
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,260
just on Yuan Yuan,

657
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,580
What will the others think?

658
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,540
Furthermore,

659
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,870
it doesn't do us any good by doing this.

660
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,190
Yuan Yuan will be the biggest winner.

661
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,660
But it's not beneficial
to us at all in the long run.

662
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,800
Do you understand?

663
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,620
What have we got to lose?

664
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,500
Aren't you hoping she'll be back?

665
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,260
Of course, I do.

666
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,990
But not on the premise of
using up all our resources.

667
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,920
Yuan Yuan, are you here to visit us?

668
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,240
This conversation isn't going anywhere.

669
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,390
Ms Ouyang is waiting for me.

670
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,980
-Is her matter more important or mine?
-Xi Xi.

671
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,280
Yuan Yuan.

672
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,780
I'll been waiting for you.
Come with me, quick.

673
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,050
Yuan Yuan.

674
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,750
Do you miss me?

675
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,880
Of course, I do.

676
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,340
What brings you here?

677
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,690
Are you happy to see me?

678
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,640
I'm just happy to see you.

679
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,190
-But...
-That's enough.

680
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,170
We've got some serious business to attend.

681
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,430
Stop wasting our time.

682
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,490
Everyone is waiting for you.

683
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,880
Duan...

684
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,320
What's this?

685
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,970
I like Jiang Zhe Yang so much.

686
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,970
And I hope...

687
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,550
So...

688
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,530
I guess you've almost done
introducing yourselves.

689
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,680
Almost.

690
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,440
The four of you get back to your work.

691
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,760
I'll chat with Ms Ouyang.

692
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,640
Sure.

693
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,740
Take a seat.

694
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,560
Let me make the introductions.

695
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,990
This is Ms Ouyang Mei Xuan.

696
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,400
She's one of the top agents

697
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,020
in show business.

698
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,560
Jiang Zhe Yang's her client.

699
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,720
We were friends in the UK for many years.

700
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,100
Jiang Zhe Yang
won't be what he is today

701
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,460
if not for Ms Ouyang.

702
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,750
-Hello.
-This is Yuan Yuan.

703
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,290
Nice meeting you, Ms Ouyang.

704
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,140
Everyone take a seat.

705
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,570
Why did Mr Duan bring Yuan Yuan

706
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,850
and the other four new broadcasters
into the meeting room?

707
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,880
I'm not too sure.

708
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,380
If you won't say it, then I'll say it.

709
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,800
-I've put up with this for a long time.
-Su Su.

710
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,560
Mr Duan is using the event as a lure

711
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,880
to convince Yuan Yuan
to renew her contract.

712
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,280
So you were eliminated from the beginning.

713
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,070
What does this mean?

714
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,360
Isn't he playing us like a fiddle?

715
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,020
How could Mr Duan do this to us?

716
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,740
I know you don't believe it.

717
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,950
Mr Duan sweet-talked us from
the beginning after all.

718
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,400
But this is the fact.

719
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,250
Xi Xi, now you are the CEO.

720
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,370
Tell us how to deal with this matter.

721
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,440
Yuan Yuan is a top broadcaster

722
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,150
in live streaming.

723
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,580
From the fan base to online traffic,

724
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,410
her ability to interact with fans
and capability of carrying products

725
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,430
is simply superb.

726
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,940
We have the top agent together
with the top broadcaster here.

727
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,980
Yuan Yuan is the best
person to partner Yang Yang

728
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,150
in the interactive live streaming.

729
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,170
Actually, I graduated from the
Central Academy of Drama.

730
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,830
I studied acting previously.

731
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,080
For various reasons

732
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,270
and different encounters,

733
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,770
I joined the live streaming industry.

734
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,040
I'm sorry.

735
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,210
Excuse me.

736
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,840
What's up?

737
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,699
You must be Ms Ouyang.

738
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,300
Who are you then?

739
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,320
I'm Qian Xi Xi.

740
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,300
Rui's CEO.

741
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,190
We're in the midst of a
business discussion.

742
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,120
I want to talk about business, too.

743
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,030
I'm sorry, Yuan Yuan.

744
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,460
Could you and Duan Ran give us a moment?

745
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,909
I want to have a word
with Ms Ouyang, alone.

746
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,150
What's going on?

747
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,270
Let us finish our discussion first.
Stop making trouble.

748
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,350
Since Ms Qian wants to have a word
with me, she'll have her chance.

749
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,530
I haven't eaten the whole day.

750
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,090
Buy me a coffee and some sandwiches.

751
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,050
Can you do that?

752
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,300
No problem.

753
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,990
You should know my
favourite type of sandwich.

754
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,650
Sure.

755
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,330
No problem.

756
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,100
Be quick.

757
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,790
Sorry for the trouble, Yuan Yuan.

758
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,100
I'm fine.

759
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,550
Have a good chat.

760
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,770
Enjoy your chat.

761
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,260
Listen.

762
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,290
I've decided on Yuan Yuan. It's final.

763
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,350
Don't mess with me.

764
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,790
Now who's the CEO here?

765
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,970
Duan Ran, I assigned you
to be in charge of

766
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,220
Perfect Blues' interactive live
streaming and and the contest.

767
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,820
But I didn’t expect things
will end up this way.

768
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,590
Don't mess with me.

769
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,460
It's all up to me.

770
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,370
Sandwich.

771
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,770
Do you want some water?

772
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,240
I'm not thirsty.

773
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,380
Take a seat.

774
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,830
I would like to talk to
you alone about this matter.

775
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,650
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

776
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,260
You're Qian Xi Xi, right?

777
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,050
Your name is no stranger to me.

778
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,810
Is that so?

779
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,620
Then let's get straight to the point.

780
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,350
That's great. I especially
like the direct way.

781
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,460
It's like this.

782
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,760
Rui has indeed just reorganized.

783
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,630
Having the chance to work with a big star
like Yang Yang with huge online traffic,

784
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,800
and a professional agent like Ms Ouyang,

785
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,740
is an honour.

786
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,930
So every broadcaster in our company

787
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,230
take this matter very seriously

788
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,990
and enthusiastically, too.

789
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,650
Mr Duan is in charge of
the contest.

790
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,210
Everyone’s enthusiasm and
participation were very good.

791
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,660
Since Ms Ouyang came to our
company in person today,

792
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,410
I'm making a suggestion.

793
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm hoping

794
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,420
you'll give every streamer
in our company a chance.

795
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,280
So that everyone can show
themselves fairly and justly.

796
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,050
You're pretty confident with
your company’s broadcasters.

797
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,980
Because I'm the CEO of the company.

798
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,540
Besides being the CEO,

799
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,390
I'm actually also a streamer, too.

800
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,070
-So I understand every streamer.
-Wait. Hold it right there.

801
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,880
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

802
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,550
You want me to interview

803
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,660
all the broadcasters in
your company, right?

804
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,540
Sure.

805
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,310
But the first one to be eliminated

806
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,290
is you.

807
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,210
Why?

808
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,260
You used to sell coffee with
Yang Yang's online traffic.

809
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
I haven't settled this with you yet.

810
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,040
So I hope that

811
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,820
you don't show up

812
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,700
during Yang Yang's activities.

813
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,080
I was using Yang Yang

814
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,820
but it also made Jiang Zhe Yang
to become a hot search.

815
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,960
It worked well.

816
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,030
If not for this hot search,

817
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,770
you wouldn't even have the chance
to talk to me today.

818
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,840
Fine.

819
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
I can withdraw from this selection.

820
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,520
If Ms Ouyang

821
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,110
could treat all the broadcasters
of our company equally.

822
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,180
I have no problem of quitting.

823
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,560
You certainly look like a CEO.

824
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,340
You also look like a director.

825
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,630
Cheer up.

826
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,690
Get ready.

827
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,030
Ms Ouyang will interview you one by one.

828
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,700
Get prepared.

829
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,030
Go put on your makeup if need be.

830
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,900
Why don't you go?

831
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,020
I was eliminated.

832
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,320
Because I was selling coffee using
Jiang Zhe Yang's online traffic.

833
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000
Consider it a punishment for me.

834
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,580
Didn't you justify yourself?

835
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,340
I defended myself.

836
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,320
But she was right.

837
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,190
You saw her for the first time today.

838
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,390
And you think what she said made sense.

839
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:13,420
It's different from what I
imagine as a first love.

840
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,410
Why are you still a little disappointed?

841
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,670
Not completely, but feeling
a little happy instead.

842
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,450
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

843
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,720
You're also participating in
the selection, go prepare.

844
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,860
Just go.

845
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,020
Hurry up and cheer up.

846
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,310
Jia Yun, I stand for you.

847
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,170
Yuan Yuan.

848
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,920
I got it.

849
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,350
Duan Ran agreed to your selection.

850
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,410
As the CEO of this company,

851
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,330
I want to be fair and just

852
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,850
to each of the broadcasters.

853
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,390
I hope you can understand.

854
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,080
I do.

855
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,510
Xi Xi.

856
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,590
As long as this selection
is fair and just,

857
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,100
I will not lose.

858
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,520
Do not worry.

859
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,970
Give your best.

860
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,700
I will.

861
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,410
[Rui Live]

862
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,360
Just say it briefly

863
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,600
your view of Yang Yang?

864
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,490
Hello Ms Ouyang, I'm Yuanbao.

865
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,520
I started to like him

866
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,410
since he was still a trainee
before he made his debut.

867
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,650
He is gentle and kind,

868
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,970
and like small animals.

869
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,170
He looks good and sings well.

870
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,620
To the fans,

871
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,470
he is a positive role model to them.

872
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,670
When the girls knew they had a chance

873
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,170
to work with Jiang Zhe Yang,

874
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,750
everyone was ecstatic.

875
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,860
Everyone was highly motivated.

876
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,580
Jiang Zhe Yang should be younger than me.

877
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,240
If we partner up...

878
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,650
Yuan Yuan

879
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,560
used to be our contracted broadcaster.

880
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,180
She was the top broadcaster.

881
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,910
She was awesome in the
live streaming industry.

882
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,260
But her contract with us expired.

883
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,000
She went to be an actress.

884
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,540
But she is not doing so well.

885
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,130
Through this interactive live streaming,

886
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,540
I hope I can resign her.

887
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,750
At last, if they lose to Yuan Yuan,

888
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,980
it will be deserved.

889
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,880
Yuan Yuan is just like
a big sister to them.

890
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,900
I can be his intimate sister.

891
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,000
He's a younger brother.

892
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,450
He's also very considerate to his fans.

893
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,860
He's a noble son.

894
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,910
It's not the same as an actor.

895
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,670
And do you know my Bulletproof Coffee?

896
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,530
I also developed it for Yang Yang.

897
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,070
Isn't this killing
two birds with one stone?

898
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,130
Lastly,

899
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,190
don't I still have you to back me up?

900
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,620
Looks like you're having all the benefits.

901
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,760
Pretty good.

902
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,550
The Jiang Zhe Yang who we generally
know through the screen

903
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,920
is not his true self,

904
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,990
but it's just his public persona.

905
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,490
In that case,

906
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,170
if we're selecting his partner in
the interactive live streaming,

907
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,770
I think it also depends on the
matching degree of the two persons.

908
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,030
In your heart,

909
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,660
what's your impression

910
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,030
of his public persona?

911
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,460
He likes petite and cute girls.

912
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,170
He's a high-end stylish man

913
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,960
with a totally international
taste and outlook.

914
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,220
But I still have something to say,

915
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,850
I don’t know if it’s
appropriate for me to do so.

916
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,730
Speak.

917
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,900
This is a live streaming
for selling goods.

918
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,230
If you just get to know
his public persona,

919
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,360
it seems to have nothing
to do with our live streaming.

920
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,970
Let’s have the second round of interviews.

921
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,200
This lipstick...

922
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,880
Just a small white bottle,

923
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,910
you can instantly moisturise your skin
and maintain it in the same condition.

924
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,280
That is, while you're
applying it to your lips,

925
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,290
you can eat at the same time.

926
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,960
Every time I'm using it,

927
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,120
I have the urge to smack my lips...

928
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,360
I believe everyone
who likes to buy lipstick

929
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,960
will have one just like this.

930
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,840
There are four lipsticks in this series

931
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,420
and four core tones.

932
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,360
Ms Ouyang.

933
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,350
I just want to ask you a question.

934
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,510
Sure.

935
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,220
What was your mood when
you woke up this morning?

936
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:22,200
What was the first thought that came up?
