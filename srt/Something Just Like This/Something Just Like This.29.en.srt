[Episode 29]

4
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,900
Check this out, Duan Ran.

5
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,260
It's Fei Fei.

6
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,110
She updated her Moments.

7
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:24,860
She seems happy.

8
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,630
I'll give her a "Like".

9
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,300
The incident with Fei Fei is over.

10
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,220
You can finally relax.

11
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,460
Even though this is over,

12
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,130
stop convincing me to

13
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,470
return to Rui Live.

14
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,680
Is that alright?

15
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,009
I'm being serious.

16
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,830
What I'm doing right now may seem mundane,

17
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,460
but I'm very content.

18
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,280
It gives me a sense of reality.

19
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,259
I'm happy.

20
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,729
It's a form of recuperation for me.

21
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,860
I don't want this to be over.

22
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,650
Okay.

23
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,740
Sure.

24
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,419
I'm going upstairs.

25
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,180
Sure.

26
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,930
I brought you

27
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,010
some books.

28
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,090
These will be helpful to you.

29
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,940
They are great. Read them when you can.

30
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,079
Learn something.

31
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,790
You're doing this on purpose.

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,740
You know I'm taking a break,

33
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,590
yet you're giving me books.

34
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,780
Don't read them then.
Just leave them at home.

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,320
How considerate.

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,690
-Off you go.
-I'll take them.

37
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,230
Looks very difficult indeed.

38
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,520
I need...

39
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,680
What do you need?

40
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,860
-Thanks.
-Off you go.

41
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,570
-I'm going home.
-Okay.

42
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,640
Drive safe.

43
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,590
Hello, please inform Mr Chen

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,850
that Cola is here.

45
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,690
I'm sorry, Mr Chen is in a meeting.

46
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,300
Please make an appointment next time.

47
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,450
Forget the appointment!
Tell him Cola is here.

48
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,510
Do you understand?

49
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,780
Are you Cola?

50
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,810
Come with me.

51
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,290
Hold this.

52
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,750
Wait for me here.

53
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,980
She finally responded.

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,130
Sure, I get it.

55
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,560
Queue up.

56
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,170
What do you mean?

57
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,920
Pass me the catalogue.

58
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,810
Is that all?

59
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,470
-Yes.
-What about the dedicated

60
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,230
dressing room and
live stream room you promised?

61
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,570
We're busy with Singles' Day.
Bear with it.

62
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,370
Dressing rooms are upstairs.

63
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,110
Just use whichever is vacant.

64
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,490
Mr Chen promised me.

65
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,020
I need to speak to him. Where is he?

66
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,350
He's busy.
Come to me if you need anything.

67
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,170
I'll fix you up with an operations team.

68
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,030
It's Singles' Day. I'm off.

69
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,890
He hasn't come down for breakfast.

70
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,490
Duan.

71
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,180
Don't go to the office today.

72
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,680
I'll accompany you to the hospital.

73
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,670
Why?

74
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,370
You said your chest feels tight.

75
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,830
You should get it checked.

76
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,250
It's just an old bug.

77
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,580
I know myself very well.

78
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,730
There are things to handle at work.

79
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,850
-Good morning.
-You're finally here.

80
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,700
Hurry up and eat.

81
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,650
I didn't sleep well.

82
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,750
Hey, kid.

83
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,750
No phones during meals.

84
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,870
Didn't you see my Moments?

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,220
You update your status ten times a day.

86
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,340
I can't keep up.

87
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,380
Your mum enjoys doing that.

88
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,510
She never gets tired of that.

89
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,390
I mean, she enjoys sharing.

90
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,920
Sharing is caring.

91
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,910
What are the both of you doing?

92
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,240
Stop teasing me.

93
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,860
If Xi Xi was here, you'd not do this.

94
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,030
Sit back down. I'll do it.

95
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,530
Xi Xi?

96
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
It's been a long time since I saw her.

97
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,780
How's she doing as a promoter?

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,230
Pretty well.

99
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,080
When is she coming back to Rui?

100
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,040
I'm planning

101
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,500
to give her a break.

102
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,710
She exhausted herself.

103
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,970
This is a good time for her to recuperate.

104
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,520
To regain her motivation.

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,990
Did you pass her the books I asked you to?

106
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,480
Of course, don't worry.

107
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,560
Okay.

108
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,450
A break is good.

109
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,970
It's an opportunity for her to reflect
on her experiences.

110
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,100
To find her bearings, read some books,

111
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,300
and recharge.

112
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,270
It doesn't seem like a break.

113
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,890
It sounds even more tiring.

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,780
What do you think? Do you like them?

115
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,110
They are alright. Not really.

116
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,380
Have a look. You chose them yourself.

117
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,240
If you find something suitable,

118
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,870
you can check out at the
cashier immediately.

119
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,080
It's alright. I don't want them.
I don't really like them.

120
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,510
No, thank you.

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,420
She just came to try clothes on.

122
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,670
What's happening?

123
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,810
Guests come to try clothes
on with their phones.

124
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,690
Before leaving the changing room,

125
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,840
they'd have taken the pictures

126
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,500
and placed the orders online.

127
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,920
If that goes on,
we can't sell our products.

128
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,860
I guess some e-commerce event is going on.

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,820
All of them came to try clothes on.

130
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,780
What do we do? Let's put them back.

131
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,480
Singles' Day is coming soon.

132
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,460
You'd probably be occupied.

133
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,550
Without Xi Xi, can you handle it?

134
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm surprised you know about Singles' Day.

135
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,640
Look at you.

136
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,650
Your dad is in the e-commerce
industry for a year.

137
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,510
Sales on Singles' Day

138
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,670
are equally important offline and online.

139
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,380
Singles' Day has evolved

140
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,550
into a nationwide shopping fiesta.

141
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,540
Physical stores should
keep up with the trend.

142
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
Physical stores should also

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,679
hop onto the Singles' Day bandwagon.

144
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,470
However, I realised

145
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,890
Singles' Day isn't
much help to physical stores.

146
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,070
There isn't much significance.

147
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,390
That's because you guys
give insane discounts

148
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,360
and vouchers.

149
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,580
It affects the retail market greatly.

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,940
This is how our industry works.

151
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,980
Emerging industries like these
do not have definite rules.

152
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,740
Unlike retail giants like you

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,670
who have seen it all

154
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,150
and have settled down to some extent.

155
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,090
We in the live streaming industry

156
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,990
are basically a ragtag group of people

157
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
from various industries, united by

158
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,630
our desire to stream.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,470
It's impossible for us to select a leader

160
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,830
and gather everyone for a meeting.

161
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,070
No one would listen to you.

162
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,230
I think it's time you learn about

163
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,170
strategic alliance.

164
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,040
Everyone should just sit down

165
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,620
to iron out the issues

166
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,710
and set some rules for the industry.

167
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,540
You need a collective system.

168
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,680
Are these for me?

169
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,760
They are for you.

170
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,310
You have to work hard
for the time to come.

171
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,110
I came to cheer you up.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,590
No, Mr Duan.

173
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,590
I have many blind dates coming up.

174
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,070
If I gain weight, no one would like me.

175
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,350
You're missing the point.

176
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,800
Don't you know?

177
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,200
After the Singles' Day event,

178
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,110
you will be rich. Forget the blind dates.

179
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,510
You're right.

180
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,420
Then I'll do whatever you say.

181
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,840
Let me tell you.

182
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,620
Your task for today is simple.

183
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,140
Two words. "Distribute vouchers."

184
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,170
Distribute them with
all your might. Go nuts.

185
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,890
Money is no object.
Distribute as much as you can.

186
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,090
Don't worry, Mr Duan.

187
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,830
I even got the coupons ready.

188
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,650
I even got the hours scheduled.

189
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,990
You know me best, Su Su.

190
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,820
Mr Duan, you seem motivated.

191
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,120
Besides that,

192
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,850
I'm as energized as

193
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,190
Popeye after consuming spinach today.

194
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,070
I'm brimming with energy
with nowhere to release them.

195
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,930
Su Su, hurry up and check this out.

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,160
Mr Duan, look.

197
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
After distributing the vouchers,

198
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,810
our fan count increased by 30,000.

199
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,950
Our orders increased by ten percent.

200
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,750
We did it.

201
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,910
We nailed Singles' Day.

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,600
We must release discounts
as early as possible.

203
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
Give the consumers some incentive.

204
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,590
Otherwise, who would buy?

205
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,760
Am I right? If this goes on,
forget about blind dates.

206
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,250
Forget about interviews. You'd be loaded.

207
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,380
Come over here.

208
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,830
-Come here.
-Yu Shi, have a look.

209
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,380
Hurry up and get over here.

210
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,730
Yu Shi, look.

211
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,000
We're going to the hotel
across the street.

212
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm buying lunch for the whole company.

213
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,670
Yes!

214
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
What are you doing?

215
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,200
You mustn't spend the money.

216
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,070
What's the matter?

217
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,380
What's wrong?

218
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,410
I'm going to be honest.

219
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,710
I received an email

220
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,360
from the Apparel Alliance.

221
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,850
Were they praising me?

222
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,430
They said, from now on,

223
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,760
the prices of apparels sold online

224
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,710
must follow those of retail stores.

225
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,260
We're not allowed to

226
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,120
employ discounts and sales.

227
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,470
If we do not cooperate, they will...

228
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,180
What will they do?

229
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,690
They'd terminate all
collaboration with us.

230
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,130
Ridiculous!

231
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,470
-Exactly.
-What in the world is this?

232
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,590
That's enough.

233
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,310
How will this benefit them?

234
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,630
What good

235
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,630
would fixing prices do for them?

236
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,150
How much can they earn?

237
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,380
Can't we have a win-win?

238
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,560
All my preparation for Singles' Day

239
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,490
went down the drain thanks to them.

240
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,420
I don't think they did it spontaneously.

241
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,770
They might have plotted this for a while.

242
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,790
Right now, we need to hurry up

243
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,410
and respond to this matter.

244
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,950
I did it, Mr Duan.

245
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,380
I gave them a call.

246
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,620
These people

247
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,040
are persistent.

248
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,930
They are unwilling to talk to me.

249
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,600
Yu Shi and I

250
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,080
did a rough calculation.

251
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,720
If we fix our prices

252
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,360
according to theirs,

253
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,670
we will lose all of our advantages.

254
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,150
I predict that our sales on

255
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,630
Singles' Day will barely increase.

256
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,360
It's a domino effect.

257
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,180
Then, our promise

258
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,720
of stock options

259
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,270
would go up in smoke.

260
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,090
Everyone would be displeased.

261
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,790
Rui would be in danger.

262
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,200
Inspect the warehouse

263
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,960
for the inventory of brandless apparels.

264
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,170
On Singles' Day,

265
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,920
we will sell brandless apparels.

266
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,400
We will not sell branded goods.

267
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,860
Forget working with them.

268
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,240
-All right.
-Sounds good?

269
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Why are you playing with your phone?

270
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,580
You should propose an idea
if you've time to do that.

271
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,440
I actually have an idea, Mr Duan.

272
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,030
What is it?

273
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,390
I think it's a battle
between both parties.

274
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,180
We can't fight by ourselves.

275
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,340
We need to draw up a strategy.

276
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,800
We should find someone.

277
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,710
We should recruit an ally.

278
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,650
[It's time you learn about]

279
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,190
[strategic alliance.]

280
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,800
[You need a collective system.]

281
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,480
We should gather an alliance

282
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,130
and then form a strategy.

283
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,240
[Everyone should just sit down]

284
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,950
[to iron out the issues]

285
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,310
[and set some rules for the industry.]

286
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,120
Are they willing to do this?

287
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,880
Invite all live streaming companies

288
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,440
that are performing well in the market

289
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,840
over for a conversation.

290
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,530
Tell them we're forming
a live streaming alliance

291
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,060
in response to the Apparel Alliance.

292
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,430
Yes, sir.

293
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,340
I'll check the inventory.

294
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,080
We have a total of 35 blouses.

295
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,160
We have 66 pieces of these dresses.

296
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
There's a piece of

297
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,590
clothing even my grandma wouldn't wear.

298
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,500
I've not seen something

299
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,150
so out of style for a long time.

300
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,350
It's alright if they are out of style,

301
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,280
but look at our current inventory.

302
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,930
They are not sufficient for sales.

303
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,920
It's over.

304
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,570
Let's go over these

305
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,310
and determine

306
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,990
how much we can sell.

307
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,920
It's better than nothing.

308
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,570
Every piece counts.

309
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,600
Stay strong.

310
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,860
You said

311
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,180
you'd lead us into victory.

312
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,390
We want to buy our shares.

313
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,430
-Yes.
-Don't worry, the clothes are fine.

314
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,370
Just sell it to your grandma.

315
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,260
Vintage is very popular right now.

316
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,230
All right! That's what I'm going to do.

317
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,480
I'll figure a way out

318
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,550
of this jam.

319
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,710
Worse comes to worst, I'll make like a

320
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
roadside stall owner

321
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,200
and call out for customers
at the top of my voice.

322
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,360
Please demonstrate.

323
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,150
-I...
-Hold on.

324
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,380
A stall owner?

325
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,750
Why haven't I thought of that?

326
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,190
You're amazing.

327
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,530
Why did you buy so much
for the three of us?

328
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,150
Everyone gets two cups of bubble tea.

329
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,590
It's a Singles' Day promotion.
Buy one get one free.

330
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,790
What a deal.

331
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,150
I'll finish it.

332
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,440
French fries.

333
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,030
You're going to ruin the book.

334
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,130
Don't worry, I'll clean it later.

335
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,200
Listen to me.

336
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,040
[The Balanced Scorecard]

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,119

338

Look, it's the hardcover edition.

339
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,380
This book costs 100 yuan.

340

-100 yuan?
-100 yuan?

341
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,020
It's just a book.

342
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,260
What is this?

343
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,980
A must read for all business managers.

344
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,740
Wow, let me have a look.

345
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,510
I see it often on the

346
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,990
list of best sellers.

347
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,310
A friend gave this book to me.

348
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,850
I did not take it seriously.

349
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,190
I think they come in series.

350
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,050
You should read all of them.

351
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,750
Where are you going, Xi Xi?

352
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,750
I put the other copies in the
storage to support the rack.

353
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,880
I'll retrieve them.

354
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,350
That girl.

355
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,710
Yuanbao, what's going on?

356
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,830
I'm not sure.

357
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,050
Why did they call for us?

358
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,570
Did Jia Yun say anything?

359
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,790
There's a meeting.

360
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,030
A meeting?

361
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,720
Xiao Wu.

362
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,440
We've been waiting for you.

363
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,510
What are you doing here?

364
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,840
Why are you here?

365
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,260
It's time to get off work.

366
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,230
I'm worried so I came to pick you up.

367
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,510
Su Su, I'm so jealous.

368
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,070
Don't be.

369
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,620
Let's go get some hotpot.

370
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,710
Babes.

371
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,870
The Apparel Alliance is
pressuring us right now.

372
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,330
I'm sure you are all aware.

373
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,300
I want everyone to be prepared

374
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,450
for what's going to happen tomorrow.

375
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,330
The vouchers we distributed this morning

376
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,630
are no longer valid.

377
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,520
The fans will blame us

378
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,260
for breaking promises.
They might even unsubscribe to us.

379
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,670
Our company's survival
hangs in the balance.

380
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,470
Thus, as the interim CEO,

381
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,920
I'm going to mobilise all of you.

382
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,210
We need to persevere in order to win.

383
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,110
Even if we do persist,

384
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,930
without the discounted price,

385
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,860
how would we sell the goods?

386
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,380
This brings me to my main point.

387
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,170
At the entrance of clothing
market tomorrow morning,

388
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,930
all of you should assemble.

389
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,540
Once the market opens, rush into it.

390
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,830
Clear the racks and buy everything.

391
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,830
What time?

392
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,230
-5:30 a.m.
-5:30 a.m.

393
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,520
5:30 in the morning?

394
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,870
Miss.

395
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,940
The early bird gets the worm.

396
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,630
My credit card is overspent.

397
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,600
I was waiting to save on Singles' Day.

398
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,800
Are there any objections?

399
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,220
Do not be late.

400
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,930
-Especially you, Yuanbao, Do not be late.
-Okay.

401
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,150
I'll leave it to you guys then.

402
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,830
-Is that alright?
-Yes.

403
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,830
No.

404
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,550
-Let's get it!
-Hold on.

405
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,750
You dainty little princesses

406
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,750
and debutantes

407
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,630
are going to source
at the clothing emporium?

408
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,310
What's wrong with that?

409
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,250
Look at yourselves.

410
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,520
All of you look gullible.

411
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,350
If all of you went,
they'd sell them at higher rates.

412
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,440
The owners are

413
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,060
more shrewd than the other.

414
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,480
To them,

415
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,910
all of you are cash cows,

416
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,530
waiting to be slaughtered.

417
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,190
No, I don't want to be a cash cow.

418
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
If you don't want to be slaughtered,

419
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,740
listen to me.

420
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,320
All of you need a disguise.

421
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,540
Mr Five, check out my outfit.

422
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,020
It's so flashy.

423
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,270
-What's the matter with you?
-Loves, look at me.

424
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,950
Am I beautiful?

425
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,370
Look. This is the ugliest
outfit I've ever worn.

426
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,120
Look at mine.

427
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,630
They look like pyjamas.

428
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,080
I was too slow.

429
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,630
I couldn't find anything.

430
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,160
Don't worry, it looks good.

431
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,390
Well, we have to bear with this.

432
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,030
Hurry up and teach us
the secret techniques

433
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,800
of bargaining.

434
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,470
Since you asked,

435
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,420
I'll teach you three techniques.

436
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,240
With these techniques,

437
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,750
you'll be kings of the hill.

438
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,300
You'll win every battle.

439
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,520
Come on, let's put our hands together.

440
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,950
May we return victorious tomorrow.

441
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,270
One, two, three.

442
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,610
We can do this!

443
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,100
Let's go for some hotpot.

444
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,480
-I want hotpot too.
-Forget it.

445
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,920
-Let's eat together.
-Forget it.

446
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,990
They are on a date.

447
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,520
-They are on a date.
-Let's go without her.

448
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,250
What's the big deal? Forget it.

449
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,950
I want hotpot too.

450
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,040
[Are you off work?]

451
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,050
[Soon.]

452
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,800
Sure, Mr Liu.

453
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,430
It's decided then.

454
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,990
I'll see you at the meeting. Thanks.

455
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,980
Okay, bye.

456
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,860
Great.

457
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,080
Eight of them are attending the meeting.

458
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,570
Six companies aren't coming.

459
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,750
You can't reach the other two, right?

460
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,210
It's alright. I'll wake up early tomorrow

461
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,190
and give them a call.

462
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,910
As long as the majority makes it,

463
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,960
I'll be at ease.

464
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,950
Where are the rest of them?

465
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,540
Mr Duan, it's midnight.

466
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,310
The girls are off work.

467
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,740
We should leave as well.

468
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,470
We have a battle to fight tomorrow.
Get some rest.

469
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,340
I lost track of time. Go on.

470
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,830
Have a sip.

471
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,220
This is great.

472
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,600
My tooth aches.

473
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,940
Come on. Your toothache

474
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,310
is a minor physical inconvenience.

475
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,920
As the interim CEO, I'm exhausted.

476
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,150
Normally,
I only have to take care of myself.

477
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,140
That would do.

478
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,790
Now, I've to take care of a company.

479
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,850
I'll have to trouble
you for the time being.

480
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,070
Don't worry about it.

481
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,500
When there is a will, there is a way.

482
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,330
I attended some meetings today.

483
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,530
It's 90 percent done.

484
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,040
Did they agree to an alliance?

485
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
What are you talking about?

486
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,310
It's not that simple.

487
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,390
We reached out to them today.

488
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,830
We will host a meeting tomorrow

489
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,140
and have a discussion.

490
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,800
Then I must pray for you

491
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,230
tonight.

492
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,750
Dear deities, please ensure the success

493
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,880
of this alliance.

494
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
I'd really appreciate it.

495
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,620
There's one more thing.

496
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,830
When Xi Xi comes,

497
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,030
do not tell her about this.

498
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,870
I don't want her to be worried.

499
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,480
I know. You'd handle the front lines

500
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,900
while she just relaxes behind the scenes.

501
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,830
I really want Xi Xi to return.

502
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,470
I want to return to my tranquil life.

503
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,790
Princess, please give me a hand.

504
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,310
Give the both of us some time.

505
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,630
You shouldn't leave her

506
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,110
a mess once she returns.

507
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,130
Let me ask you a serious question.

508
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,080
Have you ever thought,

509
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,600
if she found out about this...

510
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,030
-Duan Ran.
-Xi Xi, we're here.

511
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,900
-Come here.
-Jia Yun.

512
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,900
Look at the smile on Xi Xi's face.

513
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,520
Every time when I look at that smile,

514
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,870
I realise everything is worth it.

515
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,950
Look at all the good food.

516
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,440
Come here.

517
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,160
How early were you guys?

518
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,150
You ordered everything.

519
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,210
You must be hungry.

520
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,000
I didn't have dinner.

521
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,620
Cheers.

522
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,070
Cheers.

523
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,070
I can't take it anymore.

524
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,030
Quit drinking iced drinks
with that bad tooth.

525
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,960
Show me how you devour the chicken bone.

526
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,150
In one gulp.

527
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,880
Let me tell you. Before I left,

528
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,350
I drank three cups of ginger coffee.

529
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,400
I feel like I'm overflowing

530
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,750
with energy right now.

531
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,750
I'm very excited.

532
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,390
Me too. The last time I felt like this

533
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,250
was during the university games.

534
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,810
I can barely keep my eyes opened.

535
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,790
Little Duckling, wake up.

536
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,510
Hurry up. We've a few minutes left.

537
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,860
Stay awake, guys.

538
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,230
Do not forget the plan.

539
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,480
There are three techniques.

540
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,860
Come on, let's go!

541
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,130
[You'd become the king of the jungle.]

542
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,450
[-You'd win every single]
-Goodness, wait up!

543
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,930
[battle you fight.]

544
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,160
What's going on?

545
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,180
Don't step on me!

546
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,350
Help!

547
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,220
The last 15 pieces left!

548
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,020
Ms Zhang, check out this store!

549
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,440
-We will go over there.
-We will move forward.

550
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,860
-What?
-[We shall create a diversion.]

551
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,440
The quality is mediocre.

552
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,900
The lace is ordinary.

553
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,840
Miss, do you have other colours?

554
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,520
All the colours are on display.

555
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,400
All of them?

556
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,600
This feels alright,

557
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,030
but the design isn't great.

558
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,840
[Don't ask for the price right away.]

559
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,830
The clothes are too boring.

560
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,440
[Ask casually for something else.]

561
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,510
Miss, do you have other stuff?

562
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,460
[Don't let them know about
your favourite pieces.]

563
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,310
[Secondly, bluff.]

564
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,960
120 yuan?

565
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,690
They are selling it for 80 over there.

566
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,740
This is 180 yuan. This one too.

567
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
Honestly, miss,

568
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,260
Your clothes are too expensive.

569
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,170
[Other stores are way cheaper.
What's going on?]

570
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,280
They sell the exact same thing.

571
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,610
The designs and materials are similar.

572
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,760
They are only selling it for 60 yuan.

573
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,220
[Pressure them a little.]

574
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,430
Fine, how much do you offer?

575
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,550
[Third, be brutal.]

576
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,990
[Get in there and slash the prices.]

577
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,030
-How much is this?
-150 yuan.

578
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,330
[Slash it by two thirds.]

579
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,060
-Can you do 50?
-No.

580
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,880
[If they disagree, walk away.]

581
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,750
[However, walk a little slower.]

582
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,880
Miss, come back. I'll sell them to you.

583
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,750
[I promise they will call you back.]

584
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,430
These are the last 15 pieces left?

585
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,070
What are those?

586
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360
A customer reserved them.

587
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,490
Only 15 pieces are left.

588
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,460
-Take it or leave it.
-I'll take all of it.

589
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,350
Great. I'm clearing my stocks today.

590
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,890
The emporium just opened
and they are all gone.

591
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,320
Every bit counts.

592
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,580
Make sure to give all 15 to me.

593
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,010
Don't worry.

594
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,670
What do you think?

595
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,110
For this blouse,

596
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,980
we want them in bulk.

597
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,750
Miss.

598
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,110
What are you doing?

599
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,190
What are you doing?

600
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,730

-Stop fighting!

606
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,350
I'll kill you!

607
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,630
Go to hell!

610
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,380

[Live Streaming Alliance,
Xiamen's First Live Streaming Conference]

Look at the time.
Why isn't anyone here yet?

614
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,630
They are probably stuck in traffic.

This is the meeting room.

What do you mean?
I'm here for the meeting.

619
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,050
It says "Live Streaming Alliance"
right there.

I'm fine. That kid is doing worse.

We agreed not to get into fights anymore.

Do it yourself. I don't want to hurt you.

Physical wounds are nothing.

The wounds you inflicted on my heart

They adjusted the price
point of the goods.

675
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,040
This impacts us greatly.

676
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,850
They insulted the spirit
of live streaming.

677
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,320
Only by pulling together as a team

678
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,870
will we have the power
to negotiate with the Apparel Alliance.

679
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,500
I invited everyone over

680
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,250
with the aim of discussing

681
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,990
the establishment of an alliance.

682
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,860
I would like to cooperate with all of you.

683
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,070
We shall unite and oppose
the Apparel Alliance.

684
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,940
We should make a stand

685
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,040
and protect our industry.

686
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,160
We mustn't allow the Apparel Alliance

687
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,700
to affect our passion and spirit.

688
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,700
Am I right?

689
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,130
If you have any ideas,

690
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,350
feel free to voice them out.

691
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,240
Mr Duan, I'll go first.

692
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,260
Go ahead.

693
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,480
I'm not interested in fighting a war
against some enemy.

694
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,390
Maybe in a video game, but that's it.

695
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,980
Furthermore,

696
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,610
our company is small.

697
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,730
We could barely touch
the Apparel Alliance.

698
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,150
Hence,

699
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,870
I'll not get involved
in this strife of yours.

700
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,000
Buddy, don't say that.

701
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,240
This incident

702
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,320
directly affects the
live streaming industry.

703
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,680
Every single company will be implicated.

704
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,790
Once the rule is put into place,

705
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,830
not only will the big companies suffer,

706
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,600
but the small ones, too.

707
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,060
Our company does not rely
on selling branded goods.

708
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,830
Business goes on even without them.

709
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,070
Logically, if Apparel Alliance

710
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,190
forbids you from distributing vouchers,

711
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,190
they'd forbid you from
selling unbranded goods next.

712
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,620
What will you do?

713
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,710
I'll shut my business down
and spend time with my wife.

714
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,290
Mr Duan.

715
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,120
You said something about passion.

716
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,840
I don't get it.

717
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,120
You're the son of QE's boss.

718
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,250
You had a head start in life.

719
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,639
Even if your passion for live streaming

720
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,070
doesn't work out,

721
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,540
you can still pack up

722
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,070
and try something else.

723
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,310
As for the rest of us,

724
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,670
we'd be sitting ducks.

725
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,940
No, guys.

726
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,989
Have a little trust in me.

727
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,420
We need to trust each other.

728
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,699
Since I took the lead to organise this,

729
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,880
I won't give up.

730
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,190
We must fight till the end.

731
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,400
That's the only way

732
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,350
to get what we want.

733
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,239
Thus, I won't abandon all of you.

734
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,739
I'm one of you.

735
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,550
Anyway, why are you here?

736
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,540
The dagger of the Apparel Alliance

737
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,830
is right at our throats.

738
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,830
If we do not show up,

739
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,230
it's over.

740
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,150
This is our last resort.

741
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,120
After the hassle, this is all we got.

742
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,910
It's not going to last a day.

743
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,870
Lang.

744
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,790
I heard about a fight just now.

745
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,160
Were you involved?

746
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,390
No.

747
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,210
There's something I'd like to tell you.

748
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,730
The truck of goods you ordered

749
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,950
is on its way.

750
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,390
Get someone from your
office to receive them.

751
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,500
By the way, Zhu Wan,

752
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,760
work with Xiao Liu to get this done.

753
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,530
-All right.
-Thanks, Xiao Liu.

754
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,990
Don't worry. Excuse me.

755
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,580
Do you know him?

756
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,930
I rushed in just as the emporium opened,

757
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,280
and he told me he's sold out.

758
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,180
Of course.

759
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,640
We go way back.

760
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
We agreed previously

761
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,180
to purchase the goods.

762
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,070
The goods sell really well usually.

763
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,220
During this period of time,

764
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,740
going in there without any connections,

765
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,500
no one would sell you the goods.

766
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,720
It seems like only our company

767
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,310
is excluded from this.

768
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,080
Not necessarily.

769
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,350
As compared to you guys,

770
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,930
we can probably last
two to three days tops.

771
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,420
All right.

772
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,700
Thank you for what you did.

773
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,360
You should be thankful.

774
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,670
But not as much as I am.

775
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,030
Why?

776
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,870
Because if I didn't have the foresight

777
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,630
to come and cause trouble,

778
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,940
I wouldn't have met such a
beautiful girl like you.

779
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,220
It's fate.

780

Mister.

781
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,240
Look at the way I'm dressed.

782
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,440
Do you even have taste?

783
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,870
What's wrong with that?

784
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,910
You look good in anything you wear.

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,590
Fine.

What a smooth talker.

787
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,520
It seems like you're fine.

788
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,260
I'm not. It still hurts.

789
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,320
That's too much. That's enough.

790
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,080
Send me the medical fees
after you get it checked.

791
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,220
I'll compensate.

792
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,910
Forget about that.

To a patient in pain,

is a meal from a goddess.

I'm in no mood for a meal.

Maybe next time.

799

We're from different worlds.

Yes. Especially that part about

What about the goods we
bought from the emporium?

It isn't much.
I divided them over the next few days.

In less than an hour though,

and sells 100 units,

843
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,120
it's nothing compared to handing
out flyers on the streets.

844
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,350
Yes.

845
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,980
All right. The both of them are hustlers.

846
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,280
I'm not expecting
anything from the others.

847
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,800
Singles' Day is coming up.

848
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,280
If we don't figure something out,

849
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,900
it's over for us.

850
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,870
Everything is going to be alright.

851
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,220
Don't worry.

852
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,960
There's something else.

853
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,510
It's something personal.

854
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,470
Come to my office then.

855
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,830
I'll get changed.

856
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,320
Then I'll meet you there.

857
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,390
You...

858
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,540
Are you changing?

859
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,310
What are you doing?

860
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,980
Duan Ran, it's your turn.

861
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,690
It's only a dental filling.
Is all this necessary?

862
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,910
Yes.

863
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,830
It's not serious, is it?

864
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,000
It's not that bad.
The tooth is hitting the nerves.

865
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,310
It might hurt a little.

866
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,870
It's pushing the nerves.

867
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,370
Go easy on me.

868
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,800
I'm afraid of dentists.

869
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,510
Mr Duan.

870
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,530
You're a grown man and
you fear the dentist.

871
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,790
All that lying must be hard
on your teeth.

872
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,360
Mr Chen, why are you here?

873
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,500
What happened to your face?

874
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,760
Did someone punch you?

875
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,910
What a loser.

876
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,630
I got hurt at work.

877
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,560
I did this for love.

878
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,740
Doctor, if anything happens,

879
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,290
just do whatever you need.
I do not fear pain.

880
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,870
It's hard to say with the one next to me.

881
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,900
He's a spoiled kid.

882
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,220
Just be prepared.

883
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,980
You broke a tooth.

884
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,670
It might hurt a little.

885
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,550
Is it really going to hurt?

886
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,840
How much will it hurt?

887
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,710
Stop talking.

888
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,310
Are you going to get it checked or not?

889
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,260
If not, get out of here.

890
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,040
Doctor, just remove this tooth.
I don't want it anymore.

891
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,980
That's enough banter.

892
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:47,310
Open up. We will start the treatment.

893
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:54,080
Relax. Open your mouth. Don't be afraid.

894
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,550
Go easy, please.

895
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,070
Relax. Yes, that's the way.

896
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,140
Don't move.

897
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:16,950
You want a day off?

898
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,880
Where are you going all dressed up?

899
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,900
You're wearing the
freesia scented perfume.

900
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,150
I'm going on a blind date.

901
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,010
My mum has been bugging me
about it since last week.

902
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,660
I have to go today.

903
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,750
But you're on duty.

904
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,660
Who's going to manage the control room?
