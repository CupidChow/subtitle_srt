[We Are Young]

[Episode 33]

4
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,620
There're more mistakes.

5
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,900
What else?

6
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,570
There is.

7
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,620
There is.

8
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:16,780
There is.

9
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,740
Jiang Zhe Yang.

10
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,430
I shouldn't have imagined things.

11
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,630
There's nothing between the two of you.

12
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,210
I shouldn't be jealous, right?

13
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,210
Can you forgive me?

14
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,470
I forgive you.

15
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,430
I'm relieved now.

16
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:44,990
I'm back.

17
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,320
You're finally back, Xi Xi.

18
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,820
-Lu Hui.
-I'll take that.

19
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,300
You've not eaten, right?

20
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,100
Something delicious for you.

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,979
Really?

22
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,740
Just join in.

23
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,340
I miss you so much.

24
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,750
What took you so long?

25
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,100
Settled your things?

26
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,980
I came to tender my resignation.

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,100
I've informed the HR department.

28
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,139
Why so sudden?

29
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,260
Are you having a problem?

30
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,650
My old company

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,140
is facing some problems.

32
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,510
Didn't you know, Lu Hui?

33
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,770
I was interested in our factory rejects.

34
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,340
Actually, I'm trying to help

35
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,630
my old company to resolve its problems.

36
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,710
It'll be a tough challenge ahead.

37
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,860
I can't keep on staying here.

38
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,480
My old colleagues needs me.

39
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,460
No wonder you got interested
in the factory rejects.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,070
You were trying to help them.

41
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,660
Too bad we couldn't be of help.

42
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,670
Still,

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,270
you're the smartest girl I've ever known.

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,620
I'm sure you can do it.

45
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,820
I hope so.

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,460
I can do it.

47
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,260
I can do it.

48
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,100
I can do it.

49
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,180
I can do it.

50
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,520
Hello, everyone. I'm Mr Five.

51
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,070
Today, I'm going to show you

52
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,870
the unique shirt which I mentioned

53
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,010
in my live last time.

54
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,220
[And I'm wearing it]

55
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,680
[right now for all to see.]

56
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,750
[It may be an ordinary shirt
with its appearance.]

57
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,280
[It's more than that.]

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,540
[It's actually a sweater.]

59
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,380
Are you amazed?

60
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,900
My idea is to wear a blouse

61
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,260
together with my sweater

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,310
to match them up.

63
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,670
[Here comes Mr Five.
Is this a double shirt? Jacket?]

64
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,630
[What's that? Kind of low-class.]

65
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,100
And they're sewed together.

66
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,170
The sweater and the colour...

67
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,590
[The clothes are weird.]
[Looks nice.]

68
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,130
[What kind of design is this?]

69
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,090
[Is this a hoax?]

70
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,310
The poor response was unexpected.

71
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,820
Her design is strange indeed.

72
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,540
I think it's not too bad.

73
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,100
Time's too short.

74
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,070
The link's ready.

75
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,180
Should I proceed?

76
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,700
Yes.

77
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,610
We want to know
the viewers' acceptance, right?

78
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,970
[Are you sure you want
to recommend this product?]

79
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,050
[Confirm]

80
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,100
Hope we'll get some orders.

81
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,340
At least this is acceptable.

82
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,380
[Why doesn't Mr Five explain?]
[It's not really high-class.]

83
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,820
It's not classy.

84
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,540
Maybe you haven't looked closely.

85
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,220
My...

86
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,220
This shirt...

87
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,750
The material is different.

88
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,530
[Ugly.]
[It's not really high-class.]

89
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,570
[So ugly.]

90
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,190
Xiao Wu.

91
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,420
Xiao Wu.

92
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,140
The screen, Su Su.

93
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,540
-Where's she?
-Xiao Wu!

94
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,510
Where are you going, Xiao Wu?

95
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,260
Xiao Wu.

96
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,700
Xiao Wu.

97
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,540
Xiao Wu.

98
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,870
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,250
Xiao Wu, can you open the door?

100
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,060
Don't lock yourself up.

101
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,500
Let's face it together,

102
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,630
okay, Xiao Wu?

103
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,710
-Xiao Wu.
-Stop it.

104
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,990
Let's give her a break.

105
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:33,940
Don't be sad.

106
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,710
Take your time

107
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,909
to make yourself feel better.

108
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,640
I'll be right outside.

109
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,870
I'll be here with you.

110
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,220
What's going on?

111
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,450
I thought perhaps

112
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,200
there's some good news today.

113
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,340
Luckily, she has Mao.

114
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,480
She should be better in no time.

115
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,970
I guess Mr Five

116
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,380
has messed up the show.

117
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,659
I heard

118
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,660
Mr Duan Sr fainted during
the tripartite negotiation

119
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,260
and was sent to the hospital.

120
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,470
Mr Duan Jr has informed me.

121
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,780
He wants Ms Qian to take his place

122
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,070
in the negotiation with the alliances.

123
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,660
Xi Xi is going for the negotiation?

124
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,660
I got the news

125
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,670
that some live streaming
companies are backing out.

126
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,220
Even Chen Lang is
backing out at this time.

127
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,510
We can't count on him.

128
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,710
I really...

129
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,750
We could be losing this time.

130
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,640
Over here, Mr Wu.

131
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,870
Xi Xi.

132
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,190
It's been long time.

133
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,710
What's up?

134
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,659
I have a request.

135
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,780
I'm looking for a key.

136
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,710
Interesting.

137
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,310
What kind of key?

138
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,170
A golden key

139
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,820
that opens up a whole new world

140
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,420
for all the three alliances.

141
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,630
So I'm the golden key?

142
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,590
You may no longer the CEO

143
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,920
but you surely are getting more humorous.

144
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,910
It's an uphill task

145
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,260
and I can do nothing.

146
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,780
No, Mr Wu.

147
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,870
You can help us.

148
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,990
Listen.

149
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,870
Rui and Pineapple Xpress

150
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,200
have been cooperating countless times.

151
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,590
Sanya's emergency live streaming.

152
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,750
And the impromptu live streaming
during the power outage.

153
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,940
We've been doing our best

154
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,220
for you many times.

155
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,740
Every time, we were profitable, right?

156
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,820
I know.

157
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,850
Rui has been dedicated
itself to sell our products.

158
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,350
I'm grateful to you.

159
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,260
Now I'm seeking a justice for the company.

160
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,350
Something is unfair.

161
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,630
The Entity Alliance's
proposal is unacceptable.

162
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,100
The Live Streaming Alliance

163
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,760
possess a small market share.

164
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,190
But at least there's 30%.

165
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,340
Isn't it a loss to you, too?

166
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,260
You're right.

167
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,740
I'm caught in the middle

168
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,880
of the tussle between the alliances.

169
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,240
Hope you understand my situation.

170
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,540
All right. I know it's hard for you.

171
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,150
Actually, I haven't been to Rui recently.

172
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,290
I was doing sales

173
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,040
in a Pineapple Xpress outlet.

174
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,820
I've done a simple observation.

175
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,659
There's a huge of number

176
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,520
of factory rejects in the outlet.

177
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,230
I just wonder

178
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,179
if I can sell the factory rejects.

179
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,630
It's impossible.

180
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,980
Why?

181
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,630
You're throwing them aside.

182
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,430
Why not selling them for profit?

183
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,140
The outlets have the customary rules.

184
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,710
You know full well as a CEO previously.

185
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,650
Customary rules.

186
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,750
What's that?

187
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,840
There're rules to observe.

188
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,630
I have no control over this.

189
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,250
My hands are tied

190
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
on this matter.

191
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,900
There're strict regulations
within the company.

192
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,430
I'm giving you an advice as a friend.

193
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,920
Accept the Entity Alliance's proposal.

194
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,340
Resistance is futile.

195
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,460
I got it.

196
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,460
Jia Yun, listen.

197
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,690
Now I need you

198
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,910
to do something very important for me.

199
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,020
[When a beam of light enters a corner
of Xiamen, a group of people enjoy it.]

200
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,740
[Light]

201
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,460
Xi Xi.

202
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,900
You look pretty today.

203
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,510
Thanks for your compliment, Uncle Shen.

204
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,830
In fact, I think so.

205
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm glad

206
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,580
you have the confidence.

207
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,460
Today's negotiation
will be extremely tough.

208
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,790
Get yourself prepared.

209
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,470
I'm not worried.

210
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,460
Because I have you.

211
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,100
There's nothing I can do to help you.

212
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,220
Just like Duan,

213
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,970
I have full confidence in you.

214
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,580
It's okay. There's comforting.

215
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,220
Song.

216
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,940
This is Xi Xi.

217
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,680
She's representing Duan Ran.

218
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,020
Hello, Mr Song.

219
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,460
Qian Xi Xi.

220
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,990
We had a young kid.

221
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,430
And now we have a young lady.

222
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,310
Cut it out.

223
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,870
You're humorous, Mr Song.

224
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,140
Today,
I'm just a temporary representation.

225
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,000
My words will still be Duan Ran's.

226
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Fine.

227
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,140
Let's not waste any more time.

228
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,150
You can do it.

229
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,390
No problem.

230
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,990
Let's get started.

231
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,830
Is Mr Five okay?

232
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,190
Mao is keeping her company.

233
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,340
She should be fine.

234
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,220
I'm just worried they might chide

235
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,020
and chased us out.

236
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,460
You'll never know. Let's try it.

237
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,430
Where are they?

238
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,660
I've no idea.

239
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,900
There it is.

240
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,870
-It's here.
-Thanks for coming.

241
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,700
Hope to see you again.

242
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,860
Bye.

243
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,930
Hello.

244
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,900
Hello.

245
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,660
Are you Lu Hui?

246
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,870
Yes.

247
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,660
We're Xi Xi's friends.

248
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,510
We need to talk to you.

249
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,230
You're friends of Xi Xi.
Great, please come in.

250
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,900
-Sure.
-Let's go.

251
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,270
We have some guests.

252
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,670
They're Xi Xi's friends.

253
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,340
You're Xi Xi's friends?

254
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

255
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,710
Hello.

256
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,950
It's important, so let me
get straight to the point.

257
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,020
Mr Song.

258
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,250
You've made a proposal on
behalf of the Entity Alliance

259
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,580
and Apparel Alliance.

260
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,660
We've done a careful consideration.

261
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,870
I'm sorry. It's unacceptable for us.

262
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,660
I can promise you.

263
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,100
You won't be held responsible

264
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,270
for the information you give

265
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,780
no matter what happens in the future.

266
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,830
Do you agree?

267
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,050
You're friends of Xi Xi.

268
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,340
She's my friend, too.

269
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,270
Despite that, there's nothing

270
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,770
we can do about this.

271
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,020
If there's nothing else,

272
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,420
I need to get back to work.

273
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,750
Now what, Jia Yun?

274
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,000
I feel like going home to sleep.

275
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,340
Really?

276
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,990
I saw some nice restaurants.

277
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,430
Let's have something to eat.

278
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,780
We can't eat now.

279
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,740
I was only just saying.

280
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,130
We, the Live Streaming Alliance
had an internal discussion

281
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,070
and hope we can be the sole
agents for the Entity Alliance

282
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,650
and Apparel Alliance.

283
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,300
In other words,

284
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,100
the live streaming companies

285
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,310
will only sell specific products.

286
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,380
There's no overlapping of products between
physical outlets and online businesses.

287
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,070
The idea sounds perfect.

288
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,190
Come on.

289
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,100
Excuse me.

290
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,130
Why don't we go out

291
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,510
and have a chat?

292
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,380
No matter what products we provide to you,

293
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,020
you still could use discounts and coupons

294
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,880
to disrupt the market prices.

295
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,830
The physical outlets are
still on the losing end.

296
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,190
Mr Song.

297
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,020
Don't worry.

298
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,490
We'll develop a special system

299
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,100
and clear rules.

300
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,220
Ms Qian.

301
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,190
If we do that,

302
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,580
there could be ambiguities.

303
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,380
And there'll be a waste
of manpower and materials.

304
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,700
I've considered

305
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,380
about your concern, Mr Mu Jr.

306
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,900
My idea may not be necessarily

307
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,630
worse than standardizing
the prices, right?

308
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,830
I've thought about my idea.

309
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,310
We'll have specific customization

310
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,020
for specific brands.

311
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,780
It'll work.

312
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,200
It's really unexpected

313
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,610
that Xi Xi was having tough times.

314
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,630
She's positive and cheerful,

315
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,010
and responsible, too.

316
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,740
The painful experiences made
her to become what she is today.

317
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,340
Since our company was having trouble,

318
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,220
she resigned and totally

319
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,100
put the blame on herself.

320
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,290
Then she came here to work for you.

321
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,810
She had a good time working here

322
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,830
and was so happy.

323
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,100
She mentioned about you

324
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,030
that she's grateful for your care.

325
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,510
She's really in need of help this time.

326
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,270
I'm begging you.

327
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,850
Hope you could lend her your hand.

328
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,100
I'm sorry. There are company regulations.

329
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,430
There's nothing I can do about this.

330
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,100
How did it go?

331
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,990
I failed.

332
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,390
I've said it clearly.

333
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,550
We'll separate the products
and there'll be no overlapping.

334
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,940
You can buy it offline
if you can't get it online.

335
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,030
It's fair to both parties.

336
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,940
Fairness?

337
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,790
It's only fair if it
satisfies the interests

338
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,620
of the majority.

339
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,660
Don't you think what
we've been talking about

340
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,080
satisfies the interests of the majority?

341
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,700
The market share of the
live streaming companies may be small.

342
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,020
But it shouldn't be ignored, right?

343
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,030
Through this negotiation,

344
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,300
I hope everyone will carefully consider

345
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,990
what I've said today.

346
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,030
That includes you, Mr Song.

347
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,360
I hope you can think from our perspective.

348
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,690
There's nothing to consider about.

349
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,060
I've already put your concerns

350
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,060
into consideration in my proposal.

351
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,790
We should all agree to it.

352
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,220
Do not test our patience.

353
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,580
Well,

354
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,390
aren't we going to help Xi Xi?

355
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,740
They really need our help.

356
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,030
Please.

357
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,020
There're two spare sets of
work clothes in the storeroom.

358
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,950
Tell them the departure location.

359
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,220
That's all we can help.

360
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,630
It's done.

361
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,150
Excuse me.

362
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,420
Hello.

363
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,380
Are you both new here?

364
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,550
-Have they moved?
-Not yet.

365
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,550
Let's go.

366
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,060
Put on the safety belt.

367
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,900
They're moving.

368
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,300
-They're moving?
-They're moving.

369
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,700
You'll be the navigator.

370
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,100
Just sign the agreement.

371
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,290
The Singles' Day is coming up.

372
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,550
Don't waste your precious time.

373
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,820
Now what?

374
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,870
Aren't we selling these?

375
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,170
[Perfect Blue]

376
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,270
Why so many questions?

377
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,060
This is the warehouse
of the recycling yard.

378
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,460
They won't be sold

379
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,140
after going into the warehouse.

380
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,220
Don't you think it's a waste?

381
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,820
Can't you sell them with a discount?

382
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,170
What are you thinking?

383
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,270
These are unsellable.

384
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,790
Stop doing that.

385
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,870
-I didn't do it.
-Give me your phone!

386
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,870
-I was just doing a selfie.
-No, you can't.

387
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,820
-It was just a selfie.
-Let me see.

388
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,330
Let me see.

389
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,730
Let me see.

390
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,870
We need to check it, okay?

391
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,400
This is a private property.

392
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,060
-I'm calling the cops.
-Just let me see.

393
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,180
You can't take my phone away.

394
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,060
Let go of me.

395
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,220
We just want to check it, okay?

396
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,180
Selfie isn't allowed.

397
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,440
Selfie isn't allowed.

398
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,790
[Stop it.]

399
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,270
[Stop bullying us.]

400
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,420
[Just taking a look.]

401
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,670
[Just taking a look.]

402
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,200
[Get your hands off me.]

403
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,900
What's going on, Xi Xi?

404
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,030
Can't we make a compromise, Uncle Shen?

405
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,420
Let us work together.

406
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,060
This will be beneficial for everyone.

407
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,050
Why do we have to fight with each other

408
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,450
and both end up as losers?

409
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,340
She's even more stubborn than Duan Ran.

410
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,790
Do you think doing business
is as easy as you said?

411
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,060
You're breaking the rules

412
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,420
and taking the profits away from us.

413
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,700
Isn't that enough?

414
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,840
Remember this. Don't ever do this again.

415
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,070
Just get out of here!

416
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,550
-Go away.
-Just leave.

417
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,420
-Just leave.
-Why are you so furious?

418
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,890
I don't want to see you again.

419
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,890
Got it!

420
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,790
-Hurry up.
-Hurry up.

421
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,990
Just go away.

422
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,300
-Leave now.
-Leave now.

423
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,020
What should we do? We can't help Xi Xi.

424
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,490
They're annoying.

425
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,670
They're too strong for us.

426
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,080
I can't fight with them.

427
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,100
I can't beat them, let alone you.

428
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,510
-Not even one photo is kept?
-No.

429
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,060
I'll send someone to Guangzhou

430
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,750
and Shenzhen to look again.

431
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,790
He's leaving now.

432
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,550
Give me the car key.

433
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,540
Are you going to the meeting?

434
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,790
I was thinking about what
Duan Ran and Jia Yun said.

435
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,990
I think what they said

436
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,690
could be right.

437
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,990
Are we going to work together?

438
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,470
I don't know. We'll just see.

439
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,340
You've been given enough time.

440
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,750
Uncle Shen,

441
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,510
can we have a five-minute break?

442
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,390
It's tiring.

443
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,980
Time to take a short rest.

444
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,160
Let's take a break.

445
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,580
Is it appropriate to deliver

446
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,100
this season's high-end factory rejects

447
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,780
to the warehouse of the recycling yard?

448
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,710
What's going on?

449
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,560
There was a situation
but it's now resolved.

450
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,030
Someone was trying to take some photos.
But they've chased him away.

451
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,580
We have to be extra careful

452
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,930
especially at this
critical time, Mr Wu.

453
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,510
-Xi Xi.
-Hello.

454
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,820
What's it?

455
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,820
I knew about something.

456
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,270
So I want to talk to the both of you.

457
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,750
We shall talk about it, Mr Wu.

458
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,270
What is it?

459
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,300
Recently I've been investigating

460
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,300
your factory rejects.

461
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,030
You're willing to send
the items for recycling

462
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,830
than selling them at a discount.

463
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,420
Aren't you want to
make your accounts

464
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,950
and sale figures look nice?

465
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,210
It's a bargaining chip

466
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,850
in the negotiation.

467
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,630
Think about the consequences

468
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,940
if the evidence

469
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,820
is exposed to the public.

470
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,640
Have you thought about it?

471
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,940
This is not true, Xi Xi.

472
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,930
Show us your evidence.

473
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,900
I have it.

474
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,180
Show us then.

475
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,670
I have all kinds of evidence.

476
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,510
Photos and videos.

477
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,270
The voice recordings

478
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,550
of the delivery driver,

479
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,540
warehouse and outlet staff

480
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,060
are all with me.

481
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,100
Just show me.

482
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,580
The evidence is kept secure.

483
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,830
She doesn't have it.

484
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,510
It's all here.

485
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,750
Listen.

486
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,540
It's not easy for local brands.

487
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,060
Don't imitate the foreign brands

488
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,860
and do all kinds of weird things.

489
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,580
If you don't have the evidence,

490
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,530
then don't think of resisting us.

491
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,300
I just don't want to do the inevitable.

492
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,460
Mr Wu and Mr Mu Jr,

493
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,780
you've seen Mr Song's persistence

494
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,420
in the negotiation.

495
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,700
He's having the upper hand.

496
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,150
Honestly speaking,

497
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,270
no matter what happens,

498
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,030
once there's an outcome,

499
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,610
the two of you

500
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,960
are still the winners.

501
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,760
So why can't you help me on this?

502
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,580
On qualifications, means and vision,

503
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,030
you're no less than Duan Sheng Yun.

504
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,550
Why aren't you entrusted
for this negotiation?

505
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,390
I'm a member of the Entity Alliance,

506
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,700
do you think it's proper
for me to speak for others?

507
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,670
Moreover,

508
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,820
Xi Xi is Duan's adopted daughter.

509
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,460
It's reasonable for her to come forward.

510
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,030
It's the same.

511
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,460
Whether it's Duan Ran or her,

512
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,420
they're the same.

513
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,180
The outcome is final,
nobody can change it.

514
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,270
Now,

515
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,420
what are we supposed to do?

516
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,570
We lack of products

517
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,290
and we're in serious trouble.

518
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,580
Can't you consider about
our business relationship?

519
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,150
It was a difficult time

520
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,700
during the Pineapple Xpress Special.

521
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,390
I even cleaned the male toilet for you.

522
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,410
Do you remember this?

523
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,390
Do you?

524
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,630
And you, Mr Mu Jr.

525
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,700
The Perfect Blue's facial fair incident.

526
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,580
You know

527
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,340
that it was even tougher for us.

528
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,820
I've talked to Duan Ran about it

529
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,420
and even gave him an apology.

530
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,290
We're not the same.

531
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,150
I suffered considerably in this matter.

532
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,990
Just think about the business
relationship we built over the years.

533
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,910
Mr Song has immense
influence in this industry.

534
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,950
Nobody dares to go against him.

535
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,530
I believe you both are smart guys.

536
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,910
You ignore our business relationship.

537
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,390
And you even don't accept my reasons.

538
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,550
Now you're forcing me
to expose the evidence.

539
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,870
I'm warning you guys.

540
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,790
So be it.

541
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,060
I'll see what you're going
to do on the negotiation table.

542
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060

I've got what I deserve.

561
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,030
Furthermore,
Duan has been treating me well.

562
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,670
Okay. I hope what you said is the truth.

Are you having new ideas, Xi Xi?

568

We can continue until
everyone else returns.

569

Anyway, the outcome is set.

570

Everyone is back. Now let's start.

573
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,630
The members of the
Live Streaming Alliance

574
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,340
can sign the agreement now

575

if you have no objection.

576
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,750
I'm sorry, Mr Song.

577
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,520
Allow me to interrupt.

578
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,030
Now we have a new proposal.

579
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,080
We just had a discussion earlier.

580
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,590
We agree to the
Live Streaming Alliance's proposal.

581
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,850
We'll work with them

582
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,300
and they shall be our
sole agents for our products.

583

can be sold at a discount

I suspect you're having
a sideline job in the office.

594
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,910

00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,750
-Sit with me.
-Make a wish.

678
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,310
-Then we'll eat the cake.
-Yes.

679
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,240
Yuanbao and I are exhausted today.

680
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,830
Making a wish?

681
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,400
Isn't it too formal?

682
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,660
Three candles for the CEO.

683
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,830
Three candles for three wishes.

684
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,870
Fine.

685
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,950
-Just that?
-That quick?

686
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,200
-Blow the candles.
-Blow the candles.

687
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,420
What's your wish, Xi Xi?

688
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
Do I have to say it?

689
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,190
Tell us.

690
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,010
You're fine.

691
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,220
I'm fine

692
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Everyone's fine.

693
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,500
Xi Xi.

694
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,640
You're finally back, Xi Xi.

695
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,310
-The cake...
-I've always been here.

696
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,030
-One, two, three,...
-I miss you, Xi Xi.

697
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,790
-Is it like this?
-I miss you, too.

698
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,230
-Xi Xi.
-Now you're thin.

699
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,610
Don't ever leave us again.

700
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,030
Xi Xi gets the first piece.

701
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,580
I want Jia Yun to have it.

702
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,950
Why is that?

703
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,270
The person I want to
thank the most is you.

704
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,660
Why are we still talking about this?

705
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,770
Go ahead.

706
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,940
It's yours.

707
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,700
I want you to take the burden
of the CEO off me at once

708
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,790
after you finish your cake.

709
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,470
-I see.
-This is for Su Su.

710
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,270
I'm starving.

711
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,020
What's going on with you?

712
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,420
God bless.

713
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,130
I hope your dad's surgery

714
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,460
is successful.

715
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,660
I believe dad is just going to be fine.

716
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,830
Angioplasty is just a simple surgery.

717
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,490
This kind of surgery has
a high successful rate.

718
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,220
I know and I believe it.

719
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,090
I just wish everything goes smoothly.

720
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,860
Don't worry.

721
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,650
It's not necessary

722
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,660
for you to come here this time.

723
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,110
I'm here alone is just fine.

724
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,110
It's a long trip for you to come here.

725
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,270
Dad is unwell now,

726
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,790
if anything happens to you,

727
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,920
what am I going to do?

728
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,830
I'm willing to do anything

729
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,510
for your dad.

730
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,140
-Fine.
-You dropped something.

731
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,110
-Well...
-What's it for?

732
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,150
The amulet is for my colleague.

733
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,990
Coming.

734
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,660
Duan Ran.

735
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,860
Hold on, let me put on the hands free.

736
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,370
How's Uncle Duan's surgery?

737
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,420
It was successful.

738
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,700
[Now he's recovering.]

739
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,460
This is indeed the greatest news.

740
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,590
[Yes.]

741
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,990
What about you? Do you miss me?

742
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,890
Yes, I do.

743
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,270
That's right.

744
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,030
Just bear with me for a couple of days.

745
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,030
I'll be back once my dad gets better.

746
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,940
Quickly come back once you're done.

747
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,140
We hope to see you back on
our very first Singles' Day.

748
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,020
Is that okay?

749
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,940
The Singles' Day is a big event.

750
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,620
All of you will feel sorry
if I'm not there.

751
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,420
Who'll be sorry? Or you'll be sorry?

752
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,510
Why do I have to be sorry?

753
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,140
I wish to be by your side,

754
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,220
and witness everyone become rich.

755
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,900
Aren't you born to be rich?

756
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,310
[We get rich together.]

757
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,460
You're right.

758
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,380
I wish everyone is well.

759
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,140
I'm just worried about you.

760
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,620
On the one hand, you're the CEO of Rui.

761
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,830
On the other hand, you're the
leader of the Live Streaming Alliance.

762
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,290
You may exhaust yourself.

763
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,790
Won't you have no time for me?

764
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,940
What should I do then?

765
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,790
Then why not let Jia Yun

766
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,550
continue to be the CEO of Rui Live?
