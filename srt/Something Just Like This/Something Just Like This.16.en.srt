[Episode 16]

4
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,670
Unlike entertainment platforms,
e-commerce platforms

5
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,930
don't have as much conflicts or gossips.

6
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,700
Here, I'm able to earn money
with my own capability

7
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,960
instead of seeking rewards from others.

8
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,260
Every bit of effort I put in

9
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,039
is rewarded accordingly.

10
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,240
If you ask me
whether I wish to be on this live stream,

11
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,510
to be honest, I want to, so badly.

12
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,810
I really treasure this opportunity.

13
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,090
For that, I lost 5 pounds.

14
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,400
I saw all Jiang Zhe Yang's work.

15
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,390
Even when I'm dreaming in my sleep,

16
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,759
I'd be memorizing Perfect Blue's
product information.

17
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,850
I'm very hardworking.

18
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,850
I deserve this.

19
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,300
However, now, I gave up

20
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,110
because I don't want all my

21
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,040
colleagues' effort to go to waste.

22
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,570
I don't want us to end up with nothing.

23
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,570
Ma'am,

24
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,060
thank you for your recognition.

25
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,800
It is a pity

26
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,840
that I'm unable to work with
Jiang Zhe Yang this time.

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,660
The live stream will begin very soon.

28
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,210
You all still have a lot of work to do,

29
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,190
so I won't waste your time.

30
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,560
Yuan Yuan, what can I say?

31
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,790
Thank you for considering
the overall situation.

32
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,100
However, I hope

33
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,720
you can also understand my concerns.

34
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,890
Yuan Yuan,

35
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,650
we also regret it very much.

36
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,670
So, what to do, Mr Duan?

37
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,230
Are we still proceeding?

38
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,170
If yes, we need to quickly get ready.

39
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,620
If not, let's get going right now.

40
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,520
Yes, we are doing it.

41
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,380
We have to do it.

42
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,750
We have to do this live stream.

43
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,480
I'll broadcast it for
Yuan Yuan's sake as well.

44
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,670
Sure.

45
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,170
All right, now that the problem is solved,

46
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,210
and I have no other business here,

47
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,090
I...

48
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll go buy a cup of coffee.

49
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
You two carry on.

50
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,860
What else do you want to say? I...

51
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,900
You were asking for trouble.

52
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,910
Hello.

53

[Ms Ouyang, Yang Yang went missing.]

[He's not answering calls. What to do?]

55
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,780
Keep on calling!

56
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,340
Did you check the washroom?

57
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,710
[Yes, he was not there either.]

58
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,780
Keep searching!

59
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,530
[All right.
I'll go out and search for him.]

60
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,130
Jiang Zhe Yang went missing.

61
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,650
I'll come over now.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,190
Where did he go this time?

63
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,650
Let's check the washroom.

64
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,930
Here, I brought you all
few cans of Coca-Cola Zero.

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,140
Go ahead and drink.

66
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,220
Thank you.

67
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,190
Jia Yun.

68
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,090
I'm not drinking.
I just finished applying lipstick.

69
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,950
Okay. In that case, I'll drink it.

70
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,770
I happen to be thirsty.

71
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,530
So, what exactly is going on
with Sister Yuan Yuan?

72
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,100
Did something strange happen to her?

73
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,880
Something strange?

74
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,520
What happened?

75
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,550
I have no idea. It was just a guess.

76
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,970
Don't take it seriously.

77
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,150
I thought I could escape this fate
for once.

78
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,550
I still have to memorize
scripts after all.

79
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,080
If it was me,

80
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,540
if I get to memorize script
for Jiang Zhe Yang's sake,

81
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,170
I would be so happy.

82
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,820
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Jia Yun.

83

[Paragon Centre]

85
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,440
Hey.

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,770
Have you seen the photos I sent you?

87
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,490
I did not expect to run into you here.

88
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,410
-Where did he go?
-I don't know.

89
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,470
At this rate, will the live stream
go on as scheduled?

90
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,350
Stop joking.

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,360
Let's go and get changed.

92
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,670
There's no need.

93
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,780
Why not?

94
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,700
Did you find him?

95
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,230
What do you want to drink?

96
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,960
Americano, as usual?

97
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,940
Where is my box?

98
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,170
Quick, hurry!

99
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,750
Fellow broadcasters, are you ready?

100
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,020
Quick, quick!
Let's go to the set, come on!

101
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
Have you seen my blue suitcase?

102
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,180
Jia Yun, stop memorizing.

103
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,150
Let's go, let's go.

104
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,870
-Do it on your way there.
-Blue suitcase?

105
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,060
I saw it at the
reception counter just now.

106
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,520
-Reception counter?
-Hurry, hurry! Quick!

107
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,870
Jiang Jin Suo!

108
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,030
Thank you. Good work.

109
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,830
Excuse me.

110
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,790
Sorry.

111
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,920
Jiang Jin Suo!

112
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,430
What are you doing?

113
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,220
The live stream is about to begin.
Come on, hurry!

114
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,420
I was looking for you.
You need to hurry.

115
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,210
I looked everywhere for you.

116
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,990
-We don't have time.
-I just wanted to play piano for awhile.

117
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,220
It has been so long
since I last played.

118
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,080
This is not the time to play piano!

119
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,090
Do you know if Su Su
helped me to carry it?

120
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,870
Su Su was carrying a notebook.

121
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,700
I can't talk anymore. I need to get going.

122
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,340
Come on, hurry, Cola!

123
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,360
Come on, let's go, Yuanbao! Hurry!

124
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,180
This won't do.

125
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,820
-What are you doing?
-This won't do. I forgot something.

126
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,910
It is very important.

127
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,110
No, don’t! You can't leave!

128
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,840
You are the mascot for tonight.

129
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,580
-You can't leave.
-You... Get someone else to wear it.

130
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,710
I can't, I have to go.

131
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,910
Oh no, we are in trouble.

132
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,170
We don't have a replacement.

133
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,310
Go get your face and hair set, quick.

134
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,540
Xi Xi, we are such good friends.

135
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,390
If you need my help,

136
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,680
just ask.

137
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,740
-Really?
-Of course.

138
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,610
I'll remember that.

139
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,190
Of course.
I'll go in and get ready.

140
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,440
I'll lead them through that access later.

141
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,030
-Sure.
-Go ahead and get ready.

142
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,760
-See you later.
-See you later.

143
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,780
How dare you pinch me?

144
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,510
No one else could find him,

145
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,430
and you did. What a coincidence.

146
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,620
That's not it. I was down there.

147
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,110
And?

148
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,830
I don't know why either.
It is such a coincidence.

149
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,930
I just found him.

150
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,020
This could be, what do you call that?

151
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,800
Destiny.

152
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,140
What destiny are you talking about?

153
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,200
That does not seem to be the case to me.

154
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,710
No?

155
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,140
It is obviously destiny.

156
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,470
That's why, I said you have poor eyesight.

157
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,320
Not only that, you also aren't
aware of what is happening.

158
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,470
Say that again.
Say that again, I dare you.

159
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,600
It hurts! I'll stop.

160
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,200
-Do you admit you are wrong?
-I'm sorry, I really am.

161
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
Watch it, be careful.

162
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,300
We have a problem.

163
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,020
Mr Duan, Yuanbao suddenly left

164
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,510
right before the show.

165
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,880
She took off the mascot costume.

166
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,600
How are we going to find a
substitute on such a short notice?

167
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,330
Wait, how is that possible?

168
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,510
Yuanbao could not have left.

169
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,110
She still wants to take photos
with Jiang Zhe Yang.

170
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,520
She really did.

171
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,840
I'm in charge of finance.

172
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,670
Ms Qian, you can wear it instead.

173
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,420
Me?

174
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,870
This bear's head is huge and I'm so short.

175
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,240
It will swallow me.

176
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,950
It suits you. Hurry, quick!

177
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,600
-Put it on, quickly!
-I...

178
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,480
Duan Ran!

179
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,030
You keep bullying me!

180
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,430
You look quite cute in it.

181
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,650
It really suits you.

182
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,810
Hold it.

183
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,620
It is dusty all over.

184
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,330
Quick, tell me how I should act.
Should I be more cheerful?

185
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,820
After putting on this head,

186
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,420
you can do whatever you want.

187
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,730
-No one recognizes me anyway.
-That's right.

188
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,190
Duan Ran, do me a favour.

189
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
What is it?

190
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,940
Don't tell anyone

191
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,590
it is me inside the mascot costume, okay?

192
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,470
Anyone?

193
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,610
You are just afraid
Jiang Zhe Yang will find out.

194
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,040
He is a celebrity.

195
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,750
And he even complimented me just now.

196
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,090
Now I'm dressed like this,

197
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,950
the person acting as his mascot,

198
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,330
it will be too embarrassing.

199
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,730
Well, I think it is great.

200
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,400
It is so furry. How cute.

201
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,680
It makes me feel like hugging it.

202
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,810
Let me try and hug it.

203
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,040
This feels very comfortable, right?

204
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,970
It is so hot. Let go of me!

205
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,600
-It feels comfortable?
-Yes.

206
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,000
-You want to hug it?
-Yes.

207
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,080
In that case, promise me
you won't tell him.

208
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,960
Deal?

209
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,720
All right, put it on, quick.

210
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,040
You have hairs all over your suit.

211
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,600
Will this do?

212
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,900
-Is it on properly?
-Yes.

213
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,950
Can you see where you are going?

214
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,080
All right, go ahead.

215
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,690
What are you doing?

216
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,330
-Go ahead, quick.
-Stop it.

217
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,070
Look, everyone. This is Cola.

218
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,430
Hello, everyone. Hello, darlings.

219
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,520
Welcome to the set of
Jiang Zhe Yang's

220
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,430
live stream with Perfect Blue.

221
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,890
Thank you.

222
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,030
You are welcome.

223
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,890
Hello, everyone. To those of you
who are online or here at the set,

224
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,400
welcome to today's live stream room.

225
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,680
Today, we are at QE mall

226
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,670
to bring you this interactive live stream.

227
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,050
Is everyone also super excited

228
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,830
to be able to see our guest today,

229
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,880
Mr Jiang Zhe Yang?

230
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,930
Say hi to everyone, quick.

231
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,430
Hi, everyone.

232
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,660
I'm Jiang Zhe Yang.

233
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,190
Hi, everyone.

234
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,310
Oh right, today, we also have
an adorable guest with us.

235
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,610
And it is our mascot,

236
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,580
Xiao Mo Mo.

237
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,230
Here, let's welcome her.

238
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,060
Come on, Mo Mo. Come over here.

239
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,060
Mo Mo, let's exercise
together for awhile.

240
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,540
Mo Mo, slow down.

241
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,310
We can't dance as fast as you.

242
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,140
Isn't Mo Mo adorable?

243
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,250
The fans are here.
They are here, look.

244
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,090
[Celebrity spotted.
Come and have a look, quick]

245
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,030
[Which mall is it? Give us the location!]
[Is that Yang Yang?]

246
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,000
[What event is it?]

247
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,440
Hello, darlings.

248
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,060
We are at Perfect Blue's event

249
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,460
to bring this live stream to you.

250
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,830
Let me give a brief introduction of

251
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,070
-Jiang Zhe Yang.
-That's right.

252
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,270
That is the point.
Ever since Jiang Zhe Yang debuted...

253
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,120
This Jiang Zhe Yang,

254
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,170
how many Weibo followers does he have?

255
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,220
Him? He has 10,000 times
more followers than you.

256
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,000
So, did he write a Weibo
post about our event?

257
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,090
Yes, he did.

258
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,100
Look, there are tens of thousands
comments and reposts.

259
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,060
Great. That's great.

260
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,390
Zhang Jia Yun, her followers
count also increased.

261
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,650
It is going up quickly.

262
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,190
The same for Cola and Little Duckling.

263
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,050
[This is the one I use. It is great.]
[Both of them are great]

264
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,020
[I love you, Yang Yang]
[Wow, it is so clear]

265
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,060
[Love you two, Yang Yang and Jia Yun]

266
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,090
[I really like Ms Cola]

267
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,609
-Thank you.
-All right, thank you.

268
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,900
Thank you, Xiao Mo Mo.

269
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,390
All right. Thank you, Mo Mo.

270
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,950
Thank you, Mo Mo.

271
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,089
All right, slowly.

272
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:13,970
Come on.

273
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,490
Why aren't there any cabs today?

274
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,790
-Did get a little sweaty.
-That's right.

275
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,390
Let's take this opportunity
to witness the result.

276
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,940
Just now, Mr Jiang Zhe Yang and I

277
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,460
both applied Perfect Blue's
foundation on our face.

278
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,670
Let's take a look first.

279
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,820
The overall skin condition

280
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,300
including the base makeup

281
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,590
is still flawless and staying in place.

282
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,490
You're here, Ms Ouyang.

283
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,110
The live effect is great.

284
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,400
You are happy with it?

285
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,980
It is really great. Look how
impressive the numbers are.

286
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,020
So, I have put the link
to this foundation

287
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,440
down below.

288
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,390
Babes who wish to achieve the same

289
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,130
perfect makeup effect as Yang Yang,

290
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,860
definitely check out the link.

291
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,660
[We both applied Perfect Blue's
foundation on our face.]

292
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,870
[Let's take a look.]

293
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,550
[The overall skin condition
including the base makeup]

294
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,880
[is still flawless and staying in place.]

295
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,420
Chen Lang.

296
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,330
Rui's followers are nearing 500,000

297
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,070
whereas we have nothing.

298
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,610
How is that so?

299
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,630
We have Xiao Xiao.

300
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,140
Is that how you speak?

301
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,590
Mr Chen, Cloud Live is so rich.

302
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,430
Why don't we invite Jiang Zhe Yang
to do an interactive live stream as well

303
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,230
to increase our follower count?

304
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,940
Sure, let Zhu Wan handle it.

305
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,480
I'll pay however much it will take.

306
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,530
Wait a second.

307
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,280
I don't have the connections.

308
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,190
Didn't you get in touch with
Jiang Zhe Yang's mother before?

309
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,070
What is wrong with you today?

310
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,140
Why are you talking nonsense?

311
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,340
Our company is not inferior in any way.

312
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,270
We have Xiao Xiao. Why are you afraid?

313
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,230
It all depends on capability.

314
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,890
Our company has the capability.

315
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,310
All they do are these
attention-grabbing gimmicks.

316
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,540
All right, now that the
base makeup section is over,

317
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,210
it is now the ladies' favourite,
the lipsticks.

318
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,050
At this point, I have a test
question for you.

319
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,710
-Sure.
-Just now, I said

320
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,610
the first ever mascara

321
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,980
was made from a toothbrush.

322
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,410
The first ever eyebrow pencil was
manufactured by a stationery factory.

323
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,370
So, my question is,

324
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,230
which brand created

325
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,430
the first ever commercial lipstick

326
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,710
Commercial lipstick?

327
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,660
The first ever
commercial lipstick brand...

328
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,220
Commercial lipsticks are...

329
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,250
Guerlain!

330
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,980
-Guerlain.
-That's right. It is Guerlain.

331
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,180
My goodness, Yang Yang
is really knowledgeable.

332
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,790
At this point,

333
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,560
I have a personal request

334
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,100
which I believe is also
our audience's request.

335
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,100
What is Yang Yang's
favourite lipstick colour?

336
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,500
This question...

337
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,510
Actually, lipstick colours,

338
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,870
in fact, are like watching movies.

339
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,420
It is hard to choose a specific colour.

340
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,930
I think, if a lipstick colour
suits that person,

341
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,030
that is the best colour.

342
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,750
For example, coral tones
suit younger females.

343
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,570
As for bright reds, those are
suitable for more mature

344
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,570
and sexy ladies.

345
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,100
To me, I feel,

346
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,980
for the woman I like,

347
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,860
whatever lipstick colour she wears

348
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,190
is my favourite colour.

349
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,360
Oh my. I can feel

350
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,180
the pretty ladies among our audience
fell in love at that sentence.

351
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,720
This is infuriating.

352
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,750
Mother, help!

353
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,550
You are such a failure!

354
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,520
It hurts!

355
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,890
Why does this always happen
during critical moments?

356
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,210
The live stream will end soon.

357
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,420
Happy moments go by so quickly.

358
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,910
Next, let's have Mr Jiang Zhe Yang
do a screenshot

359
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,340
of a lucky viewer, all right?

360
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,820
-Sure.
-Here.

361
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,460
Here, this is for you.

362
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,810
Next, I'll do a countdown.

363
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,970
It will be the five viewers
on your screenshot.

364
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,620
Three, two, one. Do a screenshot.

365
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,200
-Okay.
-Alright.

366
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,290
Let me have a look.

367
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,700
All right. Great. Again, we would
like to thank our guest today,

368
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Mr Jiang Zhe Yang.

369
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,660
Thank you.

370
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,140
Before our event ends,

371
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,630
I also have something
to tell our audience.

372
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,880
That is, first of all, we will thank

373
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,210
our brand sponsor,

374
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,390
Perfect Blue.

375
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,430
Secondly, thanks to QE Mall.

376
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,790
Thirdly, I would like to thank

377
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
Rui Live team
and my management company

378
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,710
to have planned such a
great event for everyone.

379
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,800
Last but not least,

380
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,850
I would like to thank
a very special person.

381
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,630
Hurry, quick.

382
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,520
Come on, quick.

383
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,250
Come on. That's right.

384
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,320
This special person I would like to thank

385
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,900
is our mascot, Ms White Bear.

386
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,820
So, as you all can see, she is wearing a
costume which weighs more than 5kg.

387
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,500
It is really stuffy, tiring
and heavy for her.

388
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,310
The staff who worked hard
despite all this,

389
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,930


390
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,650
Take it off, quick! Hurry!

391
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,810
[Xi Xi, don't cover your face.]
[Cheering for Xi Xi]

392
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,810
[Yang Yang should take
photos with the audience]

393
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,880
[I hope Yang Yang
and Xi Xi would date]

394
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,540
Why take it off of me?

395
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,360
Don't move. Your hair is a mess.

396
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,770
And that is our...

397
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,120
Your hair is all messy.

398
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,620
They are all staring at me.

399
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,860
It was removed after all.

400
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,970
That's right, it is our

401
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,800
Rui Live's CEO,

402
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,990
Ms Qian Xi Xi.

403
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,360
As you can see, in order for us to

404
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,550
look incredible on stage,

405
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,550
she herself took on

406
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,480
the most tiring and difficult job.

407
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,630
Therefore, before I go, I really hope

408
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,630
you will all give a round of applause

409
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,170
to Ms Qian Xi Xi.

410
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,720
Let's take a photo together.

411
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,270
-You still want to take a picture?
-Of course.

412
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,000
-Don't.
-Just one photo.

413
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,000
Come on.

414
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,110
All right, enough.

415
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,070
Done.

416
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,660
You nearly scared me to death!

417
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,780
Why did you suddenly take it off of me?

418
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,770
I knew it was you from the start.

419
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,920
When did you find out?

420
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,580
When you tripped just now,
you called out.

421
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,510
I knew it was you.

422
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,630
Did I?

423
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,110
-Of course.
-Mr Duan.

424
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,200
-When you said thank you...
-I'll take it.

425
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,560
-I forgot!
-I'll take it.

426
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
How was my dancing?

427
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,280
My "Bear Cub Dance" performance just now.

428
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,590
Your performance today
fetched us great results.

429
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,060
You all got us so many more followers.

430
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,440
-You are complimenting me?
-Yes.

431
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,640
I danced well, right?

432
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,360
Xi Xi, I'll get going.

433
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,200
Seriously, thank you for
today, Jiang Jin Suo.

434
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,340
No problem.

435
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,600
I'll call you later.

436
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,080
I'll thank you next time.

437
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,190
Goodbye.

438
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,820
-Come back here.
-What is it?

439
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,700
Get a grip.

440
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,680
He gave you few compliments and
now you can't stop staring.

441
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,070
Am I?

442
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,090
Yes.

443
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,400
That is just how it is.
My eyes are huge.

444
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,680
Come here.

445
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,430
My father texted me via WeChat.

446
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,210
What did Uncle Duan say?

447
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,270
He said, after this live stream is done,

448
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,600
the follow-up work must be done properly.

449
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,470
These products must
guarantee customers' safety.

450
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,220
I thought about this a long time ago.

451
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,130
I already told Yu Shi what to do.

452
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,170
My father said himself

453
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,760
that the two of us have to monitor it.

454
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,990
The head of Engineering
will also come over and help us monitor.

455
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,920
He is being quite proactive today.

456
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,740
Sure, no problem.

457
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,750
All right, go and get changed.

458
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,230
-Ms Ouyang.
-Good work.

459
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,670
It must be be very hot to wear this.

460
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,550
It was okay.

461
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,920
How is it? Are you satisfied
with today's results?

462
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,640
The outcome of today's event is great.

463
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,640
The broadcasters have seen steady
increase in the follower count as well.

464
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,050
Yang Yang's followers are impressive.

465
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,060
It is all thanks to you
and Jiang Zhe Yang.

466
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,250
In that case, let's find a chance
to co-operate again in future.

467
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,170
We have to.
Tell you what, even if no chance comes by,

468
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,230
I'll create one for us to co-operate.

469
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,340
Sure. It is a promise.

470
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,160
All right. I'll go take
a look at Yang Yang.

471
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,360
-Sure, no problem. Go ahead.
-Goodbye.

472
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,100
Create a chance to co-operate
even if none comes by?

473
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,530
What chance are you going to create?

474
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,000
What kind of chances?

475
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,410
Never you mind.

476
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,270
Change quickly and start working.
Let's go.

477
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,870
-Let's go.
-Create a chance?

478
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,560
I told you, it is hot.

479
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,440
Stop holding me.

480
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,810
I'll hit you if you don't stop.

481
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,740
I'll use my paws.

482
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,300
Let's go.

483
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,890
How are the live stream's results?

484
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,390
Mr Duan Jr was exceptional.

485
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,930
Not only was the live stream done well,

486
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,650
it also brought more visitors to QE.

487
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,300
Statistics sent over a message just now.

488
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,140
Today, QE achieved the most visitor count

489
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,380
in the entire year.

490
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,700
Also, all the restaurants
have been fully reserved.

491
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,560
Qian.

492
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,400
Duan.

493
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,550
You are here so early.

494
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,200
The plane arrived early

495
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,610
and I took a cab here.

496
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,970
Your mall is so huge,

497
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
I almost got lost.

498
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,290
Look, we chanced upon each other anyway.

499
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,790
Xi Xi happens to be doing
an event in the mall today.

500
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,870
It should have ended by now,

501
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,530
so she should be heading back.

502
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,730
I won't bother her for now.

503
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,470
I can always meet her tonight.

504
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,350
Sure.

505
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,140
Let's go and have tea at my office.

506
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,220
Fang Kai, get the luggage.

507
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,690
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

508
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,180
How is it?

509
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,700
You have not changed over the years.

510
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,830
Time goes by so quickly.
My hair is all grey now.

511
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,000
Your business expanded
a lot over the years.

512
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,100
Look at the scale.

513
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,590
It is larger than the
shopping malls overseas.

514
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,210
This live stream

515
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,340
was very well-planned.

516
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,430
The point is, the location is great.

517
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,980
Although this is the first time
Yang Yang did a live stream,

518
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,370
but he did fairly well, right?

519
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,850
He was great.

520
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,820
Aunty, Yang Yang has been
larger-scale occasions.

521
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,670
For him, this live stream is nothing.

522
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,840
By the way, the salon you
recommended was really great.

523
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,340
After I did a skin treatment,

524
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,180
I felt I became younger.

525
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,680
-Isn't it? Not bad, right?
-Became younger?

526
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,200
-Visit again, aunty.
-Sure.

527
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,460
With your complexion,
people would think we are siblings.

528
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,780
You are such a sweet-talker.

529
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,390
Ran Ran, although we got to know
each other through live stream,

530
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,550
this is not the end to our relationship.

531
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,500
-That's right.
-This is just the beginning.

532
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,630
Find a chance to ask
your father and Mr Shen

533
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,810
to have a meal together.
It will be my treat.

534
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,010
No problem, leave it to me. Don't worry.

535
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,750
All right, no need to see us off.

536
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,540
-It is all right.
-All right, sure, I won't.

537
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,480
-Take care.
-Goodbye.

538
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,510
Give us a call if there is anything.

539
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,860
Sure, I will. Don't worry. See you.

540
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,740
Goodbye.

541
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,810
[Rui Live and Zhe]

542
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,740
Thank goodness it went smoothly.

543
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,890
My back.

544
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,470
Actually, I'm still quite
worried about Yuan Yuan.

545
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,130
I wonder what she's thinking.

546
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,600
Also, that scandal
came as such a surprise.

547
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,440
What exactly is going on?

548
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,400
Xi Xi!

549
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,960
Xi Xi!

550
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,670
-Xi Xi!
-Yuanbao.

551
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,630
Yuanbao.

552
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,440
-Yuanbao.
-Slow down.

553
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,580
Watch it!

554
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,500
Where is Yang Yang?

555
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,640
-You almost crashed into me.
-This is for Yang Yang.

556
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,330
-And all these are for Yang Yang.
-Slow down.

557
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,830
Jiang Zhe Yang left.

558
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,680
Yang Yang left?

559
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,190
The interactive live stream
ended a while ago.

560
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,470
He left.

561
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,350
No, wait. He is a celebrity.

562
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,250
He had work to do, so he left.

563
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,330
Why did he leave?

564
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,580
Don't cry.

565
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,180
Tell you what, Yuanbao.

566
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,540
We are in a mall.
People will stare at you.

567
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,540
Tell you what, today's interactive
live stream fetched great results.

568
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,000
Many people came by.

569
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,860
It is highly possible that
he will co-operate with our company again.

570
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,830
-This way, you will be able to see him.
-That's right.

571
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,180
No, but I want to watch him live.

572
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,490
Don't worry, you can find it online.

573
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,750
The live stream is exactly the same.

574
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,780
It is not the same.

575
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,780
It really is.

576
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,960
Let's go back quickly.

577
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
I don't want to.

578
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,130
It is no use even if you cry.
Quick, take this, hurry.

579
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,820
You won't get to watch the live stream
again if you don't hurry.

580
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,270
Let's go and watch the live stream, quick!

581
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,770
All right, now. Let's go.

582
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,880
Come on.

583
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,150
Let's go.

584
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,620
You won't wear it anymore?
It is just a costume.

585
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,750
I...

586
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,470
-This luggage is too hard to pull.
-What is with this luggage?

587
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,680
Let me tell you, Jiang Zhe Yang

588
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,830
looked especially handsome
in the live stream.

589
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,020
He looked 1.8m tall.

590
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,530
He is 1.85m tall.

591
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,710
I thought he is 1.8m tall.

592
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,340
Duan Ran.

593
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,060
Tell me, what is going on? Who is so mean

594
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,150
to have disclosed Yuan Yuan's
matters to Ouyang?

595
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,330
Why are you staring at me?

596
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,030
Let me tell you,

597
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,180
when we received Ouyang's email,

598
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,440
I was by Jia Yun's side.

599
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,320
I can guarantee it was not Jia Yun.

600
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,540
I did not say it was her.

601
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,380
I'll ask Ouyang later

602
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,280
what the email address is
and we will investigate.

603
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,920
Who could it be?

604
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,460
Why aren't your parents here yet?

605
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,950
They said they were going to
celebrate for us.

606
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,830
Are they late?

607
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,860
We're the ones who came early.

608
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,810
I did not wear a watch today.

609
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,950
-Xi Xi. Ran Ran.
-You are finally here.

610
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,860
-Xi Xi.
-Uncle Duan. Aunt Zhou.

611
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,300
Father, Mother.

612
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,790
It is me, your father.

613
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,090
-She is all grown-up now.
-Yes, she is.

614
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,690
Qian, have a seat first.

615
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,980
Don't you recognize me?

616
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,800
Why is he here?

617
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,310
I came back to visit you.

618
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,370
I'm fine, you don't have to.

619
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,870
This should be

620
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,790
-Ran Ran, right?
-Ran Ran.

621
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,080
He became so tall.

622
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,810
Hi, Uncle Qian.

623
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,420
Xi Xi, Ran Ran,

624
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,340
good job on today's
live stream marketing.

625
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,750
It was very successful.

626
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,070
Your Uncle Qian happened
to be back from abroad.

627
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,730
Our family will have a
reunion dinner together.

628
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,739
So, I brought one of the best wines

629
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,360
from Napa Valley.

630
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,650
Let's drink it later.

631
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,780
Drink more, Qian.

632
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,120
Xi Xi!

633
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,070
Xi Xi!

634
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,390
Xi Xi.

635
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,820
Aunt Zhou, what is going on?

636
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,270
Why is he here?

637
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,990
I have no idea.

638
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,010
I was surprised to see him myself.

639
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,000
I never imagined
I'll see him alive in this lifetime.

640
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,760
Xi Xi, no matter what,

641
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,020
he is your father after all.

642
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,910
Aunt Zhou.

643
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,200
He is not my father.

644
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,020
He neither raised me nor
cared about me before.

645
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,300
What right does he have to be my father?

646
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,500
To me, you and Uncle Duan are my parents.

647
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,000
I know.

648
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,250
Regardless,

649
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,650
look, all these years,

650
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,700
he has always been abroad.

651
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,550
It has not been easy for him.

652
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,740
Nor did he achieve anything
after so many years.

653
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,090
After all, he is your biological father.

654
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,220
Being brave enough to meet you today

655
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,770
is not an easy feat for him.

656
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,380
Don't be so hard on him.

657
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,720
Why are you defending him?

658
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,510
Aren't you angry at him?

659
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,120
Of course I am.

660
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,120
He abandoned you and
did not care about you.

661
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,130
He is so irresponsible.

662
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,290
However, you two are
related by blood after all,

663
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,530
right?

664
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,950
Give him face.

665
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,290
We finally got to meet today.

666
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,980
Let's finish this dinner
together, all right?

667
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,830
Promise me.

668
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,600
Aunt Zhou, promise me.

669
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,600
After we have this dinner,

670
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,530
I don't want to see him ever again.

671
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,770
All right, we won't.

672
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,870
Let's eat dinner first.

673
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,050
Be good. Let's go.

674
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,610
Come on, let's go.

675
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,020
Let's go.

676
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,580
Come. Here is to you.

677
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,070
All these years, if you two
haven't been taking care of Xi Xi,

678
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,200
I don't know what would have happened.

679
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,950
Here, cheers.

680
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,240
Xi Xi did quite well without you around.

681
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,260
Qian, come on.

682
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,340
Qian,

683
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,010
I think you had better come back.

684
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,790
You can't keep working abroad.

685
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,100
This... Development in China
happens so quickly.

686
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,050
I'm worried that I can't catch up.

687
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,140
When I went back to my old house,
the minute I alighted from the taxi,

688
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,260
I became overwhelmed.

689
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,860
I thought the driver took me
to the wrong place.

690
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,590
It is not just you.

691
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,380
Even when I go back there,

692
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,030
I would often be lost.

693
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,290
Qian, do you have any plans

694
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,750
now that you're back?

695
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,160
I'll take care of some matters in China

696
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,740
and bring Xi Xi overseas with me.

697
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,840
Xi Xi,

698
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,530
all these years

699
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,270
I feel I have owed you a lot.

700
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,830
It is my wish to make it up to you.

701
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,640
After we go overseas, you can

702
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,030
continue to further your studies.

703
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,020
Qian,

704
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,510
do you think your arrangement

705
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,270
is very good?

706
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,950
Do you know how much the school
fees is annually to study abroad?

707
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,010
How are you going to fund her studies?

708
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,590
That...

709
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,100
I'll take care of it somehow.

710
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,420
Somehow?

711
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,260
You have not prepared that, right?

712
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,820
In that case,

713
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,910
don't just talk about the
positive things, all right?

714
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,840
Xi Xi, I need to go.

715
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,330
So, Duan,

716
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,960
I'm a little sleepy due to jet lag.

717
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,310
I'll get going.

718
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,320
Come and stay at our house

719
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,220
so the two of us can have a chat.

720
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,750
It is all right. I had better
go back to my old house.

721
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,700
Sure, if you say so.

722
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,470
Ran Ran and Xi Xi,

723
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,030
you two see Uncle Qian off.

724
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,190
No need, I know the directions.

725
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,300
Ran Ran.

726
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,730
Sure, I'll do it.

727
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,820
It is late. I'll give you a lift back.

728
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,350
In that case, I'll get going.

729
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,540
-Okay.
-Let's go.

730
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,840
-I'm not going.
-What exactly is going on?

731
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,030
-Let's go.
-I'm not going.

732
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,740
Xi Xi.

733
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,130
Xi Xi,

734
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,880
I'd like to talk to you for a bit.

735
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,830
Don't talk to me.

736
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,570
I have not seen you for years.

737
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,490
I know that you blame me.

738
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,430
It is all my fault.

739
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,170
I did not carry out my duty as a father.

740
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,230
Why aren't we there yet?

741
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,360
We will reach soon.

742
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,450
I'll go and get the luggage.

743
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,190
Here, I'll do it.

744
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,630
I'll help you to carry it.

745
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,670
Duan Ran!

746
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,200
No need to go upstairs.

747
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,970
I'll go open the door. Be right back.

748
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,030
In that case, goodbye, uncle.

749
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,680
I'll get going.

750
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,530
Goodbye, uncle.
