Babes, you guys are super punctual.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,050
Our live stream will only start
after ten minutes.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,680
The room is a bit cold today.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,970
I'll wear a denim jacket first.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,420
I'll put it on.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,980
Of course I'm a person
who keeps my promises.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,050
Today, the top 15 babes I'll

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,870
will get a red envelope coupon
worth 15 yuan.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,360
[Yeah, only 15 people.]

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
[Only 15 people!]

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,220
[So, you have to hurry.]

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,590
[If you didn't get]

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,820
[the red envelope coupon, that's okay.]

[surprises for you.]

00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,740
Ran Ran, come here.

19
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,880
I've something to tell you.

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,030
Okay.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,750
My throat is better now.

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,030
I have you who cared about me

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,790
when I'm busy working,

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,300
I'm so blessed.

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,020
I show you my heart.

26
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,510
How's the UK?

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,590
It's kind of underwhelming.

28
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,590
But the UK economy is not so good now.

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,940
It's far worse than China.

30
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,260
China is good now.

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,960
Since China is so good,

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,730
stay here from now on.

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,930
Tell me about

34
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,950
your specific plans in the future.

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,970
In the future?

36
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,440
I'm going to rest

37
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,620
and scout around.

38
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,570
See if there's any suitable
business opportunity.

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,120
Do you want to...

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,620
Please spare me, Father.

41
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,720
I won't go to QE.

42
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,560
The streamer's outfit looks nice?

43
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,930
[Xi Xi is not working in QE anymore.]

44
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,020
[I don't want to be involved
in this sunset industry either.]

45
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,210
[Xi Xi left QE]

46
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,940
[because she wants to rely on herself]

47
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,380
[and not us.]

48
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,510

That's the new company

[Father, you invested in
a live streaming company?]

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,280
Mr Chen, please sign this.

55
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,200
Your current investment foresight
is very good.

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,660
[Is it nice?]

57
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,660
But there's no link for this jacket today.

58
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,900
The stock is running out,

59
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,530
so there's no link.

60
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,660
Didn't you say Xi Xi
doesn't want to rely on you?

61
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,790
That live streaming company is yours.

62
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,210
She didn't mention me at all

63
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,500
when she went to the interview.

64
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,650
She was hired because of her own ability.

65
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,930
Do you really like it?

66
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,660
Do we still have stock for this?

67
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,200
It seems to be running out.

68
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,570
It's running out?

69
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,480
I remember we have stock.
Go check the warehouse.

70
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,320
Why are there two of the same outfit?

71
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,200
Mr Chen.

72
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,920
Yuan Yuan asked for your advice.

73
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,030
See which one is better
to stream first.

74
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,610
I trust Yuan Yuan,
ask her to choose.

75
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,980
-It will be okay.
-All right.

76
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,250
If this jacket is in stock,

77
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,850
I'll upload the link for you.

78
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,510
But I want to remind you that

79
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,400
the inventory is really low.

80
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,680
If it's in stock,

81
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,970
you have to place the order quickly.

82

Xi Xi's live stream
will start in ten minutes sharp!

83
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,170
Amazing.

84
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,579
You have an incredible foresight.

85
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,380
Of course I have to surprise them.

86
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,190
Besides, this jacket's inventory is low.

87
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,910
If we promote it directly,
where's the surprise?

88
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,010
And that sentence,

89
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,950
"the streamer's outfit looks nice",

90
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,010

She's doing really well now.

92
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,890
She's a popular streamer
and a director.

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,150
She can be a popular streamer?

94
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,600
You're doing good today.

95
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,020
Why?
Are you going to attack Yuan Yuan?

96
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,090
It's still early to surpass Yuan Yuan.

97
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,140
This is just a small fight.

98
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,170
You must be confident in yourself.

the live stream.

How is Xi Xi's preparation?

102
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,720
Buyers' expectations are very high.

103
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,870
Expect a little upsurge today.

Go to the control room and monitor it.
Once the data comes in,

push the product down the chain.

-Okay, Mr Chen!
-Same goes for the others.

107

-Okay.
-Whose clothes are these? It's still here.

108

Don't keep mentioning Xi Xi.

-Mr Duan Jr is here.
-Why is he here?

117

I saw him get on the elevator.

Are you familiar with China's live stream

No.

My father said China's
e-commerce market is doing well.

I'm here to experience it myself.

145

When the company was founded in 2016,

[It's super nice, right?]

168
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,440
-[Only 30 pieces left.]
-[Hurry up and place your order!]

169
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,420
The smooth-talking saleswoman
Qian Xi Xi

170
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,880
is doing live streams now?

171
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,500
Stop joking.

172
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,610
She's like your sister.

173
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,470
You don't know what's going on?

174
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,180
She was going to be promoted
to floor manager back then.

175
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,240
But she decided to work here instead.

176
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,730
I gave them a target
of two million today.

177
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,130
Xi Xi is doing well today.

178
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,670
There should be no problem.

179
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,700
[Sometimes, we wear a T-shirt]

180
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,080
[with a skirt or a pair of shorts.]

181
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,530
Sometimes, when the T-shirt is tucked in,

182
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,290
the body might get exposed...

183
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,340
Mr Duan Jr.

184
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,760
Don't underestimate these salespeople.

185
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,930
The company now has
a total of 52 streamers.

186
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,650
They are influencers and models.

187
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,700
But more than half of them

188
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,420
are top salespeople or sales manager

189
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,150
I've poached from big companies.

190
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,130
They bring presentation skills
and experience.

191
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,710
They're easy-going

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,380
and hardworking.

193
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,510
People like Qian Xi Xi

194
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,440
also count as easy-going?

195
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,500
I'd say she's the hardworking type.

196
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,060
Pair this shirt with small boots

197
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,900
to make your outfit outstanding

198
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,050
Sometimes, you can even

199
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,600
match it with a pair of
white sport shoes

200
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,140
or a pair of high heels.

201
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,230
It'll make you...

202
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,180
We only made it this far

203
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,110
because of one philosophy.

204
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,530
Seize the opportunity.

205
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,760
We must seize every opportunity we get.

206
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,520
You can pair it with
any kind of shoes.

207
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,450
Xi Xi has

208
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,900
explained it clearly.

209
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,789
This makes sense.

210
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,310
Live stream platforms

211
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,330
have really caught on
in this age of internet.

212
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,550
Plus the resource from QE,

213
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,650
of course it'll be successful.

214
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,660
Xi Xi broke the record.

215
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,670
Come and take a look!

216
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,210
Xi Xi broke the record. Hurry!

217
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,930
You can use it on any occasion.

218
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,320
Look, Xi Xi is have achieved the target

219
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,340
I posted that comment.

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,190
Amazing.

221
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,080
What's that?

222
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,910
Xi Xi has broken her own record.

223
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,660
She achieved 50,000 in 30 minutes.

224
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,050
[Hurry up.]

225
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,600
You guys are wrong.

226
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,610
This isn't your

227
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,830
ordinary T-shirt and white midi skirt

228
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,880
I'll show you in detail.

229
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,330
Do you see it?

230
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,840
She's quite impressive.

231
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,050
Not only does Xi Xi excel in live streams,

232
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,910
she's also good in planning
and negotiation as well.

233
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,540
Of course, it's rumple-free.

234
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,340
Look. I'll jump

235
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,540
and turn around.
As you can see, this skirt

236
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,040
won't rumple no matter what.

237
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,800
At the rate she's going today,

238
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,370
her commission should be
a few thousand yuan.

239
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,050
Really?

240
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,720
Su Su.

241
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,790
Hurry up and post Xi Xi
on the homepage.

242
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,290
She's quite impressive.

243
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,880
[As I expected,]

244
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,700
[on the first morning
after I returned to China,]

245
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,560
[I found Qian Xi Xi to be annoying.]

246
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,200
Duan Ran, wake up.

247
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,830
What are you doing?

248
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,630
Get up and help me
find my clothes.

249
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,170
Find what clothes?

250
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,810
[Just because I studied abroad
for three years,]

251
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,230
[she started working
and making money earlier than me.]

252
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,430
Why did you put it in my closet?

253
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,880
Don't you have a closet?

254
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,860
Your closet has been empty since
you went abroad.

255
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,090
Why shouldn't I use it?

256
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,370
It'll be wasted if I don't use it.

257
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,130
You use it because it's empty?

258
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,310
Ever heard of "the dove occupying
the magpie's nest"?

259
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,160
Qian Xi Xi.

260
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,920
I'm talking to you.

261
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,850
[I suddenly realised that]

262
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,830
[in my two years of absence,]

263
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,930
I'll take this.

264
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,300
[my room,]

265
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,350
[closet,]

266
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,800
[towel]

267
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,520
[and even my parents]

268
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,410
[were taken away by her.]

269
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,670
Good morning.

270
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,220
Uncle Duan, good morning.

271
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,340
It's still early.
Why do you wake me up?

272
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,560
[It seems this long, drawn-out war]

273
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,620
[between us]

274
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,250
[is about to get longer.]

275
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,380
Wake up!

276
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,720
-Hurry!
-[The grudge between me and Xi Xi]

277
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,740
[started since childhood.]

278
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,990
-Here, Uncle Duan.
-[Xi Xi is fatherless since childhood.]

279
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,320
There are eggs and meat.

280
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,160
[When she was in primary school,]

281
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,710
[her mother died in an accident.]

282
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,900
[She became an orphan overnight and]

283
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,960
-[captured my mother's heart with tears.]
-I want to eat fried vinegar pork.

284
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,600
-Okay, I'll buy it this afternoon.
-[Since then,]

285
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,660
[Qian Xi Xi went from a neighbour]

286
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,440
[to a member of our family.]

287
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,450
Pay some attention to me, will you?

288
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,090
I feel like I'm invisible.

289
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,820
[My parents treat Xi Xi as my sister.]

290
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,850
[They treat her better than me.]

291
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,620
[But this girl is frugal.]

292
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,470
[Every month, she pays for]

293
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,850
[utilities and food.]

294
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,470
Can you stop bullying Xi Xi?

295
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,410
[She became the textbook
that my parents use]

296
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,410
[to force me to get my act together.]

297
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,040
Don't keep mentioning Xi Xi.

298
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,490
I studied abroad on a full scholarship.

299
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,610
Sorry to keep you waiting.

300
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,890
Does it look good?
A sexy goddess.

301
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,650
Whether you're on a date...

302
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,680
A dress.

303
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,240
Surpassed.

304
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,310
Xi Xi's record has been surpassed.

305
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,830
By whom?

306
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,230
Yuan Yuan.

307
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,110
She's our top salesperson.

308
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,090
She graduated from acting school.

309
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,320
She's an ex-actress.

310
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,950
She's a former entertainment broadcaster.

311
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,500
Now, she's here to be
an e-commerce streamer.

312
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,380
So this is your cash cow.

313
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,570
This is called mutual achievement.

314
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,540
Let's go.

315
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,430
Come to my office and we'll talk.

316
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,050
What do you want to drink?

317
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,150
How about whisky?

318
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,270
I'm not drinking, I need to drive.

319
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,020
Have a seat.

320
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,470
Pour me a glass of water.

321
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,080
The live

322
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,760
was a wasteland prior to 2015.

323
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,790
In 2016, it became a street stall.

324
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,770
In 2017, it became a wet market.

325
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,490
And in 2018, it finally
became the real deal.

326
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,120
A towering industry.

327
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,600
There are many people who make money
from this industry.

328
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,410
Also, many young girls nowadays

329
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,760
are obsessed about becoming a streamer.

330
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,340
The decoration in your office
is quite good.

331
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,830
It's not bad.

332
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,280
Mr Chen.

333
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,550
I'm streaming half-day today.

334
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,620
My friend got me an appointment
with Mr Wu from Pineapple.

335
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,480
I'll go negotiate with him again.

336
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,540
Thank you.

337
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,550
I'll get going.

338
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,740
Okay.

339
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,530
Why are you here?

340
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,250
Is this the way to talk to your brother?

341
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm talking nicely.

342
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,030
Are you going out?

343
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,620
In a minute.

344
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,040
Okay, I'll give you a ride.

345
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,980
We'll leave now.

346
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,570
Where are you going?

347
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,820
An appointment.

348
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,380
Qian Xi Xi, you're so annoying now.

349
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,790
I'm talking to you.

350
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
Why you didn't answer my phone calls?

351
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,820
You ignored me.

352
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,630
Great. Now my whole mouth is red.

353
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,740
Can't you see I'm busy?

354
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,250
I've been busy trying to figure out

355
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,250
how to sell that denim skirt all day.

356
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,210
I didn't have the time to check my phone.

357
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,310
Fine.

358
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,070
Let's have lunch.

359
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,440
You didn't celebrate my return.

360
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,760
I did.

361
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,780
Didn't we celebrate it yesterday?

362
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,250
I don't have time.

363
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,570
What about dinner?

364
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,370
Dinner?

365
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,960
I'll need to check later.

366
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,020
I need to see a client this afternoon.

367
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,170
I went there twice.

368
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,340
But they ignored me.

369
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,900
I don't know what will happen this time.

370
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,390
I'll go this afternoon.

371
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,950
Don't touch my hair, I just did it.

372
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,490
Can't you see?

373
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,470
I'm not like you,

374
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,960
loafing around every day.

375
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,680
I'm so busy.

376
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,420
Why are you so busy?

377
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,310
Where are you going?

378
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,540
To change my clothes.

379
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,210
Is it so hard to see you?

380
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,920
I'm busy with streaming.

381
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,900
Streaming?

382
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,790
I'm talking to you, can you stop?

383
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,890
Are we having lunch or not?

384
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,050
Don't pull my hair. Let go.

385
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,590
Don't pinch me.

386
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,520
Have lunch with me, will you?

387
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,410
I told you, I don't have the time.

388
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,560
I have something to do at noon.

389
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,230
Me and Jia Yun are going
to meet a client.

390
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,050
You still need to eat.

391
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,820
Is eating more important than business?

392
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,000
What?

393
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,490
Let me drive.

394
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,090
You sit in the passenger's seat.

395
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,380
Are you for real?

396
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,630
Damn  it.

397
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,860
Duan Ran.

398
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,230
I can see it.

399
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,380
You're not here to have lunch with me.

400
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,530
Are you here for this car?

401
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,650
Do I need to do that?

402
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,070
This car can't be touched by others,

403
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,480
but I don't feel bad
if my sister drives it.

404
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,640
Actually, I came to your company

405
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,140
to see

406
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,420
what my sister does
when I'm not around.

407
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,590
I'm worried you might get cheated.
I'm worried about you.

408
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,040
If I were ever bullied,

409
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,800
it will be you.

410
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,360
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

411
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,260
Look what you did.

412
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,670
Hurry.

413
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,960
Let's go.

414
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,700
To escort and protect.

415
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,160
Don't put things here.

416
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,190
What's the matter now?

417
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,839
How unnecessary.

418
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,290
I suddenly remembered something.

419
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,980
Why did you sit on Chen Lang's chair?

420
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,920
He asked me to have a seat.

421
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,290
That was the nearest chair.

422
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,780
Well, I have news for you.

423
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
He may have let you sit on it

424
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,600
and didn't say anything,

425
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,060
but he's probably scolded you
a hundred times in his heart.

426
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,520
Let him be.

427
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,070
Duan Ran.

428
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,360
Why are you here today?

429
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,130
Someone said you're replacing Chen Lang.

430
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,460
I have to tell you this.

431
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,350
This company is huge.

432
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,600
You can't manage it.

433
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,240
And I finally found a job
that I really like.

434
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,610
Please don't mess up our company, okay?

435
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,470
I don't care about your small company.

436
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,410
What do you sell?

437
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,030
It's only clothes costing tens of yuan.

438
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,060
Even the most expensive ones
are less than 200 yuan.

439
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,130
Your small commodity wholesale market...

440
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,190
Low-price and high-volume sales.

441
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,530
That's how live streaming companies are.

442
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,660
This is the sales strategy
of live streaming companies.

443
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,390
We're going to negotiate the new season
special with Pineapple Xpress

444
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,810
as well as a collaboration
with Nishiyama Yohji.

445
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,480
Have you closed the deal?

446
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,990
No.

447
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,940
Why are you boasting to me
if the deal is not closed yet?

448
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,060
I'm going to negotiate
with the boss now.

449
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,870
If I'm the boss,

450
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,850
I wouldn't cooperate with you.

451
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,220
It'd only lower my brand's value.

452
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,790
Just stick to your low price,
high volume strategy.

453
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,320
You're not the boss.

454
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,070
You just don't get it.

455
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,450
-Yes.
-Are you biting your lip?

456
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,540
Stop hitting me!

457
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,110
Why is he here today?

458
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,770
Did Duan Sheng Yun receive any information?

459
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,310
That's impossible, Mr Chen.

460
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,850
Our plan is foolproof.

461
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,110
I have spoken with him just now.

462
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,340
Guess what he said to me.

463
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,920
What?

464
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,140
He said he didn't want to go to QE at all.

465
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,860
And he came here to survey.

466
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,710
He doesn't want to go to QE.

467
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,880
He wants to come here.

468
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,660
There must be a deeper meaning

469
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,390
to him sitting in your chair.

470
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,670
But he didn't seem to have
any motive today.

471
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,570
I think

472
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,820
he's here to see Qian Xi Xi.

473
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,100
They don't look like siblings.

474
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,130
They look like a couple.

475
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,520
I'm not interested about
their relationship.

476
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,940
I'm just thinking

477
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,150
what Mr Duan and Mr Duan Jr

478
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,390
are up to.

479
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,400
Listen.

480
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,070
If you can't add value

481
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,210
to their brand,

482
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,620
then in their view,

483
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,700
you're lowering their brand value,
understand?

484
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,340
Duan Ran, stop arguing with me.

485
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,090
Anyway, I'll close a deal
with Pineapple later.

486
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,390
All the best to you.

487
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,590
I'll do my best.
Get off.

488
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,050
The car keys, please.

489
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,860
How am I supposed to go back?

490
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,820
By taxi.

491
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,800
I have something else on later.

492
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,540
Why don't you ever feel sorry for me?

493
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,990
You don't know
how to feel sorry for me.

494
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,710
You did well today.

495
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,470
Thanks for sending me over.

496
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,710
Get off now.

497
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,380
I'll clean it up for you.

498
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,070
What for? It's clean.

499
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,560
Duan Ran, hurry up.

500
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,100
Hurry, I...

501
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,970
The one you took is the spare key.

502
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,080
The master key is with me.

503
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,280
Happy negotiating.

504
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,530
From now on,

505
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,950
I'll retain the right to use this baby.

506
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,710
Goodbye.

507
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,770
Duan Ran!

508
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,110
Get off!

509
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,830
You liar!

510
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,890
You liar of the century!

511
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,230
You said the car is for me!

512
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,630
Why are you so petty?

513
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,170
Xi Xi.

514
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,760
I'm furious!

515
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,610
-Who's that?
-Duan Ran!

516
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,980
Listen.

517
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,670
He pretended to go to the office
and asked me out for lunch.

518
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,480
I was wondering why
he was so nice to me.

519
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,420
See? He's here for the car.

520
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,910
Isn't that infuriating?

521
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,640
Why do you guys quarrel whenever you meet?

522
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,050
Why did you expect?

523
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,070
What's so special about me and him?

524
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,080
Thanks again for setting me up with Mr Wu.

525
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,540
You're welcome,
Mr Wu is our regular client.

526
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,300
But this is the third time
you're meeting him.

527
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,930
Are you confident?

528
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,430
I have to be confident.

529
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,910
I made a bet with Duan Ran.

530
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,350
Mr Wu, please wait.

531
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,480
Qian Xi Xi, why is it you again?

532
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,610
I didn't expect you to remember my name.
I'm so happy.

533
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,150
Qian Xi Xi, I've told you many times.

534
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,180
I'm not interested in your live streams.

535
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,670
Don't look for me anymore.

536
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,080
I...

537
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,110
Jia Yun.

538
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,050
How many times have you been
to the company?

539
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,960
It's a pity that you're not doing sales.

540
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,150
No, Mr Wu.

541
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,990
I'm thinking about you.

542
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,280
Live streaming e-commerce
is popular nowadays.

543
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,260
We should keep up with the trend.

544
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,400
Mr Wu.

545
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,920
The live streaming e-commerce industry
really took off in recent years.

546
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,070
If you have time,

547
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,300
I can explain it to you.

548
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,500
After I'm finished, you'll understand
why we are unstoppable.

549
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,700
It's useless even if you're unstoppable.

550
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,280
At present, people have
a bad impression

551
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,260
of live streaming. It lacks value.

552
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,900
Besides, Pineapple has been the youngest
and most active online brand

553
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,150
in China for the past two years.

554
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,200
Tell me.

555
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,520
What benefits can you bring me?

556
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,620
What's the value?

557
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,940
The value?

558
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,190
Greatly increase your internet traffic,
brand value

559
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,680
-and sales.
-Greatly increase?

560
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,270
How great?

561
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,340
It's just great.

562
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,050
Extremely great.

563
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,720
Super great.

564
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,840
We'll call you.

565
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,140
Not again.

566
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,790
Good.

567
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,770
You mentioned increasing sales.

568
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,480
There is a chance.

569
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,860
[Paragon Center]

570
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,260
My dear.

571
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,200
Can you stop?

572
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,650
If Pineapple rejects you,

573
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,160
I'll find another client for you, okay?

574
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,690
Now there are more and more
live streaming e-commerce platforms.

575
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,040
We can't just rely on price wars
and sell low-end goods.

576
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,320
This is not a long-term solution.

577
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,260
We must rely on the brand support.

578
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,580
Okay.

579
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,380
My dear, you can save those words

580
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,100
for your company.

581
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,390
I'm curious about Duan Ran's
return to China.

582
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,440
Tell me.

583
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,080
What did he say to you
after he came back?

584
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,380
I want this pink cake.

585
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,970
Me too.

586
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,990
What did he say?

587
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,980
Duan Ran?

588
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,830
Yesterday, at four o'clock,
Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport,

589
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,150
Duan Ran's first sentence to me was,

590
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,000
"Qian Xi Xi, you're fat."
His second sentence was,

591
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,030
"Qian Xi Xi, you're as fat as a pig."

592
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,920
That's it.

593
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,760
No way. What else?

594
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,520
That's all.

595
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,880
That's how Duan Ran and I are.

596
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,690
We have nothing to talk about.

597
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,600
Qian Xi Xi, can you honestly say

598
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,120
you and Duan Ran are just siblings?

599
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,770
We're siblings.

600
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,580
Hello, here's your cake.

601
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,560
Our cake?

602
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,910
Have you scanned it?
Thanks.

603
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,490
Done.

604
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,600
Wait for me!

605
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,620
Why do you think we're not siblings?

606
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,200
See?

607
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,750
The more you deny it,
the more guilty you are.

608
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,450
Do you get commission
if we got together?

609
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,970
Sister.

610
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,270
Are you just going
to sit there and eat cake

611
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,810
while I toil away for you?

612
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,830
We had a deal.

613
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,160
I take you to see Mr Wu, you work for me.

614
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,280
Don't interrupt, where was I?

615
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:45,110
Why can't you and him be together?

616
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,070
It's simple.

617
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,880
Not only that we are not  compatible,

618
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,560
Mr Duan and Mrs Duan

619
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,510
have always regarded me
as Duan Ran's sister.

620
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,490
Even if I like Duan Ran...

621
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm saying if.

622
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,490
All these years,

623
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,000
I've been eating their food
and staying in their house.

624
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,850
If I take their only son too,

625
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,700
what kind of person would I be?

626
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,460
A dove that occupies some magpie's nest?

627
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,640
Miss.

628
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,460
Don't think too much.

629
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,010
Miss, it's you who think too much.

630
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,730
Don't ever think about it again.

631
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,220
No commission for you.

632
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,300
Here.

633
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,340
Is it nice?

634
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,030
Look, your Chen Lang.

635
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,010
Is he here for you?

636
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,030
Is this easy to fix?

637
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,380
We can handle it if the paint is intact.

638
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,840
Fix it.

639
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,250
Help me to fix it.

640
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,980
Check if there are any other problems.

641
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,340
Okay.

642
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,070
Remove all these ornaments.

643
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,610
Clean the double-sided tape stain.

644
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,240
There's a weird stain

645
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,170
on the front passenger's seat.

646
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,550
-Clean it up for me.
-Okay.

647
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,010
-Change out the air conditioner filter.
-Okay.

648
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,510
The car smells.

649
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,940
Is there enough money in my card?

650
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,300
It may not be enough.

651
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,270
Not enough?

652
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,740
Top up the card for me.

653
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,420
I'm sorry, the credit card machine
is unavailable today.

654
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,090
Please use WeChat Pay.

655
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,810
I can't pay with WeChat.

656
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,350
We accept Alipay as well.

657
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,860
Forget it, I'll just transfer directly
to your boss.

658
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,600
You get back to work.

659
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,290
Which floor is he going to?

660
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,320
What are you doing?

661
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,010
What are you doing?
Who are you trying to catch?

662
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,810
Why do you follow me?

663
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,610
Who's following you?
Who are you trying to catch?

664
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,500
That's none of your business.

665
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,670
Why did you appear at this time?

666
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,090

It's no trouble at all.

I may have to clean
the men's room for days.

872
