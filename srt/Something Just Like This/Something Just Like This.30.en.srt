[We Are Young]

3
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,420
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,770
You're wearing the
Freesia scented perfume.

5
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,820
I'm attending a blind date.

6
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,770
My mum bugged me many
times since last week.

7
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,310
I've to attend one today.

8
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,700
You're supposed to be at work.

9
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,030
Who's going to manage the
control centre?

10
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,740
Jia Yun, I'm just saying,

11
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,670
look, the stream rooms now

12
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,430
are just sitting vacant.

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,979
I already turned off the computers.

14
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,380
That way, we can save some electricity.

15
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,729
That is true.

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,650
In fact, your expertise is not
required in this situation we are in.

17
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,030
All right, go ahead. Good luck.

18
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,360
Good luck.

19
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,720
Take the week off to rest.

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,570
No need to show off anymore.

21
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,470
Where are you headed later?
Are you going back to Rui?

22
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,650
Where else? With the current situation,

23
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,750
I'd need to buckle up.

24
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,610
Go back and think of a way quickly.

25
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,480
It is the same for everyone.

26
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,840
Seriously, this Apparel Alliance

27
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,020
specifically chose this
timing to cause trouble.

28
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,760
They are not idiots.

29
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,790
Look, what is this situation?

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,770
Everyone knows Singles' Day
is very profitable.

31
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,579
This is called "hit where it hurts".

32
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,530
They got you pinned with one move.

33
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,680
What nonsense.

34
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,280
They dumped their sticky situation on us.

35
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,430
If I were not fighting
for the clothes today,

36
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,290
I would not have gone through
this. How depressing.

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,230
-Hello.
-[Mr Duan.]

38
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,080
[Have you contacted them?]

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,740
Those people are unreliable.

40
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,670
Some of them said we are unreliable,

41
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,990
and others did not even wish to talk.

42
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,280
That's not it. I don't understand
what is on their mind.

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,510
Look at this situation we are in.

44
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,370
Now, you should unite to fight
against the external enemies.

45
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,690
Or else, how will you survive?

46
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,020
That is what I told them,

47
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,590
but they would not listen.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,240
What are we going to do?

49
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,790
We can't call our sole
company an alliance.

50
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,260
Which means I can't negotiate with them,
or we will end up being laughing stock.

51
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,860
[I don't even have the
right to negotiate now.]

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,250
All right.
Let's talk again when I'm back.

53
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,280
Are you thinking of doing
a live stream alliance?

54
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,860
With the current environment,

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,450
if the livestream industry does not
form partnership and unite,

56
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,430
we don't stand a chance to win.

57
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,390
It can't be. This is good news.

58
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,360
Why?

59
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,040
Are they not happy
to work with Mr Duan Jr?

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,510
Who says this is not a good thing?

61
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,220
That day, I first booked a meeting room

62
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,360
and invited them nicely.

63
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,050
Good food and drinks were supplied

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,990
while I talked at the front.

65
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,589
I gave them advice and talked
from the bottom of my heart.

66
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,350
No one listened or paid attention.

67
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,280
Let me think about how you said it.

68
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,220
Did you tell them about

69
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,990
noble feelings, your grand ambitions

70
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,030
and gave them an empty promise?

71
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,270
You management elites
like to make such mistakes.

72
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,550
That is not what you
should tell these people.

73
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,290
You need to be practical
by talking about money.

74
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,030
I have not got the deal yet. How
am I supposed to talk about money?

75
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,150
Where does that money come from?

76
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,830
You are a gang leader, right?
Teach me some tricks.

77
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,550
I'm a gang leader, whereas
you are a rich man's son.

78
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,740
I have no tricks for you

79
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,270
unless you apologize to me.

80
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,710
You are angry at me for calling you that?

81
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,600
If you don't wish to help, fine.

82
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,050
No need to use that trick on me,

83
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,060
it is no use.

84
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,190
Look at the environment we are in now.

85
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
One cannot survive without the other.

86
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
If worst comes to worst,
we will go bankrupt together.

87
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,480
Since you mentioned it,

88
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,159
all right.

89
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,909
Since one of us cannot
survive without the other,

90
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,110
I'll help you this once.

91
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,210
It hurts.

92
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,970
I'm envious of the princess in this game.

93
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,810
She has so many outfits.

94
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,800
It would be great if there are
so many clothes for us to sell.

95
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,940
You wish.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,710
If one can become princess
by having imagined so,

97
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,300
who is going to sell clothes?

98
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Look at me,

99
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,710
I have been selling
little ducklings since this morning.

100
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,290
Not many have been sold,

101
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,080
and my throat already hurts.

102
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,880
I'm not saying it is tough.

103
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,530
It is just

104
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,590
that spicy snack tastes horrible.

105
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,460
If we could not get infield
qualification for Singles' Day,

106
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,890
all these would just be empty talk.

107
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,220
We won't make any money.

108
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,330
This hardship is experienced by
every single live stream company.

109
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,480
Since we are at it,

110
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,030
did Su Su clock out and leave just now?

111
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,580
Her family arranged
another blind date for her.

112
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,390
The other party is said to be an
employee of a foreign company

113
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,080
who earns tens of thousands monthly.

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,000
If this goes on,

115
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,540
I might as well find
someone to get married too.

116
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,200
You can find a Little Blue Duck

117
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,850
and give birth to a few
Little Green Ducks.

118
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,390
Mr Five,

119
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,230
tell you what, I'm really
worried about myself now.

120
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,080
Now, each day after I go off work,

121
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,230
I have to film eating streams at
home to earn side income.

122
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,870
I even go to the gym to shower.

123
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,920
We were selling clothes just fine,

124
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
and now we even have to fight over it.

125
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,630
Even worse, we aren't
able to get a lot of supply.

126
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,140
Does any of you have a missing
button from your clothes?

127
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,470
I'll sew it back for you.

128
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,900
Chen Lang,

129
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,159
are we really joining
Duan Ran's live stream alliance?

130
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,670
I'm having dinner with them later.

131
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,950
Monitor the office for me today.

132
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,720
No problem,

133
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,670
but I feel a little uneasy.

134
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,950
Why?

135
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,200
I...

136
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,790
Joining the live stream alliance
is a good thing.

137
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,330
Besides, Apparel Alliance

138
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,390
won't find fault with us anymore.

139
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,310
Also,

140
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,260
our company needs to pay more attention
to product quality.

141
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,720
From now on, we can't get
goods from there anymore.

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,360
The goods from
wholesale markets won't do.

143
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,920
We have to differentiate ourselves
from those other companies.

144
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,250
So, from now on, we are on
the same boat with Duan Ran.

145
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,390
So what?

146
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,380
Times have changed.

147
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,360
Most importantly,

148
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,540
we are able to find out what
is going on for both sides

149
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,150
so it will be easier for us to judge.

150
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,560
I see.

151
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,280
I thought

152
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,670
you wished to save Zhang Jia Yun,
the damsel in distress.

153
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,840
That is also true.

154
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,480
If I co-operate with Duan Ran,

155
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,690
I will have more chances
to see Jia Yun in future.

156
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,250
In that case, work harder

157
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,350
and try to win over Jia Yun this time.

158
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,040
Oh right,

159
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,950
go tidy up the warehouse later

160
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,500
and see if we can portion out
one more truck of goods

161
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,780
to send to Rui.

162
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,030
No, wait. Are we giving them those?

163
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,790
-What's wrong?
-I...

164
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,600
Didn't you see how pitiful
Jia Yun was yesterday?

165
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,470
Poor her, she did not get a single piece.

166
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,070
Besides, now we are partners.

167
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,130
Giving them

168
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,110
shows that we are sincere, right?

169
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,900
Can't you help your brother this once?

170
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,370
All right. I'll get it ready
for you and send over immediately.

171
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,290
Go quickly.

172
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,630
What is the square footage for this unit?

173
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,820
Where is it located?

174
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,490
It is just a small studio in Siming.

175
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,710
What about the car?

176
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,630
Just a normal Volkswagen

177
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,130
for our family use.

178
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,740
I heard you are a programmer.

179
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,230
I work in a live stream company.

180
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,260
I don't have a newly-wed's house.

181
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,800
So, when we get married,

182
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,100
your house will be the
newly-wed's house temporarily.

183
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,940
However, your house
seems to be very small.

184
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,160
My aim is to buy a bungalow in future.

185
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,690
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

186
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,100
Your car seems to be quite old.

187
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,940
I hope, after we get married,

188
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,170
your parents will buy a new one for you.

189
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,570
That way, I can drive the new car to work.

190
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,430
Hopefully, after we get married,

191
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,330
you will resign

192
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,750
and take care of our
future family at home.

193
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,030
As for activities like gatherings
with friends and shopping,

194
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,230
the less, the better.

195
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,990
Your work sounds very busy.

196
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,800
Do you work overtime often?

197
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,660
Working overtime is normal.

198
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,190
My current salary is
unable to support a family.

199
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,670
I hope you can withdraw your
savings for both of us to spend.

200
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,650
I'm still moving up the ladder.

201
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,910
My current salary is not sufficient for
the entire family.

202
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,020
Therefore, in the beginning stages,
you will have to use your savings

203
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,480
to provide for the family.

204
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,210
Can I take a look at your form?

205
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,460
Some of the data on here

206
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,050
are based on my level of
satisfaction from this meeting,

207
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,770
so it will be your turn to ask next time.

208
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,570
For example, whether you have
family health history of any disease?

209
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,410
All right.

210
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,050
I think you did a great job
of filling up the form.

211
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,210
I'll bring it home to study. Thank you.

212
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,100
I'm not done yet.

213
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,130
Yu Shi!

214
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,370
Why are you here?

215
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,600
You did not follow me here, did you?

216
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,470
No, I did not follow you here.

217
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,580
How is that possible?

218
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,470
I bought vermicelli.
I came here to buy vermicelli.

219
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,810
Su Su, tell you what,

220
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,700
opposite us, there is a
vermicelli restaurant opposite

221
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,130
[Ya Hai Vermicelli Soup]

222
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,760
which is really famous
and the food is very tasty.

223
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,190
I'm here to buy vermicelli.

224
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,610
I was joking. Why are you so anxious?

225
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,060
I'm not anxious.

226
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,640
I'm not anxious at all.

227
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,900
Why are you here?

228
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,580
What are you two doing here?

229
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,840
I came here for a blind date.

230
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,540
I came across a disgusting man just now.

231
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,100
Look, he even filled up a form for me.

232
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,300
Let's go. Let's get away from him.

233
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Are you all right?

234
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,100
I'm fine. I got rid of him.

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,280
Why did you buy two bowls of vermicelli?

236
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,890
I have good appetite
since it is very tasty.

237
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,310
Why don't you eat a bowl?

238
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,190
You and I will have a bowl each.

239
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,200
Sure.

240
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,970
I'll treat you to drinks later.

241
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,230
All right, no problem.

242
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,850
Here, this place will do.

243
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,940
It is quite clean, don't worry.

244
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,030
-I'll do it, let me.
-Is that so?

245
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,220
It is very famous.

246
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,770
-This smells so nice.
-Pervert.

247
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,320
How petty.

248
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,610
-I can't believe such people exist.
-Exactly.

249
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,850
This tastes great.

250
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,730
Su Su, be honest with me.

251
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,720
Did that skinny man bully you?

252
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,640
Skinny man?

253
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,740
I...

254
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,100
I just gave it a guess.

255
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,430
I just guessed.

256
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,060
I have been to a lot of blind dates.

257
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,450
I kept coming across these
type of people, I'm used to it.

258
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,040
None of the candidates previously
were normal.

259
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,560
Hopefully I will meet
a decent man next time.

260
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,950
Next time?

261
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,930
Su Su,

262
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,750
why do you keep attending blind dates?

263
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,930
If not?

264
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,920
I leave my house to go to work daily

265
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,000
and go home after that.

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,660
I can only find a boyfriend
through blind dates.

267
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,100
How did you discover this restaurant?

268
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,110
It is so tasty.

269
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,640
Is it salty?

270
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,790
No, it is just right. It tastes great.

271
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,610
I'm so hungry.

272
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,810
Have a sip of water if it is salty.

273
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,060
Yu Shi, hold this.

274
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,650
You are too sweet.

275
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,720
-I got so mad just now.
-Slowly.

276
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,430
Slowly.

277
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,300
Raise your glass once more.

278
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,870
Recently, Apparel Alliance
came up with standard selling prices

279
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,550
which caused us a great deal of trouble.

280
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,820
Come on, we will go through it together.

281
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,410
Come on, come on.

282
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,740
-Here, come on.
-I feel terrible.

283
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,660
Drink.

284
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,030
How many glasses did you drink?
Don't your teeth hurt?

285
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,360
Of course my teeth hurt.

286
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,630
We have to drink. How else
will they negotiate with us?

287
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,360
Drink as work partners, right?

288
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,450
This dinner today is not a set-up, right?

289
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,380
I'm here to eat, that's all.

290
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,980
I don't care about other stuff.

291
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,870
Mr Duan, please.

292
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,490
Later, don't bring us

293
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,590
to the hotel to listen to your
grand speech again, all right?

294
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,390
-All right.
-You are something.

295
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,900
You are so long-winded. I'm not going.

296
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,420
Let's drink.

297
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,260
You all misunderstood.

298
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,160
Mr Duan does not have
that intention, right?

299
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,700
This dinner today

300
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,090
was arranged by Mr Duan himself.

301
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,350
We work so hard and
go through so much hardship.

302
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,800
And our aim?

303
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,550
Isn't it to earn more money

304
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,410
so the elderly and our
children in our family

305
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,760
can eat and live with peace of mind

306
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,030
and for ourselves to live a
little more comfortably, right?

307
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,120
-Live more comfortably?
-That's right.

308
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,920
And now, look what they did.

309
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,350
They are making things difficult for us.

310
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,840
I think Wu Zhong Quan is to blame.

311
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,190
Who does he think he is?

312
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,620
He is just as his name suggests,

313
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,220
which is neither loyal nor compassionate.

314
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,670
All he does is trick us.

315
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,470
He is too much.

316
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,880
-Right?
-Who does he think he is?

317
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,520
-Seriously.
-Let me tell you,

318
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,560
during this time, we cannot just sit
around and wait in despair, right?

319
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,750
Not only that,

320
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,430
we will attack and strike,
to get rid of them.

321
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,510
-That's right.
-Who tolerated them all along, right?

322
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,260
Today, we think of a plan that fits them

323
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,030
and tomorrow, another method
to benefit them, right?

324
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,010
All of us worked hard
for more than a year.

325
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,670
Why do they get to pocket all the money?

326
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,930
We won't agree to that.

327
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,320
We can't.

328
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,990
Let me tell you,

329
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,780
although there aren't a lot of us,

330
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,410
but if we, as brothers,

331
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,690
stay united to form an alliance,

332
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,670
after this Singles' Day,

333
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,410
each of us will earn these shopfront each.

334
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,589
These shopfronts.

335
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,520
-Who doesn't want one?
-I totally agree.

336
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,230
Is it you, or you?

337
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,740
How can we not be mad over this matter?

338
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,370
Ever since the prices
tally with supermarkets,

339
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,570
many brands cannot get sold at all.

340
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,800
Now, it is even worse.
They even forbid the use of coupons.

341
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,220
-I agree.
-How to do business this way?

342
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,540
My company fired
two more broadcasters today.

343
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,510
My goodness.

344
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,440
Let's drink.

345
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,980
It is too terrible.

346
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,020
-How terrible.
-In fact, here is our opinion.

347
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,450
Live stream companies

348
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,560
aren't that many to start with.

349
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,780
Do you think we could triumph over that
Apparel Alliance?

350
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,670
No, right?

351
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,280
Therefore, the way I see it,

352
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,740
for now, should we do that?

353
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,520
So, buddy...

354
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,740
Let's wait until it is over first.

355
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,130
We have to watch the situation
no matter what we do.

356
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,470
Now, the problem won't be
solved if we take a step back.

357
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,090
If we take a step back today,

358
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,810
tomorrow, it will cause us problem again.

359
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,610
And again, we will have to
take another step back.

360
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,240
We will end up at a dead end.

361
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,090
Now is not the situation
whereby, if we take a step back,

362
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,270
everything will be solved.

363
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,720
What is behind us? A bottomless chasm.

364
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,930
All of us will suffer if we
take another step back.

365
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,200
-We will fall into their trap.
-Right?

366
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,670
We can't go along with them, agree?

367
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,120
Why must we retreat?

368
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,000
Who will compensate for our effort?

369
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,940
They must not get into our way
while we are earning money.

370
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,000
Right? They can earn their own money.

371
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,060
I think you are right.

372
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,030
Definitely.

373
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,260
-That's right.
-Really. Well said, Mr Duan.

374
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,190
Mr Duan.

375
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,930
I get what you mean.

376
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,970
In fact, to put it simply,

377
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,770
we are used to slacking and being lazy.

378
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,770
No.

379
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,320
However, after what
you said today, Mr Duan,

380
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,350
the few of us will work
with you this time.

381
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,350
We believe in you.

382
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,710
Work together, that's the way.

383
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,630
Cheers.

384
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,570
Oh right, for our alliance,

385
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,190
should we send someone
to negotiate with them?

386
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,140
Since Mr Duan initiated this matter,

387
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,060
-he should be the representative.
-I completely agree.

388
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,260
Is anyone against it?

389
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,780
-No.
-I think he will do.

390
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,340
-He will represent us.
-So, that will be you, all right?

391
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,070
Best of luck to our co-operation.

392
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,930
In that case, this dinner
is on our representative.

393
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,250
Of course, this entire outing is on me.

394
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,710
That's right.

395
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,070
What about this? You will
treat us to foot spa later.

396
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,270
Say no further. No problem, go ahead.

397
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,870
-You will pay for foot spa.
-No problem.

398
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,750
Sure thing.

399
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,100
Dig in.

400
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,270
Let's eat.

401
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,050
Drink some water.

402
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,690
You seem to be in a good mood recently.

403
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,670
You are finally motivated.

404
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,390
Jia Yun is not home today?

405
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,430
She?

406
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,540
She went out to have
dinner with her friend.

407
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,240
In that case, tell her

408
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,830
not to come home.

409
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,150
Nowadays, you go out to drink
with work partners everyday

410
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,850
and Jia Yun also leaves house
very early each morning.

411
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,990
Be honest with me.

412
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,230
Did the company come across trouble?

413
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,410
Me and Jia Yun are both very busy.

414
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,510
Doesn't that mean our
company is doing great,

415
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,120
that's why we are very busy?

416
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
I'm worried, that's all.

417
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,490
No need to worry.

418
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,550
Everything is fine.
Things are going smoothly.

419
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,290
What about you? How is
your work at the shop?

420
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,150
No need to worry about me.

421
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,540
I get along with my colleagues well.

422
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,940
I'm glad you are doing well.
I can rest assured.

423
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,960
Don't worry, I did not get bullied.

424
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,650
Great.

425
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,700
Wake up.

426
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,980
Don't fall asleep just yet.

427
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,800
I have a present for you.

428
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,340
A present?

429
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,950
What is it?

430
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,990
Guess what this is?

431
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,410
A polar bear?

432
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,140
Isn't it cute?

433
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,810
This cat is too swollen.

434
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,190
Why is it so swollen?

435
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,510
That is not called swollen. It is cute.

436
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,840
Look at its rosy cheeks. How cute.

437
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,620
This stuff is for girls.

438
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,970
You don't like it? Forget it.
I'll give it to Jia Yun.

439
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,860
She especially likes these
kind of cats and dogs

440
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,910
and other cute stuff.

441
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,300
I like it. I like whatever
gifts you give me.

442
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,660
I like it so much.

443
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,330
Let me rest here for awhile.

444
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,720
Hold the cat properly, don't drop it.

445
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,730
Hello. Your drinks are ready.

446
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,700
Thank you.

447
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,790
Enjoy.

448
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,490
Young masters are so troublesome.

449
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,250
You won't order coffee at a cafe.

450
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,990
Instead, you ordered a glass of water.
How are they supposed to charge that?

451
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,660
Now, I'm insomniac every night.

452
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,600
My heart is unable to take it.
Of course I'm not drinking coffee.

453
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,560
I might faint.

454
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,870
Just tell me any ideas
and thoughts you have.

455
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,670
When negotiating with them,

456
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,950
we cannot tell them
grand principles and whatnot.

457
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,090
They won't listen.

458
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,970
Once you are there, you should tell them

459
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,010
"I want coupons for Singles' Day".

460
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,550
I'm going to give discounts.
You have to allow that.

461
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,070
You really think of
yourself as the industry leader?

462
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,140
You are trying to negotiate.

463
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,200
Is that how you go about it?

464
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,720
These people will never be satisfied.

465
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,240
Today, the fact that they dare to do this

466
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,300
means they came prepared.

467
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,610
Who knows what other trouble
they have in store for us?

468
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,000
I'll take care of the
matters upfront first.

469
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,460
Once I settle those,

470
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,340
whatever tricks they use against us later,

471
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,060
we have you to handle it.
Why should I be afraid?

472
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,110
Are you complimenting or criticizing me?

473
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,240
In my opinion,

474
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,410
we should go talk to Mr Wu first.

475
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,150
Pineapple Xpress?

476
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,310
We will triumph over the enemies if
we know them and ourselves well.

477
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,390
It seems we are destined
to cross paths with him.

478
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:29,520
[Shapowei Art Zone]

479
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,750
Why did you pull me here?

480
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,910
Sister Liu is watching the
stall for me. I'm worried.

481
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,550
What is there to worry about?

482
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,820
Has the business been good at all?

483
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,960
Let those from Cat Street
watch the stall for you.

484
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,130
Even I'm not worried.

485
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,250
That is exactly why I'm worried.

486
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,930
My mother's medicine
supply is running out.

487
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,460
I'm here to solve that for you.

488
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,390
What's wrong? What are you
talking about over there?

489
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,560
Jia Yun,

490
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,580
what do you think about Mao's performance

491
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,310
when he helped to purchase
goods for us last time?

492
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,290
I know our company has
been facing difficulty recently

493
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,140
and he is very familiar in this aspect,

494
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,180
so I'm wondering if he could help us.

495
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,480
You want him to work in our company?

496
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,950
What do you think?

497
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,600
Since you said so,

498
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,080
I don't think there will be a problem.

499
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,660
I disagree.

500
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,290
Jia Yun said it is fine.

501
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,180
Why do you say there is a problem?

502
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,600
Right, Ms Zhang. Mr Five is kind,

503
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,080
but I'm indeed unsuitable

504
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,610
for this type of upscale
office environment.

505
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,270
You know how I am.

506
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,040
If I stay inside here daily,

507
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,380
and offended someone again,

508
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,180
I will cause trouble for you all.

509
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,060
Can't you change
that temper of yours?

510
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,860
Dear, don't be angry.

511
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,100
What about this, Ms Zhang?

512
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,720
Hire me as a part-timer

513
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,910
and I'll get paid hourly.

514
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,590
In future, I'll come over
if there is work to do

515
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,870
but I'd rather not sit here
when there is nothing to do.

516
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,140
I just can't.

517
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,090
That is fine.

518
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,130
This will be less of a burden
for both parties.

519
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,060
Mr Five, what do you think?

520
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,680
Jia Yun, sorry to trouble you.

521
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,290
No problem at all.

522
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,470
Xi Xi told me to look after you all,

523
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,410
so naturally, I have to take
care of your families as well.

524
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,220
All right, I'll get them
to draft a contract.

525
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,750
You can tell Mao to come
and sign it, all right?

526
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,980
Now you are considered to
be Rui's employee as well.

527
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,740
I belong to you entirely.

528
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,290
I'm your little kitten.

529
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,310
Excuse us.

530
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,850
All of you have yet to eat lunch, right?

531
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,060
Come on, let's go.

532
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,900
Ms Zhang, are you treating us to lunch?

533
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,770
I want to eat HaiDiLao Hotpot.

534
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,640
All right, so,

535
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,080
our company is not doing
that great right now.

536
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,250
I think all of us should bring into play

537
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,100
the spirit of hard work and plain living.

538
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,870
I'll treat you all to box lunches.

539
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,120
Forget it. I'll order myself.

540
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,800
I feel like eating foie gras.

541
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,000
I want to eat all-you-can-eat roast duck.

542
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,290
Jia Yun.

543
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,350
[Cloud Live]

544
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,860
Is this for us?

545
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,450
My goodness. We are finally saved.

546
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,510
Jia Yun, it is time for you to
sacrifice for our company.

547
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,970
Calm down, all of you.

548
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,770
Jia Yun hasn't agreed
to it yet. Isn't that right?

549
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,360
Ms Zhang, what kind of expression is that?

550
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,830
I'm lending you a hand
in times of trouble.

551
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,120
Why? You don't like it?

552
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,580
I'll ask them to bring it back right away.

553
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,840
It is no trouble at all.

554
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,180
There is this saying which goes,

555
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,990
"One who is unaccountably
solicitous is hiding evil intentions."

556
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,890
What is with our society?

557
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,890
Wretched men are defined as being cool

558
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,560
and gentlemen as suck-ups.

559
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,970
If that is the case, wait for it.

560
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,390
In order to get this batch of goods,

561
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,760
look how I got hit.

562
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,410
Half of my tooth got chipped off.

563
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,780
I spent RMB15,000 on dental filling alone.

564
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,710
That is quite enough for a suck-up.

565
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,020
Oh no. Are you all right?

566
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,860
I feel all better the moment I saw you.

567
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,450
It is settled then.

568
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,320
Anyway, I'm quite thick-skinned.

569
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,660
I'm fine if you are offering
all these to me as gifts.

570
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,680
I'll accept these goods.

571
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,300
I gave you these with the
hope that you will accept it.

572
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,460
I'm happy to help.

573
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,120
No, that does not sound like you.

574
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,880
Is there no additional terms?

575
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,350
I remember now that you mention it.

576
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,030
Jia Yun,

577
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,110
with your personality,
since I was such a great help,

578
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,040
you should have meals with
me for the rest of our lives

579
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,590
or you will feel bad, right?

580
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,080
Yuanbao, this suits you.

581
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,540
I have money to eat now!
I finally get to eat at long last!

582
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,870
Since you gave me so much goods

583
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,630
and the fact that you
sustained a little injury,

584
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,570
one steamboat meal.

585
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,620
One steamboat meal?

586
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,070
-No next time.
-Let's go.

587
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,870
Wait, I'm not done yet.

588
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,160
Go ahead.

589
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,450
Look, these colleagues of mine

590
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,070
have not eaten lunch yet.

591
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,770
Besides, it would be boring for two
of us to eat steamboat on our own.

592
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,510
It is more lively if all
of us eat together.

593
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,840
I understand. Go ahead.

594
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,100
Girls, do you want to eat steamboat?

595
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,750
Yes!

596
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,560
Madam,

597
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,690
what brings you here to our shop?

598
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,760
You are Qian Xi Xi?

599
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,440
That's right. That's me.

600
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,130
Look, all these clothes hangers
are placed haphazardly.

601
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,270
It is not aesthetically pleasing at all.

602
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,370
No, madam, don't misunderstand.

603
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,940
This is because a customer
was choosing clothes just now.

604
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,450
Madam, the decorations in our shop

605
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,080
were ideated by designers.

606
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,970
These have always been arranged this way.

607
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,070
That is before.

608
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,560
It can't remain unchanged forever.

609
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,420
The customers will
experience aesthetic fatigue.

610
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,950
Madam, actually, if the
hangers in our shop

611
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,610
are too frequently adjusted,

612
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,710
it will also cause discomfort
among our customers.

613
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,530
Besides, our brand has
a fixed customer base.

614
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,970
-That's right.
-Stop finding excuses for your laziness.

615
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,910
Use your brains while working.

616
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,420
What is with Human Resource nowadays?

617
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,400
What kind of staff did they hire?

618
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,160
You are wearing T-shirts
instead of uniforms.

619
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,650
You don't even watch your own appearance.

620
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,580
How many times did I emphasize
the importance of proper attire?

621
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,840
You degraded the overall image of
the sales associates.

622
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,820
I'm sorry, madam. Our shop's
uniform is a shirt.

623
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,700
I had no time to iron it since I left
for work in a hurry this morning.

624
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,710
I'll take note next time

625
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,650
to dress according to the rules.

626
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,350
I will also take note of how
the hangers are placed.

627
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,950
It is a fact that you did wrong

628
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,700
and so, you will get punished.

629
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,380
As usual,

630
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,990
you will be responsible to
clean the corridors today.

631
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,000
Madam...

632
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,490
Sure, no problem, madam.

633
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,970
Leave it to me. I'll take care of it.

634
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,020
Here we go.

635
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,720
So, what do you think?

636
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,570
Good job for the arrangements.

637
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,970
These lobsters aren't huge

638
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,480
but they were caught this morning.

639
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,730
The freshness is guaranteed.

640
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,320
-Did you hear that?
-More will be served if one is not enough.

641
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,680
That's right, that dish taste quite good.

642
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,280
-You can have a taste.
-Sure.

643
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,370
Oh right, bring her a Basa fish later.

644
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,900
The type without pricks.

645
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,590
The beef I had yesterday,
any of those left?

646
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,920
I specifically kept a portion for you.

647
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,640
Everyone, I need to
formally announce this.

648
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,610
This restaurant serves delicious beef.

649
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,990
The beef is imported from Japan daily

650
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,560
and never left overnight.

651
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,179
Oh right, I just got
a fresh batch of scallops

652
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,080
which have not been unsealed.
Let's go and choose some.

653
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,570
Right, I'll choose some of
the bigger ones for you.

654
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,770
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

655
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,090
I'm so envious.

656
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,810
Jia Yun, Mr Chen treats you so well.

657
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,080
I would say yes to him if I were you.

658
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,580
Jia Yun, although Chen Lang's

659
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,550
way of handling matters
is a little questionable,

660
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,219
he treats you well enough.

661
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,850
There are many others who treat me well.

662
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,230
Mr Five, in future, tell Mao

663
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,920
to join our activities more often,
since he just joined our company.

664
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,199
He is occupied today.

665
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,090
He will work here as a part-timer

666
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:45,100
and he needs to find someone
to watch his stall at Cat Street.

667
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,900
He also needs to help his mother.

668
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,949
Next time. I'll definitely
ask him along next time.

669
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,870
Next time it is.

670
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,639
Can we cook the meat now?

671
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,520
Wait awhile more. We can't
open the pot yet, calm down.

672
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,250
I'm hungry.

673
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,080
The entire level takes
too much effort to clean.

674
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,500
Xi Xi, it must have been
very tiring for you today.

675
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,900
My body feels sore all over.
I'm exhausted.

676
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,910
I'll do it.

677
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,940
I need to take a rest for awhile.

678
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,920
My goodness.

679
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,820
Xi Xi, try this quickly.

680
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,240
I bought this milk tea
especially for you.

681
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,200
Thank you, I'm so thirsty.

682
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,130
-Drink more.
-Finish it.

683
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,990
Don't just drink the milk tea.

684
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,190
The rice is still warm. Eat some, quick.

685
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,530
Thank you, Manager.

686
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,100
It is great to have you two
during these moments.

687
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,240
I love you two.

688
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,570
Don't worry about it.

689
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,030
Just leave it here.
I'll rest for awhile first.

690
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,210
Tell you what,

691
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,330
don't' worry.

692
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,570
After all, I cleaned men's toilet before.

693
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,290
I can handle this much.

694
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,650
Xi Xi, let me tell you,

695
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,200
that building manager was
standing up for her sister-in-law.

696
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,820
In her opinion, because
you joined our company,

697
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,830
her sister-in-law's position
was snatched away.

698
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,890
Sister-in-law?

699
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,290
So she is related to the building manager.

700
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,360
-That's right.
-Tell you what,

701
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,930
her sister-in-law

702
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,020
is five more kilograms fatter than her.

703
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,460
Even if she goes through
the recruitment process,

704
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,260
she won't be able to join either.

705
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,550
I knew it. It's no wonder.

706
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,660
She looked at me as if we were enemies.

707
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,790
And here I was thinking what happened.

708
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,550
Being a fashion icon

709
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,500
can be such a headache sometimes.

710
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,850
Don't make it too curly.

711
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,910
What is it? You sounded urgent.

712
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,790
Mr Chen,

713
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,570
you only kept me waiting for 40
minutes this time. I'm flattered.

714
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,800
I was having lunch with Jia Yun.

715
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,180
I was going to take the opportunity
to go shopping with her.

716
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,370
Be grateful that I came over.

717
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,470
So what is it?

718
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,260
I chanced upon him by accident.

719
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,270
What do you mean?

720
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,610
What are you doing?

721
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,760
Mr Wu.

722
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,750
Mr Wu.

723
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,920
Hi.

724
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,130
Mr Wu,

725
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,480
I did not notice before,

726
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,340
but under all that beard,
in fact, your skin is quite smooth.

727
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,970
Is that so? Let's see. Where?

728
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,220
-It is fair and smooth.
-Don't.

729
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,410
You are getting your hair styled today.

730
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,180
In fact, I learned hairstyling
skills before this.

731
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,720
We can do wavy hair with this.

732
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,650
Your curls won't do. Leave it to me.

733
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,520
Be nice to Mr Wu.

734
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,550
I apologize.

735
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,600
Mr Wu, the two of us

736
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,420
came all the way here.

737
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,150
Don't let our effort go to waste, right?

738
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,180
Today, treat it as doing a good deed

739
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,850
and release some news for us

740
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,660
so we will go back happily.

741
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,300
If you disagree...

742
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,940
-I think, the two of us...
-I had better settle your hair first.

743
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,970
I think we should curl
your hair after all.

744
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,300
We're long time friends.

745
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,630
Listen, I'm not the one who started it.

746
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,560
Long time friends? You are
forcing us into dead ends.

747
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,090
I'll be honest with you.

748
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,780
Apparel Alliance was pressured by
Entity Alliance

749
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,240
to request the live stream
companies to standardize pricing.

750
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,410
Entity Alliance?

751
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,450
That's right. Entity Alliance.

752
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,650
You all issue coupons
all the time to reduce the prices

753
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,490
and caused the actual shops
to have lesser business

754
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,170
so they gathered the people
from industry associations

755
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,980
to form Entity Alliance that
specifically deals with e-commerce owners.

756
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,150
They said if standardization of pricing
is not implemented,

757
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,750
they will reduce the number of shopfronts

758
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,330
and change them into restaurants,
entertainment centres and cinemas.

759
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,650
Therefore,

760
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,290
you all forced us to sign the agreement

761
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,190
and if we don't, you will
stop supplying goods for us?

762
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,170
Brick-and-mortar businesses
comprise more than 70% in total.

763
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,900
As you know, the majority wins.

764
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,300
What else can we do?

765
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,330
So they used you to go against us.

766
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,960
Duan Ran, come out for a second.

767
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,410
Wait for us,
we will be back to fix your hair.

768
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,800
Chen Lang,

769
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,150
where are you going?

770
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,290
The interrogation is not over yet.
Where are you going?

771
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,290
You are still pretending?

772
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,490
You were pretending in there just now,

773
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,070
and you still won't stop pretending?

774
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,070
Don't you know about
Entity Alliance?

775
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,040
How would I know?

776
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,550
Everyone in the industry knows

777
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,870
your father is the president of this
Entity Alliance.

778
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,860
If I were to guess,

779
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,790
who knows how your father
is involved in this matter?

780
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,220
You did not team up with your father

781
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,050
and came to get
information from me, right?

782
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,980
Wait, watch what you are saying.

783
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,350
My father?

784
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,060
I'm his own son.

785
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,550
If he came up with this to sabotage
me, how does it benefit him?

786
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,560
Now, I'm genuinely considering

787
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,680
the benefit of you and me, as well
as the entire live stream alliance.

788
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,340
In that case, go back quickly
and talk to your father about it.

789
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,540
Or else, which company
would want to co-operate with you?

790
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,790
Such a waste of my time.

791
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,050
I should have gone shopping with Jia Yun.

792
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,500
Shopping? What about this Mr Wu?

793
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,170
You stay here to curl his hair.

794
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,430
Go away.

795
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,330
Dad.

796
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,480
Why did you suddenly come to see me?

797
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,540
How did you threaten
Apparel Alliance?

798
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,650
Did they pressure you

799
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,230
and you can't take any more?

800
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,200
No, that's not it.

801
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,140
I know how to handle them.

802
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,420
I just want to know whether this matter

803
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,880
has to do with you.

804
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,870
This Entity Alliance

805
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,760
was indeed initiated by Song.

806
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,790
I have experience investing in
e-commerce for some years

807
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,320
so he thought he would get me

808
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,630
to be the president this time.

809
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,350
I have known him for years now

810
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
and I could not refuse, so I said yes.

811
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,110
His series of actions,

812
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,430
in fact, I did hear about it.

813
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,300
He is a very aggressive man.

814
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,270
The operation this time

815
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,350
indeed matches the benefit of
Entity Alliance.

816
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,090
That is, to set a trap

817
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,970
for the e-commerce owners
before Singles' Day.

818
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,660
I estimate that

819
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,630
this time, you all don't have
much chance to turn that around.

820
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,000
And what is your opinion on this?

821
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,350
My take on this is very simple.

822
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,770
I hope you guys,

823
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,670
including his Entity Alliance,

824
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,080
can each take a step back.

825
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,260
Compromise will make a
conflict much easier to resolve.

826
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,110
Is this matter up to you to decide?

827
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,810
In fact, no.

828
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:49,610
Even if we don't have much chance,
we still have to try, right?

829
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,310
What? Only his association can get united

830
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,660
and we can't? Impossible.

831
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,800
All right, I'll get going.
Don't worry, just wait and see.

833
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,350
Mr Duan, is there anything you need?

834
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,210
I'm just wondering, where is Qian Xi Xi?

835
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,340
Xi Xi was told by Building Manager
to go clean the corridor.

836
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,940
You all still need to do that?

837
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,100
No, not for us.

838
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,510
The manager keeps
making things difficult for Xi Xi lately.

839
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,330
All right.

840
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,840
I'll get going.

841
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,630
Please take care.

843
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,290
Hi, sir. Welcome to I Do.

844
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,450
How can I help?

845
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,240
All right, for the follow-up,

846
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,760
I'll ask them to liaise with you.

847
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,680
Sure.

848
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,530
-See you.
-Sure. Take care.

850
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,800
Why are you here?

851
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,810
I'm here to look for Duan Ran.

852
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,580
No one was at the reception
so I didn't want to barge in.

853
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,310
He went out with Yu Shi just now.

854
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,600
Do you need him for something?

855
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,950
We are going to negotiate
with them tomorrow.

856
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,120
On top of that, his father

857
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,350
is the current president for
Entity Alliance.

858
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,630
So, I came over to talk to them

859
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,090
and see what is their plan.

860
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,190
I did not know that.

861
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,320
I only found out yesterday too.

862
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,480
After all, I don't wish to lose money.

863
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,850
On one hand, I'm an ally

864
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,110
but on the other, I might sabotage myself.

865
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,700
Duan Ran is not that type of person.

866
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,840
I know he is not,

867
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,960
but I'm not sure about his father.

868
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,330
After all, he once sabotaged me.
