This cannot be settled
with a meal of crawfish.

5
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,440
Not a problem.

6
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,670
What do you want?

7
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,210
Just leave it to me,

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,030
but you must tell me the answer.

9
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,330
Let me think about it.

10
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,780
I'll owe it to you first.

11
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,080
Listen to me.

12
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,180
This is very important to my dignity

13
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,259
at work and at home.

14
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,490
All right.

15
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
You should figure out how to

16
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,820
face Xi Xi when she returns later.

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,030
How to face her?

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,390
I'll just let it be.

19
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,870
I get mad just thinking about it.

20
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,670
Well, about her resignation,

21
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,160
I admit that I was being too emotional.

22
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,300
Isn't it?

23
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,420
Look at what she's doing now.

24
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,300
She's a girl.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,410
It's late,

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,950
yet she's out with some man.

27
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,490
I can't reach her and she
wouldn't pick up her phone.

28
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,290
What does she think she's doing?

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,690
She went overboard.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,370
How ridiculous.

31
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,539
Duan Ran.

32
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,830
Have you ever thought

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,760
for Xi Xi from her point of view?

34
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,320
What do you mean?

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,060
Help her decide dating spots?

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,350
Actually, she told me many times

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,200
that she can't take it anymore.

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,540
She knows her weaknesses.

39
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,900
She knew from the start

40
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,410
that you were supposed to be CEO.

41
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,350
You were inexperienced back then.

42
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,810
That's why she took on
this responsibility.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,350
She wanted to give you more time

44
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,020
to grow and learn.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,110
However, I know

46
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,120
that she's extremely exhausted.

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,520
I hope you will learn to
bear this responsibility

48
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,310
so she can take a break.

49
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,020
Can you do that?

50
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,170
No.

51
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,310
If she wants to take a break,

52
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,000
it's completely fine.

53
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,920
I also want her to get some rest.

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,620
However, I can't take on the
position as CEO.

55
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,640
That position is reserved for her.

56
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,720
Why are you resigning?

57
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,710
Although you're the CEO,

58
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,120
I think

59
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,030
there's no need for you
to bear the consequences.

60
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,290
Do you want me to be honest?

61
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,560
Of course.

62
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,140
I don't deserve it.

63
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,920
Don't deserve what?

64
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,050
I don't deserve to be CEO.

65
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,250
Why not?

66
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,560
Previously, I heard that
Uncle Duan and Aunt Zhou

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,060
did not allow Duan Ran and I to date.

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,900
I was angry on the inside.

69
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,960
So I wanted to snatch the position
away from Duan Ran.

70
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,650
However, unexpectedly,

71
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,720
I really became the CEO.

72
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,590
I was in a dilemma.

73
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,930
I wanted to prove myself,

74
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
yet I'm afraid of underperforming.

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,750
The more I think about it,

76
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,950
the more anxious I become.

77
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,280
The more I cared,
the more restricted I am.

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,870
Do you understand?

79
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,550
I guess so.

80
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,890
It's like

81
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,000
when you try to control something,

82
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,780
in the end, it controls you instead.

83
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,500
Jiang Zhe Yang.

84
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,000
You're amazing.

85
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,030
You understand me so well.

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,860
I wish Duan Ran was half
as good as you were.

87
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,310
When I try to talk to him,

88
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,210
he'd argue with me.

89
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,420
I realized you enjoy the way

90
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,570
he argues with you.

91
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,420
We were like that since young.

92
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,300
I'm used to it.

93
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:55,100
Does that mean on the inside,

94
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,430
you're feeling inferior?

95
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,590
Yes, I am.

96
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,340
No one acknowledges me,

97
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,760
including myself.

98
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,340
Check out my album.

99
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,300
Well, I think we should get some rest.

100
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,750
I'm going to bed.

Hey, Jia Yun.

103
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,150
I need your help in something else.

104
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,940
What is it?

105
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,150
I want to apologize to Xi Xi.

106
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,730
Back then when you persuaded
me to join the company,

107
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,990
you promised to allow me to study abroad.

108
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,150
For your company

109
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,270
and your relationship,
I contributed a lot.

110
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,200
When will you fulfil your promise?

111
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,300
How about this?

Do you know who Zhang Si is?

I'm Zhang Si.

124
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,870
I wanted to convince him
to reconcile with Fei Fei.

125
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,730
What do we do? This was a wasted trip.

126
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,640
Not necessarily.

127
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,160
At least we know

128
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,720
this wouldn't work.

129
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,670
I can't explain this to Xi Xi.

130
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,130
Give Ms Qian a call first.

131
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,159
Okay, you should call her.

132

It's going to be fine, Su Su.

we will try something else.

What do you have in mind?

135

Let me ask you.

136
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,760
Why did you call the game

137
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,350
the Palm of Your Hand?

138
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,710
It was a random name.

139
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,470
Why would you do that?

140
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,800
I'm smart. I blurted it out.

There's one more album to go.

147

You released many albums.

If we listen to each one,

149
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,430

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,680
A great opportunity showed up.

174
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,650
This movie

175
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,170
will help remove the label of idol off me.

176
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,620
I really want to obtain the role.

177
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,420
It's a story about

178
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,920
a serial killer and a female broadcaster.

179
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
Thus,

180
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,900
when I approached you, I wanted to

181
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,140
understand the life of a
broadcaster through you.

182
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,890
Honestly,

183
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,220
I didn't believe you initially.

184
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,340
You're the Jiang Zhe Yang.

185
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,770
A top star like you

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,460
was willing to help us out.

187
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,220
I understand you very well,

188
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,250
but I'm surprised I was any help.

189
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
You should seize this opportunity.

190
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,240
However,

191
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,920
as I start to get to know you,

192
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,730
I realized that you've

193
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,230
many attractive traits.

194
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,960
I'm very happy when I'm with you.

195
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,050
Hence, I can't help myself.
I want to see you every day.

196
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,940
Eventually, I realized

197
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,280
I really

198
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,530
fell in love with you.

199
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,470
Thank you, Jiang Zhe Yang.

200
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,220
To me,

201
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,230
I've always thought of you
as a good friend.

202
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,540
Is it because of Duan Ran?

203
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,160
This is between us.

204
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,850
It has nothing to do with him.

205
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,530
I treat the bond we share as  friendship.

206
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,590
We'll still be good friends, right?

207
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,920
Yes, good friends.

208
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,710
Good friends.

209
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,590
We came here for nothing.

210
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,980
Actually, I had the chance

211
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,910
to stop this issue from worsening.

212
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,680
Because of that scoundrel,

213
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,970
I lost my temper at Fei Fei for no reason.

214
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,030
The situation ended up like this.

215
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,270
I'm such a failure.

216
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,560
I lack both in IQ and EQ.

217
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,080
That's impossible.

218
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,190
Firstly,

219
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,040
you're an undergraduate.

220
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,970
Since you graduated,

221
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,590
that proves your IQ is fine.

222
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,300
Look, Su Su. Secondly,

223
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,470
you're quite a social butterfly.

224
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,630
Many people like to be around you.

225
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,500
Even an uninteresting dork like me

226
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,210
likes to be your friend.

227
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,750
Your EQ is fine.

228
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,000
You're fine.

229
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,780
I must be unlucky then.

230
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,650
All the men I met were scoundrels.

231
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,280
If they aren't in it for marriage,

232
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,080
why did they attend blind dates?

233
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,670
Su Su, listen to me.

234
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,900
Usually,

235
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,540
the conventional mindset believes that

236
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,180
a woman's prime for marriage and pregnancy

237
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,850
is 25 to 28 years old.

238
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,890
This is a conventional belief.

239
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,270
Most women above 28 years old

240
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,680
feel a sense of emptiness.

241
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,780
They feel the anxiety of
being eliminated by nature.

242
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,770
Since the progression of mankind,

243
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,580
such beliefs are now outdated.

244
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,540
Do not fall prey to those
Nihilistic beliefs.

245
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,040
What do you mean?

246
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,480
I mean,

247
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,280
don't rush into a marriage.

248
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,220
I'm not anxious but my mum is.

249
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,310
I'm waiting for someone to marry me.

250
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,260
Don't worry.

251
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,530
Su Su, one fine day,

252
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,520
I think you will meet someone

253
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,820
who understands you.

254
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,190
This is very important.

255
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,830
It will be too late then.

256
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,180
I'm taking a nap.

257
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,020
Darling, you're home.

258
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,100
Hold on.

259
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,340
What's going on?

260
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,860
What are you doing here late at night?

261
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
Jia Yun is asleep.

262
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,110
You're going to bother her.

263
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,170
Jia Yun isn't asleep. This is for you.

264
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,300
Have a seat.

265
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,470
Despite so,

266
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,830
it's inappropriate for you to stay here.

267
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,060
Jia Yun isn't home.

268
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,460
She's out for some fun.

269
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,180
I waited for you for a long time.

270
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,780
I wanted to apologize to you.

271
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,530
What is it for?

272
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,520
All these while,

273
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,530
I've never thought from
your point of view.

274
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,750
I'm sorry for that.

275
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,030
I didn't try to share your burdens,

276
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,230
or understand your frustrations,

277
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,810
I'm sorry for that.

278
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,750
One more thing.

279
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,290
Today, at the entrance of QE,

280
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,090
I was wrong for what I said.

281
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,540
I acted impulsively.

282
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry for that as well.

283
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,400
Did Jia Yun teach you to say that?

284
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,180
With that brain of yours,

285
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,590
you wouldn't be able to figure it out.

286
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,420
Jia Yun did guide me a little.

287
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,860
However, the severity of this matter,

288
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,380
my apologetic attitude,

289
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,570
and the depth of my
acknowledgment for my mistakes

290
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,270
are all from me.

291
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,430
It's genuine.

292
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,320
Hold on.

293
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,990
Something isn't right.

294
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,010
Stay right there.

295
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,170
Why would you talk to Jia Yun
about the both of us?

296
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,960
Did you disclose our relationship to her?

297
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,910
Not at all.

298
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,510
We agreed to this.

299
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,750
We will not tell anyone about us.

300
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,680
Jia Yun would never betray me.

301
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,619
She wouldn't leave me here alone

302
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,020
and stay out at a hotel.

303
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,720
Look, Jia Yun

304
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,230
works very hard.

305
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,750
She needs some time to relax, right?

306
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,300
I think we need to relax as well.

307
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Tell me honestly.

308
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,060
Where did you send her to?

309
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,790
Jia Yun should be

310
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,090
enjoying the view of nature
from her fancy hotel room.

311
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,960
Fine, you're forgiven.

312
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,160
You forgive me?

313
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,120
Alright, let me ask you.

314
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,180
Where did you go with Jiang Zhe Yang?

315
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,240
Look at the time now.

316
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,760
It was just the both of you.

317
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,600
-You're so fierce.
-Where have you been?

318
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,610
What did we do?

319
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,960
We had a conversation.

320
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,690
A conversation?

321
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,370
What is there to talk about?

322
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,600
You were out so late.

323
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm worried when you're not home.

324
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,370
Were you worried?

325
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,510
Of course.

326
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,620
Really?

327
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,860
Jiang Zhe Yang is a celebrity.

328
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,510
What are you afraid of?

329
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,350
I'm still worried.

330
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,530
We talked about you.

331
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,120
What did you talk about?

332
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,290
We talked about your great qualities.

333
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,460
Well, what kind of qualities?

334
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,530
I'm not going to tell you.

335
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,130
It's a secret between
Jiang Zhe Yang and me.

336
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,550
What?

337
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,930
It's our secret.

338
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,550
The both of you have secrets?

339
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,450
How dare you share
secrets with someone else?

340
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,090
It's getting late. You should go home.

341
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,950
You're wearing my pyjamas.
Where are your clothes?

342
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,710
Is it in the room?

343
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,150
Where are your clothes?

344
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,070
Did you hide them?

345
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,610
Hurry up and leave.

346
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,230
I need to shower.

347
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,540
Where did you put them?

348
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,400
Where did you keep your clothes?

349
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,150
It's late and you're
making me leave alone.

350
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,310
It's dangerous out there.

351
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,360
Sir.

352
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,380
Look at yourself.

353
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,930
You're a huge man towering at over 180cm.

354
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,350
If you walk on the streets at night,

355
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,530
others would be afraid of you instead.

356
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,060
I might encounter

357
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,050
a group of young girls.

358
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,810
I can't take it.

359
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,070
It's dark outside.

360
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,820
No one would be able to see you.

361
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,560
I'm a dazzling man...

362
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,790
-Stop it. Hurry up.
-What's up?

363
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,780
You need to leave. I've something to do.

364
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,320
What is it?

365
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,620
I'm going to shower. Once I return,

366
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,180
you should be gone, do you understand?

367
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,600
Hurry and go.

368
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,760
Leave the flowers here. You may go.

369
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,080
Do you hear me?

370
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,090
What did you want to tell me?

371
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,270
I wanted to tell you that

372
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,200
I think something is going on
between the two of them.

373
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,040
What is it?

374
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,370
The night before yesterday,

375
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,960
I saw Duan Ran carrying Xi Xi.

376
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,840
He said Xi Xi twisted her ankle.

377
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,700
It didn't seem like it.

378
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,350
The both of them were giggling around.

379
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
What are you trying to say?

380
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,540
Are the both of them together?

381
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,960
That's impossible.

382
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,240
Why not?

383
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,700
It's been one whole day.

384
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,110
Xi Xi hasn't called.

385
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,100
Duan Ran isn't home yet.

386
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,130
Something is wrong.

387
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,170
I realized

388
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,390
when you were discussing work,

389
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,530
Duan Ran would protect Xi Xi.

390
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,050
Since when has he done that?

391
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,330
He probably grew up.

392
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,410
He matured and learnt
to take care of others.

393
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,070
The both of them are partners,
starting their own company.

394
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,280
It's a bond of friendship they built.

395
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,300
Well, I think

396
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,590
it's wrong for you to

397
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,050
place them to work together, okay?

398
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,060
All right. Get some rest.

399
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,470
Don't worry about it.

400
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,380
Hi, Jing.

401
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,750
-You're here.
-We're here.

402
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,780
-Ouyang.
-Ms Jing.

403
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,760
Yang Yang, the director is here.

404
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,490
Director.

405
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,160
This is Yang Yang.

406
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,720
Nice to meet you, sir. I'm Ouyang.

407
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,470
Have a seat.

408
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,650
Yang Yang, you became fitter.

409
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,810
I worked out a little.

410
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,190
He goes to the gym on time every day.

411
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,740
He's working hard for the role of Xiao Yu.

412
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,790
That's impressive.

413
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,490
The new idols nowadays are

414
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,030
unable to deal hardships.

415
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,370
Forget about sacrificing
for a specific role.

416
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,560
You did a great job.

417
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,730
I'm not complimenting him
just because I'm his manager.

418
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,690
Yang Yang goes to the gym every day.

419
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,600
His diet only consists of chicken breasts.

420
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,150
His discipline is amazing.

421
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,180
There aren't many actors
who'd work so hard.

422
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,040
Since you had such
practice and involvement,

423
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,990
share your experience with us.

424
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,710
No problem, Ms Jing.

425
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,910
When I first read the script, I find that

426
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,910
Xiao Yu was a psychopath.

427
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,240
However, he wasn't born this way.

428
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,540
Due to certain things or people,

429
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,270
he gradually became one.

430
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,090
His girlfriend was a broadcaster.

431
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,290
Broadcasters are very similar

432
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,180
to celebrities like us.

433
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,040
What's the matter?

434
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,300
That went well with Jing and the director.

435
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,890
Why are you still upset?

436
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,530
Are you worried your mum would disagree?

437
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,460
I'm worried about what she thinks,

438
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,100
but that's not it.

439
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,820
What is it?

440
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,580
Why are you so unhappy?

441
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,920
If there's nothing we could do,

442
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,410
let's sign the contract before

443
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,470
my mum realizes.

444
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,710
It would be too late then.
What do you think?

445
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,770
That is our last resort.

446
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,430
We should try to convince her.

447
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,550
-All right.
-We will talk to her.

448
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,920
What's going on with you?

449
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,420
What made you unhappy?

450
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,360
You've a weak stomach.

451
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,970
You should reduce your alcohol intake.

452
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,220
Is it because you met Qian Xi Xi

453
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,750
it didn't end well?

454
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,110
You sure are sharp.

455
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,350
I can't keep anything from you.

456
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,930
Yesterday, I wanted to comfort her.

457
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,380
During her difficulties,

458
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,550
I wanted to be there for her, like a
hero rescuing the damsel in distress.

459
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,550
Unexpectedly...

460
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,820
What happened? Did she reject you?

461
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,910
Did I say something wrong?

462
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,670
What did you say?

463
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,560
I told her,

464
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,850
I approached her in the
beginning to understand the role.

465
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,570
Am I being a jerk?

466
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,130
It's alright.

467
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,470
Normally in situations like
these, girls would be

468
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,290
touched when the guy is honest.

469
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,030
Forget it.

470
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,530
I tried my best,

471
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,350
but it's nothing compared
to her childhood bond.

472
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,070
Did she tell you it was
because of Duan Ran?

473
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,190
It was because she did not
bring up Duan Ran at all.

474
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,520
That's why I figured
it was because of him.

475
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,790
I can imagine.

476
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,290
I felt the same when
Duan Ran and I were together.

477
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,190
When he's

478
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,100
video calling his sister,

479
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,940
he'd not pick up my calls.

480
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,010
When his sister is in a bad mood,

481
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,170
he'd text her all night to cheer her up

482
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,830
without sleeping a wink.

483
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,740
Did the both of you
break up because of this?

484
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,800
Not really.

485
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,880
I think there were many reasons

486
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,680
to our break up.

487
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,660
This was one of it.

488
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,410
[Shapowei Art Zone, Art, Life, Live]

489
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,220
Girl,

490
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,170
I heard something happened yesterday.

491
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,430
Don't be nosy.

492
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,440
-What are you doing?
-Wow.

493
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,560
Lady, you're glowing beautifully.

494
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,300
You do not look like someone
who just lost her job.

495
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,500
Jia Yun, stop joking around.

496
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,790
Can't you see? I'm packing up.

497
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,930
Give me a hand.

498
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,750
Today is my last day at Rui Live.

499
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,140
You...

500
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Have you really thought it through?

501
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,360
Yes.

502
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,380
I'm absolutely sure about this.

503
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,980
I was very rational and reasonable

504
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,980
when I submitted my resignation
to Mr Duan and Mr Shen.

505
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,460
You're aware as well.

506
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,350
Ever since Yuan Yuan left,

507
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,550
the pressure grew.

508
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,310
Due to my incompetency,

509
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,120
I've to bear a lot of responsibilities.

510
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,850
I'll break down one day anyway.

511
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,810
If I made this decision earlier,

512
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,350
passed the position to Duan Ran,

513
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,070
this wouldn't have happened.

514
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,650
Let's go.

515
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,900
What did Duan Ran say?

516
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,140
He thought he was more suitable

517
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,370
to be the CEO anyway.

518
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,890
Why are all of you here?

519
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,740
-Why are you here?
-Xi Xi, what are you doing?

520
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,970
Where are you going?

521
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,450
What's going on? Are you leaving?

522
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,430
Yes.

523
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,280
I resigned yesterday.

524
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,150
Mr Duan will take over very soon.

525
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,720
He will lead all of you out of this mess.

526
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,710
Don't worry.

527
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,350
Don't go.

528
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,800
Why are you crying?

529
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,780
We will see each other again.

530
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,100
When you're off work,
we can go for some hotpot

531
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,060
or barbecue.

532
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,560
We will meet all the time.

533
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,960
No, I can't eat without you here.

534
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,290
I can't affect that appetite of yours.

535
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,540
You resigned.

536
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,550
Can I quit and return to designing?

537
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,840
No.

538
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,670
You've to stay here and
continue achieving your dreams.

539
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,280
You will have your own brand of coffee.

540
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,400
Mr Five.

541
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,350
You will become a great designer.

542
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,380
As for the both of you,

543
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,930
strive to become the head broadcaster.

544
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,570
As for you, ma'am,

545
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,630
you should continue to take it easy

546
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,430
and live your life as a princess.

547
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,640
The reason I could live the life I used to

548
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,100
was because you were around.

549
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,140
Now that you're gone,
I can't continue living like that.

550
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,110
That's enough.

551
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,900
You sure know what to say.

552
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,540
Xi Xi.

553
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,690
Although we are new to this company,

554
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,810
thank you still for taking care of us.

555
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,570
We're reluctant to part with you.

556
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,450
Work hard.

557
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,190
Xi Xi, are you coming back?

558
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,070
Of course.

559
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,700
I'll come back to visit all of you.

560
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,510
Don't ignore me when the both of you

561
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,770
rise in fame next time.

562
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,780
What will you do next?

563
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,280
I don't know.

564
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,090
I'll probably find an easier job.

565
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,920
I want to live a carefree life too.

566
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,520
Here's an advise.

567
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,330
You should get married soon.

568
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,220
You should get a huge
wedding gift prepared.

569
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,270
No problem

570
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,210
Yuanbao, Mr Five, I'm leaving.

571
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,760
Give me a hug.

572
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,840
Do well.

573
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,190
Continue to work hard.

574
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,420
You can do it.

575
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,790
I'm leaving.

576
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,980
Goodbye, Xi Xi.

577
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,240
I'm leaving.

578
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,310
Why are you here?

579
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,790
What's wrong?

580
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,990
I completed your orders for free.

581
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,390
Wait.

582
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,000
Where's everyone else?

583
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,050
Probably hanging out at the rest area.

584
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,360
What should we do?

585
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,160
Ms Qian resigned.

586
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,880
Xi Xi resigned?

587
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,080
Didn't you know?

588
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,760
I heard QE expelled her.

589
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,630
What should we do?

590
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,910
Xi Xi left.

591
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,800
It's going to be fine.

592
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,060
Jia Yun.

593
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,600
Come out for a moment.

594
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,600
I heard Xi Xi resigned.

595
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,700
Is that true?

596
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,380
It's my fault.

597
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,320
If I handled Fei Fei's situation well,

598
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,980
this wouldn't have happened.

599
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,300
I'll go get her.

600
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,410
Forget it.

601
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,920
It's her own decision.

602
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,600
Don't blame yourself.

603
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,300
You didn't know it would end up this way.

604
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,850
Am I right?

605
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,570
What should we do now?

606
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,480
Right now?

607
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,180
There's nothing we can do right now.

608
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,000
Let's just wait until
everything settles down.

609
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,820
Su Su.

610
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,370
How did the situation with Fei Fei go?

611
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,150
Fei Fei's boyfriend
found a new girlfriend.

612
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,770
We can't put our hopes on him.

613
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,750
We've to figure something out.

614
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,620
Figure something out?

615
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,310
What else can we do?

616
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,870
The company has many employees.

617
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,940
Will our pay be withheld?

618
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,490
That won't happen.

619
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,210
There must be a way to solve this.

620
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,810
Hurry up.

621
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,360
It's time for a meeting.

622
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,560
What is that meeting about?

623
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,690
Mr Shen from QE is here.

624
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,420
Ladies and gentlemen.

625
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,550
I suppose everyone is aware

626
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,760
that Qian Xi Xi, the previous CEO,

627
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,350
already submitted her
resignation to the board.

628
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,450
It was approved.

629
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,070
A company cannot go on without its head.

630
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,880
The vacancy of CEO

631
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,070
will affect the management greatly.

632
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,180
I came today

633
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,030
as a representative of the board

634
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,430
to hear all of you out.

635
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,580
Uncle Shen.

636
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,000
Xi Xi is only leaving for the time being.

637
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,100
She will be back.

638
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,480
We don't have to rush
in selecting a new CEO.

639
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,460
If we do not select a new CEO,

640
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,540
the company will continue
to spiral into this mess.

641
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,880
Ran Ran, this is the board's decision.

642
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,280
Qian Xi Xi's resignation

643
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,920
was not only a result of her guilt,

644
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,590
but also from the pressure
of public opinion

645
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,190
and the Ministry of Commerce.

646
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,199
It's a pity.

647
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,550
She will not be able
to return for a while.

648
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,150
Mr Duan should be the CEO.

649
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,909
I agree.

650
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,969
Besides Xi Xi,

651
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,480
Mr Duan knows the system
of the company very well.

652
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,100
If Qian Xi Xi is no longer the CEO,

653
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,300
Duan Ran would be the best candidate.

654
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,310
Uncle Shen, you can't do this.

655
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,850
During this time when Xi Xi is gone,

656
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,090
I'm not going to take over.

657
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,820
Duan and I agree

658
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,760
that matters of Rui

659
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,210
will be settled through internal accord.

660
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,080
Your recommendations

661
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,320
will be prioritized.

662
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,750
I'll do it.

663
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,830
About this incident, I...

664
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,820
About this matter of consumer's complaint,

665
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,750
I need to bear the responsibility.

666
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,410
I was the first to receive Fei Fei.

667
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,860
The way I talked to her

668
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,330
and the way
I dealt with it was unacceptable.

669
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,570
During times like this,

670
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,160
I must speak up.

671
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,900
I can't push the blame on someone else.

672
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,920
Let me atone for my mistakes.

673
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,030
I hope the executives will give me

674
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,480
a chance to atone for my mistakes

675
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,740
and clear Xi Xi's name.

676
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,950
Yu Shi.

677
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,930
Don't blame me for being frank.

678
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,250
I think,

679
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,800
you're not suitable to be the CEO.

680
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,720
Although you do a good job
in managing our finances,

681
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,060
based on the incident of Fei Fei,

682
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,520
it shows your inadequacy in management.

683
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,810
I would like to say something too.

684
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,890
Mr Yu, don't be mad at me.

685
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,090
Most of the time,

686
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,290
I could barely understand you.

687
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,420
I...

688
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,550
If you become my leader,

689
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,700
I'd be lost.

690
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,740
Yu Shi.

691
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,350
There are many ways to
atone for your mistakes.

692
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,220
It's not necessary for you to be the CEO.

693
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,150
This situation is blatant.

694
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,570
All of us recognize the best candidate,

695
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,240
but he's unwilling to take over.

696
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,970
Everything we say

697
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,320
would be meaningless.

698
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,280
Let's just vote.

699
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,630
Whoever gets the most votes, takes over.

700
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,560
I agree with that.

701
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,120
Everyone's future lies
in the future of Rui.

702
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,160
Today, I'll leave the rights

703
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,650
to everyone seated here.

704
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,630
It's fair.

705
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,620
It is fair.

706
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,030
However, we don't know who to vote.

707
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,460
Yes, I don't know who to vote for.

708
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,050
I can't pick someone randomly.

709
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,820
Don't worry.

710
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
I'll give everyone sufficient time

711
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,860
to think it through.

712
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,120
After 15 minutes,

713
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,570
the voting begins.

714
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,860
Let's go inside.

715
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,910
Who else can we choose besides Mr Duan?

716
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,510
Look at us.

717
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,530
Nobody is capable of being the CEO.

718
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,870
Do you think we should

719
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,380
reserve the position for Xi Xi?

720
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,020
Look, in order to protect us,

721
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,250
in order to protect Rui,

722
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,570
she resigned.

723
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,190
If we do not vote for her,

724
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,830
it's distasteful.

725
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,940
-Don't you think?
-Yes.

726
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,960
We worked with Xi Xi for a long time.

727
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,740
We acknowledge her abilities.

728
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,780
I think

729
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,300
only Xi Xi is capable
of managing the company.

730
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,100
Let's cast our votes for Xi Xi.

731
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,090
That sounds good.

732
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,240
It's decided then.

733
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,780
Let's all vote Xi Xi.

734
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,880
Okay.

735
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,380
We agreed on this.

736
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,960
No one should deviate.

737
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,840
We will cast all votes to Xi Xi.

738
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,180
We shall summon her back with our effort.

739
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,940
Alright, that's it then.

740
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,910
Okay.

741
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,580
We shall operate in teams.

742
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,310
All broadcasters
should talk to their operations director

743
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,320
and assistants.

744
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,690
Yu Shi.

745
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,680
Talk to the department of
finance and administration.

746
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,750
I'll inform the IT department.

747
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,240
Okay.

748
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,560
We don't have much time left.

749
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,710
Let's split up.

750
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,760
-Okay.
-Let's go.

751
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,910
Let's go.

759
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,040
Don't shut the door on me.

760
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,110
I don't have ill intentions.

761
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,360
I just came here to talk.

762
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,320
The employees of Rui sure are loyal.

763
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:56,500
Most votes were given to Xi Xi.

764
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,760
Qian Xi Xi took the blame and
resigned for the employees.

765
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,910
In terms of competency and responsibility,

766
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,890
she lived up to her role as the CEO.

767
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,610
Therefore, to us,
she's the best candidate.

768
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,300
Zhang Si blocked me.

769
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,450
He blocked my number and on WeChat.

770
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,850
I cannot reach him at all.

771
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,630
Can you help contact him?

772
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,090
Ask him where he is.

773
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,170
Is it true that he no longer wants me?

774
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,930
Fei Fei.

775
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,250
Calm down.

776
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,970
Look, I don't know who Zhang Si is.

777
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,780
I don't know where he is either.

778
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,190
How should I contact him?

779
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,090
Give him a call.

780
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,330
Tell him that Fei Fei
wants him home immediately.

781
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,010
Wait, he doesn't know who I am.

782
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,500
How should I call him?

783
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,360
Yu Shi and I are to be
blame for this matter.

784
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,250
We should bear accountability.

785
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,750
Yes, I agree.

786
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,550
Please punish us as you see fit.

787
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,270
Can you allow Xi Xi to return?

788
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,020
The importance and necessity

789
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,060
of Xi Xi's resignation as CEO,

790
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,990
I explained it to all of you.

791
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,620
I don't want to repeat myself.

792
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,080
The selection of candidate

793
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,420
is limited to employees only.

794
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,280
Those who resigned are not in this list.

795
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,840
Thus, these votes will be forfeited.

796
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,660
Uncle Shen.

797
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,370
You said that

798
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,590
majority of the votes were given to Xi Xi.

799
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,840
Is there someone else?

800
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,780
Yes.

801
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,020
There are two more valid votes.

802
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,770
Both these votes were given to

803
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,190
Zhang Jia Yun.

804
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,280
What's going on?

805
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,820
We agreed on this.

806
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,280
Which traitor did that?

807
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,520
Yes, who pulled out the last minute?

808
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,520
It's not me.

809
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,060
Even if she votes for herself,

810
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,650
who else voted for her?

811
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,670
Since both valid votes were
given to Zhang Jia Yun,

812
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,840
I officially announce that

813
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,300
from now onwards

814
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,390
until the appointment of the board,

815
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,140
Zhang Jia Yun will manage
the daily functions of Rui.

816
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,330
This shall take effect immediately.
