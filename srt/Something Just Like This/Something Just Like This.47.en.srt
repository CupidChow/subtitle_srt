[Episode 47]

4
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,760
This industry is going to be huge.

5
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,850
Right now,

6
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,050
at this very moment,

7
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,590
I need to give it my all.

8
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,890
I hate broadcasters
who employ Beauty Filters,

9
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,860
who put on a persona

10
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,370
and force themselves to smile
just for a few bucks.

11
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,840
I hate the viewers who create a fuss.

12
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,420
I hate the stupid employees of mine.

13
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,900
Of course, they hate me as well.

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,100
The only reason
I lasted so long in the industry

15
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,310
was because of my desire to defeat you.

16
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,250
In the end,

17
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,039
you still won.

18
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,410
Ding Ding.

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,700
The things you've done

20
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,430
constitute unfair competition.

21
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,210
However, I'm not going to file a lawsuit.

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,680
I just want to tell you this.

23
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,850
Never allow hatred

24
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,340
and the urge to win change who you are.

25
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,389
You will never be happy.

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,020
You're right, Duan Ran.

27
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm not happy at all.

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,700
When are you leaving?

29
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,230
I'll see you off.

30
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,680
Duan Ran.

31
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,670
Is Ding Ding going to give Rui back to us?

32
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,360
Yes.

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,910
What happened to Ding Ding?

34
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,220
In a competition,

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,670
he'd kill to win and now
he's leaving without a word.

36
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,200
Is he treating our baby

37
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,840
like a toy?

38
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,700
That's how he is.

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,790
He still hasn't gotten over what
I did to him during childhood.

40
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,420
If I had to work with him at Rui

41
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,640
and look at him all day,

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,720
I'd go crazy.

43
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,660
There's no more space here.

44
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,730
What are you hiding underneath your bed?

45
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,360
What's that?

46
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,840
It's Saint Seiya.

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,020
It must've fallen inside.

48
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,940
What is this?

49
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,430
Why did you leave a giant,
adorable teddy bear under your bed?

50
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,140
What is this? It's in a box.

51
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,550
Duan Ran.

52
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,180
This is it!

53
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,350
This is it.

54
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,700
Why did you hide it under the bed?

55
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,880
Who placed it in a box?

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,820
You did.

57
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,310
-Why did you place it in a box?
-It wasn't me.

59

Are you still afraid?

60

Well...

61
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,890
Why are you still keeping this?

62
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,070
It's evidence of your crime.

63
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,710
So I kept it.

64
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,590
I wanted to remember it forever.

65
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,060
"Remember it forever?"

66
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,180
Remember what?

67
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,100
What do you think?

68
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,350
What do you think?

69
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
Get off me.

70
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,270
What are you doing?

71
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,560
Where did the gear go?

72
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,900
I don't know either.

73
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,820
A gear fell off.

74
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,520
How do I put this back together?

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,409
Did you find it?

76
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,810
I can't find it. A gear fell off.

77
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,320
Aunt Zhou.

78
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,810
Aunt Zhou.

79

Has Uncle Duan returned from fishing?

80
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,770
No.

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,910
Uncle Shen called and

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,870
said they are not coming home for dinner.

83
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,250
They are so energised.

84
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,860
They are getting old
but they never get tired.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,650
We were so chummy.

86
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,330
Do you think your mum knows?

87
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,980
Most probably.

88
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,020

You would never leave
the country with me now.

92
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,570
Why do you keep bringing this up?

93
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,840
The local prospects are great now.

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,520
It's the perfect time to hustle.

95
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,130
I'm not going over there.

96
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,900
I noticed you sound so
much like your boyfriend now.

Are you serious?

98

-You've been influenced.
-That's great.

Don't get all giddy.

Once Aunt Zhou approves of it,

101

you can get excited all you want.

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,620
You and Uncle Duan both agreed.

I'm not afraid of Aunt Zhou.

We're easy to deal with.

Aunt Zhou has a psychological issue.

106
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,909
Duan Ran found her a psychologist

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,610
to help her with therapy.

Come here. You're just in time.

115

If I'm not mistaken, these projects

116
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,580
can be categorised under
the company's cost, right?

No.

120

Take it back.

Take it back.

122

I know you and Ms Qian
are no longer bothered

by the mistakes I made in the past,

124

but I cannot get over it.

you and Ms Qian.

127

Apologise?

128
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,350
You call abandoning your friends
an apology?

129
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,770
Where's the sincerity?

130
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,390
An apology comes with a responsibility.

131
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,120
Look at the situation right now.

We're just about to fire on all cylinders.

As the CFO,
you can't just leave like this.

135
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,670
What's wrong with you?

136
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,919
Is this what a brother should do?

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,789
Is this what a friend should do?

138
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,970
Do you understand?

139
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,080
Listen to me.

140
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,799
It isn't as complicated as you think.

141
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,530
You shouldn't overthink this.

142
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,180
Xi Xi and I aren't mad at you.

143
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,010
I was mad

144
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,170
at what you did before,

145
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,870
but I already gave you a punch.

146
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,310
Isn't that right?

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,770
Since we get along now,

148
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,830
that means we're square.

149
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,440
We are still brothers.

150
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,950
So stop acting like a stranger.

151
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,550
Be a good friend and get back to work.

152

Do you hear me?

-You...
-Stop it.

154
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,690
Just do your job well. You're the best.

155
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,330
You can do this.

Yu Shi.

157
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,290
This is only the beginning.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,280
Hello. I'm a new broadcaster.
My name is Zhao Xin Ran.

159
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,340
I'm very happy to meet all of you here.

160
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm going to introduce three
fragrances to you today.

161
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,940
The first one is the one in pink.

162
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,350
The characteristics include

163
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,110
scents of roses and jasmine.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,050
Gosh, you frightened me.

165
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,210
What are you doing here?

167
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,360
I came to see if I can
help out in any way.

168
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,480
Go away. Everyone is busy.

169

Su Su.

170
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,650
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,820
Can we talk?

172
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,400
Can you give me another chance

173
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,870
to pursue you again?

174
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,260
Let's introduce ourselves once more.

175
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,420
Hello, I'm Yu Shi.

176
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,890
I'm your colleague.

177
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,530
I'd always wanted to be a good person,

178
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,870
but I failed.

179
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,050
I swear

180
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,620
I'm going to use
the remainder of my life

181
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,100
to be a good person.

182
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,840
Nice to meet you.

183
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,240
Yu Shi.

184
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,970
What does that have to do with me?

185
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,870
You can keep me in check.

186
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,220
You will be my mirror.

187
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,680
If I stray even slightly,

188
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,820
or if I go back to my evil ways,

189
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,920
reprimand me.

190
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,320
Insult me.

191
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,200
You can call me a big jerk.

192
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,490
A monster.

193
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,750
A low-life.

194
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,570
Anything you want.

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,010
Have you

196
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,660
forgiven me?

197
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,290
Yu Shi.

198
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,360
Do you know what disappointed me the most?

199
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,440
What?

200
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,120
You kept everything

201
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,010
from me.

202
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,740
You never trusted me.

203
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,360
Why should I treat you as a friend?

204
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,890
I'm sorry, Su Su.

205
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,260
I should get back to work.

206
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,740
Unless...

207
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,860
Unless you promise

208
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,980
to tell me everything in the future.

209
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,600
I'll give you a chance then.

210
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,290
Don't worry, Su Su. From now on,

211
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,860
I'll keep nothing from you.

212
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,640
I'll tell you everything.

213
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,850
Trust me.

214
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,380
Get to work.

215
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,160
[Happy Birthday]

216
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,000
-Hello, Uncle Qian.
-Hello.

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,970
Uncle Qian,

218
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,520
what are you playing with?

219
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
It's an antique.

220
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,190
I'm used to it.

221
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,810
The place looks great.

222
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,190
Xi Xi is here.

223
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,920
Hurry up and welcome the birthday girl.

224
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,850
[Happy Birthday, Qian Xi Xi]

225
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,710
Happy birthday, Xi Xi.

226
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,100
Thank you.

227
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,290
Qian Xi Xi, happy birthday.

228
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,260
Oh my goodness.

229
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,220
Happy birthday,
Qian Xi Xi. It's been a long time

230
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,530
since I celebrated my birthday.

231
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,750
Hurry up and record this.
I'll give a grand introduction.

232
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,150
This outfit I'm wearing,

233
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,710
designed by Mr Five herself

234
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,060
and made by Mao,

235
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,670
is a limited edition denim shirt.

236
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,670
Get a closeup.

237
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,710
It's the only one

238
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,920
that was ever made.

239
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,380
-Xi Xi.
-Thank you so much.

240
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,560
Xi Xi, I also prepared a gift.

241
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,620
-There you go.
-It's huge. What's in there?

242
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,880
They are wine glasses.

243
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,010
-Isn't it pretty?
-A pair of wine glasses.

244
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,190
Xi Xi, I have a gift for you too.

245
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,440
This is a very expensive
bottle of red wine.

246
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,450
Expensive wine glasses

247
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,600
and expensive wine. Did
you guys plan this beforehand?

248
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,860
Not at all.

249
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,610
We did not plan beforehand.
Why would we do that?

250
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,140
We think alike.

251
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,540
You sure do.

252
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,550
Thank you.

253
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,550
It's ready.

254
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,610
Let's blow the candles.

255
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,290
Blow the candles.

256
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,530
Someone is still busy...

257
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,080
He's still taking photos.

258
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,950
Let's turn off the lights.

259
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,490
-♫ Happy ♫
-I haven't made a wish.

[Happy birthday, Xi Xi.]

266
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,900
[Xi Xi, where's Mummy?]

267
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,540
[All you ever do is eat candy.]

268
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,750
[Where's Mummy?]

269
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,730
[Where am I, Xi Xi?]

270
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,170
When was this taken?

271
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,040
[My little princess is amazing.]

272
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,780
[Where are you going?]

273
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,750
You were so ugly when you were young.

274
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,930
[Mummy.]

275
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,740
[Mummy.]

[I want you to be happy every day.]

[I want you to grow up happily.]

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,430
[Xi Xi.]

279
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,320
[Alright, I'll watch you eat.]

280
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,460
[The whole cake is yours.]

[Daddy.]

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,200
[Daddy.]

289

[Did you hear that?]

290
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,990
[Qian.]

291
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,970
[Today is Xi Xi's second birthday.]

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,760
[No matter what happens between us,]

293
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,000
[Xi Xi is still our daughter.]

294

[is stubborn just like mine.]

297

[I believe when our daughter grows up,]

[she's going to meet]

[Someone with whom
she can spend her life.]

[Yes, I'm here.]

[Listen up.]

[will be happier than me.]

309
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,690
Excuse me.

310
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,380
Before watching this video,

311
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,400
I was ignorant

312
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
about my own daughter.

313
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,240
We were married for five months.

314
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,470
Then we divorced,

315
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,960
and I went abroad.

316
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,540
I thought I did the right thing.

317
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,400
However, after watching the video,

318
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,920
I realised I was a jerk.

319
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,260
I played this video today

320
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,630
for you, Mrs Duan.

321
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,730
Mrs Duan.

322
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,380
You know

323
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,130
I used to disapprove
of Duan Ran and Xi Xi.

324
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,570
However, for the past six months,

325
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,240
in order to be together,

326
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,770
they did everything they could

327
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,110
to convince me.

328
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,830
To convince Duan.

329
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,510
They even got you a therapist.

330
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,580
I'm moved

331
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,190
by their effort.

332
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,410
So, I changed my mind.

333
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,880
Mrs Duan.

334
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,580
Xi Xi is Li Li's daughter.

335
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,670
Li Li's blood flows in her.

336
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,610
She's just like her mother.

337
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,280
No matter what challenges she face,

338
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,750
especially in love,

339
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,540
she'd never surrender

340
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,220
or give up.

341
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,290
Right here,

342
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,280
I'm begging you,

343
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,220
for the sake of Li Li,

344
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,840
give the kids a chance.

345
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,180
Xi Xi, blow the candles first.

346
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,140
Come on, the candles are melting.

347
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,360
They're going to burn out.

348
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,410
-Hurry.
-Here.

349
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,940
Dad.

350
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,340
Three, two, one.

351
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,760
Perfect.

352
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,510
Do you think Ma Li would blame me

353
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,310
for separating Duan Ran and Xi Xi?

354
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,080
She was your best friend.

355
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,110
If she's watching from above,

356
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,620
she'd understand your difficulties.

357
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,020
The doctor said

358
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,290
I insisted on keeping them apart

359
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,670
because I was

360
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,240
unable to forgive myself.

361
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,240
I was punishing myself.

362
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,560
Do you agree with the doctor?

363
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,510
As your husband,

364
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,110
I'm responsible as well.

365
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,310
Over the years,

366
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,270
I've owed you

367
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,050
too much.

368
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,480
You're always concerned
and worried about me.

369
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,890
However,

370
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,490
I spent all of my effort and time

371
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,810
on my job.

372
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,420
I neglected you.

373
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,210
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,190
It's in the past. Forget it.

375
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,360
Honey.

376
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,440
Relax a little.

377
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,610
The children are grown up.

378
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,530
They can make their own choices.

379
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,610
They are brave enough to
accept the consequences.

380
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,990
As their parents,

381
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,790
we shouldn't interfere
with the choices they make.

382
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,000
Is that alright?

383
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,130
Alright.

384
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,140
Over the years,

385
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,000
I've always thought

386
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,650
you abandoned Mum and I.

387
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,790
You didn't fulfill your duty

388
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,660
as a father and a husband.

389
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,490
However, after watching the video,

390
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,400
I realised I was wrong.

391
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,540
I was wrong about you.

392
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,960
I'm sorry.

393
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,620
I wasn't there when you grew up.

394
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,830
This is my biggest regret in life.

395
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,900
This regret

396
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,930
cannot be undone.

397
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,560
What should you do?

398
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,220
You can't miss out any more.

399
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,750
I'll make it up to you,

400
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,940
as a father.

401
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,480
I owe you the respect you deserve.

402
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,310
I'll make it up to you, too.

403
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,880
Aunt Zhou.

404
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,510
Are you alright?

405
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,630
Xi Xi, I'm sorry.

406
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,380
Your dad is right.

407
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,510
You and Duan Ran

408
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,850
have worked very hard
for the past six months.

409
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,980
I saw it myself.

410
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,160
After seeing your mother,

411
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,060
I am very

412
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,450
ashamed of myself.

413
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,940
You raised me and took care of me.

414
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,670
I'll never forget that.

415
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,440
All these years,

416
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,930
I've always treated you
like my own mother.

417
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,360
The burden in my heart

418
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,080
is finally lifted.

419
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,340
I don't know what to say right now.

420
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm just happy.

421
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,010
I'm very happy.

422
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm leaving Duan Ran to you.

423
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,140
I...

424
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,440
From today onward,

425
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,430
I'll always be on your side.

426
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,400
If he mistreats you,

427
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,810
I'll teach him a lesson.

428
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,910
-All right?
-Aunt Zhou.

429
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,000
-Call me mum.
-I'm really...

430
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,850
My baby.

431
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,330
I...

432
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,720
Mum.

433
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,080
We cried until the lights went off.

434
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,710
Why is there a power outage?

435
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,260
Where are the rest of them?

436
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,760
Xi Xi, where's Su Su?

437
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,840
I don't know.

438
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,730
What's going on with the lights?

439
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,520
[Marry me, love]

440
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,110
[The decorations]

441
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,420
[today are rather special.]

442
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,770
[Because I'm going
to do something special.]

443
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,920
[I'm going to do]

444
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,660
[something I've always wanted to do.]

445
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,180
I'm going to regret it

446
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
if I don't do this.

447
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,330
Xi Xi.

448
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,120
[We've been together for a long time.]

449
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,190
[From siblings, we became lovers.]

450
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,300
We've come this far together.

451
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,080
I'm very moved.

452
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,150
I like being with you.

453
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,110
[I like the smile you give me]

454
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,850
[when I return home.]

455
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,430
I like the way we spend our summers

456
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,730
strolling along the streets,

457
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,460
hand in hand.

458
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,160
Xi Xi.

459
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,210
I like waking up

460
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,100
to you burying your face in work.

461
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,940
You make me believe

462
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,120
that we will always be together,

463
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,120
and we will always depend on each other.

464
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,780
When you're helpless and sad,

465
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,920
I wish to lend

466
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,140
my shoulder for you

467
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,430
to cry on,

468
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,030
[no matter how much it hurts me.]

469
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,510
[Xi Xi.]

470
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,750
[You make me believe]

471
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,020
[that no matter when]

472
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,550
[or where]

473
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,310
[I fight my battles,]

474
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,000
someone is going to be home,

475
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
waiting for me to return in triumph.

476
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,510
That person is you.

477
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,160
Our bond

478
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,070
feels very familiar,

479
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,400
but every time we meet,

480
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,360
my heart still skips a beat.

481
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,330
I love you very much.

482
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,250
What is he doing?

483
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,310
I hope

484
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,740
you'll spend the rest
of your life with me,

485
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,170
to be my better half.

486
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,120
[Let us walk hand in hand]

487
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,130
[into our future.]

488
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,550
He didn't inform me beforehand.

489
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,800
Xi Xi.

490
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,360
Will you marry me?

491
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,570
[Marry me, Qian Xi Xi]

492
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,240
Walking together hand in hand.

493
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,700
Duan Ran.

494
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,350
It feels weird hearing you say that.

495
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,220
I get afraid sometimes.

496
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,930
I'm afraid I might not
see your smile again.

497
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,920
Or see you busying around the house.

498
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,640
I'm afraid of a world without your voice.

499
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,600
If I'm left alone in a room,

500
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,820
I'd miss your presence and your scent.

501
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,050
They are all

502
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,850
addictions that I can never overcome.

503
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,870
-So, today...
-I do.

504
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,340
I've been waiting for
this day for a long time.

505
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,890
I love the happiness we share.

506
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,360
I love the things you said to me.

507
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,270
This is how you make me feel everyday.

508
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,090
And I want you to know that.

509
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,700
I never heard you say that.

510
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,090
Everyone is here.

511
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,240
It's a little embarrassing.

512
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,240
I'm warning you.

513
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,900
You need to be prepared.

514
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,660
After getting married,

515
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,370
half of your assets belong to me.

516
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,400
Duan Ran, I'm making this clear.

517
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,860
We're getting married,

518
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,630
but what's mine is mine
and what's yours is yours.

519
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,070
This is the bottom line. Do not cross it.

520
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,290
My assets

521
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,090
belong to my parents,

522
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,110
but I belong entirely to you.

[Shapowei Art Zone]

524
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,820
That small luggage

525
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,210
isn't enough.

526
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,429
It's enough.

527
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,250
You should bring the cashmere
sweater too. The UK is cold.

528
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,650
You need to dress warmly.

529
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,320
Okay.

530
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,760

This time, stay back in the UK

a little longer.

533
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,320
Sharpen your skills.

534
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,550
You have a long way to go.

535
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,420
Yes, that's true.

536
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,679
Alright, take care of yourself.

537
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,800
I wanted to show you around the UK.

538
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,300
I don't need you to do that.

539
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,230
I'll travel the world when I retire.

540
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,370
But now, I must work because of you.

541
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:47,929
Look at you, Ding Ding.

542

Excuse me. Are you Mr Shen Ding Ding?

543
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,280
A package for you.

00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,550
Alright, I'm leaving.

545
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,210
Are you sure you don't
want me to send you off?

546
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,090
It's fine.

Don't bear a grudge against Duan Ran.

You should learn from him

-Spend carefully.

Go on.

556
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,580
Jog while you can.

557
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,660
Remember to jog.

558
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,920
Do some swimming

559

00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,400
Is this pretty?

569
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,410
Every dress is pretty.

You look pretty in everything.

Really?

572
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,610
I like this dress.

573
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,390
-Yes.
-You're here.

574

He said everything looks good.

576

I think this dress is great.

577
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,980
Is that all?

578
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,470
It looks great. What else should I say?

579
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,170
Fine. You guys should talk.

580
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,350
She's been trying on dresses all day.

581

The sales lady is losing it.

582
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,330
Once a woman lays her eyes on clothes,

583
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,680
it's over.

584
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,330
I think women

585
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,250
know exactly what they want.

586
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,250
Look at Xi Xi.

587
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,140
This colour complements
your skin tone very well.

588
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,430
Jia Yun

589
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,740
and even Mr Five.

590
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,690
They are very certain

591
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,480
of their goals.

592
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,660
I deeply admire

593
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,020
their tenacity.

594
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,270
I want to try on the veil.

595
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,700
-Yes, this is...
-Is this the one I picked?

596
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,820
Yes.

597
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,500
Women are stronger than men in many ways.

598
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,260
They are more resilient

599
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,250
and tenacious than we are.

600
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,500
Sometimes,
they are more cruel, too.

601
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,320
I heard Jia Yun isn't

602
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,220

603
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,470
You need to keep her in check.

604
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,910
When did you become a feminist?

605
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,560
It's her decision.

606
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,340
I can't say anything.

607
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,580
There's a saying that goes...

608
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,700
Duan Ran.

609
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,030
This is beautiful.

610
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,460
Amazing.

611
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,160
I know you think it's great.

612
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,640
Fine, back to your conversation.

613
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,620
That one and this one...

614
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,880
Where was I?

615
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,710
You said...

616
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,640
As the saying goes,

617
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,180
"a fine bird chooses the right tree."

618
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,360
There are no more trees in my world.

619
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,380
Your attitude towards relationships

620
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,430
is most reassuring.

621
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,650
I have something for you.

622
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,620
A wedding gift.

623
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,270
It's yours.

624
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,600
Back then, I spent

625
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,000
my hard earned money on this.

626
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,020
The tank is filled.

627
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,630
I also maintained it well.

628
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,240
It's as good as new.

629
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,900
Is it uncomfortable?

630
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,470
No.

631
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,250
It's great.

632
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,490
You've become

633
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,030
rather adorable.

634
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,630
I'm still practical.

635
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,530
We may be in charge
of different platforms.

636
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,210
But in the boardroom, we're still rivals.

637
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,070
Don't you lose.

638
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,540
In terms of performance,

639
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,150
I'm not afraid of anyone.

640
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,630
Thanks.

641
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,340
Hello, babes.

642
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,430
Thank you for waiting.

643
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,840
I'm your favourite broadcaster,

644
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,300
Qian Xi Xi.

645
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,340
It's been such a long time.

646
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,550
Did I lose weight?

647
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,920
Well, if you say so.

648
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,620
But seriously, I've been
on a diet recently.

649
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,410
I'm getting married soon.

650
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Thank you, babes.

651
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:54,030
Thank you for your blessings.
You should send me some rewards.

652
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,670
We had no choice.

653
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,890
Today is the Qixi Festival.

654
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,650
As the CEO, I have to set an example.

655
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,040
Don't worry,
I'll spend the Qixi Festival with you

656
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,620
in the live stream room. I'm very happy.

657
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,280
Are you referring to
the blouse I'm wearing?

658
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm not sure.

659
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,200
I chose a random top from the warehouse.

660
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,070
I'm not sure about its price.

661
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,050
Don't worry.

662
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,670
I'll check

663
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,590
with our staff members.

664
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,090
I'll get them to check the inventory.

665
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,320
If there is stock, I'll let you know.

666
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,410
This might be the last piece left.

667
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,830
What?

668
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,490
There's stock left.

669
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,950
How many pieces are there?

670
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,160
How much does it cost?

671
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,510
All right.

672
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,680
Okay.

673
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,130
Darlings.

674
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,410
I must say,

675
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,990
you have great taste.

676
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,190
This pink top I'm wearing

677
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,720
is from a fashion line.

678
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,880
It's made specially for VIPs.

679
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,270
I wore it by accident today,

680
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,740
and since all of you have seen it

681
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,580
and I love all of you,
I have to sell them to you.

682
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,100
Don't you worry.

683
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,110
I'll do my best to provide for you.

684
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,640
This is perfect.

685
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,730
Listen,

686
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,380
the boss just showed up.

687
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,380
I'll see if I can get his approval.

688
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,250
Don't go away.

689
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,350
What do you think?

690
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,740
Am I doing well?

691
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,970
When you said,

692
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,720
"the top on the broadcaster is so pretty,"

693
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,140
that was really lame.

694
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,750
Well, I'm your man.

695
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,620
Your biggest fan.

696
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,540
You will always be my biggest fan.
