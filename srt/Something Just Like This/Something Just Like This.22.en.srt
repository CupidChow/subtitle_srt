00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,220
Sure, I knew I could rely on
a capable manager like you.

5
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,670
We settled this with just one call.

[Goodbye.]

9
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,500
What's wrong?

10
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,610
Are you jealous?

11
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,550
This is just work.

12
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,660
Since Yuan Yuan left,

13
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,520
we lost a third of our viewership.

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,900
I need to rack my brain.

15
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,340
I've asked her to introduce us

16
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,840
some suitable broadcasters.

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,830
Stop imagining things.

18
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,250
Talk to me.

19
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,060
Duan Ran.

20
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,170
Now,

21
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,100
what if

22
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,120
we're forced to take
5 million from Yuan Yuan.

23
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,110
Would it be inappropriate

24
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,050
if we really accept the money?

25
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,320
It's written on the contract.

26
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,910
It's perfectly all right.

27
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,340
Just to let you know.

28
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,230
Yuan Yuan is among

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,050
the first broadcasters
who worked for Chen Lang.

30
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,820
She was even earlier than me.

31
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,180
Yuan Yuan had a part

32
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,650
in making Rui into what it is today.

33
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,690
I know that.

34
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,240
Signing the contract is a way

35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,710
to safeguard the
company's interest, right?

36
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,600
Yuan Yuan breaks the contract,

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,900
so she's to pay a termination fee.

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,260
That's the legal responsibility.

39
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,990
But emotionally, it's unacceptable to me.

40
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,040
Since we took over Rui the first time,

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,570
she had been a big help to us.

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,220
She's chasing her dream.

43
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,200
Will we seem to be ungrateful

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,710
if we take the money from her?

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
What has this got to do
with ungratefulness?

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,090
What about

47
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,950
the fact that we've been

48
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,800
increasing her popularity

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,830
and making her the head broadcaster.

50
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,030
Now she's leaving us
once becoming popular.

51
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,620
Isn't that ungrateful?

52
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,360
You wanted to increase her popularity

53
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,380
and make her

54
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,360
to become the head broadcaster.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,430
She didn't ask for these.

56
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,010
That isn't ungrateful.

57
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,630
I just don't understand.

58
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,320
I spent so much to
make her become popular.

59
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,310
And she's unhappy with it?

60
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,660
RMB5 million
is a heavy burden to Yuan Yuan.

61
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,329
I don't want the money.

62
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,160
That's your choice.

63
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,290
But the company needs it.

64
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,010
We'll be dead without the money.

65
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,250
I have the say since I'm the CEO.

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,700
I say no.

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,670
No.

68
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,900
Wait.

69
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,310
Don't say it anymore.

70
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,630
Whether you're the CEO or not,

71
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,330
-I'll have to take the money.
-Don't talk to me.

72
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,930
She's going nuts.

73
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,350
And forgetting her place.

74
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,040
Uncle Shen.

75
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,670
I'm asking you

76
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,540
to consider the matter

77
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,590
from the view of the top management

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,770
to give Xi Xi a little pressure,

79
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,610
to make her accept the money.

80
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,690
The breaking of contract and the
leaving of the head broadcaster,

81
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,380
is indeed a heavy blow to Rui.

82
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,520
It certainly is.

83
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,590
If we don't take the money,

84
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,130
Rui will be dead.

85
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,740
You came to see me

86
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,340
for the sake of Xi Xi, right?

87
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,080
Xi Xi is too emotional.

88
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,790
She often gets caught

89
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,330
in relational matters.

90
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,560
What will happen if I'm not by her side?

91
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,260
You must help me, Uncle Shen.

92
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,520
I still remember the time
during the last quarter

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,230
when the report was released.

94
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,910
In her report, Xi Xi said it was you

95
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,570
who won the contract from Pineapple
Xpress on interactive live streaming,

96
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,170
and got Yuan Yuan onto
the Talent Chart, right?

97
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,490
I was so busy then that
I hardly had time to breathe.

98
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,790
Now do you think

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,460
that you're more suitable to be the CEO?

100
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,340
What is this supposed to mean?

101
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,980
Assigning Xi Xi as the CEO then

102
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,750
was dad's and your decision.

103
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,820
I was unhappy, right?

104
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,190
She’s been doing well

105
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,560
all this while

106
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,800
and is competent in her role.

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,530
I'm glad to see her able to train herself

108
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,770
while holding the post of CEO.

109
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,400
Now I just want to focus on

110
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,850
assisting her to make the company great.

111
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,910
You're making a mistake

112
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,940
if you think this way.

113
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,370
What are you trying to say?

114
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,560
During that time,

115
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,330
Xi Xi was indeed more
suitable among you both

116
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,350
to be the CEO.

117
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,170
There was another intention.

118
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,380
It was to train you

119
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
by letting you work your way up.

120
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,420
Hold it.

121
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,140
Please don't, Uncle Shen.

122
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,540
Just calm down.

123
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,010
This is my personal opinion.

124
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,690
Over these periods, we can see

125
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,909
that you have improved tremendously.

126
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,090
Either from the viewpoint

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,000
I think

129
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,770
you're more suitable to be the CEO.

130
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,330
There could be a misunderstanding.

131
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,450
I'm not here today to make a complaint.

132
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,909
Let's make this clear.

133
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,370
I'm here actually to ask you for a favour.

134
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,100
Put some pressure on  Xi Xi

135
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,340
so she'd accept the termination fee.

136
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,220
In business, we talk business.

137
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,500
You're right.

138
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,150
Xi Xi will lose the
justification to be the CEO

139
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,750
if she declines to
accept the termination fee.

140
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,690
I've conveyed my thought to you.

141
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,490
You should just think it over.

142
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,710
I will.

143
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,960
You must really help me, Uncle Shen.

Stop saying it anymore.

147
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,340
I know.

I don't want the termination fee.

You're too kind to me.

I broke the contract, so I must pay.

You're being considerate to me,

so I'd like to do the same to you.

156
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,430
You're leaving us suddenly

157
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,720
to become an actress.

158
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,420
Everything ahead is an unknown,

159
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,010

160

So you need the money.

161
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,850
Let me tell you.

162
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,150
Since becoming the CEO,

163
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,320
I've learned the importance of money.

164
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,929
Money gives you the confidence.

165

You can do the things you
want, only if you have the money.

When you start a new career,

167
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,190
the essential things
are not your dreams or confidence.

168
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,570
Over there, you need to spend the money...

169
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,620
You're all here.

Listen here.

172
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,790
You can terminate the contract.

173
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,070
But you must pay the termination fee,

174
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,850
else I can't let you go.

175
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,310
Duan Ran.

176
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,910
Haven't I made myself clear last night?

177
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,440
Why are you making a fuss now?

178
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,080
We're having a discussion.

179
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,900
Please don't bother us.

180
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,000
Just leave us.

181
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,760
Let me finish.

182
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,040
Yuan Yuan

183
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,230
I know asking you to pay is hard for you.

184
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,080
I've been nurturing you since you
graduated from the acting school.

185
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,370
I've always been generous with you.

186
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,120
I've given you good resources.

187
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,210
I've spent all the money on you.

188
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,290
I've given all that you need.

189
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,380
Don't you agree?

190
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,320
Yes?

191
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,820
You won't become what you are today

192
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,240
if it's not for us, right?

193
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,090
You can just go.

194
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,040
That means I failed to keep you.

195
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,040
But right now,
you're not being fair, Yuan Yuan.

196
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,210
What do you mean?

197
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,970
She's chasing her dream.

198
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,980
It's nothing to do with fairness.

199
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,660
Even if she's gone,

200
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,480
we can nurture new broadcasters,

201
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,490
explore new business.

202
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,690
Can't we just move on?

203
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,090
Can't we?

204
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,140
Just ignore him.

205
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,200
I fully support you.

206
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,080
Duan Ran.

207
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,490
The decision is final.

208
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,770
Stop pressuring her.

209
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,540
I have the last say.

210
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,270
What you said to her is in vain.

211
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,760
-That's it.
-Come!

212
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,900
I won't accept the termination fee.

213
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,200
-What do you want?
-Go downstairs.

214
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,150
Why can't we stay upstairs?

215
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,350
What do you want to say?

216
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,360
Listen.

217
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,600
You must not misuse your kindness.

218
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,110
So only you can see the big picture

219
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,170
and I only care about the petty stuff?

220
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,280
I have to tell you.

221
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,410
I had enough of this.

222
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,090
Yuan Yuan now has no place to go.

223
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,890
In what capacity are you
dealing with this matter?

224
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,880
You're not a friend.

225
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,510
You're not Wonder Woman.

226
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,430
You're the CEO

227
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,460
of an entrepreneurial company.

228
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,660
You're not a one-man team.

229
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,160
The fate of the company is in your hands.

230
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,640
On this matter,

231
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,160
you should not mix emotions with business.

232
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,820
Isn't the company's
interest the top priority?

233
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,480
Yes.

234
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,390
If I do as you say,

235
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,690
the more reason I shouldn't accept it.

236
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,040
Why?

237
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,540
It's because of company culture.

238
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,420
Duan Ran, aren't you aware

239
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,760
that she's done so much for the company?

240
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,910
Now she wants to leave.

241
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,550
She could lose everything
if she pays the money.

242
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,100
Where's our human touch?

243
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,070
A company without its human touch

244
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,200
will have no staff,

245
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,860
we won't earn anyone's trust.

246
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,850
Furthermore,

247
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,380
Rui's reputation and those of QE Group,

248
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,250
your dad as well as the

249
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,010
live streaming industry will be damaged.

250
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,330
Stop your nonsense.

251
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,050
We're businessmen.

252
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,270
We live in this sphere,

253
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,600
so we must adhere to its rules.

254
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,810
What are the rules?

255
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,060
It's the spirit of contract.

256
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,050
The contract is black and white.

257
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,070
We must adhere to the contract,

258
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,570
and not some illusory human touch.

259
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,280
I know the importance of contract spirit.

260
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,590
But frankly,

261
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,850
I can't do this.

262
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,210
That's unacceptable.

263
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,270
You must do it

264
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,810
for the company.

265
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,870
How so?

266
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,480
-Ain't I want the best for the company?
-Guys.

267
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,180
I'll pay the compensation.

268
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,790
Just stop, Xi Xi.

269
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,910
I've made the decision.

270
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,530
What are you talking about?

271
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,930
Haven't we... Yuan Yuan!

272
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,000
Look what you've done.

273
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,380
What...

274
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,560
Qian Xi Xi.

275
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,210
On this matter,

276
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,130
you must listen to me.

277
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,640
Since you took over the company,

278
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,780
we've quarrelled countless times.

279
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,320
You must listen to me this time.

280
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,080
I really don't understand.

281
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,750
You've always been a spendthrift.

282
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,040
When we had our hardest time,

283
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,400
you were selling things.

284
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,730
But now it's different.

285
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,490
Yuan Yuan's departure
will cause trouble for the company.

286
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,320
But you must give me
a really convincing reason.

287
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,400
Why don't you say something?

288
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,430
It's for the company

289
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,400
and everyone else.

290
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,880
[Rui Live]

291
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,630
You still need to pay?

292
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,810
I must pay.

293
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,830
I'll transfer the money tomorrow.

294
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,180
Let's go.

295
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,490
So Yuan Yuan has finally gone?

296
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,650
Are you going to cry?

297
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,530
I really admire Yuan Yuan.

298
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,440
She just walked away
after what she's achieved,

299
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,240
starting all over as an actress.

300
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,200
She could do worse out there.

301
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,480
The company spent much effort to make her

302
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,290
become what she is today.

303
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,360
She still left us eventually.

304
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,530
Sometimes when I think,

305
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,330
why did I fight so hard

306
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,130
with Duan Ran for the post of CEO?

307
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,810
Was it out of anger?

308
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,160
I dragged the company down

309
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,260
due to my lack of ability.

310
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,510
All I bring to myself is a burden.

311
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,140
My dear Xi Xi,

312
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,940
you won't be defeated
by such a small setback.

313
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,010
It's not like you.

314
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,380
Maybe because a lot of
things happened recently.

315
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,120
Duan Ran has been doing well.

316
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm actually glad.

317
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,000
But the stress increased.

318
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,849
In the company,

319
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,980
I finally did something well recently.

320
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,810
But Yuan Yuan left us
not even two days later.

321
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,730
And that Ms Ouyang.

322
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,520
Since she appeared,

323
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,490
I've been uneasy.

324
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,329
Now we owed others a
great deal of favours.

325
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,359
I know Yuan Yuan left,

326
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,840
but we can still nurture a new broadcaster

327
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,240
and take up new projects.

328
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,440
I won't comment on the relationship

329
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,330
among Mr Duan, Ms Ouyang and you.

330
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,410
Have some coffee and cool it.

331
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,220
Let's talk about work.

332
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,870
What are your plans now?

333
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,550
What can I do?

334
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,920
Hasn't Duan Ran already
found his ex-girlfriend?

335
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,010
With the cash flow in our hands,

336
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,010
we're doing quite well.

337
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,790
Signing a few temporary broadcasters

338
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,200
shouldn't be a problem.

339
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,080
Let him struggle a bit.

340
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,430
That's right.

341
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,160
We'll do what we are supposed to do.

342
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,740
Even if Yuan Yuan is gone,

343
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,740
we'll have a way to fill the opening,

344
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,910
right?

345
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,220
Sometimes I think Yuan Yuan
and Chen Lang are similar.

346
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,670
They're well prepared with clear goals.

347
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,650
And they're always decisive.

348
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,040
Mr Chen.

349
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,870
My goodness, didn't expect you to come.

350
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,800
Why have you come at this time?

351
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,060
I guess you haven't eaten yet.

352
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,210
Let's have a good meal.

353
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,110
Hot pot or barbecue.

354
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,600
We can have both hot pot and barbecue.

355
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,220
I just came and you want to take me away.

356
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,890
This is my first time to your company.

357
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,820
Won't you show me around?

358
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,520
You're right.

359
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,200
This is the central control platform.

360
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,310
All the devices you're seeing now,

361
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,910
are recent purchases
with the latest model.

362
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,980
Look at that lamps.

363
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,220
Do you see the round-shaped lamps?

364
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,610
It won stop even if the whole
company is a power outage.

365
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,970
They are powered separately.

366
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,970
These are my spiritual sustenance.

367
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,820
By the way, there're others.

368
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,410
-You may love it if you see it.
-You poached Yuan Yuan.

369
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,010
Now you want to poach me, too?

370
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,750
Mr Chen, Rui was set up by you anyway.

371
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,150
You're truly ruthless

372
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,740
when you're making your move.

373
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,320
I just introduced a producer to Yuan Yuan.

374
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,050
I've no idea if she'd be chosen.

375
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,800
She made the decision.

376
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,480
Don't be childish.

377
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,410
Isn't there an old saying?

378
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,820
Business is as cruel as war?

379
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,280
Since it's a battlefield,

380
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,480
there will be winners and losers.

381
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,870
But it's not the only way to succeed.

382
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,720
The battlefield is not just

383
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,570
about life and death.

384
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,410
What's wrong with Rui?

385
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,940
It shouldn't be.

386
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,340
If Yuan Yuan is leaving,

387
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,800
she's to pay a lot of money.

388
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,520
It's enough for
the company to survive a while.

389
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,930
Xi Xi is different from you.

390
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,680
Mr Chen, let me just advise you.

391
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,520
Don't play tricks behind the back.

392
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,410
You may win for the moment.

393
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,380
However,

394
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,600
in the long run,

395
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,990
you would end up being the loser.

396
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,130
Just ponder about it.

397
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,060
You certainly have a good eye, Ouyang.

398
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,610
Look at the earrings you picked.

399
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,020
They're inconspicuous.

400
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,740
It looks nice once I put them on.

401
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,660
Right?

402
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,300
The shop has some pretty exquisite stuff.

403
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,850
-It's kind of niche.
-Yes.

404
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,900
It's rare elsewhere.

405
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,660
Let's go shopping next time.

406
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,170
I certainly hope so.

407
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,710
Not a problem.

408
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,140
You're back, Xi Xi.

409
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,180
I'm home.

410
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,740
What a coincidence.

411
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,350
After the tea ceremony class,

412
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,490
I ran into Ouyang and Duan Ran.

413
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,830
We had an appointment with a broadcaster.

414
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,200
We had a short chat.

415
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,440
Then we ran into her
right after the appointment.

416
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,850
It was a coincidence.

417
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,820
I see.

418
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,190
Indeed.

419
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,960
Ouyang bought me a pair of earrings today.

420
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Aren't they nice?

421
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,250
You look good with everything.

422
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,310
Really nice.

423
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,270
Duan Ran.

424
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,180
How was the appointment?

425
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,080
-We...
-We had a good chat.

426
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,160
She agreed to join Rui.

427
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,160
It went well.

428
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,310
How did I do, aunty?

429
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,580
Good to hear that.

430
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,340
Anyway, Yuan Yuan is gone now.

431
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,670
We need reinforcement.

432
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,920
Looks like my technique is okay.

433
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,390
I learned a new skill today.

434
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,590
Don't just stand there, Xi Xi.

435
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,890
Today, Ouyang is having
dumplings with us. Come and help.

436
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,600
Aunt Zhou.

437
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,340
I don't think I'll join you.

438
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,120
Why?

439
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,820
I'm having an appointment
with Zhang Jia Yun.

440
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,120
I forgot to tell you.

441
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,940
I'm putting something down
then I'll be going.

442
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,450
Enjoy your meal.

443
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,170
I'll be back after dinner.

444
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,100
What was Duan Ran's mother's intention?

445
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,390
Was she having a motive?

446
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,270
I don't think so.

447
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,560
Duan Ran and I aren't a couple.

448
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,700
Aunt Zhou doesn't know that I like him.

449
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,460
Why did she bring her home?

450
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,000
That Ouyang.

451
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,500
She's such a third wheel.

452
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,060
What is she thinking?

453
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,650
I think Aunt Zhou wants
them to be together.

454
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,750
She thinks they're a perfect match?

455
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,430
When I got home just now...

456
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,180
Don't mention it.

457
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,080
They're were talking about shopping.

458
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,010
They have a mutual affection.

459
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,220
I really didn't know what to say.

460
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,460
Fortunately, you saved me

461
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,270
when I needed you the most.

462
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,690
-Thanks, Jia Yun.
-It's my obligation.

463
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,610
That's enough.

464
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,280
How are Ouyang and Duan Ran getting on?

465
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,000
Ouyang was

466
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,760
ambiguous.

467
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,290
It's hard to guess her intention.

468
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,950
You know the three standards.

469
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,110
Not proactive, not rejecting
and not responsible.

470
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,390
Isn't she a scum then?

471
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,170
What's Duan Ran reaction?

472
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,220
Standard response.

473
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,530
So he's a scumbag!

474
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,610
My goodness.

475
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,940
Anyway, they're partnering to bully me.

476
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,610
But you ran away?

477
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,760
I did not.

478
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,740
That's not the way, Qian Xi Xi.

479
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,960
They're attacking.

480
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,370
You can't just retreat.

481
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,480
At least you have to give him a hint.

482
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,210
Maybe he can't sense anything now.

483
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,560
I didn't run nor hide.

484
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,500
Whose home is this?

485
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,680
It's my home.

486
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,960
Can't I come home

487
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,200
when I don't feel good? No problem at all.

488
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,520
You've lost.

489
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,640
Are you with me?

490
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,220
What am I supposed to do now?

491
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,710
It's so difficult now.

492
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,300
Are you looking for a place to stay?

493
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,690
The landlord stops renting next month.

494
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,790
I need to move out.

495
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,480
You need not look elsewhere.

496
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,600
Let's stay together.

497
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,570
I'll move here, too.

498
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,760
Let's get through thick

499
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,520
and thin together at this time.

500
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,640
That's a good idea.

501
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,140
You can separate yourselves, too.

502
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,080
You no longer can think

503
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,410
clearly as you two
tend to stick together.

504
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm serious.

505
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,270
-Really?
-Just think about it.

506
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,890
We'll be staying here.

507
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,500
I thought for a while.

508
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,130
Actually you know
I always wanted to move back.

509
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,660
I was living under
someone's roof, after all.

510
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,310
And you just said.

511
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
Maybe things will get better if

512
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,020
we separate for a short time.

513
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,730
My dad came back, right?

514
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,270
We had many conversations.

515
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,370
Whenever I go home,

516
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,790
I feel a little awkward when spending time

517
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,550
with the Duan family.

518
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,780
You should temporarily
move to a separate place,

519
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,680
just to clear things up one by one.

520
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,940
No matter what,

521
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,300
I'll move in first,

522
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,190
followed by you.

523
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,440
-It's a deal.
-No problem.

524
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,540
-Let's toast.
-Cheers.

525
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,770
We can live together.

526
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,880
Here's to our new home.

527
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,090
This is a dream I had for a long time.

528
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,240
It's now come true.

529
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,380
Let's drink to it.

530
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,820
Let's plan it well.

531
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,770
But I also hope

532
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,160
that the next housemate to succeed me

533
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,660
is Duan Ran.

534
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,430
We've been housemates since we were kids.

535
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,650
I mean sleeping together on the same bed.

536
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,760
Stop being a tease.

537
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,680
Who wants to be his roommate?

538
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,200
We're bitter enemies.

539
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,070
Then let Ouyang be his roommate.

540
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,870
I appreciate you driving me home.

541
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,360
It's no trouble.

542
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,260
You sure know how
to make my mum happy.

543
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,400
I didn't do it deliberately.

544
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,210
I'm a friend of the parents.

545
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,690
No parents don't like me.

546
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,520
The broadcaster

547
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,500
we met today seemed to be interested.

548
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,950
We should meet her again.

549
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,310
I'll give her a call to confirm.

550
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,270
Sure.

551
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,300
I'll be at the company all day tomorrow.

552
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,500
She can come any time.

553
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,880
I feel you're a lot
more mature than before.

554
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,850
You used to be a grown-up brat.

555
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,310
Really?

556
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,860
Maybe I need to take care of others now.

557
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,910
Who? You mean Qian Xi Xi?

558
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,440
That's right,
that little girl has a bad temper.

559
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,520
She didn't seem to be very happy today.

560
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,150
And ran out.

561
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,080
Xi Xi.

562
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,780
Are you waiting for me?

563
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,780
What's up?

564
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,030
What's going on?

565
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,330
Nothing. I just went out to eat.

566
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,960
My mum invited Ouyang over
for dinner so you got jealous?

567
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,050
Let's make it clear.

568
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,150
Zhang Jia Yun needs to move out soon.

569
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,450
I let her live with me.

570
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,470
I'm moving over to live with her.

571
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,270
Live with you?

572
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,760
In the old house?

573
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,940
I can't live here forever.

574
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,490
What are you saying?

575
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,610
What's that about my house or yours?

576
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,140
Have you ever thought about

577
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,650
my feelings

578
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,480
and my folks' as well

579
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,110
if you just move away?

580
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,380
I've been living in your house.

581
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,410
Have you ever considered how I feel?

582
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,580
It'll still be the same.

583
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,530
I'll visit your folks

584
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,390
anytime whenever I'm free.

585
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,810
No difference at all.

586
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,180
Are you jealous?

587
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,120
Aren't you too narcissistic?

588
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,150
Jealous of what?

589
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,960
It's late.

590
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,060
I'm sleepy.

591
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,950
I need to go to bed.

592
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,380
[Shapowei Art Zone]

593
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,320
Let me help you with that.

594
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,140
Wipe your hands.

595
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,570
Let me do it.

596
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,580
I'll do it.

597
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,200
You look bad.

598
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,430
Drink this.

599
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,070
This is good for you.

600
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,610
Who looks bad?

601
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,650
You. You're in a
bad condition recently.

602
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,420
This helps to overcome your fatigue.

603
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,660
Thanks.

604
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,110
Let me tell you another good news.

605
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,010
You will get better right away.

606
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,790
You seem so excited, what's the good news?

607
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,000
The money has arrived.

608
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,900
Yuan Yuan kept her promise.

609
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,580
The RMB5 million termination fee

610
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,980
was deposited into the company's account.

611
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,310
It's too soon.

612
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,550
The company finally has a good cash flow.

613
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,610
We've seen worse.

614
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,130
I was worried

615
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,080
about the company's cash flow.

616
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,210
I used to expect Yuan Yuan

617
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,620
to increase our sales

618
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,860
and improve our cash flow.

619
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,880
But she decided to leave us.

620
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,460
Ms Qian.

621
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,640
This is a good news.

622
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,980
Why aren't you feeling happy at all?

623
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,800
What's there to be happy about?

624
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,290
Yuan Yuan has struggled for many years

625
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,820
and finally earned a house.

626
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,370
Now she had to sell her house

627
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,770
to come up with the money.

628
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,130
She has to start all over again, right?

629
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,860
Should I be happy with this?

630
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,390
But I think,

631
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,200
from the company's perspective,

632
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,870
this is something positive.

633
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,400
You don't even know

634
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,010
that I was so happy when
I saw Yuan Yuan just now.

635
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,070
I kept praising her for being pretty.

636
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,090
She came here?

637
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,120
Where's she?

638
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,980
She's cleaning up her stuff
at the dressing room.

639
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,400
Hold this.

640
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,850
You have done very well

641
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,800
on the journey of live streaming.

642
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,710
The future

643
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,800
has something better in store for you.

644
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,820
It's time to finally say goodbye.

645
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,610
Well,

646
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,929
I always wanted to leave before,

647
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,080
and I felt nothing.

648
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,000
And now that I'm leaving,

649
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,340
I can't actually bear to part with it.

650
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,510
I feel a sense of loneliness.

651
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,530
If you don't want to go,

652
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,730
you can always change your mind.

653
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,120
Xi Xi.

654
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,240
We do not regret the decisions we made.

655
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,620
You can still stay if you want.

656
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,390
You still have a choice.

657
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,310
Yuan Yuan.

658
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,330
Don't you think you're
being cruel to yourself?

659
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,370
What's going on with you?

660
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,270
You're betting your life

661
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,550
on something that may
not be achievable at all.

662
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,830
Is it worth it?

663
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,730
Xi Xi.

664
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,720
There's no turning back for me.

665
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,190
I've paid the termination fee.

666
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,060
I didn't give myself a way out.

667
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,590
Fine.

668
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,760
Anyway, since you've said so,

669
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,250
I have nothing more to say.

670
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,240
All your things are packed.

671
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,160
How about I get everyone
to bid farewell to you?

672
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,780
I'm almost ready to go.

673
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,580
It's not necessary for that.

674
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,890
Everyone is busy.

675
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,530
Why not

676
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,200
another time.

677
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,760
I shall give everyone a treat next time.

678
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,810
Fine.

679
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,400
I'll see you off.

680
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,850
Promise me that you'll
visit us when you're free.

681
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,500
I'll go put the luggage.

682
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,380
Okay.

683
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,460
-Yuan Yuan.
-What is it?

684
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,780
I'm returning my card.

685
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,890
Yuan Yuan, I'll demagnetise the card

686
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,640
and return to you the deposit.

687
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,570
Can I keep this card?

688
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,990
Yuan Yuan.

689
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,710
We need the card and deposit slip

690
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,030
to return the deposit.

691
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,930
This is the company's policy.

692
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,100
Then I don't want the deposit.

693
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,910
I just want to keep the card,

694
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,620
as a memorial.

695
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,100
Zhi Zhi, give her the card.

696
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,070
Sure.

697
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,580
I'll take full responsibility on this.

698
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,000
Sure.

699
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,000
I have nothing to give you.

700
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,220
This card shall be my gift to you.

701
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,400
I've been here for a year.

702
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,520
I still have deep feelings for Rui.

703
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,570
However,

704
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,920
I still have my dreams.

705
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,270
Needless to say, I know.

706
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,440
Nothing to be sorry about.

707
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,130
You've paid your dues.

708
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,080
You're free

709
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,660
to walk out from the door.

710
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,860
Rui could be in trouble again

711
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,050
because of my departure.

712
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,930
Then you'll have to work hard for a while.

713
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,620
Entrepreneurship requires hard work.

714
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,090
As a friend, I know you well.

715
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,080
But as the CEO,

716
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,580
I'm really breaking down now.

717
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,340
Don't worry.

718
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,310
When I succeed one day,

719
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,360
I'll be back for you.

720
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,860
Then I wish the day will come soon.

721
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,210
I heard the entertainment
industry is complicated

722
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,580
and not easy.

723
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,290
Take good care of yourself.

724
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,750
You've been working so hard,

725
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,000
You have to take care, too.

726
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,590
So long as I'm here,

727
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,010
your access card

728
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,030
can forever enter the doors of Rui.

729
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,320
Thanks, Xi Xi.

730
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,460
Keep it up.

731
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,980
Keep it up.

732
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,970
So long.

733
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,670
You're really leaving.

734
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,400
I'll come back to see you.

735
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,960
Bye.

736
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,370
[Rui Live]

737
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,140
Bye.

738
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,430
I have a bad news for everyone.

739
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,300
Yuan Yuan has left us.

740
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,890
Yuan Yuan finally became
the head broadcaster.

741
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,380
Why did she just leave us?

742
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,580
Yuan Yuan is our only head broadcaster.

743
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,640
Now she's gone, what shall we do then?

744
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,240
No matter how good you are,

745
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,260
you're an Internet celebrity at best.

746
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,190
Now Yuan Yuan has entered showbiz,

747
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,870
we have to work hard
every day to sell goods here.

748
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,980
Don't get so dejected.

749
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,010
Yuan Yuan's leaving

750
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,050
is a great opportunity
for everyone of you.

751
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,280
All this while,

752
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,660
the company invested
a lot of resources on her.

753
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,860
Since she's gone now,

754
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,060
everyone here
will get to use the resources.

755
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,610
The company has decided.

756
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,010
We'll nurture and promote a
head broadcaster from among you.

757
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,970
Yes.

758
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,820
You can depend on us.

759
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,320
We'll give our best.

760
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,750
After Yuan Yuan cancelled her contract,

761
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,810
many brands wanted to
terminate their contracts, too.

762
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,610
Rest assured,

763
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,310
we'll negotiate with them.

764
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,620
We'll persuade them to stay with us.

765
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,530
As for the remaining brands,

766
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,090
we'll let you handle them.

767
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,680
I hope everyone of you will prepare well.

768
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,960
Don't get panicked

769
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,310
because of Yuan Yuan's departure, okay?

770
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,360
The brands signed a contract with us

771
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,400
because of Yuan Yuan.

772
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,490
Since she's gone, how many are staying?

773
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,030
There are so many of us.

774
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,380
How will you delegate?

775
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,760
I'll do my best to negotiate.

776
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,800
As for the allocation...

777
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,300
Since everyone’s expertise is different,

778
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,900
the allocation will
be arranged accordingly.

779
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,720
I heard that Mr Duan hired
a star as reinforcement.

780
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,830
Will the brands only
be distributed to them

781
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,150
while we get nothing?

782
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,090
It's impossible for us

783
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,080
to depend on the existing brands,

784
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,890
or hiring temporary broadcasters.

785
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,310
Are we getting any new brands?

786
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,300
The costs of keeping the
existing brands are much lower

787
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,770
than acquiring new brands.

788
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,100
Thanks for your effort.

789
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,440
That's all for today.

790
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,570
Everyone, get back to work.

791
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,140
Let's go.
