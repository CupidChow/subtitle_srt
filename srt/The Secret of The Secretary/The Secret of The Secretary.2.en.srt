1
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:08,663
This guy doesn't look like he's here to learn how to make dessert.

2
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:12,774
Feels like looking for something.

3
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:43,058
I don't know why, but I'm a little shaken up.

4
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,639
It's like nothing happened.

5
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:58,199
Let's work

6
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:00,401
I'm on mission right now

7
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:06,828
You're a real eye-catcher today.

8
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:10,091
Even he's starting to notice you.

9
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:18,354
If I remember correctly, you used to like him a lot, right?

10
00:01:20,835 --> 00:01:22,835
You did eat nothing again?

11
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:24,129
I‘m not hungry

12
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:26,314
You don't have to come every day.

13
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,784
I volunteered.

14
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,001
You were a picky eater when you were a kid.

15
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,583
You're still so stubborn.

16
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,001
Reiji, you don't have to do this for me.

17
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:46,385
I'm just worried you're too tired.

18
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:51,389
You really don't have to do this for me.

19
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,247
You have your own business

20
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
I thought I could always stay with him.

21
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:04,172
Even if it's just a little assistant.

22
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:07,328
But now you have to sneak a glance at him.

23
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:15,195
About like someone

24
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,343
It's never just a sentence.

25
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:22,098
When I was a kid, I didn't know how to get close to someone.

26
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:23,654
Just

27
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:29,065
Wherever he goes, my feet will follow.

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Until now

29
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:36,716
I guess I never learned how to let go.

30
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:43,118
I'm not asking you to avenge me.

31
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,063
But I beg you.

32
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:48,496
This is the moment of truth.

33
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,686
Don't let that creeping feeling of goodwill

34
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,139
It's a reason for you to falter.
