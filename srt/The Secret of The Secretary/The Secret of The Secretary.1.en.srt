1
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,653
My name is Shoyo

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm on some kind of mission.

3
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:30,081
I came to this magic cake company.

4
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:31,957
At the behest of Mr. Tanaka

5
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:37,093
he's working behind the scenes with Reiji to win a tender

6
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:39,446
Today

7
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:42,115
The target has finally shown up.

8
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:48,205
The director just came back from a business trip to Korea.

9
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:51,531
And I hear there's no luck this time.

10
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:54,517
What three-year project plan? It doesn't matter right now.

11
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:57,500
We grew up together.

12
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,047
I know that guy too well.

13
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:02,301
I'm interested in three months

14
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:05,544
To make our company's name known throughout Asia.

15
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:06,936
You know that

16
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,297
You're meeting him for the first time today, aren't you?

17
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:12,863
Just be careful.

18
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,130
What kind of person is that?

19
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,308
These eyes seemed to be looking into their

20
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:02,120
You come here

21
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:06,791
ok

22
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:24,705
take it easy

23
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:27,489
Be gentle.

24
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:33,820
This guy's always been a flirt.

25
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,568
It pisses me off.

26
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,733
Come in

27
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:11,632
While you were away

28
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,632
Shoyo frequently avoids the security system

29
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:15,632
Abnormally high frequency of logging in to the back office to check information
