1
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:18,214
He is an indisputable presence in front of outsiders.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,692
When did you start lying to me?

3
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,224
Since I started working here... but

4
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:37,414
I just always wait for you

5
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:43,250
Wait until you confess everything to me on your own.

6
00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:50,184
I'm very afraid.

7
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,733
The truth, when spoken

8
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:54,962
I might not be able to stay at this company anymore.

9
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:57,529
I'm going to pour myself a cup of coffee.

10
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:06,693
Can someone like me get close to you?

11
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:13,645
From now on, you are mine.

12
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,171
What happened to the data stolen by xiaoya?

13
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:15,623
Mr. Tanaka, I have obtained the information you requested.

14
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:18,477
Have someone steal the information and then report him.

15
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:19,620
What happen to you

16
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:24,078
Don't let that quietly growing fondness slip away

17
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:26,072
undermine our plans

18
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:27,797
When you're not around

19
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:29,995
Xiaoya frequently evades the security system

20
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:33,447
Abnormal number of logins to the backend

21
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,679
What are you up to?

22
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,425
Never mind. Go tell him what to do next.

23
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:57,172
leiji

24
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:01,242
How come you answered the phone?

25
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:04,080
I knew you and Mr. Tanaka were on the same side.

26
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,311
Tell Tanaka

27
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,689
I am prepared to withdraw from this bid.

28
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:15,142
By the way, I'll tell you too.

29
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:18,657
I will protect Xiaoya.

30
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:22,064
Just like how I take care of every dessert I make.

31
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,334
I hope

32
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:25,695
You can meet someone who like you

33
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:35,571
Why do you want me to give away the real recipe?

34
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:40,143
The recipe can be copied.

35
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,599
Expect you

36
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:56,228
No one can take away my heartbeat at that moment.

37
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:02,152
That is my unique magic.

38
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,670
The most important thing is temperature

39
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,769
At that time, I thought he was a very cold-hearted person.

40
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:40,154
With temperature

41
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:43,302
Only then can hearts truly connect.

42
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,009
Until I discovered

43
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:48,284
He just hides his feelings.

44
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,949
Your handwriting is beautiful.

45
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,230
Very steady hands

46
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:57,641
Very suitable for desserts
