"Happy Country" South Korea

4
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,010
The film is based on the 1979 assassination of the president.

5
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,820
All characters and events in the film are fictional and may differ from reality.

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:02,820
Safe House in Gung jeong-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul

7
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,490
Kill the guy today.

8
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,620
Did he kill the president too?

9
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,120
Act when you are ready

10
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,050
There are too many guards. Maybe next time?

11
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,020
No.

12
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,320
Just do your own thing.

13
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,220
This is for liberal democracy

14
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,920
Nothing will happen.

15
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:27,560
The assassination of the president occurred on October 26, 1979

16
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,620
Honey

17
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,070
Beautiful Mom

18
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,720
Honey

19
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,220
I'm not going in.

20
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,020
What happened?

21
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm going back now

22
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,250
Take good care

23
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,190
Children

24
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,390
I'm leaving

25
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,820
Good Dad

26
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,400
The assassination attempt on the president took place on October 26, 1979

27
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,270
The Central Intelligence Minister and seven others were arrested. Petitions calling for their release continue to appear.

28
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,170
Therefore, a legal team was organized around the opposition party.

29
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,950
In this case, the Minister of Central Intelligence has great power.

30
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,250
Based on huge organizational strength

31
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,290
If we have control over the martial law troops, we can handle it.

32
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,020
So I conceived this plan

33
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,600
Related to the military and other forces

34
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,120
External forces involved

35
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,320
Killed the President

36
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,490
It's a very speechless action.

37
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,150
It's a murder case of treason.

38
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,610
Office of the Presidential Assassination Counsel

39
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,590
He's a very active guy.

40
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,720
The case was handled within six hours.

41
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,920
It's not daybreak yet

42
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,520
The Minister of Central Intelligence was arrested as a murderer.

43
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,290
Stronger intelligence capabilities

44
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,750
Less than two hours later, we knew the president was dead.

45
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,990
That's true.

46
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,750
Yeah, I'm back.

47
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,390
Howâ€™s it going?

48
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,490
Deliberately hiding from me

49
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,150
Don't answer the phone at all

50
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,790
Didn't you see it?

51
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,020
Yes

52
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,090
Less than ten days until the trial

53
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,590
How come they don't even have a team of lawyers?

54
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,050
The bigger problem is Park Dae-ryung

55
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,890
Because he's a soldier

56
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,850
No one wants to defend him.

57
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,720
It was a military court ruling.

58
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,250
It is the final word

59
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,790
This way we can only surrender

60
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,590
Do you guys want to keep watching the fun?

61
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,090
Are you here for a spring outing?

62
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,290
Get out, get out

63
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,250
Whether it's threats or lies

64
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,650
Get a lawyer.

65
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,350
Really

66
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,520
Why don't you go out?

67
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,690
Change your position.

68
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,950
What

69
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,190
Seats?

70
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,150
Yes

71
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,090
Hurry up

72
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,490
Straighten your legs

73
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,620
Not straight forward

74
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,190
Straighten it like this

75
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,750
Have you memorized all the lines?

76
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,820
Yes

77
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,190
Say it again

78
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,090
OK

79
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,920
The bracket fell off.

80
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,190
Collapse on top of head

81
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,750
tube

82
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,790
Fall down this way

83
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,320
I thought I was going to die.

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,920
We tried our best to stop

85
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,140
I was dizzy from being hit

86
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,420
This can't happen, then...

87
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,890
Thinking of my wife who ran away from home, I can't stop crying

88
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,950
That's pretty cool.

89
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,140
...

90
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,520
Hand Position

91
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,890
Very impressive

92
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,620
Can be an actor

93
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,620
A few pipes fell off

94
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,750
There should be five or six.

95
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,620
Well

96
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,050
More than that

97
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,220
Eight

98
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,990
nine

99
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,820
Hello, really

100
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,320
Not those

101
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,050
A few pipes fell off

102
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,990
Twenty, twenty

103
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,050
Twenty, yes.

104
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,590
This guy is not a lawyer, he is clearly a gangster

105
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,450
No one anyway

106
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,790
How is the strength

107
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,350
Very impressive

108
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,350
Very good at defense and principled

109
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
No one is better suited for dog-eat-dog battles than him.

110
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,690
Do lawyers really have to go to this extent?

111
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,320
All are colleagues

112
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,290
I also need to make a fake plaster

113
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,540
Sr.

114
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,120
You listen to me.

115
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,650
The courts are not for distinguishing right from wrong.

116
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,090
It distinguishes between winning and losing

117
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,390
Got it?

118
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,090
All rise!

119
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,620
Let you come over for dinner

120
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,120
Why don't you come?

121
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,720
What's this?

122
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,850
I want to be your headhunter

123
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,420
Presidential Office Case?

124
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,490
The whole country is in chaos

125
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,450
Just put on your shroud and worship it.

126
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,990
This is a trial you will hardly encounter again in your lifetime.

127
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,550
It will be published in the newspaper every day

128
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,390
Try to get a reduced sentence.

129
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,020
There will be endless cases in the future.

130
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,950
That's your idea

131
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,590
How much will you give?

132
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,090
Do you want me to work for nothing?

133
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,520
Aren't you a human rights lawyer?

134
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,550
Why don't you talk about human rights?

135
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,290
Bring cash

136
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,890
Three hundred thousand per person

137
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,090
Then I'll take it

138
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,150
I visited the prison yesterday.

139
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,820
You don't know your father's condition yet.

140
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,750
It's really bad.

141
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,730
Shut up

142
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,320
Otherwise, sew your mouth shut.

143
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,790
Take it out immediately

144
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,420
If we let it go, something terrible will happen.

145
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,750
If you take this case

146
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,720
We will also be more attentive

147
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,450
If you leave your uncle alone, something bad will happen to your father.

148
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,650
How come you are here?

149
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,650
I heard you were sick.

150
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,820
It won't be so hard to stamp a seal

151
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,650
Hide the students who were being hunted

152
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,050
Then go to the parade

153
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,020
Will there be any changes?

154
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,590
Speak

155
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,520
They are all very cute

156
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,220
I can't live for myself.

157
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,450
Let them become criminals

158
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,780
Yeah

159
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,620
You are right, you have a clear conscience

160
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,050
Just live like this

161
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,120
Small buttocks paint

162
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,820
Scare me

163
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,450
How come you came back so late and didn't hear me calling you?

164
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,950
Don't do this

165
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,190
Shenzhen

166
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,250
I want to take a case. What do you think?

167
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,250
South Korea's biggest political scandal

168
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,920
Presidential Office Case?

169
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,510
Wait a moment

170
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,650
What's going on?

171
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,090
You're not that type.

172
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,220
I think this is a God-given opportunity.

173
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,450
Will offer good conditions

174
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,020
Oh my god

175
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,920
If I can plead not guilty

176
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,630
You can become the protagonist in an instant

177
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,720
To be successful?

178
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,750
How can you say that?

179
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,290
Okay, that's true.

180
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,350
Worrying for nothing

181
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,750
That's all I have to say.

182
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,480
The atmosphere is so good at night

183
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,320
How about it

184
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,990
Tonight, in the dead of night

185
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,420
She is the daughter of the boarding house.

186
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,120
You guy

187
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,020
What's wrong?

188
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,020
Handprint here

189
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,990
Take off your shirt

190
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,590
I am lawyer Jung In-ho

191
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,820
æˆ‘æ˜¯æœ´æ³°æŸ±

192
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,620
November 14th Your Wife Ok Jung-ae

193
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,290
Hire me as your lawyer

194
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,590
I'm just saying the main point

195
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,620
Among the eight people involved in this case

196
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,090
Only if you are an active military member

197
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,820
That is to say

198
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:16,690
You will be the only one to go to court-martial.

199
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,420
You know a military tribunal is the final word, right?

200
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,620
The judge picked up the gavel

201
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,650
One blow of the hammer will determine your sentence

202
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,350
But it's different if it's a normal trial.

203
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,050
There will be three trials.

204
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,120
Second and third instance

205
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,750
Can delay time

206
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,950
Slowly create public opinion

207
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,990
Avoiding a military court

208
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,750
As long as you create public opinion, you will have a chance of winning

209
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,220
Mr. Lawyer

210
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,950
I see you have something to say. Please speak up.

211
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,120
Soldiers have rules to follow

212
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,790
I am a soldier

213
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,490
Soldiers should abide by military law

214
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,920
So what do you want to say?

215
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,320
I have no intention of avoiding the military.

216
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,250
Colonel Park

217
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,490
Here are the rules

218
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,950
There are no rules in court.

219
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,300
The winner is the strong one

220
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,990
I guess I'll have to reconsider hiring a lawyer.

221
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,360
Military police

222
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,530
I said the court is not the place to distinguish between good and bad people

223
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,100
Only wins and losses

224
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,220
I go

225
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,250
The crime of civil sedition is an act that undermines the democratic order.

226
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,150
Minister Kim Young, who led these three cases

227
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,190
Claims that the president was not assassinated

228
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,490
But to take up the gun for national restoration

229
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,420
The focus of the debate

230
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,950
Doesn't it depend on the crime of civil sedition?

231
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,920
Shooting the president in an attempt to launch a military coup?

232
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,190
Still wearing the mask of a dictator and longing for democratization

233
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,990
Will the court recognize Park Jong as a dictator?

234
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,120
I can only try it.

235
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,820
All right

236
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,390
Hello, Lawyer Zheng

237
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,950
I heard you went to meet Colonel Park

238
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,990
Any questions?

239
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,720
I haven't received a lawyer's notice yet.

240
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,850
Why

241
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,320
He said he would not accept trial unless it was done by military court.

242
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,790
He insisted on a military trial against him

243
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,350
It is said that Colonel Park is a very capable soldier.

244
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,720
Everyone is regretting the loss of a pitiful person

245
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,190
It seems that he is not a flashy political soldier.

246
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,650
He is not only honest

247
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,090
It is still the fastest in the same period.

248
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,190
Everyone says he has the ability to be promoted to Chief of General Staff

249
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,290
No, that's why

250
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,520
Do you want me to ask him to hire me as his lawyer?

251
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,850
What I mean is

252
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,750
It's hard for a man like him to escape military law.

253
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,620
It's really depressing.

254
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,250
What did you say?

255
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,420
To put it bluntly, isn't he digging his own grave?

256
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,790
How dare you shoot the president?

257
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,990
You really are

258
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,120
Okay, okay.

259
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,520
I think everyone's opinions are fully expressed.

260
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,120
The court meeting is scheduled for three o'clock.

261
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,350
We should go

262
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,420
It's too late if you don't leave now.

263
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:44,650
Yongsan Army Headquarters - Office of the Chief of Staff

264
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,890
No public hearings

265
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Otherwise, it's not just reporters.

266
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,990
Even ordinary people will squeeze in.

267
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,050
I said that now that things have come to this, how can we not proceed in public?

268
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,650
Neither the ruling party nor the opposition party will sit idly by.

269
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,800
I'm afraid I'll have other intentions

270
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,920
We must nip the problem in the bud

271
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,390
You

272
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,990
They were from the government.

273
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,320
In case, your private life is leaked

274
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,470
Isn't the result obvious?

275
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,240
Stop talking

276
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,050
Sr.

277
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,320
Yes.

278
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,190
They've all arrived

279
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,120
Not available in private

280
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,520
The Prime Minister is determined to do this.

281
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,220
There's been a lot of gossip in the military lately.

282
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,450
Are you being led by the nose?

283
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,490
You were not like this when your Excellency was still alive.

284
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,120
Hey, Major General Quan

285
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,950
You don't think the power comes from the General Administration?

286
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,220
The Chief of Staff has arrived.

287
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,390
Loyalty

288
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,350
Okay, everyone, please take a seat.

289
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,290
All we can do is keep the secrets with guns.

290
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,890
I am very awkward with politics and other areas.

291
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,190
There's nothing wrong with the front line.

292
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,090
We are doing our best

293
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,950
Oh, I forgot to introduce you.

294
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,520
This is the security commander, Major General Jeon Sang-doo.

295
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,120
The bad things that happened recently are all due to his careless management.

296
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,690
I am Jeon Sang-doo, who is in charge of the Joint Investigation Headquarters.

297
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,250
The court and military prosecutors present

298
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,950
Not only must we protect the personal safety of the defense lawyer,

299
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,120
We will ensure that nothing goes wrong during the trial.

300
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,150
Okay, okay.

301
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,950
Major General Quan, please be brief.

302
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,950
Sr.

303
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,550
Speak

304
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,150
The defendants are all unconvicted prisoners.

305
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,020
Please treat him as a political prisoner.

306
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,020
Have you heard any other bad comments?

307
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,570
I'm just saying this just in case.

308
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,950
I will keep it in mind

309
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,690
Take good measures

310
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,090
Thick is which thickness?

311
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,380
The Thickness of Virtue

312
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,100
Jung In-hoo

313
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,720
This is the name my father gave me.

314
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,800
He must be regretting it now.

315
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,450
You are in charge of Colonel Park's case, right?

316
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,770
-loyalty

317
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,520
I am Private First Class Kim Shin-woo

318
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,150
Yes, I understand

319
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,850
Loyalty

320
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
What's so funny?

321
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,020
I don't understand why people do this.

322
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,100
I mean report your rank and name.

323
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,790
You mean it's wrong to report the official rank and name?

324
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,390
There's no need to speak so loudly.

325
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,270
It's all a manifestation of authoritarianism

326
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,220
Your idea is interesting

327
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,190
Let's take a walk

328
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:26,550
- Can you save Colonel Park?
- Are you kidding me?

329
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,150
Do you think so?

330
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,950
At least ten to fifteen 
years, no less.

331
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,920
After all, he assassinated the president and plunged the country into panic

332
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,690
It should be considered a rebellion.

333
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,220
He was acting under instructions.

334
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,190
And he's not the main culprit.

335
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,090
I don't understand the law

336
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,390
But I heard that the principal and the accessory to the crime of civil sedition are of the same nature.

337
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,020
No

338
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,930
The same thing happened in the 515 incident of assassinating the Japanese cabinet.

339
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,550
The principal offender was sentenced to death but his subordinates were acquitted

340
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,450
Really?

341
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:15,120
What do you think of soldiers?

342
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,520
Oh, I forgot you don't like to be told your rank and name.

343
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,490
Well, let me ask you this.

344
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,990
What do you think of the soldiers?

345
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,420
Defending the country

346
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,320
Besides that, what are your thoughts?

347
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,950
Real thoughts

348
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,750
I don't understand what you mean

349
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,920
It seems you are more timid than I thought.

350
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,950
Staying in power for too long

351
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,650
And what else?

352
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,620
I also think that the military is beyond the necessary role

353
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,290
Arresting innocent people and framing them as communists

354
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,750
I don't think this is patriotic.

355
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,980
You should pay attention to it.

356
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,570
Since you told me your thoughts on soldiers

357
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,190
Then I will tell you what I think about lawyers.

358
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,800
You are garbage.

359
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,120
A piece of trash who only knows how to talk about the law and collect commission fees

360
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,720
- You said too much. 
- What's wrong?

361
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,550
Why am I wrong?

362
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,150
Soldiers are different from you.

363
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,120
The soldiers don't even have a quarter of what you earn.

364
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,290
I will defend my country to the death.

365
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,950
You think it's funny to give out your rank and name?

366
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,150
You think it's funny to be polite to your superior who works hard for you, right?

367
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,820
I heard your father is a priest in the church.

368
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,420
I don't even know my body is rotting.

369
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,250
And help those who clamor for democracy

370
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,060
A bunch of idiots

371
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,320
Ten years at most

372
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,390
Just wait and see

373
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,770
You can't even wear the nameplate properly

374
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,820
How to save Colonel Park is very interesting.

375
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,020
Wait and see

376
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,790
Major General Jeon Sang-doo, who directed the assassination, was able to take power

377
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,700
The head of the joint investigation headquarters has more power than the commander

378
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,790
Japanese public opinion

379
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,190
Major General Jeon Sang-doo, who directed the assassination, was able to take power

380
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:08,150
The head of the joint investigation headquarters has more power than the commander

381
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:18,950
Jeon Sang-doo and the hardliners in the military, who control the combat forces

382
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,420
Expected to be at the forefront of power

383
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,950
Just follow military law

384
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,190
But I can't give up the third trial

385
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,290
Why did you kill him?

386
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,990
I have to know the cause and effect before I can help you

387
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,050
Head of the Intelligence Service of the Republic of Korea

388
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:13,820
Leading his men to assassinate the president in the center of Seoul

389
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:21,520
The investigation record says you were following orders, right?

390
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,320
Military prosecutors would laugh.

391
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,020
To defend

392
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,020
Patriotism or political and social awareness should be shown.

393
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,300
Yes.

394
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,750
In my eyes, this is just a meaningless struggle for interests.

395
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,320
That's good

396
00:28:58,590 --> 00:57:00,480
Do you want to follow military law?

397
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,250
Didn't you say we should follow the principles?

398
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,850
How much do you know about the military?

399
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,240
I dislike

400
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,500
You can't like

401
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,750
But

402
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,520
To be responsible for defense

403
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,050
You are a complicated person.

404
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,720
All rise.

405
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,620
Army Headquarters Court-Martial

406
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,920
Public trial preparations completed

407
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,020
Take a seat

408
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,850
First public hearing of the first trial

409
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,890
The general meeting of the Army Headquarters on martial law will now begin

410
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,720
Public trial of Kim Young-il and seven others begins

411
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,920
Prosecutor please read the indictment

412
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,990
Defendant Kim Young-il

413
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,590
As the Minister of Central Intelligence, he repeatedly failed to stabilize the political situation.

414
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,620
Dismissed for incompetence

415
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,050
Plan to kill the president and seize power

416
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,390
After personally killing the president and the chief of security

417
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,350
Instructing the confidant defendant

418
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,820
That is, Park Tae-joo and others handled

419
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,220
After killing the president, he plotted to overthrow the country

420
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,750
Kim Young-il, the defendant, please, come forward

421
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,920
Defense attorney, please make your opening statement.

422
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,890
First

423
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,350
Thanks to the Ministry of Justice for making the trial public

424
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,820
Early morning of October 11

425
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,450
Kim Young-il, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, accompanied his secretary Park Tae-joo

426
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,490
Taking a helicopter to look around the situation in Kamama

427
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,590
Witness the resistance to the Restoration dictatorship

428
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,220
General Kim Young-il is struggle spreads to a democratic environment

429
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,750
In a state of urgency to prevent further bloodshed

430
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,050
I have objections

431
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,920
Please don't use the title of General.

432
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,090
He is a criminal who has been prosecuted for breaking the law.

433
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,550
Prosecutor

434
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,820
You are now following the principle of presumption of guilt

435
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,090
presiding judge

436
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,090
Inappropriate names idolize the defendant

437
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,950
Could be used maliciously

438
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,790
Please make this statement

439
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,490
Expungement from the testimony record

440
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,420
Respect the defendant's position and human rights until proven guilty

441
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,820
Presiding judge

442
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,750
Defender

443
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,450
The title of General is not a good one.

444
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,550
Assassinated the President

445
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,820
The defendant also admitted the fact

446
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,320
Please don't use the title of General Minister.

447
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,250
Called the defendant

448
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,950
Fifteen-minute recess

449
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,150
Continue the court session

450
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,650
Among the defendants implicated in this case

451
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,720
Only Park Tae-joo was accused

452
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,250
The sentencing was determined at the first instance

453
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,520
Just because he's a soldier

454
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,490
The heavy sentence was determined in the first trial instead of the third trial.

455
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,050
Is it appropriate?

456
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,820
I want to find out more about this

457
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,620
Military law applies to soldiers

458
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,020
Are you saying this is wrong?

459
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:29,990
The Constitution states

460
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,490
In an emergency such as a war, the first instance decision

461
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,420
It only says this exception

462
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,650
This is a petition for unconstitutionality of the first instance system

463
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,890
Presiding judge

464
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,150
The defense is using unorthodox methods to delay the trial.

465
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,120
I am requesting that this also apply to defendant Park.

466
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,090
The three-tier review system for citizensâ€™ basic rights

467
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,520
Citizens want a speedy trial

468
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,590
It cannot be used to check whether it is unconstitutional

469
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,970
Waste of time

470
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,490
Citizens don't want a speedy trial

471
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,190
A fair trial

472
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,350
Defender

473
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,590
Don't force it.

474
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,920
The one-trial system under emergency martial law cannot be considered unconstitutional

475
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,990
It cannot be an obstacle to the trial.

476
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,090
Is it unconstitutional?

477
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,890
It is determined by the committee and is not under the jurisdiction of the Trial Department.

478
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,090
And

479
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,920
The three-trial system is a basic right of citizens

480
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,950
For defendant Park, it was a matter of life and death.

481
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,790
The court that avoids the most basic right of defense

482
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,190
Is there a will for a fair trial?

483
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,820
I doubt it.

484
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,850
Hey!

485
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,650
Trial is the definition of procedure

486
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,890
Democratic Society

487
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,720
Reasons for not accepting people's trial

488
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,550
Because the procedure is not correct.

489
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,320
That trial cannot be considered legitimate.

490
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,540
Therefore

491
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,320
The defense attorney

492
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,590
To all judges

493
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,190
Request for refutation

494
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,290
Please be quiet.

495
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:13,950
Defender.

496
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,390
Do you mean to replace all the judges?

497
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,390
That's right.

498
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,920
We cannot accept a trial that violates the Constitution.

499
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,720
Before that

500
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,450
Why did the Trial Department respond so quickly and decisively?

501
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,290
Please explain first

502
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,020
The defense is now threatening the court

503
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,850
I am warning you

504
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,450
If you continue to say something that disregards the judgment department

505
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,530
I will never ignore it.

506
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,920
Temporary adjournment.

507
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,920
So sweet!

508
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,320
Good.

509
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,490
You won't treat us casually anymore, right?

510
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,890
Of course

511
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,690
The small note was delivered in real time.

512
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,650
Maybe near the court?

513
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,590
After all, the variable is still the army.

514
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,120
The younger generation is right

515
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,820
Although Park Chung-hee fell, the army is still there

516
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,820
If the court finds, you are resisting dictatorship

517
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,050
Who will be hit?

518
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,400
Everyone should be aware

519
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,020
We are following the Korean ship now.

520
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,550
It's really rigid

521
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,490
What kind of position is it other than the Secretary of the Central Intelligence Department?

522
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,530
Right below Minister Kim.

523
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:52,720
But

524
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,850
Living in a 16-ping-sized board house

525
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,620
The total assets are only 4 million won

526
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,590
Are you asking me to believe this?

527
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,220
Hide quickly, I want to see you

528
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,350
One

529
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,070
Two

530
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,870
Three

531
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:27,820
Four

532
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,190
Five

533
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,200
Six

534
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,650
Seven

535
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,020
Eight

536
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,620
Nine

537
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,750
Ten

538
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,150
Kid?

539
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,090
Elder sister

540
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,220
Why are you here again?

541
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,090
Didn't I translate it myself?

542
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,950
Please save his life.

543
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:19,890
I am sorry

544
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,020
I only know this method.

545
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,350
He won't beg for mercy or plead.

546
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,720
And very strict with himself

547
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,090
Will not betray others or break their trust

548
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,050
Please

549
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,620
I know the Colonel.

550
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,720
As long as I'm clean

551
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,590
As long as I am open and honest, it's fine

552
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,450
No matter what the family is like

553
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,050
I said something I shouldn't have said

554
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,220
Go ahead

555
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,290
Pull the trigger

556
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,190
Keep shooting until you run out of bullets.

557
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,450
Because in preparation

558
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,990
No difficulty

559
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,590
Here

560
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,620
In preparation

561
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,950
It means you already knew it

562
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,120
Although I didn't say I would kill you.

563
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,890
But anyone will understand

564
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,220
Just say you don't know

565
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,850
Because it's not stated

566
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,590
Let you shoot the president

567
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,820
Just say it's an emergency.

568
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,850
Are you asking me to lie?

569
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,890
In court

570
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,220
I've said this several times before. This is not the place to tell the real from the fake.

571
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,220
People all lie in life.

572
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,220
I lie as if it's my daily routine

573
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,290
We have to speak with one voice to put on a show.

574
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,390
It's so depressing.

575
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,990
Okay, you have to convince me first that you know you have to kill the president.

576
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,190
Then assisted

577
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,720
Not assisting

578
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,650
- I'm following orders. 
- Come on, come on, come on

579
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,650
I'm so depressed.

580
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,150
Anyway, you soldiers are really...

581
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,320
It's such an obvious character.

582
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,250
How much younger are you?

583
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,750
I'll punch you.

584
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,480
Just kidding

585
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,370
Just kidding

586
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,020
Good

587
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,850
Not assistance but command

588
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,690
The so-called command

589
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:45,820
What is?

590
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,290
Disobedience means death

591
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,650
Soldiers must obey orders in all circumstances

592
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,690
What if the order is unreasonable?

593
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,820
Commands cannot distinguish right from wrong

594
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:05,920
Why?

595
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,320
Because soldiers are on war missions

596
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,620
If you judge the order based on your personal thoughts

597
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,550
The chain of command will collapse

598
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,450
Will eventually be defeated

599
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,390
Yes

600
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,050
You cannot judge orders based on your personal thoughts.

601
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,850
Because orders should be rational and legal

602
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,320
Especially the intelligence department where the defendant worked

603
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,350
It is a special organization that deals with state secrets.

604
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,820
Highly demanding and obedient

605
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,390
The superior orders the subordinate to obey

606
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:47,390
Army officer Park Tae-joo followed his superior's orders according to military discipline

607
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,850
The defendant's actions did not violate any law

608
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,620
No furthermore.

609
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,490
The prosecutor asks you to interrogate.

610
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,150
How is this situation?

611
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,420
There

612
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,790
If your superior orders you to shoot that comrade

613
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,750
This question has nothing to do with this case.

614
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,550
Let's listen.

615
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,290
Sir Judge?

616
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,130
Let's listen.

617
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,190
I will obey

618
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,050
As long as the order is given

619
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,020
I'll shoot anyone who does order it.

620
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,820
Silence, silence, silence

621
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:04,450
Did the defendant think it was justified to shoot an innocent comrade?

622
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,020
I'm not saying this is justified.

623
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,120
For soldiers, the standard for distinguishing things is orders.

624
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:15,950
As long as the order is given

625
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,150
I will obey

626
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:21,620
Defendant

627
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,620
Who has the power to command the army?

628
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:31,390
Who has the highest command authority for the Republic of Korea's military?

629
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,120
Is the President

630
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,990
When defendant Jin gave instructions

631
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:46,690
Don't you know it's an assassination of the president?

632
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,650
Did You Know?
Did You Know?

633
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:03,150
I knew.

634
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:15,590
No furthermore;

635
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,990
What does it mean? Not be able to go down?

636
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,690
What happened to you?

637
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:14,090
Just run away like a coward.

638
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,920
Look up!

639
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,920
Is there anyone here who hasn't received a threatening phone call?

640
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:30,120
Whenever the phone rings, my wife's heart beats faster

641
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,250
Let's go after eating.

642
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,520
Damn....Anyway

643
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,590
Life is a matter of doing things one way or another

644
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,750
Just go when you have to.

645
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,750
Go home and sleep when you have time

646
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,050
Damn why can't you be honest?

647
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,120
Everyone knows we are just a name

648
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,550
Does anyone here think they can win?

649
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,490
Is there?

650
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,290
Are you done yet, damn it?

651
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,850
Damn it, go away

652
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,190
Hey you guy

653
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,950
Do you think I don't know you came in here to be famous?

654
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,290
You shit...

655
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,320
Did you drink carbon monoxide?

656
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,750
Come on

657
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,120
You have to be beaten

658
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,250
Let go

659
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,290
Damn

660
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,220
Damn the dog

661
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,650
Yesterday was my daughter's birthday

662
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,150
This is what my wife gave me.

663
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,420
I can't say it, so I open it and see

664
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,050
She hasn't been to school for a week.

665
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:48,350
She said she wanted to see her friends and cried at home every day.

666
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,890
She is only in the first grade of elementary school

667
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,050
These dogs are really

668
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,390
Jung In-hoo Sr...

669
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,490
Don't say anything
Don't say anything

670
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,990
It solved today

671
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,050
Including you?

672
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,250
When you hear gunshots, start moving.

673
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:42,350
This is for liberal democracy

674
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,520
Did you already know this?

675
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,690
No, I didn't know

676
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,450
It's death anyway

677
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,450
I will follow the minister.

678
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,450
Retreat.

679
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:46,390
What?

680
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,550
Canceled the battle

681
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,050
Itâ€™s over.

682
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,090
Block it

683
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,790
What happened?

684
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,250
Minister?

685
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:22,720
His Excellency has passed away

686
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:23,750
What?

687
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:25,750
Who did it?

688
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,690
Secretary Park

689
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:34,690
Where to go?

690
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:38,620
Intelligence Department?

691
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,570
Army Headquarters?

692
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,150
Namsan Art Cave

693
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:01,890
The Minister behind asked the Intelligence Department Army Headquarters

694
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,990
I said the Army Headquarters is suitable.

695
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,750
After the Minister agrees

696
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,490
We drove to Yongsan where the Army Headquarters was.

697
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,350
Do you remember this sentence?

698
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,650
During the joint investigation

699
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:19,620
Why did you transfer to the Army Headquarters?

700
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,550
After the President's Death

701
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,420
Looking for dozens of officers

702
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:32,950
Compared to going to the Intelligence Department

703
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,950
I think it's better to go to the Army Headquarters.

704
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:43,450
Minister Kim has a huge intelligence organization

705
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,650
If you want to overthrow the country

706
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,550
He will definitely go to Nanshan

707
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,190
But I went to the Army Headquarters.

708
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:55,890
In the tiger's den guarded by more than a hundred generals

709
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,350
Only three people

710
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:04,820
This can't be civil unrest.

711
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:08,520
At the decisive moment the colonel turned the car around

712
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,450
Minister, let me see the intelligence.

713
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:15,150
I turned to the Army Headquarters to prevent civil unrest.

714
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,250
That's it!

715
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:17,890
There is a way to survive.

716
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,190
All I need is to prove that it was the colonel who said he wanted to leave.

717
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,990
Are you betraying the minister in order to keep me alive?

718
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,150
The Colonel was the one who pushed the priest away.

719
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,720
Who is this because of?

720
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,070
I just followed my boss's orders.

721
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,450
No chaos appeared one after another

722
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:43,390
I thought maybe I could prevent more sacrifices

723
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:50,990
It's what I chose

724
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,120
Should I tell the truth?

725
00:55:55,250 --> 00:56:00,290
Minister Jin is going to die anyway.

726
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,190
Hey!

727
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,620
I understand.

728
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:07,590
I'll see to it.

729
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,020
That's it.

730
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,450
I'm giving up

731
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,520
Damn Minister.

732
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,490
I told you now is not the time to worry about others

733
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,220
Not because of the minister.

734
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,650
I see my sinful colleagues every night.

735
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,650
The screams in my head

736
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,350
I will take responsibility for my sins

737
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,050
Don't say such irresponsible words

738
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:55,190
If a person ends

739
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,920
Do you think you can just be happy?

740
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,250
Three people were killed by the colonel's gun.

741
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,620
You don't have that qualification.

742
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,920
If you want to atone your sins

743
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,590
Standing on the judgment floor

744
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,620
The due blame

745
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,690
You should be judged.

746
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,750
That's the rule.

747
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,720
I'm going to pee

748
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,620
Where is this

749
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:49,020
Hey!

750
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,090
I am a lawyer

751
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,550
Something seems to be wrong

752
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,390
Write a letter of guarantee.

753
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,450
Write as I said

754
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:04,790
If you give me your fingerprints, 
I'll let you out.

755
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,850
What's wrong with you?

756
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:12,750
Who are you? 
Who ordered you guys?

757
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,450
Who is it?

758
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:20,220
Call your boss over.

759
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,920
If it weren't for your dad, 
You would be useless.

760
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,290
Severe abdominal damage due to intestinal obstruction

761
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,490
Cancer cells have spread to the liver

762
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,890
There is really no time for treatment.

763
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:34,920
Uncle

764
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,990
Put your hand out

765
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:06,950
I used to think that defending soldiers was particularly incompatible with my brother.

766
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,920
But I knew it just by looking at the kids.

767
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,290
Almost like my brother

768
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:20,420
I was sad when I thought of my dad.

769
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,590
I was thinking while being beaten

770
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,450
Was my father also beaten like me?

771
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,090
He was caught and beaten like a dog.

772
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,620
Why are you laughing like that?

773
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,390
If you laugh like that

774
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,890
Do you think others will feel sorry?

775
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,350
I'll sleep for a while

776
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:47,220
Set off

777
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:51,790
Witness?

778
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,020
What is the destination of the vehicle?

779
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,590
No specific direction.

780
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:02,690
Of course I thought it was the Intelligence Department, so I drove to Nanshan.

781
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:04,220
The car turned towards Longshan

782
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,220
What is that reason?

783
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,590
Yes, it is the minister's instruction.

784
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,820
Can you elaborate on this?

785
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:19,950
The President has passed away.

786
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:20,920
What?

787
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,920
Who did it?

788
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:24,890
Secretary Park...

789
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:27,820
Where to go?

790
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:32,290
Intelligence Department Army Headquarters?

791
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,490
How did defendant Park react?

792
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:38,720
The secretary looked very flustered.

793
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:40,690
I was troubled for a while

794
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:53,020
Let's go to the Army Headquarters.

795
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,850
It should be better there.

796
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,950
Let's go to the Army Headquarters.

797
01:04:58,790 --> 01:04:59,350
Yes.

798
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,920
At that time, I received the order to turn the car around.

799
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,950
Turned to the direction of the Army Headquarters

800
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,920
Article 87 of the Criminal Law

801
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,950
The crime of civil sedition is

802
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,620
to investigate the law for the purpose of resisting the chaos

803
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,420
a crime committed by a majority of people through rioting

804
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:19,220
What does this sentence mean?

805
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,920
It means that only six people cannot overthrow the country.

806
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:29,290
If civil unrest is really the goal

807
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:32,650
Of course, it is natural to go to the central government, which has its own support.

808
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,090
Of course

809
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:35,250
But

810
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,920
Park Tae-joo defendant did not choose the Intelligence Department

811
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,520
Instead, he chose the Army Headquarters.

812
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:42,890
Kim Young-il follows Park Tae-joo's lead

813
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,850
Turning to Army Headquarters

814
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,920
So this incident

815
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,620
But Kim Young-il, who was originally the head of the Central Intelligence Agency

816
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:55,920
The personal escapade that killed the president

817
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,090
It has absolutely nothing to do with the civil unrest.

818
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:02,220
It's just a murder case.

819
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,750
Really?

820
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:10,290
Is this to bring down Minister Kim and save Park Tae-joo?

821
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:12,890
Have you discussed it together?

822
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,720
Prosecutorsâ€™ request cross-examination

823
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,520
Was there any vehicle operation the day before the witness incident?

824
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,890
Yes, every day.

825
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,420
With the defendants?

826
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,990
The two have been together

827
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,350
Strange Places

828
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,350
Didn't you find it?

829
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,920
They were talking to each other in weird ways.

830
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,450
You mean the day before the incident?

831
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,220
Just as you can remember

832
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:46,390
Please be more detailed.

833
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,490
That was the day before

834
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,520
I don't remember

835
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,290
Yeah

836
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,490
Focus on driving

837
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:04,050
Difficulty remembering exactly what was said

838
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:05,750
Look at the content of your statement on the day of the incident

839
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,290
At a speed of 80 kilometers per hour

840
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:10,920
Even remember every word of the conversation while driving

841
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,650
But the conversation the day before

842
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,390
But you can't remember

843
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:16,750
Lee Tae-moon

844
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,420
Perjury

845
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,050
It will be a great sin

846
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:23,450
The presiding prosecutor is now threatening the witness.

847
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,290
Ok very good

848
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,790
Even if the witness is right

849
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,690
So

850
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,920
What kind of person is the defendant Jin?

851
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:43,790
The man who advocated taking up arms for democratic revolution

852
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,750
No plans or goals

853
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,820
A word from an impulsive subordinate

854
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:50,020
At most, he is just a foolish person who looks around.

855
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:50,690
How else can I describe him?

856
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,990
This is the head of the Intelligence Department of the Republic of Korea.

857
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:55,150
And

858
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,190
When defendant Jin gave the order to kill

859
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:02,050
Park Tae-joo was accused of: Why didn't you assert your own opinion?

860
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,720
If I hadn't thought about killing someone,

861
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:04,590
You should be like in the car

862
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,490
Just express your opinions confidently

863
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:09,320
Presiding judge...

864
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,120
If you want your testimony to be valuable

865
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,690
First of all, the witness must be a person who thinks without prejudice.

866
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:20,090
Witness Lee Tae-moon and the defendants are like a family

867
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:23,450
There is a high possibility of giving biased testimony

868
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:26,290
The evidence is also 
Very insufficient.

869
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:29,990
I apply to have his testimony expunged from the record.

870
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,150
The defendants advocated a democratic revolution

871
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:38,990
Just an excuse

872
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,120
Ultimately they want state power.

873
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:43,550
They committed

874
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:47,920
The anti-state crime of brutally killing the president and his bodyguard

875
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,250
-That is to say,  
-Lawyer Zheng

876
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:53,990
What's this?

877
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,890
- What are you doing?
- What is this trial all about?

878
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:01,490
The small note was passed several times during the trial.

879
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:03,090
Please go back to your seat.

880
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:05,450
If that's the case, why is there a court hearing?

881
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:08,320
-Drag him out. 
-What are you doing?

882
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,920
Damn, a bunch of guys who eat the government's food

883
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,990
Put the camera down

884
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,090
How dare you drag the lawyer out?

885
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:16,150
Please have a fair trial

886
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:17,390
Are you listening?

887
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,190
How long are you going to hide like rats?

888
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,390
These bastards

889
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:27,350
I asked you guys if you heard the asshole

890
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:33,090
Is this democracy?

891
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,450
Everyone, be quiet. Everyone, be quiet.

892
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,890
Silence.

893
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:40,090
The next hearing will be at 10 am on the 3rd.

894
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:41,720
Hearing in the same court

895
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,390
And the testimony of witness Lee Tae-moon

896
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,820
Will not be adopted.

897
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,590
Is it cool?

898
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,750
Don't you know their purpose?

899
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,950
They can judge it however they want.

900
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,300
How could you fall into their trap?

901
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:18,990
I am sorry.

902
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,950
Is the court a place for you to play heroism?

903
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,990
Why cause this commotion?

904
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,350
You have to know when to stop.

905
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:33,390
Get out.

906
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,520
What is chaos?

907
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:39,730
Are you pretending not to know?

908
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:41,720
If Colonel Park meant to go to Army Headquarters,

909
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,950
What kind of situation will Minister Jin be in?

910
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:45,990
What's your attitude?

911
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:49,960
Are you acting like this because I brought shame upon Minister Kim?

912
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:51,650
What?

913
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,990
Do I have to cut off the tail to keep the body?

914
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,320
Who cuts whose tail?

915
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,920
Don't I have eyes?

916
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,950
Don't you just want your men
to be your helpers?

917
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,950
And then turn Minister Kim into a democracy fighter?

918
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:04,720
Democracy?

919
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,590
Okay, that's OK

920
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,890
Dictatorship is the essence but the manifestation is social revolution

921
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:11,690
Okay, but

922
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,900
Shouldn't we rescue those who should survive first?

923
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,030
Who is this because of?

924
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:24,950
All his men rushed into the fire with oil drums.

925
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,400
You actually did this

926
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,090
What is a mere democracy fighter?

927
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:30,920
Why is everyone so damned?

928
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,850
What are you doing in 
front of your seniors?

929
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:33,950
Besides

930
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,320
If this continues,

931
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,690
Colonel Park will die.

932
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,420
The trial was screwed.

933
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,360
You say something that makes me breathless.

934
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,920
It's not torture.

935
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,290
You're

936
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:20,850
really chilling

937
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,090
Sometimes I feel colder than you

938
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:26,720
Really?

939
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:33,050
Let's chat today

940
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:37,100
Chatting about the kind of things that can help us understand each other.

941
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:54,920
My father was a pastor.

942
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,390
Help students who escape,

943
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:01,520
give the women workers transportation fare

944
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,650
His wife and children are starving to death.

945
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:05,950
But he always thinking about others

946
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,290
I studied very hard

947
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,150
This disgusting poverty

948
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,820
I will return all of them when I become a prosecutor.

949
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,050
I was eliminated during recruitment

950
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,720
Is it because of your father?

951
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:27,090
Do you think that children are the only ones who are worrying?

952
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,720
Parents are also worrying

953
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,520
Although I am not qualified to give you advice

954
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,320
But don't hate your father too much

955
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,420
Some people are not able to live differently from others.

956
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,390
Just open one eye and close one eye

957
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,850
But he just couldn't do it

958
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:54,390
Eat it

959
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:03,900
Vice-Captain

960
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,510
I met the Minister for the first time.

961
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:11,250
It was a tough time.

962
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:13,250
But he takes good care of me.

963
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,890
That night

964
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,420
I wanted to ask him several times.

965
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:26,890
Is it necessary to do this?

966
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,490
But I couldn't ask

967
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,320
It's the orange Huishan gave me.

968
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:53,520
My children

969
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,990
They think I'm doing okay?

970
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,890
I want to see them in my dreams.

971
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,150
But they rarely show up

972
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:21,470
No time

973
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:24,220
Find someone who can prove that Colonel Park is right

974
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:26,550
Make sure to put that person on the witness stand.

975
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:32,490
The four people who were in the car that went to the Army Headquarters that day

976
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:37,090
Driver Li Taiwen is no longer useful in court

977
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:40,750
Minister Kim and Colonel Park

978
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,390
Because we are both defendants, so no.

979
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:44,320
Only one person left

980
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,450
Do you want Chief Zheng to take the witness stand?

981
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,920
Is there anything wrong with that?

982
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,810
That's easy to say.

983
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:56,370
He's the martial law commander.

984
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:59,190
What's the problem with him being in the witness chair?

985
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,350
Is there any other way?

986
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,720
It's useless for someone who has no lethality to serve as a witness.

987
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,820
A bomb is needed

988
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,040
As long as Chief Zheng can stand there

989
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:08,150
Public opinion will also cause a sensation

990
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:10,330
The judge couldn't do anything to him.

991
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,650
I understand your desire to not miss any opportunity.

992
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:14,620
What?

993
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:23,550
What's your plan?

994
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:28,620
Just first...

995
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,950
just do it with gritted teeth

996
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,190
Minister Kim said

997
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,950
Colonel Park may not have the luck of a superior, but he has the luck of a lawyer.

998
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:47,150
You're right, fuck democracy.

999
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:48,620
Let's rescue the people first.

1000
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,590
Sr.

1001
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:53,190
You can't act on impulse on this matter.

1002
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:54,420
This is a procedure.

1003
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,590
Let's go head-on three or four times

1004
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,920
At most, it's just a drizzle that wets my clothes.

1005
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:01,020
Try your best to see

1006
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,450
Sr. Sr...

1007
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,470
Hey, first...

1008
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,320
Official documents

1009
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,290
Hey, Lawyer Jin

1010
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:41,130
Intermediary Application

1011
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:43,620
We need your testimony.

1012
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,950
Do you remember the day of the incident?

1013
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:52,920
Colonel Park said in the car that he was going to the Army Headquarters.

1014
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,750
You know this isn't okay, right?

1015
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:59,220
This is the only testimony you can give.

1016
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,120
Please take the witness stand.

1017
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,990
I am the martial law commander.

1018
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:05,750
The Commandant appeared in the martial law trial

1019
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,950
Is this reasonable?

1020
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,440
Because you were there

1021
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,490
So you have an obligation to testify.

1022
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:11,250
I'm talking about you

1023
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,120
Do you think I can testify for just one side?

1024
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,490
Go back.

1025
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:22,920
Contact the Deputy Headmaster

1026
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:25,990
What is the real reason for not being able to do this?

1027
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:27,350
Hey?

1028
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:29,150
What are you afraid of?

1029
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:31,450
Why are you all whining like a dog holding its pee?

1030
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:34,120
Why are you still standing there, you disrespectful boy?

1031
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,350
Chief, please

1032
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,250
Please go out.

1033
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,420
The chief's testimony is the only

1034
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:44,890
Am I going to drag you out by force?

1035
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:51,020
If you are confident...

1036
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,190
Sir?

1037
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:56,320
Let me go, sir?

1038
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,620
Wait a moment.

1039
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:00,850
Damn!

1040
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:19,950
If it were me, I would do the same as Colonel Park.

1041
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,080
If you are a soldier

1042
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:25,090
There is no choice.

1043
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,850
Is there no room for persuasion?

1044
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,620
Be careful on the road.

1045
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:48,850
Damn, it's cold.

1046
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:49,990
Loyalty.

1047
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:04,950
Hey wake him up.

1048
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,820
Loyalty

1049
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,350
Sr... Sr...

1050
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:23,790
for a fair trial, please be a witness.

1051
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,920
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1052
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,920
It's me, sir. Please help me once.

1053
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,550
For the sake of a fair trial, please just say one word.

1054
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:38,790
- Go
- Sir? Sir? Sir?

1055
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:42,850
Chief...you bastard!

1056
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:54,890
Lawyer Zheng

1057
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:57,820
Letâ€™s go eat

1058
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:05,920
Another lawyer left.

1059
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:10,090
I don't know how many people will remain here after the trial.

1060
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,990
These guys are really...

1061
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:13,790
What should Chief Zheng do?

1062
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:16,650
The day after tomorrow is the last day to apply

1063
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,230
I know you've been tired recently.

1064
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,390
But no, it's not possible.

1065
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,950
Where is Colonel Park?

1066
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:29,420
Do you have any solution?

1067
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:33,070
Do you have any way to convince Chief Zheng?

1068
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:37,020
We have tried our best

1069
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:40,990
There's less than a week left until trial.

1070
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,990
Let's focus on the trial

1071
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,990
Cheer up.

1072
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,250
That's it

1073
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,720
Running at full speed

1074
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:02,560
One, two. One, two.

1075
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,290
Run!

1076
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:18,390
Where to run to.

1077
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:32,290
Let's go.

1078
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,750
What's going on?

1079
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,590
Stop.

1080
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:15,420
You can't go in anymore.

1081
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,220
Stop.

1082
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:18,490
Catch him, catch him.

1083
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:21,020
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1084
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:21,850
You stop.

1085
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:22,550
Really.

1086
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:31,890
Get out of the way

1087
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:33,490
Get out of the way.

1088
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:34,390
Don't move.

1089
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,120
What's wrong with you?

1090
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:38,150
Catch him, catch him.

1091
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,420
Catch him now.

1092
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,990
If the trial is carried out

1093
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:59,090
must be conducted in private.

1094
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:06,050
Isn't this already discussed?

1095
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:07,620
This time it doesn't feel good.

1096
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:10,320
Get control before you waver.

1097
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:13,220
I'll do my best if you let me do it.

1098
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:15,220
Major General Quan

1099
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:20,450
I heard recently that the Joint Investigation Department has exceeded its authority.

1100
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:24,990
Is it your decision whether the government controls the audit of politicians?

1101
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,970
These are all unfounded words.

1102
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:27,890
It's a rumor.

1103
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,850
So...

1104
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:41,910
The Deputy Ministers' Meeting is also...

1105
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:44,490
Is that also a rumor?

1106
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:52,450
I'm going to say something to you.

1107
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:58,450
It has been 18 years since we risked our lives to complete the revolution

1108
01:24:58,450 --> 01:24:59,850
You know this regime.

1109
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:01,720
How did we get it?

1110
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,850
Your legacy was thrown away like a rotten shoe.

1111
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,320
We are always left behind.

1112
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,450
Are we going to be led by the nose like this forever?

1113
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:12,220
Who is being led by the nose?

1114
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,420
Hey, Major General Quan

1115
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,390
If you want to get involved in politics

1116
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:25,290
If you want to do it, take off your uniform and do it.

1117
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,020
You go out.

1118
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:43,800
Hey?

1119
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,150
Haven't you ever learned to salute?

1120
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:06,420
There will be absolutely nothing for you to worry about.

1121
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:14,720
That's right.

1122
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,550
Deputy District Chief Zheng said he has something to report to you.

1123
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:23,450
Can he visit?

1124
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,090
Today?

1125
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:25,550
I heard it was a joint response.

1126
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:27,050
It won't take up too much of your time.

1127
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:30,450
I have to go to my parents-in-law's house to celebrate my birthday tonight.

1128
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:34,650
That's it.

1129
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:36,820
Then I'll ask him to come over at 19 o'clock.

1130
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:49,090
Birthday?

1131
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,320
Get rid of Chief Zheng.

1132
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,290
Adjutant

1133
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:08,190
Check the family, wife and property of that guy.

1134
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:09,190
All of it.

1135
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,850
We will report back to you after investigation.

1136
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:20,250
I'll let you answer the phone.

1137
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:22,550
A call from the Director's Office.

1138
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:30,790
What happened to your arm?

1139
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,250
Nothing.

1140
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,450
Simple boy!

1141
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,220
Apply for a witness.

1142
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:56,650
Can you keep my list confidential before I submit it?

1143
01:27:58,090 --> 01:27:59,050
Do you agree?

1144
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:00,320
But

1145
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:01,850
Need to use recording.

1146
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,090
Can't...

1147
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:05,900
If you don't agree, it's over.

1148
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:09,490
must attend the trail.

1149
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:26,830
I lost, I lost, I lost...

1150
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,420
But

1151
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:34,950
The list must not be leaked before it is submitted and must be kept confidential.

1152
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:46,250
Although it's a bit rude, can I hug you?

1153
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:53,290
You are.....oh

1154
01:28:58,790 --> 01:29:00,300
Court opens at 8:30

1155
01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:09,130
You must protect the general manager by half past eight.

1156
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:11,820
Definitely.

1157
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:14,510
I am the chief judge.

1158
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,190
Be careful when you go back.

1159
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:24,220
Are you really okay?

1160
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:25,990
Why?

1161
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:30,920
Are we going to pretend we didn't see the corruption case of Executive Director Jeon?

1162
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:48,990
If you want to strangle him, someone needs to grab his tail.

1163
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:51,250
The lawyer is a good fit.

1164
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,650
The scene looks good too.

1165
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:54,620
We might get burned.

1166
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,950
If you want to catch Nichu, you have to be prepared to miss it.

1167
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:07,950
It shouldn't be that easy 
to convince him.

1168
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:10,750
I said I can do it, okay?

1169
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:13,020
If I take this seriously, I'm screwed.

1170
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:13,920
Really?

1171
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:17,450
Hey!

1172
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:47,920
It is now 18:30 on December 12

1173
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,520
They have 62 people

1174
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,250
Arresting the Chief

1175
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:52,450
Departure completed

1176
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:54,450
Say it again

1177
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:57,620
Current time: 18:30 on December 12

1178
01:30:58,050 --> 01:30:59,790
They have 62 people

1179
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:01,450
Arresting the Chief

1180
01:31:01,450 --> 01:31:02,590
Departure completed

1181
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:06,390
Expected to arrive at General Residence in Hannam-dong at 18:00

1182
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,090
It is five kilometers away from the destination

1183
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:24,090
The leading convoy will arrive in eight minutes.

1184
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:25,350
Say it again

1185
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:27,050
It is five kilometers away from the destination

1186
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:28,890
The leading convoy will arrive in eight minutes.

1187
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:56,060
Hannam-dong Army Chief of Staff Residence

1188
01:31:58,390 --> 01:31:59,890
Loyalty!

1189
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:01,120
Deputy Director...

1190
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:03,620
I have something to report to the chief.

1191
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,890
Loyalty!

1192
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:11,290
Pass.

1193
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,190
Be prepared.

1194
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:40,190
Come in.

1195
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:00,950
You...

1196
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,750
Guard? Guard?

1197
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:13,250
Deal with them all.

1198
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,620
Sorry to bother you so late.

1199
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:25,790
Sit down.

1200
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:42,690
We came here because we need the chief's confession.

1201
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:44,220
Confession?

1202
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,490
Between the Director General and Minister Kim

1203
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,590
Testimony states that money was traded.

1204
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:53,590
What?

1205
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,450
Please also help

1206
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:01,120
The order was given to the chief to assist

1207
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:03,290
Instructions for making a statement,

1208
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:06,390
Please.

1209
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:08,350
Who gave this order?

1210
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:11,850
Subordinates are terrified.

1211
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:13,590
You know you're going to take me

1212
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,320
It requires an order from the President.

1213
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:22,020
Did the president give the order?

1214
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:24,090
Yes.

1215
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:26,980
Adjutant Luo

1216
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:29,450
Come in.

1217
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,620
Contact Cheong Wa Dae

1218
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,220
Check if there is this command

1219
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,850
Put down the phone.

1220
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:02,550
Put it down, you little bastard.

1221
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:03,220
What?

1222
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,150
Put it down now...

1223
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:05,350
What are you doing?

1224
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:06,190
Sir.

1225
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:08,550
Just go and take the survey together.

1226
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:09,550
You have to think about it

1227
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:11,550
Don't go wrong

1228
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,750
Put it down quickly

1229
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:14,650
I'll let you put your hands down, you little bastard.

1230
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:18,190
Put it down for me

1231
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:24,590
Hand, Hand, Hand

1232
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,650
Bring it to the front

1233
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:27,950
Raise your hands above your shoulders

1234
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:32,790
Take the Sir

1235
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:34,950
hurry up

1236
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:02,690
Block

1237
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,650
Come over here

1238
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,450
Come here, boy.

1239
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,720
Walk

1240
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:17,690
Set off

1241
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,490
Accelerate

1242
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:29,620
Lawyer Zheng Renhou is here

1243
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,270
Contact the Joint Investigation Headquarters

1244
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:37,520
What is going on?

1245
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:42,920
As long as Chief Zheng is here, everything will be settled.

1246
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:47,520
Loyalty!

1247
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:55,220
On December 12, 1979, the New Army Mutiny

1248
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:14,050
Everyone raise your glasses

1249
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:16,950
Cheers to the general's long life

1250
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,820
Cheers

1251
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:25,490
- Congratulations. 
- Thank you for your hard work.

1252
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:26,920
Thanks for your hard work

1253
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:30,850
Last night, Chief of Staff Zheng Zhenyu

1254
01:37:31,050 --> 01:37:33,420
Indicted for aiding the rebellion

1255
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:36,550
On October 26, the President was assassinated.

1256
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:40,820
Even though we knew that the head of the Central Intelligence Agency was a criminal

1257
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:55,890
What's going on?

1258
01:37:58,520 --> 01:37:59,690
From now on

1259
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:03,290
The trial will be closed to the public

1260
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:06,090
And said it's all over

1261
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:07,980
Said no one would show up

1262
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:15,800
Why?

1263
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:18,790
There's just some damn stuff.

1264
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,150
Damn!

1265
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:35,050
Why can't I get this damn plaster off?

1266
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:36,790
Oh shit!

1267
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:47,580
- Can't enter. 
- Damn it.

1268
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:50,150
I came here to say something.

1269
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:51,790
Said no.

1270
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:53,150
Come back after you get permission.

1271
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,250
Why not?

1272
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:56,020
Is this Japanese territory?

1273
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:57,920
Civilians are not allowed to enter here.

1274
01:38:58,050 --> 01:38:59,250
You can't go in.

1275
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:01,550
Let go, Let go.

1276
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:05,390
Hey, let him in.

1277
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,090
Why?

1278
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:23,420
Do I have to take off my underwear for you to see?

1279
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:24,550
Let him in right away.

1280
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:02,050
Please spare my life

1281
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:06,050
I won't be an eyesore to you anymore.

1282
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:10,350
Are you trying to trick me into letting him go?

1283
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:11,170
Um?

1284
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,950
You should save people in court.

1285
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:15,950
Colonel Park

1286
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:19,950
He is a soldier who has dedicated his life to his country.

1287
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:23,450
It is not a crime to obey orders

1288
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,190
Please give him a way out.

1289
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:28,890
This No. 3 club is just not very useful.

1290
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:32,990
The golf ball can't run back by itself.

1291
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:44,920
Can you help me pick up the ball?

1292
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:11,920
I think

1293
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:15,950
obeying orders is not punishable by death.

1294
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:20,790
You think the crime is not punishable by death?

1295
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:21,990
Yes

1296
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:25,960
Do your thoughts matter?

1297
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:31,930
Thoughts of a mere lawyer.

1298
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:00,920
It would have been nice if you had come earlier.

1299
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,850
Colonel Park didn't do it.

1300
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:06,220
Even if you make a plan

1301
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,890
Minister Kim also acted alone.

1302
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,990
Even if it is reported

1303
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:13,850
Minister Jin was the only one who did this.

1304
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:16,090
Don't you understand this?

1305
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,950
Just a head on the neck

1306
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:21,890
I can pick it up right away

1307
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:23,290
Do you understand?

1308
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:25,950
I keep it here so you can see what the country looks like.

1309
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:28,990
Look around

1310
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:31,090
Overwhelmed

1311
01:43:31,090 --> 01:43:32,150
Indecisive

1312
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:35,220
The guy who didn't know what to do was running around

1313
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:36,790
Messy

1314
01:43:37,190 --> 01:43:38,200
It's a mess.

1315
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:40,850
Order must be established

1316
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,620
Who?

1317
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,380
Come and lift this big stick

1318
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:52,960
In military uniform

1319
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,520
Persisted for 25 years

1320
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:00,750
I should be qualified.

1321
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:13,550
But yeah

1322
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:17,840
If someone holds me back

1323
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:22,290
If someone blocks

1324
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:24,320
If you were me

1325
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:26,790
What will you do?

1326
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:35,690
No matter what you do

1327
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,120
Colonel Park

1328
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:41,720
Death

1329
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:49,590
Got it?

1330
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:56,870
Section Chief Jin

1331
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:03,160
Dig into this guy's background

1332
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:07,500
There must be a lot of unclean places.

1333
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:10,690
You go back

1334
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:14,680
When things calm down, let's go have a bowl of rice cake soup

1335
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,090
What the hell?

1336
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:29,690
I am a stinky person indeed.

1337
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:32,420
Because I am a guy without connections or background

1338
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:33,820
I want to create my own life

1339
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,450
So study hard

1340
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:37,820
Money

1341
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:39,950
That power

1342
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:41,990
Will anyone hate it?

1343
01:45:43,090 --> 01:45:43,960
Of course I would think

1344
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:47,960
Those who are rich and prosperous but still live in poverty are mentally ill

1345
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:51,520
No matter if there is sin or not, no matter if there is taste or not

1346
01:45:51,550 --> 01:45:53,400
I'm going to steal and cheat

1347
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:55,800
To lick the stinky feet of powerful people

1348
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,890
Let the powerless shed tears of blood

1349
01:45:58,890 --> 01:45:59,480
How about it?

1350
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:00,990
How about it?

1351
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:03,250
I'm bad enough already.

1352
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:04,220
Yeah

1353
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:07,190
But

1354
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:11,630
It's really disgusting.

1355
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:15,100
It's fucking disgusting.

1356
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,820
A guy like you

1357
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:20,650
I won't kill for money.

1358
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:23,190
I won't kill to get ahead.

1359
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:24,450
Do you understand, you bastard?

1360
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:26,990
Killing because of one's desire

1361
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,620
Is this something a human can do?

1362
01:46:58,290 --> 01:47:00,020
Hear me out

1363
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:22,320
If you want to be king, then be the king.

1364
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:27,650
If you want to get rich

1365
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:31,450
Then take all the money of the Republic of Korea

1366
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:36,780
But

1367
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:42,750
Sincere advice

1368
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,420
Don't kill people

1369
01:47:58,420 --> 01:47:59,490
Do you understand?

1370
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:07,750
I asked you if you heard me, brat.

1371
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:24,470
If you are told to turn right, then you must turn right

1372
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,600
What?

1373
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:29,250
Pronunciation: woo

1374
01:48:41,650 --> 01:48:43,090
An ignorant reporter.

1375
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:44,890
Hanging on newspaper

1376
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:48,050
I think you'll be interested

1377
01:48:54,890 --> 01:49:00,020
Let me have a few drinks with you.

1378
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,690
I found that Minister Jin

1379
01:49:04,490 --> 01:49:06,290
There's a lot of hidden property.

1380
01:49:07,490 --> 01:49:08,120
corruption

1381
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:09,520
Bribery

1382
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,950
There are still many things that can be found.

1383
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:18,750
I was under a lot of pressure because of this incident.

1384
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:23,490
Do you play golf?

1385
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:25,790
Very interesting, right?

1386
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:42,690
Must accept...

1387
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:46,790
Don't feel burdened

1388
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:49,090
Just say a few words to me.

1389
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:54,390
Do you think this trial will go smoothly?

1390
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:58,650
There are dozens of tanks parked at Gwanghwamun.

1391
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:03,690
Colonel

1392
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,990
Do you know what real
civil unrest is?

1393
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:14,520
The tanks parked on the streets of Seoul

1394
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,390
That's the real civil unrest.

1395
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:18,550
I know

1396
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:20,990
Because that's the only way to survive

1397
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:24,950
Only you survive

1398
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:31,620
Only Lee Ye Jin can survive

1399
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:33,950
Only if Li Huishan can survive can her family live.

1400
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:38,620
Don't think too complicated

1401
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:39,650
Never mind conscience and belief

1402
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:41,690
Just turn a blind eye.

1403
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:43,150
The world will be different

1404
01:50:47,290 --> 01:50:48,190
Anyway

1405
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:51,820
The Republic of Korea will go the way of arming

1406
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:54,920
Whether a traitor or a revolutionary

1407
01:50:58,590 --> 01:51:00,620
They won't remember the name Park Tae-joo

1408
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:14,320
5-year fixed deposit and 16-square-meter fully rented bungalow

1409
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:16,950
The total amount is less than 4 million won

1410
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:20,190
His eldest brother has worked in a coal mine for 20 years.

1411
01:51:20,190 --> 01:51:25,220
His younger brother worked as a welder on construction sites to make a living

1412
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:28,050
Born into a poor family

1413
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:30,250
The defendant graduated with honors from the Army Academy

1414
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:32,130
Always committed to serving on the front line

1415
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,380
He is a model military officer.

1416
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:36,620
On duty in the Army Division

1417
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:40,820
He was once transferred away from the front line by his boss, Kim Young-il

1418
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:42,920
He applied to return to the field team more than a dozen times.

1419
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:45,190
This transfer application

1420
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:50,790
This is information that proves that he does not want to become a political soldier.

1421
01:51:55,820 --> 01:52:01,250
The defendant pointed the gun at his teammate and took his life

1422
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:04,820
Killing can never be justified under any circumstances

1423
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:06,650
Should be severely punished

1424
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:09,650
But

1425
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:14,190
Absolutely cannot agree

1426
01:52:14,190 --> 01:52:16,850
Park Tae-joo's actions are an act of supporting civil unrest

1427
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:21,400
Soldiers who obey orders cannot be held accountable

1428
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:22,720
Half an hour

1429
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:26,350
The order was given only half an hour ago.

1430
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:30,290
This is done intentionally by the boss to hinder the judgment of his subordinates.

1431
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,650
Article 12 of the Criminal Law

1432
01:52:33,650 --> 01:52:35,990
No punishment for forced behavior

1433
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:48,720
The defendant was in a position of power

1434
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,220
Cleaner than anyone else

1435
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:55,920
But for the sake of the country

1436
01:52:57,250 --> 01:53:01,820
A true soldier who always takes the lead in fighting the enemy

1437
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:13,450
Dreaming of becoming a proud military attachÃ©

1438
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:16,450
I would like to ask you

1439
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:23,890
For this person who wants to be buried in the national cemetery

1440
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:30,090
Foolish principleists are exonerated

1441
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:57,720
Did the defendant know that this was a final judgment?

1442
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:00,120
Yes.

1443
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:04,520
On October 26, 1979, the defendant

1444
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:09,050
Participated in the assassination plan of the president on the orders of his superiors

1445
01:54:11,850 --> 01:54:12,550
Yes.

1446
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:16,590
I mean if

1447
01:54:18,150 --> 01:54:20,290
If you only have one practice in life

1448
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:22,390
so

1449
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:25,690
If you could go back in time

1450
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:29,090
What choice will you make?

1451
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:34,890
I'm asking if you'll participate.

1452
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:40,320
The act of overthrowing a country and usurping power

1453
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:46,620
Will you follow your boss's instructions?

1454
01:54:53,490 --> 01:54:55,020
If I could go back in time

1455
01:54:59,390 --> 01:55:00,520
In the Army Division

1456
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:05,320
I want to go back to the old officers' quarters.

1457
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:11,050
There is the smell of my wife's cooking

1458
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:15,390
And the laughter of children

1459
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:17,620
The Defendant

1460
01:55:19,090 --> 01:55:20,250
Please give a brief answer

1461
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:31,720
I am a soldier from the Republic of Korea

1462
01:55:33,190 --> 01:55:37,250
Soldiers must obey orders

1463
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:40,620
Because I believe

1464
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:46,990
This will protect my children, my family, and my country.

1465
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,320
I am...

1466
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:02,250
The choice on October 26th

1467
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:08,620
There will be no changes.

1468
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:34,520
Defendants Kim Young-il, Kim Ji-won, and Han Ho-seok

1469
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:41,850
Park Tae-joo Lee Ki-suk Yoo Tae-woo Kim Tae-woo

1470
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,550
Applicable to killing for the purpose of civil unrest

1471
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:50,990
And the death penalty for crimes such as aiding and abetting sedition

1472
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:03,820
All rise!

1473
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:55,120
For you

1474
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:01,070
Don't bother.

1475
01:58:09,990 --> 01:58:14,020
Yeah, but I understand one thing.

1476
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:21,720
You are a real lawyer.

1477
01:58:39,450 --> 01:58:40,350
