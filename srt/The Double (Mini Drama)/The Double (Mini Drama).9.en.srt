2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,000
Wu Baohui's sister will tell us

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,760
whether the person
who appeared at the wedding that day

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,480
was Wu Baohui

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,040
or Li Ziyu.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,760
Ms. Chen, I've arrived
at Ms. Wu Baoting's home.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,440
I will conduct the interview
under the supervision of the board.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,320
Please come in.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,040
Hello, Ms. Wu.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,960
Oh.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm the client manager
from Qinghe Hotel.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,180
I'm here today to gather
some client feedback.

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,060
Are you satisfied
with the banquet standards?

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,560
Yes. Thank you.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,800
How about your family?

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,320
We also want to gather
some family opinions.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,080
My sister attended the wedding.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,040
So, she really is her sister.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,200
What exactly is going on?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,440
What's wrong, Baoting?

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,160
Wow.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,000
They look so alike.

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,480
How could there be such a coincidence?

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,680
If it weren't for Miss Li sitting here,

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,480
I might have been misled.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
They don't really look alike
with a closer look.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,600
Miss Li is much more elegant.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,480
Impossible.

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
Absolutely impossible.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,160
Zhao Jize,

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,240
did you have something to do with this?

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,240
- Who is that person?
- Get out.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,200
Is it Li Ziyu?

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,960
Li Ziyu isn't dead,

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,080
is she?

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Since today was just a misunderstanding,

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,320
I think we should leave now.

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,040
Let's go.

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
Who is she?

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,640
Is she Li Ziyu?

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,000
Li Ziyu isn't dead, is she?

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,080
Now,

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
you are the real Li Ziyu.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,800
Zhao Jize,

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,800
to seize the inheritance,

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,600
you really would stop at nothing.

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,120
Did Chen Jingru tell you all this?

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,440
What else did she say to you?

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,420
Since you want to know so badly,

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,400
fine.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
I'll tell you.

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,680
You controlled the real Li Ziyu

53
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,680
and kept watching me all this time.

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,840
Now, everyone in Qinghe
is under your command.

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,440
Congratulations, Mr. Zhao.

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,320
You got your way.

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,320
Get out of the car.

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,440
Miss Li.

59
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,440
Miss Li, slow down when driving.

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,000
Sis.

61
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,560
Where is she?

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,840
Who?

63
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Didn't you just bring back the cake?

64
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,480
It's the same flavor?

65
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,920
Sis.

66
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,920
Sis?

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
Why are you being weird today?

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,520
- Am I?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,480
You just got a call, went out,

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,000
and came back in different clothes

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,400
with the same cake.

72
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,240
When did I go out?

73
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,160
A few minutes ago.

74
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,440
Hey, Sis.

75
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,400
Where are you going?

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Wait.

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
Li Ziyu.

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,280
You're Li Ziyu, right?

79
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,720
You're...?

80
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,640
Sorry.

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,480
I mistook you for someone else.

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
Are you crazy?

83
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,280
Sis.

84
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,640
What's wrong with you?

85
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,640
Baoting.

86
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
Listen to me.

87
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,520
The person who appeared at our home
two minutes ago wasn't me.

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,080
Then who was it?

89
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,760
Why did she pretend to be you?

90
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,680
I don't know.

91
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,720
I really don't know.

92
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,600
Sis.

93
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Are you too stressed recently?

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,440
If you're unhappy with your job,
come back.

95
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,600
I don't want you to overwork yourself.

96
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm fine.

97
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,240
Maybe it's just that work stress
has been high lately.

98
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,920
Let's go back.

99
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,780
Alright.

100
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,300
(Zhao Jize)

101
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
Ms. Wu.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,920
I remember you promised me

103
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,320
you'd cut ties
with everything from the past.

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,720
What if I go back on that promise?

105
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,280
Everyone now believes you are Li Ziyu.

106
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,400
You have no way out.

107
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,880
I could just leave.

108
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
You're the one with no way out.

109
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
If the truth is revealed,

110
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,760
Qinghe Group will sue you for fraud.

111
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,400
Think about your sister.

112
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,520
How despicable.

113
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
So,

114
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,960
you'd better cooperate with me

115
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
and stay here.

116
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,320
Notify everyone.

117
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,080
From this moment on,

118
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,520
Miss Li is forbidden
to leave the estate.

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,840
Anyone who disobeys

120
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,760
will bear the consequences.

121
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,080
What are you trying to do?

122
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,000
Imprison me?

123
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,040
I gave you too much freedom before.

124
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
Now,

125
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,360
I've changed my mind.

126
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,060
I'll be on a business trip
for a few days.

127
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,240
Take care of her.

128
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
Understood.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,400
She's lively by nature.

130
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,960
She probably won't stay put for long.

131
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,680
In the coming days, have someone deliver

132
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,960
some clothes and bags
that girls like to the house.

133
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,560
Let her choose.

134
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,760
You're so good to her.

135
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
Why not tell her?

136
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,720
Can you stop being so nice to me?

137
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
What's wrong?

138
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm scared.

139
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,680
Scared of what?

140
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,000
Scared that I might fall for you.

141
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,600
Alright.

142
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,700
I'll restrain myself
from being too nice to you.

143
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
It's so hard.

144
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,360
Miss Li,

145
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,160
these are our latest arrivals
of the season.

146
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,340
As soon as they came in,
we brought them here for you.

147
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,320
Take your time choosing.

148
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
If you like any, just keep them.

149
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,120
Sis,

150
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,880
yesterday, I was cleaning up
and found your bag left here.

151
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,440
Come by and pick it up when you're free.

152
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
