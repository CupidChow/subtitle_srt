Oh.

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,440

69
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,720

00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,800

that have collaborated

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,800

80
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
Okay.

81
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,120
Come in.

82
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,300
Do you still want to take a walk?

83
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
Are you done with your work?

84
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,400
Yes.

85
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,680
Okay.

86
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,080

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,560
Do you like walking?

88
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,960
It's okay.

89
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,280
I like to walk when I'm stressed.

90
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,480

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,320
my heart doesn't tire so easily.

92
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,520
How about now?

93
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,000

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,320

95
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,480

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm fine.

97
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,800

98
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,800
Of course,

99
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,280
someone like you who can do anything

100
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,040
wouldn't be scared
by this small setback.

101
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,720
Thanks for your trust.

102
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,600
Would you like

103
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,680
to have candy to ease the anxiety?

104
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,360
Is it sweet?

105
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,520
Try it and you'll know.

106
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,760
Is it sweet?

107
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,160
Quite sweet.

108
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,320
Do you want to try it?

109
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,840

You look so pretty
even while sleeping.

115
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,360
You look just as good when you wake up.

116
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,040
Why are you pretending to sleep?

117
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,920
If you want to keep looking,

118
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,760
I can pretend a little longer.

119
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm going out.

120
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,680
You can sleep.

121
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,360
Where are you going?

122
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,400
Just going out for a walk.

123
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,680
I'll drive you.

124
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
No need.

125
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
You rest a little longer.

126
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,400
Okay.

127
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,440

Sure.

129
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,400
If I had known,

130
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,760
I would have pretended a little longer.

135
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,080
You really didn't disappoint me.

136
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,060
Come in, and we'll talk.

137
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,040
Where is Miss Li?

138
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,440
She went out at noon.

139
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,480
She hasn't come back yet.

140
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
Did she take a car?

141
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,840
No.

142
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,740
(Wu Baohui)

143
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,610
Your home still feels the same.

144
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,430
It gives me a strange feeling.

145
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,960
Stop pretending.

146
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,320
You once looked down on it,

147
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,520
and you won't change your mind.

148
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,400
This is the money you wanted.

149
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,880
Don't come looking for me again.

150
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,280
We're so familiar with each other now.

151
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,840
Occasionally seeing each other

152
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,080
is fine, right?

153
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,480
You keep coming to find me.

154
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,920
Does your wife not mind?

155
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,000
What could she possibly mind?

156
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
But,

157
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,560
compared to her,

158
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,640
I care more...

159
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,760
Wu Baohui.

160
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,680
I regret it.

161
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,280
What do you want?

162
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Wu Baohui.

163
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,200
Let's start over, okay?

164
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,240
Xu Jiaming, you're crazy.

165
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,640
Wu Baohui,

166
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,800
did you already plan
to impersonate Li Ziyu

167
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,280
and inherit Qinghe Group?

168
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,960
No wonder you didn't cause a scene
when I dumped you.

169
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,600
So, you've found your next target.

170
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,160
Let go.

171
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,000
Wu Baohui.

172
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,040
Let me tell you.

173
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,920
You'll never get rid of me.

174
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,120
If you dare get any closer to her,

175
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,560
I have a hundred ways

176
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
to make you wish you were dead.

177
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,020
Aren't you afraid of your secrets
being exposed?

178
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
Want to offend me?

179
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,760
Go ahead, and try me.
