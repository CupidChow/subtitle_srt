2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,400
Sis,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,080
yesterday, I was cleaning up
and found your bag left here.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,740
Come by and pick it up
when you're free.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,680
(She left this.)

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,240
(There might be clues from Li Ziyu.)

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,400
(I need to find a way to go back.)

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,000
This one looks pretty.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,920
I'll try it on.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,880
It does look nice.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,440
Alright.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,680
We'll have it dry-cleaned
and delivered to you.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Wait.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,160
Do you have other sizes?

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,320
This one is already your size.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,200
Our models are chosen
to match your body measurements.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,600
I've recently gained weight.

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,760
The size doesn't fit.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,440
If possible,
I'd like to go to the store.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,120
Of course.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,720
We'll be waiting for you, Miss Li.

22
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,360
I want to go shopping.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,960
What?

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
Am I restricted from that too?

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,000
Mr. Zhao,

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,160
Miss Li wants to go shopping.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,760
Got it.

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,680
Send a driver to go with her.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,120
Understood.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,520
Miss Li,

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,080
please get in the car.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,280
Miss Li, let me drive.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,040
Miss Li, Miss Li.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,960
Let me drive.

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
Hello? Mr. Zhao.

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,560
Miss Li drove off.

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,440
Where to?

38
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,640
I don't know.

39
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,020
(Secretary Tian)

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,440
Wu Baohui ran away.

41
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,320
Mr. Zhao, I...

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,200
I'm heading back now.

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,840
What about the meeting?

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Instead of worrying
about postponing the meeting,

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,080
you should worry about yourself.

46
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,420
(Zhang Shunyang)

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,440
Zhang Shunyang?

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,040
How could Li Ziyu know him?

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,060
(Zhang Shunyang)

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,220
(Zhang Shunyang, Swipe to answer)

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,840
Ms. Li,

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,000
you finally answered the phone.

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,720
What's up?

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,320
The course in Bin City has ended.

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,600
I've booked an evening flight back.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,520
Before I leave,

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,280
I was wondering if I might have
the chance to meet you in person.

58
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,440
Hello?

59
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,840
Ms. Li, are you listening?

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,680
Ah.

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,920
Alright.

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,080
I'll come to see you.

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,400
Great.

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
Ms. Li?

65
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,040
It's me.

66
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,600
Oh, I didn't expect

67
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,840
to meet you in person before leaving.

68
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,280
Is that so?

69
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,760
This place is beautiful.

70
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Yes.

71
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,800
I fell in love with it
the first time I came.

72
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,960
Thanks for providing
such a perfect spot.

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,640
Actually,

74
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,960
my connection

75
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,320
to Bin City is
thanks to your sponsorship.

76
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,680
My sponsorship?

77
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,800
Originally,

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,080
I hadn't planned on coming to Bin City

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,200
until I received your call.

80
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
You said

81
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,680
you hoped I could come here.

82
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,640
Oh, by the way,

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,120
there's a question
I've always wanted to ask.

84
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,840
Why did you set the course fee
at this price?

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,200
Is there an issue with the price?

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,080
If ordinary people can work hard

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,480
to afford it,

88
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,880
art becomes less of a luxury.

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,640
My stay in Bin City was enjoyable.

90
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,600
I have a plane to catch,

91
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,840
so I won't disturb you anymore.

92
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,760
I hope we can meet again sometime.

93
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,880
Alright.

94
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,820
(Special Price)

95
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,680
A price that ordinary people

96
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,000
can strive to reach.

97
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,960
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

98
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,760
My idol,
the painting master Zhang Shunyang,

99
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,800
is actually coming here to give a class.

100
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160
Really?

101
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,080
That's wonderful!

102
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,240
With his guidance,

103
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,580
you'll definitely improve a lot.

104
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,600
Come on.

105
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,080
Ordinary people like us
can't afford his class.

106
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,400
Well.

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,920
(Shunyang Art Studio; Special Price)
Why is it so much cheaper?

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
An unprecedented price.

109
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,760
Maybe heaven is favoring our Baoting.

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,920
Definitely not.

111
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,880
Even at half the usual price,

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,320
it's still close to 900,000.

113
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,760
I can't afford that.

114
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,120
Forget it.

115
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,560
Maybe in the next life, I'll be rich.

116
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,360
Wu Baohui,

117
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,280
you're about to make a fortune.

118
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,520
A client has their eye

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,360
on your big house in the east of town.

120
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,120
They requested you to handle it.

121
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,560
No way.

122
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,520
Did the client check carefully?

123
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,440
That house is priced
way above market value.

124
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,920
Of course.

125
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,880
The client already paid the deposit.

126
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,520
The deposit has been paid?

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Who is this client,

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,600
paying the deposit

129
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,640
without even seeing the house?

130
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,360
Don't ask.

131
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,760
You wouldn't understand
the ways of the wealthy.

132
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,560
I'll give you her number.

133
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,400
Follow up on it.

134
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,560
You get a percentage.

135
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,400
Got it.

136
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,600
Thanks, boss.

137
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,400
Baoting,

138
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,200
when does registration
for that Master Class close?

139
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,840
Today.

140
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,480
Why so soon?

141
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,720
Maybe because of the big discount,

142
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
lots of people signed up.

143
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,420
(Wallet)

144
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,340
(Calling Mr. Liu)

145
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,440
Hello, Mr. Liu.

146
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,040
Can you lend me 900,000 more?

147
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
I'll pay you back next week.

148
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,720
The interest

149
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,440
will go with what you said.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,240
Sorry.

151
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,400
The number you're dialing
is temporarily unavailable.

152
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,880
Sorry.

153
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,240
The number you're dialing
is temporarily unavailable.

154
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,080
Please wait...

155
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,640
You brat, you promised to pay us back.

156
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,520
After paying such a big deposit,

157
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,840
she suddenly disappeared.

158
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,400
Could that big client also be Li Ziyu?
