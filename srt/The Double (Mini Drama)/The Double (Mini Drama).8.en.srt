00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,060
(Old Witch)

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,520
Let's meet,

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
Miss Wu.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
I have a gift for you.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,560
Get in the car.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,160
What exactly do you want?

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,880
You won't be disappointed
with what I have.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,920
Should we have someone
intercept Chen Jingru's car?

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
Let her go if she wants.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,760
Send someone to protect her in secret.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,760
What exactly do you want?

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,880
Aren't you curious

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,960
about how Zhao Jize
persuaded me to leave?

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,120
He's always been very capable.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,600
Coming from poverty,

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,840
with no one to rely on,
he made it to where he is today.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,600
His abilities are indeed impressive.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Impressive enough to hit my weak spot.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,760
Do you want to know
what my weak spot is?

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,160
It's me who had someone

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,320
kill the real Li Ziyu back then.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
Chen Jingru,

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,520
you're terrifying.

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm terrifying?

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,600
Then what about Zhao Jize?

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,800
I've always been curious.

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,480
He knew what I wanted to do to Li Ziyu.

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,080
Why did he stand by

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,480
and let me kill her?

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,880
Until I found these photos.

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,320
Take a look.

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,760
These photos...

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,640
Even when Li Ziyu was still alive,

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Zhao Jize had his eyes on you.

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,640
You were part
of his meticulously planned scheme.

37
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,080
Now,

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,200
do you still think
you're someone special to him?

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,160
Li Ziyu was worthless to him,

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,280
and you are even less.

41
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,200
Get in the car.

42
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,680
Why did you drink so much?

43
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,000
It seems that the first time
we met was just like this.

44
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,440
Really?

45
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,920
Zhao Jize,

46
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,720
what kind of person are you?

47
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,800
What do you think?

48
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,760
I don't know.

49
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,440
Let's go home.

50
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,640
Zhao Jize.

51
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,240
Yes?

52
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,360
Can you stop being so nice to me?

53
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,520
What's wrong?

54
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm scared.

55
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,280
Scared of what?

56
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,640
Scared that I might fall for you.

57
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,280
Alright.

58
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,240
I'll restrain myself
from being too nice to you.

59
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,680
What did

60
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,960
Chen Jingru say to you today?

61
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,320
I saw you get in her car.

62
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,440
Wu Baohui.

63
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,880
Good night.

64
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,200
Where are you going?

65
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,680
Just getting some air.

66
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,760
I'll go with you.

67
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
No need.

68
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,440
Why are you avoiding me?

69
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,160
Are you afraid of me?

70
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,840
Did Chen Jingru say something to you?

71
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,030
Yes.

72
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
You let her kill Li Ziyu.

73
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,960
Do you believe that?

74
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,480
I thought you'd trust me.

75
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,720
Then tell me.

76
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,160
How did Li Ziyu die?

77
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,960
What are you afraid of?

78
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
Say something!

79
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
I see.

80
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,360
The board meeting is about to start.

81
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,920
Calm down

82
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,960
and come back quickly.

83
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,920
As of yesterday,

84
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,380
Qinghe Hotel's value
increased by six percent.

85
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,900
Qinghe Properties' value
increased by six percent.

86
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,400
Qinghe Winery also shows
a significant upward trend.

87
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Next,

88
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,480
let's welcome Ms. Li Ziyu
as the chairwoman

89
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,320
to share

90
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,440
the group's strategy
for the next quarter.

91
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,560
Ma'am, the board meeting is in session.

92
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,520
You can't go in.

93
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,080
Not everyone has arrived.

94
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,480
How did it start already?

95
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,360
Why is she here?

96
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
Wasn't she removed from the board?

97
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,000
Chen Jingru,

98
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,480
you've been dismissed from the board.

99
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,600
Please leave.

100
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,600
Give me five minutes.

101
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,040
What I have

102
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,880
won't disappoint everyone.

103
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,160
The driver responsible for the incident
has disappeared,

104
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,480
and so has his family.

105
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Everyone, please look at the projection.

106
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,760
Isn't that Miss Ziyu?

107
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,400
Why is she in a place like this?

108
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,160
This person isn't Li Ziyu.

109
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,160
She's a girl named Wu Baohui.

110
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,240
How can there be two people
who look exactly the same?

111
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
According to Mr. Zhao,

112
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,240
the person in this photo

113
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,160
is our real Miss Li Ziyu.

114
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,880
They really do look exactly alike.

115
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
Could there really be
such a coincidence in the world?

116
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
Coincidence?

117
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
There's more.

118
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,160
The wedding they attended

119
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,480
was the wedding of Wu Baohui's sister.

120
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,800
If the person in the photo
is really Li Ziyu,

121
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,240
then on that day,

122
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,880
Wu Baohui didn't appear
at the wedding at all.

123
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,400
What?

124
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,200
How is that possible?

125
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,800
According to Mr. Zhao's explanation,

126
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,480
Wu Baohui and Li Ziyu
are not the same person,

127
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,160
and Miss Ziyu appeared
at Wu Baoting's wedding

128
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,080
simply as the group's manager.

129
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,440
However,

130
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,200
according to guests at the wedding,

131
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,400
the person on stage

132
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,520
repeatedly said
she was Wu Baoting's sister,

133
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
Wu Baohui.

134
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,120
To verify my theory,

135
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,520
I've asked the hotel's client manager

136
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,120
to head to Wu Baoting's home.

137
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,280
One simple question
for Wu Baohui's sister

138
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,240
will clarify whether the person

139
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,320
who appeared at the wedding that day

140
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,760
was Wu Baohui

141
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,560
or Li Ziyu.

142
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,080
Ms. Chen, I've arrived
at Ms. Wu Baoting's home.

143
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,920
I will conduct the interview
under the supervision of the board.
