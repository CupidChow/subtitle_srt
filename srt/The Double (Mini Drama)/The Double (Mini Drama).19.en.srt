2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,360
Mr. Zhao,

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,840
there's news about Chen Jingru.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
Where is she?

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,200
She's in a sanatorium of Qinghe.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,480
A sanatorium?

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,400
How did you find her?

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,560
Chen Jingru contacted us.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,700
(Tianquan Lake Jinling Villa)

10
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,320
I didn't expect us to meet like this.

11
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,780
I didn't expect you

12
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,080
to contact me either.

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,200
What happened to your leg?

14
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,600
It was a car accident.

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,040
It was intentional,

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,800
just like how I killed Li Ziyu
back then.

17
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,240
You took so much money.

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,680
It's no surprise
people have targeted you.

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,680
The money?

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,200
It's not with me.

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,720
If it were,

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,080
do you think I'd let you find me?

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,800
The finance manager betrayed me.

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,000
He's loyal to someone else.

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,920
That's impossible.

26
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,520
Apart from Li Qinghe,

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,040
only you could have manipulated him.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,080
What if it was Li Qinghe
who manipulated him?

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,720
Then everything would make sense, right?

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,320
Are you crazy?

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
See?

32
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,610
You all think I'm crazy,

33
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,390
but the truth is just like this.

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,320
At first, I couldn't understand

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,000
why the finance manager would betray me.

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,160
Until later,
I realized someone wanted to kill me.

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,240
I'm telling you.

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,800
This is all Li Qinghe's conspiracy.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,400
Li Qinghe is dead.

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,240
They say he died in a skydiving accident
and fell into the sea,

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,560
but his body has never been found.

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,480
Now, looking back,

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,000
everything was his plan.

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,000
Why would Li Qinghe do this?

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,320
Think about his relationship
with Li Ziyu.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,600
You've always known?

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,920
You knew.

48
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,000
Why did you allow it all to happen?

49
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,720
Not everyone has to be the good guy.

50
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,160
Until his so-called death,

51
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,440
Li Qinghe firmly believed
Li Ziyu was still alive,

52
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
and that she just didn't want
to see him.

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,040
So, he faked his death

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,400
to use a huge inheritance
to force Li Ziyu to show up.

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,240
How could he be sure

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,040
Li Ziyu would come back
to inherit the fortune?

57
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,880
That was his mistake.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,480
He didn't think that Li Ziyu
would rather give up 60 billion

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,600
than return to the Li family.

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,160
He also didn't expect

61
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,760
that there was someone in this world
who looked exactly like Li Ziyu.

62
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,160
You disrupted all his plans,

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,240
so he had no choice
but to reveal his final card.

64
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,680
He had the finance manager pretend
to be friendly with me,

65
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,320
then stole all of Qinghe's cash,

66
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,400
and framed everything on me.

67
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
Still don't believe what I'm saying?

68
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,520
Here's a photo my people took
a few days ago.

69
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,000
What do you think?

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,560
Do you want to cooperate?

71
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,080
What do you want?

72
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,560
I want you to help me
take down Li Qinghe.

73
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
Where is he now?

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,360
Do you know Room 1001?

75
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,480
Doesn't Qinghe Hotel
only have 1,000 rooms?

76
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,240
When the hotel was being designed,

77
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,920
Li Qinghe had
an extra basement floor designed.

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,680
Only he and the designer knew

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,480
about the existence of this basement.

80
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880
The legendary Room 1001

81
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
is there.

82
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,360
You're saying

83
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,360
he's been hiding in the hotel
all this time,

84
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,320
watching us.

85
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,320
Wait.

86
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,860
How did Chen Jingru
suddenly discover him

87
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,200
after so long?

88
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,720
Good girl.

89
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,400
I didn't expect
that after all these years,

90
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,440
we would meet again.

91
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,400
You can't escape.

92
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
As long as you're alive,

93
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,240
I can find you

94
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,360
no matter where you go.

95
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,000
You're a freak.

96
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
I just want you to stay by my side.

97
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
Is that wrong?

98
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,840
Ah?

99
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,800
You were always my daughter.

100
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,720
As long as you want,

101
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,000
I can give you anything.

102
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,840
I want your life.

103
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,920
My life?

104
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,840
Alright.

105
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Now,

106
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,920
my life is in your hands.

107
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,440
If you want it,

108
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,320
take it.

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,400
Take it!

110
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
Li Ziyu is back.

111
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,720
Why?

112
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,960
All these years, I couldn't understand

113
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,160
why you did this to me.

114
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,880
Because I love you.

115
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,040
This isn't love.

116
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,120
Do you know

117
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,400
you've ruined my life?

118
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,320
I provided you with the best life,

119
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,640
the best education,

120
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,760
and the most comfortable
living environment.

121
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,040
It was me

122
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
who made you who you are.

123
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,710
Li Ziyu!

124
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,040
You are Li Ziyu, right?

125
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,680
Look at that girl.

126
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,000
How envious

127
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
she is of you.

128
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,760
She looks just like you.

129
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,040
She's been struggling in society
since she was a child,

130
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,340
suffering all kinds of hardships.

131
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,900
And you've been a pampered life
under my protection.

132
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,200
She desperately wanted to become you,

133
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,280
yet you

134
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,760
ungratefully wanted to escape.

135
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,880
It's not like that.

136
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,800
Li Ziyu,

137
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,360
I'm Wu Baohui.

138
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
You must know me.

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,280
Listen to me. Don't act impulsively.

140
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,800
Zhao Jize and I are here.

141
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,440
We'll protect you.

142
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,040
Li Ziyu,

143
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,360
don't do anything foolish.

144
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Don't punish yourself
for someone else's mistakes.

145
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,640
Don't ruin yourself
because of a moment of lapse.

146
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,520
I've already been ruined.

147
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
Li Ziyu!

148
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,040
Where is Li Ziyu?

149
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,520
She's gone.
