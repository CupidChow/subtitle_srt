2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,520
Go home.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
Home?

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,880
My home or Li Ziyu's home?

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,400
You are Li Ziyu.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,000
Zhao Jize,

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,320
stop deceiving yourself.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,640
Where exactly is Li Ziyu?

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,120
She's nearby, right?

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,080
Since this is Li Ziyu's place,

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,760
there must be clues here.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,960
Stop looking.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,160
Listen.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,600
Come home with me, okay?

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,120
Are you controlling her?

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,520
Answer me.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,520
Fine.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,600
You won't say anything, huh?

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,680
Then our cooperation ends here.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,880
Wu Baohui.

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
The truth is often harsh.

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,200
Even so,

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,760
do you still want to know?

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Li Ziyu knew of your existence long ago.

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
Then why didn't she come out
and expose me?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,720
I'm impersonating her.

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,320
Having you impersonate her

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,600
was her idea.

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,080
But what about the inheritance
from Li Qinghe?

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,960
That enormous inheritance

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,480
was a gift from Li Ziyu to you.

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,000
Back then,

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,960
Chen Jingru staged a car accident,

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,440
hoping to erase Li Ziyu from the world.

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
By the time I arrived,

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,640
the driver had already fled.

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,160
Fortunately,

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,200
Li Ziyu was still alive.

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
Afterward,

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,960
at her request,

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,440
I found her a place to hide.

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,080
Do you still not want to go back?

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,640
If you're afraid of Chen Jingru,
I can...

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,480
There's no need.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,200
Just consider Li Ziyu missing.

46
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,560
The chairman is still looking for you.

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Besides,

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,280
Qinghe Group needs a successor.

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
He's looking for me?

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,480
You were looking for me?

51
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
Sit.

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
Where have you been?

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,600
Just got back from school.

54
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,720
Who sent them to you?

55
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,840
A classmate.

56
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,960
A boy or a girl?

57
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,880
Give them to me.

58
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,760
Why did you take these?

59
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,840
Why did you take the flowers?

60
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,560
Why did you take the flowers?

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
I don't want to go back.

62
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,600
Zhao Jize,

63
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm begging you.

64
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,920
Don't make me go back, alright?

65
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Li Ziyu wanted to hide here forever,

66
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,360
never involving herself
with Qinghe matters again.

67
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,800
Until one day,

68
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,080
she discovered you.

69
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,040
Someone in this world

70
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,400
looks exactly like me.

71
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,460
(Painter: Wu Baoting; Painting: Sister)

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,840
After that,

73
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,600
Li Ziyu tried in various ways

74
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,760
to learn about you.

75
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Later,

76
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,600
Li Qinghe fell critically ill.

77
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,080
Mr. Li Qinghe,
a well-known entrepreneur in our city,

78
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,280
is on his deathbed.

79
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,040
Before passing,
he hopes to find his long-lost daughter,

80
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,640
or his 60 billion yuan inheritance
will go unclaimed.

81
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,120
Li Qinghe has died.

82
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,240
You can go back now.

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,640
I don't want to go back.

84
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
I don't have the courage anymore.

85
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,960
If you don't return,

86
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,040
Chen Jingru will inherit
Qinghe Group as his widow.

87
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,520
Are you willing

88
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
to let that happen?

89
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
How about letting her
go back instead of me?

90
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,120
Would she agree?

91
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,100
(Calling Zhang Shunyang)

92
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,760
Mr. Zhang,

93
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
I'd like to invite you to Bin City

94
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,960
to hold a two-week Master Class.

95
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,040
I'll cover all expenses.

96
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,320
The environment here is quite nice.

97
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,000
You'll love it.

98
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,440
What should I call you?

99
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,520
Just call me Ms. Li.

100
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,460
(Zeng Lixin,
Chairman of Jia He Fang Chan)

101
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,600
Hello,

102
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,360
I really like that house
in the east of town.

103
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,080
The deposit has been transferred.

104
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,240
As for further procedures,

105
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
I'd like Ms. Wu Baohui from your company

106
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,160
to handle them.

107
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,280
I not only want her to agree,

108
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,720
but I also want her

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,760
to willingly become me.

110
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,200
So, it was her idea to have me

111
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,600
impersonate Li Ziyu?

112
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,560
Yes.

113
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
That paternity test was real, too,

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,980
but you switched the sample
to Li Ziyu's.

115
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,520
Correct.

116
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,360
Now, you can rest easy as Li Ziyu.

117
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,640
