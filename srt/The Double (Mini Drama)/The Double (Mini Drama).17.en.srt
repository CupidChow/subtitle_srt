(High-end whole-house ceiling)

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,960
Hey, be careful.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,480
There are fragile items inside.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,600
Hey, be careful.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,640
Are we leaving just like this?

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,440
Buying the old house back
has always been our mother's wish.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,640
What's wrong?

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,800
You don't want to go back?

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,800
No.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,720
I just feel that after living here
for more than ten years,

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,800
I've unconsciously come

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,560
to regard it as home.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,000
A rented house is never truly a home.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,360
Don't think too much.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,860
You'll leave with the luggage first.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,120
I'll finish up with Bai Qian

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,280
and come to find you.

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,680
Take care.

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Take care.

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,000
Take care.

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,360
Take care.

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,160
Mr. Zhao, I don't want it.

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,560
Take it.

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
It's what you deserve.

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
If you need anything,

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,040
just call me back anytime.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
I hope we can meet again.

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,500
([Bank of Communications]
Dear Mr. Zhao Jize, it's your birthday.)

30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,600
What about you?

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,120
Do you have any wishes?

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,520
I never make wishes.

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,240
Make one on your birthday.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,760
Birthday wishes often come true.

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,040
I'll take you to the rooftop
of my house.

36
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,920
The breeze is lovely there,

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,280
and the night view is beautiful.

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
You'll definitely like it.

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,160
Alright.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,800
Safe travels.

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,240
Today, standing here on this podium,

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,000
I truly feel undeserving.

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,760
As everyone knows,

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
(Qinghe Group Press Conference)
Qinghe Group

45
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,980
is facing an unprecedented crisis.

46
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,200
In order to save Qinghe,

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,800
we had no choice

48
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
but to let go of many divisions.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,600
We've failed the trust
of many employees.

50
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,280
A few months ago,

51
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,960
when the crisis of Qinghe first broke,

52
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,560
the group faced a devastating blow.

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,440
Someone asked me,

54
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,000
"Are you stressed?"

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,520
Are you stressed?

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
A little.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
What about you?

58
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,720
I'm fine.

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,480
Still being tough, huh?

60
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,800
Of course,

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,080
someone like you who can do anything

62
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,920
wouldn't be scared
by this small setback.

63
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,840
Thanks for your trust.

64
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,320
I said I was fine.

65
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,160
It's not about being tough.

66
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
I just believe

67
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,560
that many people who believe

68
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,560
in Qinghe and me are supporting me.

69
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,720
It's because of your trust

70
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,840
that Qinghe has been able to rise again

71
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,160
and start anew.

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,080
Zhao Jize,

73
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,160
this isn't a dream, right?

74
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,980
(Zhao Jize's birthday)

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Stop the car.

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,960
Driver, stop the car.

77
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,080
Letting Wu Baohui take the brunt

78
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,560
is the only way
to protect Qinghe and you.

79
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,640
Is there a better way
to protect Wu Baohui?

80
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,480
Mr. Zhao.

81
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,320
Answer me.

82
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,960
Make a statement

83
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,880
that Li Ziyu is dead,

84
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,420
and any problems that occur after this

85
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
will be your responsibility.

86
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Let's do it that way.

87
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,400
I'll handle the rest.

88
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,960
Mr. Zhao.

89
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,480
Then I wish you

90
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,520
a safe journey.

91
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,480
Zhao Jize,

92
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,000
I've made up my mind;
I'll take this with you.

93
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,920
It really is snowing, Zhao Jize.

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,880
Yes. It's snowing.

95
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,560
I want to make a wish.

96
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,880
Has your wish come true?

97
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,960
It's you.
