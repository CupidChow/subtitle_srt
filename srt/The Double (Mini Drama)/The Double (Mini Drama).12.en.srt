2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,320
Li Ziyu was here.

3
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,540
(Li)

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,400
Brother.

5
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,560
This is the first time

6
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,240
and also the last time
that I'll call you brother.

7
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,360
By the time you see this letter,

8
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,240
I'll be on my way to leave Bin City.

9
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Who is it?

10
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,000
It's me.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,520
Thank you for your help and care
over the past few years.

12
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,720
In my heart,

13
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,080
I've long considered you my only family.

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,720
Without you,

15
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,720
I wouldn't have had the courage
to leave the Li family

16
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,000
and start anew.

17
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,240
Ten years ago at the estate,

18
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,320
I said I hoped that ten years later,

19
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,600
we'd both be living the lives we want.

20
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,600
Today, ten years later,

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,120
you've found the person
you were looking for,

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,200
and I'm going to live my own life.

23
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,020
I've made all the arrangements
at the company.

24
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,800
Now, everyone believes

25
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,440
that you've gone missing.

26
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,320
This is not the reason why I helped you.

27
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,360
Thank you.

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,240
Many years ago, I read a book,

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
and there was a line in it:

30
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,320
"Sharing a journey by boat,"

31
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,040
"we'll each find our own way."

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,840
I've liked it for a long time,

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,760
and now I give it to you.

34
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,400
I wanted to see you one last time

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
to properly say goodbye,

36
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,360
but I was afraid that after tonight,

37
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,440
I wouldn't have the courage to leave.

38
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,560
So, that's all.

39
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,040
I wish you all the best.

40
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
Sorry,

41
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,520
the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

42
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,400
Sorry,

43
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,120
the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,840
Li Ziyu is gone.

45
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,720
She's not coming back.

46
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Can you come with me somewhere?

47
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,740
Do you find it familiar?

48
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
Wu Baohui,

49
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,960
you really don't remember me at all.

50
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,920
Stop crying.

51
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,960
If they bully you again,

52
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,000
just tell me.

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
I'll find a way to deal with them.

54
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
One day,

55
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll protect you
just like you protected me.

56
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,360
So, it was you.

57
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,200
Later, those kids
came to bother me again,

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,520
but by then,

59
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,840
you had already moved away.

60
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,920
At that time,

61
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,960
my mother passed away.

62
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,120
After that,

63
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
that man took us to Bin City.

64
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,720
I went to look for you.

65
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,120
They said you moved away

66
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,640
and wouldn't come back.

67
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,760
Li Qinghe took me away.

68
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you know

69
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,200
the biggest secret of the Li family?

70
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
Li Ziyu

71
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,960
isn't Li Qinghe's biological daughter.

72
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,520
She was adopted by him.

73
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,400
How is that possible?

74
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,280
It's not just you.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,920
Even Chen Jingru and Li Xianghe
wouldn't have thought

76
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,320
that Li Ziyu

77
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,360
isn't Li Qinghe's biological daughter.

78
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,880
Li Qinghe has an abnormal,

79
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,120
obsessive attachment to Li Ziyu,

80
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,560
not allowing her to be close
to any man but himself.

81
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
As Li Ziyu grew older,

82
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,040
he needed someone he could control

83
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,840
to be Li Ziyu's fiancé.

84
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,160
So,

85
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,000
he chose you.

86
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,360
Yes.

87
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,240
The moment I saw Li Ziyu,

88
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,400
I was stunned.

89
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,960
I never thought in this world,

90
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,560
there could be two people so alike.

91
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,360
At the same time, I realized

92
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,520
that every unhappy person

93
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,760
has their own misfortune.

94
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,400
I never thought

95
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,720
that after all these years,

96
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,840
we'd meet again in this way.

97
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,880
I've seen you many times.

98
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,600
Stay away from her.

99
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,760
Do you understand?

100
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,960
You worthless brat,

101
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,440
always making me angry.

102
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,600
Why don't you just die?

103
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
And you too.

104
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,120
Both of you are useless burdens.

105
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,040
I'll beat you both to death!

106
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,600
Who?

107
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,600
One day,

108
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I'll protect you
just like you protected me.

109
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,520
It's all in the past.

110
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Wu Baohui.

111
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,960
Now,

112
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,800
a new life begins.
