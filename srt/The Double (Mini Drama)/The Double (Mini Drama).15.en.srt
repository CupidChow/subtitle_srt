2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,160
Why didn't you tell me?

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,440
I can handle it myself.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
Wu Baohui!

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,200
Do you think you're very smart?

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,000
Do you have to put yourself in danger
before you'll stop?

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,240
What I gave him was a blank card.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,400
I've sorted out the conversation
and sent the recording to him.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,800
I also liked his wife's post
on Moments.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,280
He's living
off his father-in-law's support,

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,840
and he doesn't dare to act rashly.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,520
I'm not asking you about this.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,920
Then what are you asking about?

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,360
I promised you.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,480
Stay by your side.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,240
I will protect you.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,640
You never trusted me, did you?

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,080
Zhao Jize...

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,920
I...

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,480
It's not that I don't trust you.

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,280
I've just gotten used to it.

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,800
Ever since my mother passed away,

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,360
I've gotten used to relying
on myself for everything.

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,480
You've been too good to me
these past few months.

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,840
You helped me a lot.

26
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,880
Sometimes I even think

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,080
that if I leave you,
I won't be able to do anything.

28
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,720
I don't want to just depend on you.

29
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,800
I want to be someone
who can stand by your side.

30
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,120
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm just scared.

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,360
I'm afraid you'll get hurt,

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,560
even if it's just a possibility.

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,760
Wu Baohui,

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,720
I think I'm caring about you
more and more.

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,080
We've searched all over Bin City,

37
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,600
but we haven't found Chen Jingru.

38
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Then keep looking.

39
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,600
Next city, and next province...

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,760
Everywhere Chen Jingru might have gone.

41
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,320
Look everywhere for her.

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080
Mr. Zhao.

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,280
It's too late.

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,040
The suppliers and agents
have filed a joint lawsuit.

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,720
The court will accept it soon.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,440
The amount involved is huge.

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,800
We have no way out.

48
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,240
Mr. Zhao,

49
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,320
I advise you to think of yourself.

50
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
What do you mean?

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,920
The best solution is

52
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,320
to make Wu Baohui the scapegoat.

53
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
Shut up.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,480
The people causing trouble outside

55
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,600
are already at our doorstep.

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,000
As long as the problem isn't solved,

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,760
Qinghe will always be in danger.

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,680
But what has

59
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,120
Wu Baohui done wrong?

60
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,960
Her mistake was

61
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,680
becoming Li Ziyu.

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Qinghe doesn't just belong to you.

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,280
It belongs to tens of thousands
of people and families.

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
If this building collapses,

65
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,280
the consequences
will be unimaginable.

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,040
Pushing Wu Baohui out

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,640
is the only way
to protect Qinghe and you.

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,640
The temperature is just right.

69
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,080
Do you want to come down and try?

70
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,400
No need.

71
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,840
It's your rich people's heated pool.

72
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm afraid if I get used to it,

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
I won't be able to go back.

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,840
I won't go down.

75
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,200
Ah!

76
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,480
You've come down.

77
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,560
You don't have
so many concerns now, right?

78
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,200
Can you swim?

79
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,400
No.

80
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,920
I'll teach you.

81
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,920
Like this?

82
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,920
Open your arms.

83
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,370
I can't do it anymore. I'm exhausted.

84
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's go up and rest?

85
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,160
I never imagined

86
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,940
that the life of the rich
could be so wonderful.

87
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,440
Before I turned 25,

88
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,640
I never imagined this day would come.

89
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,640
Poor people always like to fantasize.

90
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,520
Haven't you ever fantasized
about being rich?

91
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,240
I have.

92
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
What did you imagine?

93
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,880
If I had one million,

94
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,800
I'd buy Baoting a lot of luxury brands.

95
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,440
That way,

96
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,280
she wouldn't be looked down upon

97
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
for wearing cheap clothes.

98
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,600
If I had ten million,

99
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,920
I'd send Baoting abroad

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,920
to the best university

101
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,960
for the best education.

102
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
If I had 100 million,

103
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,880
I'd buy Baoting the biggest,
most luxurious house,

104
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,480
and raise her like a little princess
from a fairy tale.

105
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,280
I want her to be carefree.

106
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
I never thought further than that.

107
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,200
I don't dare to.
