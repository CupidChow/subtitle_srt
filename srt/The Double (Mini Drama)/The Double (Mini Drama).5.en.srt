2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,200
What?

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,120
The real Li Ziyu is already dead?

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,800
How did she die?

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,280
How do you know she's dead?

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,120
Did the same thing happen to her?

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,800
Oh, no.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,040
Chen Jingru definitely
won't let this go.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,280
She must be plotting against me.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm in real danger now.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,360
Chen Jingru.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,480
Come out.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,200
If you've got the guts, come out.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,320
Face me head-on.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,200
We're safe for now.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,760
See?

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,440
I told you Chen Jingru
wouldn't just let it go.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,840
This is obvious.

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,880
She's trying to poison me.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,440
Oh, no.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,400
What should I do?

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,080
No, no, no.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,640
I prepared this.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,360
Oh?

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,400
Really?

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,440
It's delicious.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,880
But the pork intestines
are a little cold.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,640
It'd be better
if they were fresh off the grill.

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,880
Finish up and rest early.

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,760
You can't leave.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,960
What now?

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,400
What if they send someone

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,760
in the middle of the night
to sneak into my room

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,200
and...

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,640
They're not that dumb.

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,920
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,440
No.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
You said you'd protect me.

40
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,000
If you can't,

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,560
I'll quit.

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,880
Zhao Jize.

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,480
Are you asleep?

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,240
Yes.

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,640
That's good.

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,880
Ah!

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,520
If someone's coming for a life,

48
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,600
take his, not mine.

49
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,520
The driver responsible
for the incident is here,

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,700
willing to come forward
to testify against Li Xianghe.

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,800
Good.

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,240
Did you hear that?

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,120
It's safe now.

54
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,000
Go down and sleep.

55
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,320
What do you want then?

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,560
Just sleep like this.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Don't worry; I won't do anything to you.

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,000
Aren't you afraid
I'll do something to you?

59
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,120
Well.

60
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,880
You don't seem like a bad person.

61
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,240
You're the second person to say that.

62
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,320
Who was the first?

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,320
Li Ziyu.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,320
I've always wanted to ask you.

65
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,680
You and Li Ziyu...

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,600
Wu Baohui.

67
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
Good night.

68
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,840
The evidence is conclusive.

69
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
Li Xianghe won't be able

70
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
to turn things around this time.

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,640
We'll settle both

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,000
the old and new scores together.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,080
However,

74
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,400
there's no direct evidence
linking this to Chen Jingru.

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,160
It seems she'll make her next move.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,680
She used others to do the dirty work.

77
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,920
I didn't underestimate her after all.

78
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,560
Oh, why didn't you wake me up?

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,840
We stayed up too late yesterday.

80
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,160
I overslept.

81
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,000
You must've worn yourself out

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,600
after last night.

83
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,080
No, I'm not tired.

84
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,920
No.

85
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,880
Oh, my.

86
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,360
Should I ask the cook to stew
some sea cucumbers for you?

87
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,480
No need.

88
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,720
I wanted to ask you something.

89
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,640
Can I take two days off?

90
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,080
Wu Baohui,

91
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,160
you're not planning to run away,
are you?

92
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,560
No.

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,960
My sister's getting married
at the end of the month.

94
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,040
I want to attend her wedding.

95
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,840
Denied.

96
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,000
Why?

97
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,680
Chen Jingru won't let you go.

98
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,800
You must cut ties with everything
from your past.

99
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,280
Boss Zhao.

100
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,880
My generous, considerate,

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,000
handsome, rich,

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,440
and charming boss.

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,680
Not negotiable.

104
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,240
How about this?

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,680
Let's meet halfway.

106
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,680
I won't attend the wedding,

107
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,280
but you have to let me see my sister
before the wedding.

108
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,080
Impossible.

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,640
Just ten minutes.

110
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,640
If you can't handle it,
you'll bear the consequences.

111
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,840
Thank you, boss.

112
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,040
Baoting,

113
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
I've missed you so much.

114
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,200
Let me see.

115
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,080
How come you've lost weight again?

116
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,440
Is Bai Qian not treating you well?

117
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
No.

118
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
I've been losing weight for the wedding.

119
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
By the way, Sis,

120
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
has your friend surnamed Chen

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
contacted you again?

122
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
She?

123
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
She's such a good person,

124
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,240
asking me a lot about you.

125
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,360
She said she loved my paintings

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,760
and told me to keep working hard.

127
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,880
She has friends who run art exhibitions,

128
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,280
so they might help me set one up.

129
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
Yes.

130
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,480
She's really nice.

131
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,920
Sis,

132
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,620
when I become famous,

133
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,200
selling any painting will be enough
for us to live without worry.

134
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,840
Then you won't have to work so hard.

135
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,960
Our Baoting has really grown up.

136
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,000
You're so understanding.

137
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Of course.

138
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,440
Sis,

139
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,400
you haven't come back home in a while.

140
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
I miss you.

141
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,840
How come your work
has gotten so busy lately

142
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,560
that you don't even come home?

143
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,520
Right.

144
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,760
I recently found a new job

145
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,160
with great salary.

146
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,200
The pay is three to four times
what I used to make.

147
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,160
Really?

148
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,920
But

149
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,120
this new job is a bit special.

150
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,640
I might have to stay in another city
for a long time.

151
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,560
When are you leaving?

152
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,080
I'll be leaving soon.

153
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,560
What about my wedding?

154
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,360
Aren't you coming?

155
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,960
I might not make it.

156
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Oh.

157
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
It's okay.

158
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,800
Your career is more important.

159
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Work opportunities
don't come by every day.

160
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,680
If I can't come,

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
will you be upset?

162
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,160
No.

163
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,280
Our Baoting is so understanding.

164
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,240
Alright, enough said.

165
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,840
I have to catch my flight now.

166
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,800
Go then.

167
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,120
Don't waste time.

168
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,400
Bye.

169
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,320
Wu Baohui.

170
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,040
Long time no see.

171
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,600
Nice ring.

172
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,720
It's a bit too big.

173
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm not used to wearing it.

174
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,620
Well, you chose it after all.

175
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,600
I have things to do.
You can do as you please.

176
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,520
Hey, Wu Baohui.

177
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,920
I regret

178
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,200
breaking up with you.

179
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,080
I always feel guilty.

180
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,240
I was too weak back then.

181
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,000
That's why I let you leave.

182
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,360
But now it's different.

183
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
Wu Baohui,

184
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,640
would you give me another chance

185
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
to make up for my past mistakes?

186
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,880
How do you want to make up for it?

187
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,000
Are you going to divorce and marry me?

188
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,040
Or do you want me
to be your secret mistress?

189
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
I can give you a better life.

190
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,520
So, you're trying to make up
for it with money.

191
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,680
You could say that.

192
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,120
I've recently incurred a huge debt.

193
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
Things are financially tight.

194
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,800
Can you help me pay it off?

195
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,280
You've changed a lot.

196
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,680
I didn't expect that.

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,020
(Xiecheng Resort Hotel, Room Key)

198
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,200
Wait for me here.

199
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,240
I'll offer you a satisfactory price.

200
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,960
What do you mean?

201
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,080
Five thousand?

202
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,680
Ten thousand?

203
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
As a woman,

204
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,480
you must have a price.

205
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,480
Thanks for the invitation,

206
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,920
but we have other arrangements,

207
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,560
so we'll have to pass.

208
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,920
Hey, handsome.

209
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
This woman is disgusting.

210
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't be fooled by her.

211
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,520
She's broken off an engagement

212
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,920
and owes a large sum of money.

213
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,520
I don't care.
