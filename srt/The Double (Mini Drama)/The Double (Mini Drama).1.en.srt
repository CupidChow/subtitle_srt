00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,200
From now on,

00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,080
you are Li Ziyu.

3
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,380
(On the day of Bin City's richest man
Li Qinghe's funeral)

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,900
(Li Xianghe, younger brother
of Bin City's richest man Li Qinghe)

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,220
(Funeral)

6
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,440
Mrs. Qinghe,

7
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,520
my condolences.

8
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,660
(Chen Jingru, widow of Bin City's
richest man Li Qinghe)

9
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,840
My big brother is gone.

10
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,440
There's nothing more

11
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,240
for you in the Li family.

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,440
Take

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
this money

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,960
and find a good family

15
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,200
to live a peaceful life.

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,960
Keep the money

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
for yourself to live on.

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,160
There's no guaranteed place
for you in Qinghe Group in the future.

19
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,760
You're doing it the hard way.

20
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,000
Biao,

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,320
be gentle.

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,400
Don't disturb my brother's rest.

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,560
Yes.

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,680
Your wife has been outside for a while.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,280
When is she coming back?

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
You wretched woman.

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,280
I'll fight you!

28
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,740
(Zhao Jize, adopted son
of Bin City's richest man Li Qinghe)

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,880
I...

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
Go, go, go.

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,840
As the executor
of Chairman Li Qinghe's will,

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
I will now

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,840
announce the contents of the will.

34
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,840
I,

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,400
Li Qinghe, hereby bequeath all my assets

36
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,880
to my only daughter,

37
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,520
Li Ziyu.

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
No way.

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
My big brother must have been
confused by illness.

40
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,880
Right?

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,080
Li Ziyu?

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,040
She disappeared over ten years ago.

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,120
No one knows if she's dead or alive now.

44
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,120
Yeah.

45
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,840
How could this happen?

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,740
Li Ziyu?

47
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,000
(Li Ziyu, Li Qinghe's daughter)

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,120
Li Ziyu!

49
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,800
Li Ziyu is actually still alive!

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,550
Long time no see.

51
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,360
Mom.

52
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,600
How

53
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,360
are you still alive?

54
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,480
Uncle Xianghe,

55
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
long time no see.

56
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,080
Li Ziyu.

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,080
You...

58
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,560
You died...

59

over ten years ago.

61
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,440
Are you human,

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,600
or a ghost?

63
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,600
What are you trying to do?

64
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,480
Don't worry, Mom.

65

Maybe you should answer it.

Got it.

78
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,640
Oh, it's a work call.

79
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,600
These people can't

Hurry and blow out the candles.

82
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,800
Let me guess
what our Baoting wished for.

83
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,020
(Invitation)
Could it be this?

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,880
The Master Class of Shunyang Art Studio.

85
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
But it's very expensive.

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,320
No.

87
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,320
This is the last birthday
before you get married,

88
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,600
so of course, I'll fulfill your wish.

89
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,600
Where did you get so much money?

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
Did you borrow money again?

91
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,640
Our family...

92
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,160
It's not called borrowing.

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,600
It's called cash flow.

94
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,280
I've landed a big deal.

95
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,440
A client wanted to buy a big house

96
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,520
and asked me to handle it.

97
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,680
They've paid the deposit.

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm about to go sign the contract.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,720

104
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,680
Where's the money?

105
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,240
How dare you mess with us?

106
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,120

Hurry and pay us.

You'd better pay us today,

112
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,640
