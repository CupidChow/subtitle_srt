2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,880
Uncle Xianghe.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,080
Ms. Chen.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,720
You must honor your bet.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,280
Oh, my god.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,440
That scared me.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,280
Those two just now were looking at me
like they wanted to eat me alive.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,480
Luckily, we rehearsed
for this in advance.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,280
Oh, no.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,720
My toothbrush is missing.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,120
The hair from the bathroom floor
is gone too.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,960
We're done for.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,080
They must have taken it
to do a paternity test.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,200
What should we do?

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,440
Mr. Zhao,

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,040
I know that if the truth is out,

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,680
I'll have no reason to continue
working for you.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,000
But

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,280
could you maybe give me

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,880
a little severance pay

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,800
as a token of appreciation
for my positive

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,960
and hardworking attitude?

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,400
That day will never come.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,160
What do you mean?

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,320
What if the sample they took

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,480
was one I specially prepared?

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,680
We've already

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,480
won this game.

29
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,800
The girl on the right
is named Wu Baohui.

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,640
What's interesting is

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,720
from the moment Li Ziyu appeared,

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,280
Wu Baohui completely vanished.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,980
Hello, Baoting.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,040
Sis, where are you?

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,880
Oh.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,720
My company sent me on a business trip.

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,960
What about you?

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,520
How's your study
at Shunyang Art Studio going?

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,240
The teacher praised me today.

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,240
By the way, Sis,

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,240
someone offered a lot of money
to buy my painting today.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,000
That's amazing!

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,240
Yeah,

44
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,720
but it was one of your friends
who bought it.

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
My friend?

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
Which friend?

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,160
It's me.

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,200
Sis, when did you meet this friend?

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,080
Why haven't you mentioned her before?

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,720
We haven't known each other long,

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,520
but for some reason,
we hit it off instantly.

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,200
Maybe it's because she looks
like the daughter of a friend of mine.

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
That friend's daughter disappeared
a few years ago.

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,360
Every time I see your sister,

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,880
I can't help but think

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,280
of that missing girl.

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,880
I wonder if she's gone
through as much hardship

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,040
during all these years
away from home.

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
That's why

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,320
I truly want to help you two.

61
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
What are you trying to do?

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Long time no see.

63
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
Why don't we catch up somewhere?

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,440
When?

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,520
Right now.

66
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,470
I'm waiting for you at your place.

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,280
Are you going out?

68
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,600
No.

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,760
It's so late.

70
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,880
What's the matter?

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
You said earlier you wanted
to celebrate,

72
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,160
so I had someone
prepare some white wine.

73
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,840
No need.

74
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,960
It's too late; I want to rest early.

75
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,520
Stay home for the next few days.

76
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,170
Don't go anywhere.

77
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,320
Chen Jingru and others
won't let this go easily.

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm worried you might be in danger.

79
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
Do you understand?

80
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,120
Whatever happens,

81
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,600
remember to tell me.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,160
Zhao Jize,

83
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,200
can I trust you?

84
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,320
If you want.

85
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
How should we celebrate?

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,360
Maybe some barbecue
and crayfish tonight,

87
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,000
with a little beer.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,640
By the way, do you like pork intestines?

89
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
The kind that sizzles

90
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,480
with oil dripped on the grill.

91
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,720
Oh.

92
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,760
That'd be great.

93
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,720
Send up some night snacks.

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,560
Alright.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,520
I've had some night snacks prepared.

96
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,880
If you're hungry, we can eat together.

97
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,240
Zhao Jize,

98
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,360
