2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,880
Has your wish come true?

3
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,240
What did you just wish for?

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,120
If I say it, it won't come true.

5
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,920
Maybe some wishes

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,000
don't need heaven's help.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,060
I might be able
to make them happen for you.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,820
I've always wanted to go
to Switzerland

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,880
and see the Alps.

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,960
Don't laugh at me for saying this.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,280
I've never been abroad.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,000
Forget it.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,320
Seeing snow here
already makes me very happy.

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,200
What about you?

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,640
Do you have any wishes?

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,800
I never make wishes.

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,720
Make one on your birthday.

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,240
Birthday wishes often come true.

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,200
I'll take you to the rooftop
of my house.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,300
The breeze is lovely there,

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,600
and the night view is beautiful.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,160
You'll definitely like it.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,400
Alright.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,680
Make sure she signs it.

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,760
And let her

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,600
drink this.

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,200
It'll be all over.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,520
We've come a long way to get here.

29
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,400
Now,

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
there's no turning back.

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,360
You're still awake?

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,640
Yes.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm just thinking

34
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,160
how much longer
we can keep going like this.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,880
Not much longer.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,480
What's this?

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,120
Some Qinghe business paperwork.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,360
It needs your signature.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,080
Why is it all in English?

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
A calming tea.

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,680
It'll help you sleep.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,120
Wait.

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,800
What's wrong?

44
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,800
Aren't you afraid I'll poison you?

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
I trust you.

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
I trust you completely.

47
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,760
Get some rest.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,080
Wu Baohui.

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Sis, the meal is ready.

50
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Why am I here?

51
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,440
This is your house;
of course, you're here.

52
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
Why are you back?

53
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,600
What do you mean?

54
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,940
Aren't you married now?

55
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,480
Yet you still come back
every few days.

56
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,840
Is Bai Qian okay with this?

57
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,600
No fever.

58
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,320
The wedding's next month.

59
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,840
Next month?

60
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,200
I've booked a fitting for the dress.
I have to go.

61
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,440
Drink the soup while it's hot.

62
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,660
(Your salary: 3,000 yuan.
Account balance: 3,002.3 yuan.)

63
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,360
How could this be?

64
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Who are you?

65
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
I'm looking for someone.

66
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,800
- Who?
- Li Ziyu.

67
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Li Ziyu?

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Never heard of her.

69
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,860
She's a woman in her twenties

70
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,000
who looks a lot like me.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
She's not here. Don't wander around.

72
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,120
Get out.

73
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,840
Please.

74
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,360
She really looks just like me.

75
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,680
Please check again.

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,240
This is very important to me.

77
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,560
- Stop!
- Let me in!

78
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm looking for Zhao Jize.

79
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,040
Without an appointment, you can't enter.

80
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,720
I'm Li Ziyu!

81
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,880
Look carefully.

82
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm Li Ziyu, Chairwoman of Qinghe Group.

83
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,120
If you're Li Ziyu,

84
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,440
then I'm Li Qinghe!

85
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,600
Let me in.

86
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,360
Please, I'm begging you.

87
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,920
Just let me in.

88
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,640
I've seen plenty of people like you.

89
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,360
Go away. Stop causing trouble here.

90
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,400
Zhao Jize!

91
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
Is she alright?

92
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,880
She's doing well.

93
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,080
That's good to hear.

94
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,000
I haven't touched any
of the money inside.

95
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,920
I'm returning it to you now.

96
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,240
This is the compensation
your sister deserves.

97
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,040
Take it.

98
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,120
You'll need money for many things.

99
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,600
She's always been

100
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,560
taking care of me since we were little.

101
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm so used to her kindness towards me,

102
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,120
even though she's only two years older.

103
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
From now on,

104
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll look after her in my own way.

105
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,520
My husband and I are planning
to return to Wen City,

106
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
and we'll take my sister with us.

107
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
That's good to hear.

108
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,760
I'll keep the card.

109
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,080
Take this.

110
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,840
What's this?

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
It's the key to your family's old house.

112
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,280
Didn't my dad sell it?

113
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,040
How could it...?

114
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,800
Since you're going back to live there,

115
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,920
you'll need a home.

116
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,440
Don't get the wrong idea.

117
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,920
Just think of it

118
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
as your sister's salary.

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,560
She's helped me a lot.

120
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,800
Alright.

121
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,200
Mr. Zhao,

122
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
in the future,

123
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,400
take care of yourself.

124
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,620
Let's take a photo together.

125
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
Come on, smile.

126
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,320
It's so delicious.

127
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,320
When I had money,

128
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,600
I'd buy ten-yuan ice cream

129
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,200
and a thousand-yuan winter coat.

130
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,480
Wu Baohui,

131
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
be happy.
