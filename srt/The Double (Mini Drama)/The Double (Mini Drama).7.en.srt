2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,520
Now, let's have the bride
and groom exchange rings.

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,640
Baoting.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,720
The bride is too nervous.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,080
She forgot the process.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,120
Baoting.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,800
Sis.

8
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,120
Our Baoting

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,880
is really beautiful.

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,960
Sis.

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,800
I almost thought you wouldn't come.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,160
I almost thought you didn't
care about me anymore.

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,080
How could I not care about you?

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,560
Today is the most important day
in our Baoting's life.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,120
Of course, I'd come.

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,080
How did this unreliable sister show up?

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,040
Exactly.

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,760
She borrowed a lot of money

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,920
and almost made her sister
unable to get married.

20
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,880
The bride can't be angry.

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,720
If you're angry, you won't look pretty.

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,520
Go now.

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,560
The groom is waiting for you.

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,240
How shameless.

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,600
She got dumped

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,160
and is trying
to ruin her sister's wedding.

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
Marrying one of them

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,560
must be bad luck from eight generations.

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,480
Mr. Zhao of Qinghe Group.

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,520
Oh, my god.

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,880
How could Mr. Zhao attend this wedding?

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,040
Wow.

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,800
It seems the bride and groom
have great connections.

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,400
They actually invited Mr. Zhao Jize,
CEO of Qinghe Group,

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,960
to the wedding.

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,440
Let's welcome Mr. Zhao
to the stage for a speech.

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,760
Why did such an important guest
come to our wedding?

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,260
I don't know either.

39
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,920
He seems to be a friend of my sister's.

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,240
How could your sister have
friends from such high circles?

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
Today, at the invitation

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,480
of my good friend Ms. Wu Baohui,

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,720
I'm honored to attend
her sister's wedding.

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,840
I have had no interaction

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,560
with Ms. Wu Baoting.

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,680
We don't know each other.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,360
But I do have a deep connection
with her sister,

48
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,520
Ms. Wu Baohui.

49
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,880
So,

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,400
I'll start by talking about her sister.

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
At first,

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,880
like everyone else,

53
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,320
I stubbornly thought she was unreliable

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,800
and irresponsible.

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
I thought she was a good-for-nothing.

56
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,840
But as time went on,

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,880
I realized she was very special.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,480
She loves life

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,800
and is full of vitality.

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,520
She always faces the world
with optimism and positivity.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,640
She's generous,

62
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,640
always going out of her way
to be good to others,

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,200
thinking of herself last.

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,920
She's very smart

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,640
and has her own principles
for dealing with life,

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,600
continuously influencing me.

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,120
She's a work partner I trust

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,400
and someone I truly admire.

69
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,040
So,

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
I started wanting
to know more about her.

71
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,440
And from her,

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,520
I learned about her sister.

73
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,520
Her sister likes to eat strawberry cones

74
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,560
but doesn't like the crispy shell.

75
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,240
She likes to eat meat

76
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,000
but doesn't like soup.

77
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,360
She loves to eat meat,

78
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,440
doesn't like soup,

79
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,720
loves to draw,

80
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,640
and is afraid of the cold.

81
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,800
I hope you'll remember all this,

82
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,560
and just like her sister,

83
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,320
go all out to be good to her,

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,520
love her,

85
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,800
and tolerate her.

86
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,600
Finally,

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,640
I want to say something to the bride,
Ms. Wu Baoting.

88
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,040
Remember

89
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,280
that your sister

90
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,640
cares about you

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,920
far more than you think.

92
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,600
Sis.

93
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,000
If you're unhappy with your work,

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
come back anytime.

95
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,840
I have money now.

96
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,440
It's my turn to support you.

97
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,960
Okay.

98
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,520
(In the book it says)

99
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,920
(growth happens in an instant.)

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,640
(I used to not believe it,)

101
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,400
(but now I'm willing to.)

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,120
(Because at this moment,)

103
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
(I clearly realize)

104
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,040
(I'm no longer the humble Wu Baohui
I once was.)

105
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,800
(I)

106
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,440
(am Li Ziyu.)

107
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,280
Just now, my friend

108
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
was attending a wedding banquet
at a hotel under our group

109
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,280
and took a picture.

110
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,120
I think it came out quite interesting.

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,960
Do you guys want to take a look?

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,960
You go upstairs first.

113
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,000
I never expected Miss Ziyu
who grew up in Singapore

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,720
to have such a wide network.

115
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,560
As the hotel manager,
is it wrong for Miss Ziyu

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,640
to send her blessings

117
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,120
to the newlyweds?

118
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,480
It's not for me to decide.

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,480
The answer will come.

120
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,000
You go upstairs first.

121
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,760
I'll handle this.

122
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
Go ahead.

123
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,560
Name your terms.

124
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,240
It's simple.

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,120
Have her admit at the board meeting

126
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,160
that she's the fake Li Ziyu.

127
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Alright.

128
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,680
Then I suppose I should also reveal

129
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,040
at the board meeting

130
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,120
how the real Li Ziyu died.

131
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,320
Li Ziyu

132
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
is dead?

133
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,600
Ms. Chen, you must have a poor memory.

134
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,440
What a coincidence.

135
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,160
My relatives back home

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,760
happen to know the driver
responsible for the accident.

137
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,440
When the time comes, Ms. Chen,

138
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
I'm afraid being removed from the board
will be the least of your worries.

139
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
The tea is finished.

140
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,720
I have matters to attend to.

141
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,840
Feel free to stay, Ms. Chen.

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,720
I dared to deal with Li Ziyu.

143
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,880
Aren't you afraid
I'll do something to her?

144
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,040
Before,
out of respect for my foster father,

145
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,600
I never acted against you.

146
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,000
But if you keep testing my limits

147
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,840
and being ungrateful,

148
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,360
then Li Xianghe's yesterday

149
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
will be your tomorrow.

150
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,520
Mr. Zhao, that's too risky.

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,400
How's it going?

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,940
All the photos and videos
have been dealt with.

153
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,840
But there were
a lot of people at the wedding.

154
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,640
Got it.

155
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Are you mistaking her for Miss Ziyu?

156
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,640
Sorry, I spoke out of turn.

157
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,520
From beginning to end,

158
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,320
she's Wu Baohui.

159
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,480
If she becomes your weakness,

160
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,280
it won't be good

161
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,760
for either of you.

162
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,440
Still awake?

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,600
Yes.

164
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,160
Were you waiting for me?

165
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,600
The decision was mine.

167
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,140
You don't need to feel guilty.

168
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
It's late.

169
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,680
