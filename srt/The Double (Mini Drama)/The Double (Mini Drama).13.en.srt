2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
It's all in the past.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,120
Wu Baohui.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,440
Now,

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,200
a new life begins.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
Welcome back home, Miss Li.

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
Mr. Zhao, the company is in trouble.

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,440
All the money in the company's accounts
has been transferred.

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,140
The finance manager
has also disappeared.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,500
He works for Chen Jingru.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,760
The suppliers delivered the goods
but haven't been paid.

12
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,680
The agents paid
but haven't received the goods.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,960
Now, they're causing a scene
outside the company.

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,980
Pay back the money!

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,340
(Pay back my hard-earned money!)

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,000
(Paying debts is the right thing to do!)

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,400
Protect her.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Don't worry.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
I'll handle it.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,960
Pay back the money!

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,920
The car is here.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,740
Pay back the money!

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,040
Pay back our hard-earned money!

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,160
Pay back the money!

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,080
Zhao Jize, pay back the money!

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,160
Open the door!

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,220
Mr. Zhao,

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,880
those troublemakers are very agitated.

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,080
You can't get out of the car.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,880
I said, open the door!

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,800
(Paying debts is the right thing to do!)
Pay back the money!

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,760
Pay back the money!

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,450
Don't let him run!

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,280
It's her.

35
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,500
Don't let him run!

36
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,840
Pay back the money!

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,010
Pay back our hard-earned money,
Zhao Jize!

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
Everyone, listen to me!

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
I hear your concerns.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,680
Please give me some time to confirm it.

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
If it's true,

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,080
Qinghe Group won't withhold

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,320
a single cent from you.

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,280
Another empty promise!

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
Chen Jingru has been talking
to us several times

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,520
but has been stalling for a whole year.

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,200
There's still no answer.

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
How can we trust you?

49
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,600
- Yeah, how can we trust you?
- Right!

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,120
Chen Jingru has been fired by the board.

51
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,440
From now on,

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
I will handle the payments.

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,520
Please trust me.

54
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,360
Who knows?

55
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,230
I think they're just
trying to avoid paying.

56
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,870
Someone's dead!

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,590
Someone's dead!

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,480
It's been so long,

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
and Mr. Zhao hasn't come up yet.

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,720
Is something wrong?

61
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,160
Mr. Zhao!

62
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,080
What happened to you?

63
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,660
Just some external injuries.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
Get some gauze and alcohol.

65
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
Okay.

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,040
Is this what you meant?

67
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
You said you could handle it.

68
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,840
Go look by the window.

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
The troublemakers

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,720
have left, right?

71
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,640
Are these

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,400
tears of joy?

73
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,880
Why are you crying again?

74
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,640
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

75
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,960
Alright.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,960
Stop crying.

77
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,440
It won't happen again.

78
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Mr. Zhao,

79
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,240
the gauze and alcohol.

80
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,160
I'll help you treat the wound.

81
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,960
I'll take care of it.

82
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,320
You go.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,280
Tian was too rough.

84
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,240
Has the total been counted?

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,320
How much in total?

86
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,320
All the cash flow
from the accounts is gone.

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,000
What about Chen Jingru?

88
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,400
Any news on her?

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
Nothing yet.

90
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,340
Then why are you still standing here?

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Me?

92
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,200
Go check her ticket records.

93
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,680
Well.

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,080
No need for me to help with the wound?

95
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,120
No.

96
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,320
I'll handle the wound first.

97
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,720
Don't let it get infected.

98
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,120
Sure.

99
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,640
Does it hurt?

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,880
No.

101
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,760
Then I'll be gentler.

102
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,720
It's fine.

103
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,520
It doesn't hurt.

104
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,640
I'll throw this away.

105
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,920
Sure.

106
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,120
Long time no see.

107
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's talk.

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
Who are you?

109
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,720
It's you, right?

110
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,880
Wu Baohui.

111
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

112
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,760
Wu Baohui.

113
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,840
You can fool others,

114
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
but not me.

115
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,360
What do you want?

116
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Money.

117
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,560
I want money.

118
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,440
How about one million?

119
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,960
You're crazy.

120
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,880
This little thing

121
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,400
should be easy for you, right?

122
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,520
Give me some time.

123
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,640
Two weeks.

124
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
I'll wait for your news.

125
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,060
(Two weeks later)

126
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,780
Do you have something on your mind?

127
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,720
I was just lost in thought.

128
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,120
You don't need to worry
about the company.

129
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,280
I'll handle them as soon as possible.

130
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,960
