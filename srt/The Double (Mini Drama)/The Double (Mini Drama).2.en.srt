2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,000
Qinghe Group

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,880
is made up of Qinghe Hotel,

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,680
Qinghe Properties,

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,560
and Qinghe Winery.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,640
Among them,

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,240
Qinghe Hotel is the most powerful,

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,480
with over 600 hotels around the world.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,960
In other words,

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,720
securing the management rights
of Qinghe Hotel

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,280
means controlling
the entire Qinghe Group.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,920
Do you have

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,680
any questions about Qinghe?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,960
Yes, yes.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,600
Last night, you said

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,560
you'd let me live the life of my dreams.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,400
Is that true?

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,960
Does that mean I can
make any request I want?

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,760
Go ahead.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,760
I want a monthly salary

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,800
of 10,000 yuan.

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,640
I want bonuses, commissions,

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,120
social security, and housing funds.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,080
The salary should be paid
no later than the 15th.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,000
It can't be delayed
until the end of the month.

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,240
Also,

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,120
I won't accept

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,240
an 80% trial period salary.

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,800
If there are no objections,

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,840
let's look forward
to a pleasant cooperation.

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Mr. Zhao,

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,120
can I have this?

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,520
This way, please.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,940
- Mr. Zhao, it's done.
- Mr. Zhao, it's done.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,560
How do I look?

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,840
Go there.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,920
Sit down.

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,960
It doesn't suit you.

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,880
This looks more like her.

40
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,840
From now on,

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,520
you are Li Ziyu.

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,200
That's impossible.

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,200
Li Ziyu is already...

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,920
How could she still be alive?

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
We'll find out if she's Li Ziyu

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,000
at the board meeting.

47
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,530
It is reported

48
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,100
that the third board meeting
of Qinghe Group will be held today.

49
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,020
The originally undisputed line
of succession was suddenly overturned.

50
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,360
What will Li Ziyu's

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,720
unexpected appearance
bring to Qinghe Group?

52
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,520
Is this the chairman's daughter
who disappeared years ago?

53
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,940
(General Meeting of Shareholders)

54
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,600
This is expensive.

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,880
(I've got to find a way
to eat more later.)

56
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
(Otherwise, it'd be a huge loss.)

57
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
Now, I'll make the announcement.

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
After a unanimous vote by the board,

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,920
Ms. Li Ziyu is appointed
the new chairman of Qinghe Group.

60
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,480
The board meeting was moved up?

61
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,360
Why wasn't I informed?

62
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,520
According to the chairman's will,

63
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,200
Li Ziyu's appointment
as the new chairman is final.

64
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Ms. Chen, you're busy every day,

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
so we didn't bother you to come.

66
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,640
Are you worried about bothering me

67
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,920
or worried that this fake lady
will be exposed?

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,000
She's an impostor
pretending to be Li Ziyu.

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,360
Ms. Chen,

70
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,760
you can't make jokes like that.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,880
Exactly.

72
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,020
If you're going to say that,

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,600
you'd better have evidence.

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,120
Here's the evidence.

75
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,460
(Qinghe Group General Meeting
of Shareholders)

76
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,240
Hello, everyone.

77
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,960
I am Chen Jingru, Li Qinghe's widow.

78
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,840
Over ten years ago,

79
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,800
Li Ziyu mysteriously disappeared.

80
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,920
The late chairman searched the world

81
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,200
but never found any trace of her.

82
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,960
And now,
as the chairman has passed away,

83
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,360
this lady claiming to be Li Ziyu

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,440
suddenly returned.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,320
I am deeply suspicious of this.

86
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,030
In my hand is a paternity test report
I just obtained.

87
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,000
It has not been opened yet.

88
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,120
I will open it

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,800
in front of everyone.

90
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,140
(Sealed)

91
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,680
Wait a minute.

92
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,280
Ms. Chen,

93
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,880
since you haven't opened the report,

94
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,360
how can you be sure

95
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,040
that Ms. Li Ziyu

96
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,400
is not the chairman's
biological daughter?

97
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,040
I have my opinion.

98
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,840
Then I should also share my opinion.

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,960
The late chairman always felt guilty
toward Miss Ziyu,

100
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,680
which is why he wrote this will.

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
But you're doing this today.

102
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,960
Do you want to humiliate the chairman
in front of everyone?

103
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,080
Exactly.

104
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,520
The dead should be respected.

105
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,360
This is too embarrassing.

106
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,640
Besides,

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Miss Ziyu has been missing
for many years.

108
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,480
If the result shows she is indeed
the chairman's biological daughter,

109
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,160
wouldn't that break her heart

110
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,720
and the chairman's too?

111
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,880
That's right.

112
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
It'd be heartbreaking.

113
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,000
Fine.

114
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,000
If that's the case,

115
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,320
Mr. Zhao, do you dare to make a bet

116
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,680
with me in front of everyone?

117
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,200
If the report shows
she is the biological daughter,

118
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,640
I will voluntarily
withdraw from the board.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,200
If not,

120
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
will you do the same?

121
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,960
Mr. Zhao,

122
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,960
you seem a bit hesitant.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll raise the stakes.

124
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,920
If this report shows

125
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,000
she's the biological daughter,

126
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,440
then I will also

127
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,320
withdraw from the board.

128
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,240
Mr. Zhao,

129
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,480
do you think

130
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm being sincere?

131
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Right?

132
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,000
A bet's a bet.

133
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,320
What's going on?

134
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,560
She's real.

135
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,320
She really is the biological daughter.

136
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,720
(Confirmed as biological)
It seems

137
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,820
they'll have to step down
from the board.

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,280
How could this happen?

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
Mom,

140
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,320
why don't you believe

141
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,040
I'm your daughter?
