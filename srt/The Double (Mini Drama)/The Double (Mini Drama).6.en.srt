Thank you.

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,960
I feel much better now.

6
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,880
Good.

7
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,120
How's the preparation
for your sister's wedding going?

8
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,720
Has the venue been decided?

9
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,160
If not,

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
I can arrange it.

11
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,400
Wow.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
This is so beautiful.

13
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,640
How much does this cost?

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,000
Fill in the contact number.

15
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,000
Get in touch with this guest.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,840
We'd like to sponsor her wedding.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,680
Okay.

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760
Wait a moment.

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,640
Come up with a convincing reason.

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,760
Sure.

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,560
Sis, you know what?

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Just now,
a high-end hotel held a lottery,

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
and I won the special prize.

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,180
The wedding banquet is completely free.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,040
Sis,

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,160
I'm really so happy now.

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,040
My sister has received the surprise.

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,200
Thank you so much.

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,920
I've cleared the debts you owed before.

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
As for this money,

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,440
consider it as a dowry for your sister.

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,640
Zhao Jize,

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,520
there's one question

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,160
I've always wanted to ask you.

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,880
Are you so good to me

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,120
because of Li Ziyu?

38
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,240
Well,

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,440
I know that.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,080
Still, thank you.

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,200
No.

42
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,680
You've helped me a lot,

43
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,240
and you deserve it.

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,840
To me,

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,160
you're not a double for anyone.

46
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,840
If you need,

47
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,840
I can have someone anonymously
transfer the money to your sister.

48
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,840
But with this large amount
suddenly in her account,

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,120
how would she dare to use it?

50
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
Do you have any other methods?

51
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,540

Please play responsibly

54
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680

look at this one.

57
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,920
Here.

58
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,640
You won the grand prize.

59
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,880
How much?

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,000
A full 800,000!

61
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,720
- How much?
- 800,000!

62
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,360
Oh, my god, sir.

63
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,120
I told you my ten years of buying
lottery tickets weren't in vain.

64
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,960
You're so lucky!

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,640
- Let me see.
- What?

66
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,360
I'll buy your ticket
for double the price.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
How about it?

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,480
What? Dude, are you joking?

69
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,280
How could you do something so stupid?

70
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Tell me the number.

71
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,320
It's done.

72
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,600
Here you go; you gave me voluntarily.

73
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Sir,

74
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,640
you know this young lady, right?

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,200
She comes every afternoon.

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,240
Give her the ticket later.

77
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,680
Do you two come here often?

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,360
The poor always

79
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
need something to look forward to.

80
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,800
Sir, please check if I've won.

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,640
Got it.

82
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Miss, you've won the prize!

83
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,320
- How much?
- 800,000!

84
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,080
Really.

85
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,720
800,000!

86
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,320
(Hopefully, with this money,)

87
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,040
(you can be happy.)

88
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,640
Why are there so few people here?

89
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,120
Yeah.

90
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,960
I heard the bride has a sister.

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,920
Why isn't she here today?

92
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,440
Her sister

93
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,480
is known for being unreliable.

94
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,880
Not long ago, she owed
a huge amount of money,

95
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,920
making the family a mess.

96
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,360
It's better

97
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,000
that she's not here.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,760
Even if she came, it'd be embarrassing.

99
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,080
I'll have the hotel staff make a video
of the wedding and send it to you.

100
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,520
Okay.

101
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,280
You care so much about your sister?

102
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,480
It's more than just care.

103
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,280
As long as she's happy,

104
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,680
it's more important than my life.

105
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,520
Our Baoting

106
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,680
has been sensible since she was young.

107
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,600
She never says

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,160
what she likes or dislikes.

109
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,440
But who am I?

110
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,400
I know her so well.

111
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,720
She's loved strawberry cones
since she was little,

112
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,720
but she never liked the crispy shells.

113
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,280
So, I told her,

114
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,000
"I like the crispy shells the most."

115
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,240
She likes meat,

116
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,080
but she doesn't like soup.

117
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,320
So, I always drank the soup.

118
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,440
She loves to draw,

119
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,280
so I worked as a cleaner
in the art studio,

120
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,720
doing the hardest jobs

121
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,080
for the least money,

122
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
begging the director
to give her a chance.

123
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,860
She's afraid of the cold,

124
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
so I always took a bath first,

125
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,240
just to make sure the water

126
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,200
would be warmer for her.

127
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
I'd rather go broke borrowing money
at high interest

128
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,880
just to give her some dowry

129
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,600
before she gets married

130
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,400
so her in-laws won't look down on her.

131
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
I don't want to hear people say,

132
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,360
"Wu Baoting"

133
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,080
"is great"

134
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,320
"but has an unreliable sister."

135
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,920
As a sister,

136
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,400
I want to be reliable once.

137
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,080
Wanna make a bet?

138
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
To leave yourself some hope.

139
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
If you win,

140
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,200
I'll take you to the wedding.

141
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,840
I've never been lucky.

142
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,880
How do you know if you don't try?

143
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Miss Wu,

144
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,000
today, you're very lucky.
