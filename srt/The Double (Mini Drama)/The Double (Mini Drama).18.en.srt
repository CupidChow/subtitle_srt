2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,720
Mr. Zhao.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,520
Long time no see.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,320
We understand how you feel,

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,440
but now that Li Ziyu is dead,

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,680
how will Qinghe Group pay the money

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,520
it owes us?

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,880
I will take on all the responsibility.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,960
Take on responsibility?

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,400
How will you do that?

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,480
Zhao Jize,

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,720
you really think too highly of yourself.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,120
What are you?

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,800
You're just a dog of the Li family.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,480
Hey!

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,840
Don't go too far.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,280
Even a dog will jump over the wall
when it's desperate.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,840
Qinghe Group hasn't fallen yet.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,240
You're being so eager to kick us
while we're down.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,640
Li Ziyu.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,080
Why isn't she dead?

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,040
Li Ziyu.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,200
Don't come any closer!

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,460
Wasn't it supposed
to be my responsibility?

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,680
Now what?

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,280
No need for me to take responsibility?

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,800
No need now.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,080
Tell me.

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,840
How should I take responsibility?

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,760
Li Ziyu,

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,120
are you a human or a ghost?

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,280
What do you think?

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,800
I was wrong.

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,280
May your spirit

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,160
rest in peace.

36
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,820
Please don't come looking for me
at night.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,120
Qinghe Group's poor internal management

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,520
has caused losses for everyone.

39
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,560
I am deeply sorry for that.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,240
I have the solution
to this issue in my hands.

41
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,640
For those willing to help Qinghe
weather this crisis,

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,120
from today onward,

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,400
I will prioritize paying 10% upfront,

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,120
with the remaining amount
paid in installments,

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,200
and the highest interest rates applied.

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,120
How does that sound?

47
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,720
After all, we won't be getting
the money anytime soon.

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,640
Better to get something than nothing.

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,240
Alright, I accept.

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,240
I accept too.

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,280
Count me in.

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,360
Well, count me in too.

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
Those who accept the plan,

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,320
please follow me.

55
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Fine.

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
What?

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,680
You can't handle
the civilian life anymore?

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,360
Can't wait to return
and act like the fake rich lady?

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,120
How did you know it was me?

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,880
I thought I was well disguised.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
So,

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,760
do I now have the air of a rich lady?

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,920
Sure.

64
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,880
Undoubtedly.

65
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,560
Of course.

66
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,020
(Yixiang)

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,880
Tell me.

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
Where did this money come from?

69
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,920
Li Ziyu's overseas assets.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,320
It's you.

71
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,760
Where is Zhao Jize?

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,760
Mr. Zhao doesn't know I'm here.

73
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,360
That's just the kind of person he is.

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
He's so arrogantly confident,

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,040
always thinking he can solve everything.

76
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,280
How is it here?

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,160
Very beautiful.

78
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,240
What's wrong?

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,440
This is a seven-star hotel

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,800
next to Switzerland's Alps,

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,840
which was

82
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
secretly purchased a few years ago

83
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
by a Chinese guest.

84
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,760
That guest

85
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,880
was Li Ziyu.

86
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,440
This is the car Li Ziyu drove
in Switzerland.

87
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,760
These are her servants.

88
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
A week ago,

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,600
Li Ziyu sold all her overseas assets,

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
hoping to save Qinghe from the crisis.

91
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,760
She couldn't come forward,

92
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,500
so she asked me to ask you for help.

93
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,800
Three billion

94
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
is not enough to solve Qinghe's crisis,

95
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,800
but it will give Zhao
a chance to breathe.

96
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
Now,

97
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,200
only you can save him.

98
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,360
Why didn't you tell me?

99
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,200
It's too dangerous.

100
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,200
It could implicate you.

101
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,040
What if I hadn't returned?

102
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,840
Do you really plan
to take the consequences on your own?

103
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,600
Someone as smart as me

104
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,240
would never suffer.

105
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,680
Cut it out.

106
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
I know about Qinghe's situation.

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,240
I've been with Qinghe
for over ten years.

108
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,240
I can't leave here.

109
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,960
But have you

110
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
really thought this through?

111
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,560
Qinghe's crisis

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,200
won't be solved overnight.

113
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,040
I've thought it through.

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
You know me.

115
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm always bold
when it comes to investing.

116
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,000
Wu Baohui,

117
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,880
not every investment
goes the way you want.

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
Haven't you considered

119
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,560
what if we lose?

120
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,480
I trust you.

121
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,840
Even if we lose,

122
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,240
I'll accept it willingly.
