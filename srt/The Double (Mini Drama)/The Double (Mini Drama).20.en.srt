00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,000
She's gone.

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,520
Do you think

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,680
Li Ziyu will come back again?

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,880
Maybe.

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,000
There are fireworks.

8
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,040
Li Qinghe is dead.

9
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
The autopsy report
from the police is out.

10
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,760
He died from a sudden heart attack.

11
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,600
What happened?

12
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
Right.

13
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,840
This is what my daughter would do.

14
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,520
Why?

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,360
Why are you treating me like this?

16
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
I guess

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,440
this is karma.

Birthday wishes often come true.

23
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,200
(I hope we'll no longer be poor)

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,640

30
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,640
(spending her 26th birthday for her.)

31
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,940

Once,

38
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,560
I experienced
the troubles of poverty.

39
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,800
(Li Ziyu: Miss Li, I love you)
I know what despair feels like.

40

Today,

41
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,440
I want to use my small power

42
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,960
to establish the Dream Angel Fund

43
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,490
and help your dreams.

44
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,140

Li Ziyu's life was wonderful,

59
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
but I think

60
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,440
Wu Baohui's life suits me more.

61

Alright.

62

(This time has made me realize)

63
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,280
(wealth without hard work
is full of dangers.)

64

to say goodbye to Li Ziyu's identity,)

(voluntarily turn myself in,)

(and admit my mistakes.)

67
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,500

of fraud.)

and fined.)

(Five years later)

72
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,080
It feels so comfortable.

73
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,000
