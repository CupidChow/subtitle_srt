00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,015
BECAUSE THEY'RE SOAKED IN BLOOD.

[Takahiro] Isn't this our school's chapel?

197
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,554
[Rie] Wait, is that a coffin?

198

-Was this always here?
-[Shota] I knew it.

199
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,267
It was that girl I saw.

[Shota] The ones that are chosen have to

335
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,650
find the victim's hidden,
dismembered body parts.

336
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,110

starts exactly at midnight."

That's the thing we saw last night.

342
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,003
Okay, so why is today
a repeat of yesterday?

343
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:52,425
Until the Body Search is complete,
this is our only day.

344
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,681
You mean we'll just repeat
today over and over?

345
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:02,727
[Shota] Yes. At least until
we find all the hidden body parts.

346
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,655
Huh? What's with him? So creepy.

347
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,491
Who is he? That man.

348
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:22,581

His name's Mr. Yashiro, I think.

Mm-hmm. Sorry, let's do it tomorrow.

352

[Hina] That sounds good.
Everyone, an update.

Hmm? I just had a hunch, you know.

00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,587
[Shota] I'm guessing we're supposed
to put the body parts we find in here…

380
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,591
[Rie] But if that thing finds us again…

Why'd you turn the lights on?

395
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,184
It's a lot easier
than searching in the dark.

396
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,561
But the Red Person's gonna find us.

he was a star athlete.

[Shota] Yeah. I was looking
for information on the Body Search

579

when I discovered a connection
to a real-life murder case.

[Takahiro] And Shota printed copies
for all of us.

Thirty years ago, somebody was murdered
and dismembered right near our campus.

-[Shota and Rumiko] What?

Are you serious?
You never told us about that, Asuka!

an amusement park with her family--

00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,229
Is this…

608
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,442

609
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,693
Ah, no.

Assuming all the body parts are on campus,

618
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,016
we stand the best chance of finding them
if we work as a team.

619

Everyone, grab a pen, and mark
the places you've already searched.

620

Going off our experience thus far,

I think the Red Person
is drawn to our position

<i>Beyond that, if we strategically turn</i>
<i>on the lights all around the school,</i>

635
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,947
<i>I think the Red Person</i>
<i>will be lured to those spots.</i>

01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,668
I can't find the cat.

-[brakes squeal]
-[cat yowls]

888
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,801
-[girl 1] Was that a cat?
-[boy] You see that?

889
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:55,970
-[Asuka] Huh?
-[girl 2] Oh my God.

890
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,556
-I'd chase him down.
-[laughing]

891
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,891
-That's so you.
-What do you think it means?

892
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:03,728
-[Yuzuki] It means she hates rejection…
-She isn't here!

What's Sawada doing?

897
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:20,536
Hey, why are you doing Rie's job?
The class president should be doing that.

898
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,621
-What?
-Rie? Who's that?

899
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,789
What?

900
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:26,709
Hey, has anyone seen Rie today?

901
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,420
[all murmuring confusion]

902
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:43,517
Atsushi?

903
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,729
[Atsushi] Hey!
What the hell do you mean, Rie's gone?

904
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:49,648
We don't know!
But today's all different for some reason.

905
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,152
[Asuka] Last night, Rie…

906
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,570
[Takahiro] What happened?

907
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:59,492
-Rie got eaten by Emily.
-[gasps]

908
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,036
What does that mean?

909
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:07,249
It means if the monster eats you, your
whole existence gets completely erased!

910
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,710
Are you kidding me? What do we do?

911
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,213
We can't do shit.
It's gonna be dark soon.

912
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:15,174
-But if we all get eaten, then we…
-[Rumiko] Enough!

913
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,677
We'll all be erased
before we find that head.

914
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,888
There's no way out!

915
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:41,826
[Asuka] Is that plastic bag…

916
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:50,126
[Mr. Yashiro] It was run over
in front of the school.

917
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,591
Mr. Yashiro, do you know
what the Body Search is?

918
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,094
What?

919
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:02,596
[suspenseful music playing]

920
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,058
I don't know what you're talking about.

921
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,479
Whenever we got together to do research
on the Body Search,

922
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,231
you were always watching us.

923
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:24,451
Look!

924
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,039
[wind whistling]

925
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:40,217
I knew exactly when this pot would fall,
to the second.

926
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,805
Please, tell me what you know
about the Body Search.

927
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,314
[Mr. Yashiro] I think
I was a senior in high school

928
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:55,524
when I was dragged into my Body Search.

929
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,235
What do you mean, "think"?

930
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,157
I'd forgotten it.

931
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,242
What?

932
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,786
[Mr. Yashiro] Until I found this book.

933
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:12,041
I kept thinking…

934
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:17,379
that I had great friends
I spent my high school years with.

937
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,474
That's her name…

938
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:37,483
We were in different classes,
we never even spoke to each other.

And yet…

941
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,407
I'm sure she meant everything to me.

942
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,414
At least, I think so.

943
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:02,132
Today, I can't remember how I really felt.

944
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,973
Once the Body Search is over,

945
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,601
your memories of it go away.

946
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,062
So, then,

947
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:19,692
all of your friends that you did
the Body Search with, they were…

948
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:22,111
Forgotten.

951

[Rumiko] Why has the Red Person
become that monster?

952
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:43,132
[Shota] Maybe we, like, woke the doll up
or something when we were in the house.

953
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,636
[Takahiro] We need to figure out
a way to avoid the monster

954
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,054
and find the missing head.

955
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,850
Damn it, where the hell is it?

956
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:57,896
[Shota] I know. I'm pretty sure
we've searched every inch of the school

957
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,606

[Asuka] Hmm?

971
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,781
When I got scouted…

972
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,120
I told Keiwa High
I wasn't interested in going pro.

Truth is…

974
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,462
when things got serious,
I got scared that I'd fail.

That's who I am.

No more.

I swear I'll protect you.

I've got your back.

Once the Body Search is over,

984
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,557
we can finally see tomorrow.

985
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:04,041
If tomorrow does come…

986
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,214
I'll disappear again.

987
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,761
I'll be invisible to everyone.

988
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,349

01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:23,894

and you really do disappear tomorrow…

993
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,757
I promise, I'll find you.

Here, I swear on this clip.

997
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,509
I will find you.

998
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,844
[Asuka] I have a theory.
I think the head might be inside the doll.

999
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,097
[Shota] Okay… What makes you say that?

1000
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,435
[Asuka] Well, when I saw it in the pool…

1001
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:33,607
Emily the doll
sank into the water head first.

1002
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,613
That means the thing
we've been looking for the entire time

1003
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:42,908
is inside the head of the monster.

[liquid sloshing]

1010
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:33,959

I know Rie will come back to us.

Hey.

1014
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:18,003
I figured out why the six of us
were chosen. I think I get it now.

1015
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,297
Tell us why.

1016
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,384
Because that monster…

1017
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:28,472
was drawn to us
by the cracks in our hearts.

1018
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,350
It's our loneliness come to life.

1019

then we take it down together.

Night after night,

but didn't give up.

We're gonna stop that monster
and put that head back where it belongs.
