1
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,200
Why isn't the main force here yet?

2
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,599
I'm getting really anxious.

3
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,079
Uncle

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,680
Don't mess it up.

5
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,159
Alright.

6
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,519
The people have arrived.

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,879
But you need to

8
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,959
intensify their training.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,439
Don't let them get to the battlefield

10
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,239
without knowing anything, stumbling around blindly.

11
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,840
Otherwise, they'll just be sent to die.

12
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,599
Uncle

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
We need equipment for training too.

14
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,079
We only have about twenty guns in total.

15
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,840
How can we train?

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm thinking about that too.

17
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,159
Where to go

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
to get more guns.

19
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,240
Doesn't Xiaobaima have guns?

20
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,439
But that's not enough for everyone.

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
Some are still using pitchforks.

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,680
Maybe your dad can come up with something.

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,599
Forget it.

24
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,439
I can't go home right now.

25
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,000
Even if I could,

26
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,520
my dad would skin me alive.

27
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm just kidding.

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,879
Uncle

29
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,000
Hearing you mention my dad

30
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,919
reminded me of something.

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,879
My dad once told me

32
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,039
that not far from my home,

33
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,439
in Yangshuzhuang, less than fifty kilometers away,

34
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,719
there's a mysterious man living there.

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,520
People call him Liu Baye.

36
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,439
He used to be a brigade commander in the Northeast Army.

37
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,199
He fled during the retreat.

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,280
Now he's hiding in the mountains near Yangshuzhuang.

39
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,479
I've heard that officers from the Northeast Army

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,960
have plenty of guns.

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,080
They often sell guns to make a fortune.

42
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,800
I wonder if he has any guns.

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,840
Yeah.

44
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,560
If you go, take me with you.

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,159
Wait, but...

46
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,800
If both of us leave,

47
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,879
what about the others?

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,840
Uncle

49
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,360
You want me to take care of these dozens of people?

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,599
It has to be you.

51
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,840
So I've been promoted!

52
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,400
Comrade Tian Xiaogui,

53
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,879
This is just the beginning.

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,639
In the future, you'll lead

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,879
thousands of troops.

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,639
You need to train them

57
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,599
not just in combat,

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,439
but also here.

59
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,080
They all came

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,960
driven by passion.

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,919
I'm worried they won't stick with it.

62
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,319
You need to work on

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,319
their mindset too.

64
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,400
Right?

65
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,360
You have to make sure

66
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,439
their determination to fight the Japanese invaders never fades.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,240
And give them

68
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,480
confidence that final victory

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,360
will be ours.

70
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,600
Uncle

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,040
Leave them to me.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,920
Don't worry.

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,920
Alright.

74
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,920
He passed out.

75
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,360
He passed out.

76
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,399
I made you faint.

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,759
He's awake.

78
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,959
Come on, take him away.

79
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Come on.

80
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,879
You all saw that, right?

81
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,519
Let's see if your mouths or your bones are tougher.

82
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Spit it out, confess now.

83
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,560
Who's with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army?

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,040
Confess on your own.

85
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
You'll suffer less.

86
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,439
And it'll be easier for us.

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
If I have to ask you,

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,480
things won't be so easy.

89
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:24,800
Sir

90
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,759
Are you with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army?

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,319
No, I'm not. Really, I'm not.

92
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,439
Then why did they arrest you?

93
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,839
I have no idea.

94
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,120
I was heading to Mudanjiang.

95
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,439
They grabbed me on the way.

96
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,120
You were going to Mudanjiang to find the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, right?

97
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,480
No, not to find them.

98
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I was visiting relatives.

99
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,079
Visiting relatives?

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,199
Did you see the one they just took away?

101
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,600
He was just visiting relatives.

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,839
Turns out his relative is with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

103
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,839
What a coincidence, huh?

104
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,600
Take him away.

105
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,560
I guess it's the same for him.

106
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,759
No, sir.

107
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,519
My relative isn't with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

108
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,160
Really.

109
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,199
I'm not.

110
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,199
Xiao Tielin

111
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,680
Wait a second.

112
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,360
Xiao Tielin

113
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,279
Move aside, move aside.

114
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:03,839
Who?

115
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,560
Xiao Tielin

116
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,639
Do you know him?

117
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,560
He's my relative.

118
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,519
He's not with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

119
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,240
Which Xiao Tielin?

120
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,279
Commander of the Tiger Fighting Regiment, Xiao Tielin.

121
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,600
Commander of the Tiger Fighting Regiment, Xiao Tielin.

122
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,439
He's your relative?

123
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:14,959
Yes.

124
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,920
The Emperor is my great-uncle too.

125
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,600
Take him away.

126
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,240
Sir

127
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,360
Darn it

128
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,560
When the military police stand over there,

129
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,879
holding their guns like that,

130
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,040
half my men are gone.

131
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,319
Anyone who went into the mountains with you,

132
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,560
none of them survived.

133
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,639
My adjutant,

134
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,120
he's been with me for three years.

135
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,279
He made it there.

136
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,079
He got killed too.

137
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,079
I was just thinking

138
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,560
how to

139
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
take care of his mother for the rest of her life.

140
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,279
I'm like a clay Buddha crossing a river now,

141
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,839
barely able to save myself.

142
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,240
If it weren't for

143
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,360
you guys, my sworn brothers,

144
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,160
I'd be done for already.

145
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,879
Old Xiao

146
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,680
Don't worry.

147
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,720
If they dare touch you,

148
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,439
all our regiments will revolt together.

149
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,079
We'll blow them to bits.

150
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,519
I really rely on you guys.

151
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,800
Help me keep this old life of mine.

152
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,079
Anyway,

153
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,920
I'm just

154
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,000
a commander with no troops now.

155
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,399
I'll take it one day at a time.

156
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,480
If you ask me,

157
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,040
this lousy, thankless commander job

158
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,439
isn't worth doing if you can avoid it.

159
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,600
Old Xiao

160
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,759
After a while,

161
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,399
you should think about

162
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,240
finding a good job for retirement.

163
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,959
What could I do?

164
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,079
There are plenty of cushy jobs in Northeast China.

165
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,439
Come in.

166
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,160
Report.

167
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,199
Commander, a phone call.

168
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,360
It's for Commander Xiao.

169
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,040
I'm not answering.

170
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,120
Just say I'm dead.

171
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:56,800
No, no.

172
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,160
Put the call through.

173
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,079
Yes, sir.

174
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,360
What if it's the military police?

175
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,000
Answer it.

176
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,160
Old Commander

177
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,680
Who is it?

178
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,720
It's me, Lao Si.

179
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,079
Which Lao Si?

180
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,560
I used to work under you.

181
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,079
Then I was transferred to Xin'an.

182
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,120
Xu Lao Si.

183
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,399
That's not right.

184
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,519
Didn't you go to check the prison?

185
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,879
What's going on?

186
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,960
Here's the situation.

187
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,080
We caught someone.

188
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,120
He claims he's your relative.

189
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,519
Surname.

190
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,519
Surname is Tang.

191
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,519
He sounded pretty convincing.

192
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,200
So,

193
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,120
Given our relationship,

194
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,000
I had to let you know.

195
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,519
What if it's true, right?

196
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,240
Don't know him.

197
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,720
You don't know him?

198
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Alright, if you don't know him, that's fine.

199
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,039
We mainly suspect

200
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,080
he's with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

201
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,279
If he really is your relative,

202
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,440
it has nothing to do with you.

203
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,399
Then it's definitely a misunderstanding.

204
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,039
Tang or whoever,

205
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,200
I don't have such a relative.

206
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,000
If he dares to lie to me,

207
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,600
I'll make him pay.

208
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,840
Is he from our hometown?

209
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,279
Surname is Tang.

210
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,639
This kid

211
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,879
never lets me have peace.

212
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,480
Lao Xiao.

213
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,759
It's hard to find someone reliable these days.

214
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,840
Someone you really know well.

215
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,279
It's really not easy.

216
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,320
You might need someone in the future.

217
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,200
You can't spend your whole life

218
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,279
being a lone commander.

219
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,840
Makes sense.

220
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Take advice, eat well.

221
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,759
Xu Lao Si.

222
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,080
Brother.

223
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,320
You said his surname is Tang.

224
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,759
What's his full name?

225
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,000
Tang Deyuan.

226
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,679
He actually is

227
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,320
a distant relative of mine.

228
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,080
See?

229
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,320
Then I'll let him go.

230
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,080
Don't let him go.

231
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,840
We've already roughed him up.

232
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,799
That little punk.

233
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,120
You beat him?

234
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,919
How bad was it?

235
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,159
Let me tell you,

236
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,080
just teach him a lesson.

237
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,799
Don't beat him to death.

238
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,279
Leave his arms and legs intact.

239
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,679
Just a lesson.

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,320
Arms and legs are fine.

241
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,559
Tried to suck up, but failed.

242
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,000
Now I've got a big job on my hands.

243
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,840
Who is it?

244
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,279
Is this Master Liu's house?

245
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,879
May I ask who you are?

246
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,519
An old acquaintance.

247
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
Is Master Liu at home?

248
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,279
Unfortunately, no.

249
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,480
Master Liu isn't home.

250
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,679
Where did he go?

251
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:24,799
Harbin.

252
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,559
When will he be back?

253
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,159
He didn't say.

254
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,799
I didn't dare ask.

255
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,039
Do you need something?

256
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,200
Just tell me.

257
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,480
My business

258
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,559
really needs to be discussed with Master Liu himself.

259
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,240
Then there's nothing I can do.

260
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:43,879
Well,

261
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,120
Where in Harbin is he?

262
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,559
Why are you so nosy?

263
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,480
Master Liu didn't say.

264
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,080
I didn't dare ask.

265
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,960
What are you doing?

266
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,919
You didn't answer when I knocked.

267
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,879
So I just peeked over the wall.

268
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,559
Just took a look.

269
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,000
That's trespassing, you know.

270
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,519
You realize that?

271
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,000
My feet didn't even touch the ground.

272
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:31,759
Right?

273
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,639
I didn't enter your yard either.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,559
How is that trespassing?

275
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,039
You—

276
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,919
Don't come down.

277
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,559
My big black dog gets angry.

278
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,519
He'll bite you.

279
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,960
Don't blame me.

280
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,600
Then I'll give him a piece of meat.

281
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,279
As a greeting gift.

282
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,960
Wait a moment.

283
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,799
Let's talk inside.

284
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,080
Please.

285
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,679
Do you know who the Little White Horse from Congshan is?

286
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,960
Bandit.

287
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,000
Watch your mouth.

288
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,960
Not a hero.

289
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,320
My family and bandits—

290
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,559
No, not at all.

291
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,000
We have nothing to do with those mountain folks.

292
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,360
No grudges either.

293
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,799
Alright, alright.

294
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,840
Get up, get up.

295
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
I'll be honest with you.

296
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,759
I was sent by the Little White Horse from Congshan.

297
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:47,000
I want to work with Master Liu.

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,440
To do a big deal.

299
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,960
What kind of deal?

300
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,399
Can't tell you.

301
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,840
Where exactly did Master Liu go?

302
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,159
Harbin.

303
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,120
Is anyone home?

304
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,720
Zhang the carpenter from Yangshuzhuang.

305
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,399
The table legs here are loose.

306
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,159
He's here to fix them.

307
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,480
Me coming to your house

308
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,200
can't be known by outsiders, understand?

309
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,759
Got it.

310
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,240
Me—

311
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,200
I won't say a word.

312
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,519
Where's your backyard wall?

313
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,039
Let's go.

314
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,160
I'll take you to see Master Liu.

315
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,039
I really didn't expect this.

316
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,440
Master Liu.

317
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,400
You've hidden yourself so well.

318
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,319
I'm scared from all the fighting.

319
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,640
I came here,

320
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,400
not for anything else.

321
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,599
I just wanted to

322
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,400
buy some guns from you.

323
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,920
In times like these,

324
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,720
who dares to hide such things?

325
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,160
If the Japanese find out,

326
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
it'll cost your life.

327
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,759
Liu Dehai.

328
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,880
Master Liu.

329
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,480
I've heard about you for a long time.

330
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,839
Your reputation is legendary.

331
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,359
You were once with the Northeast Army,

332
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,559
a brave general.

333
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Some commanders

334
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
didn't resist the Japanese.

335
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,880
You were the first to stand up against them.

336
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,720
Later, you joined

337
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,799
the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army.

338
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,720
After suffering defeat,

339
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,799
you disappeared without a trace.

340
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,640
I'm looking for you,

341
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,680
not to ask you to fight again,

342
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,119
but to pay real money

343
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,279
to buy your guns.

344
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,880
We're going to fight the Japanese.

345
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,279
I told you,

346
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,599
I don't have any.

347
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,119
If you want to buy something, buy my life.

348
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,440
You... you...

349
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,640
What happened?

350
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Master Liu is gone.

351
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,039
I thought he was leaving,

352
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,359
but I didn't expect him to go so soon.

353
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,599
About this... you—

354
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,519
He's already gone.

355
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,119
Can't you just let him go?

356
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:27,079
We did know each other, after all.

357
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,480
It's the time to say a few words.

358
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,000
No,

359
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,880
He's being buried so soon?

360
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,279
Isn't that a bit rushed?

361
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
It's still hot in autumn.

362
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Afraid the body won't keep.

363
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,920
It's disrespectful to the dead.

364
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,200
It could shorten one's life.

365
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:01,759
You—

366
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,880
Can we stop pretending now?

367
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,839
Master Liu,

368
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,319
Why are you so sure

369
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,839
that I'm Master Liu?

370
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,279
When you go out to eat,

371
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,799
with good food and wine,

372
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,240
you're never in a hurry.

373
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,839
Even when the owner pours your drink,

374
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,720
you don't even respond.

375
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,359
As a servant,

376
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,559
where do you get such leisure?

377
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
Where do you get that attitude?

378
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
When I said I wanted to do business with Master Liu,

379
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,039
at that moment,

380
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,720
you packed your things that night

381
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,960
and tried to run away.

382
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:57,759
If the person in that room

383
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,839
was really Master Liu,

384
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,079
would a servant

385
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,799
just leave like that?

386
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,079
See,

387
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,279
you really couldn't shake me off.

388
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,319
So you put on this act today,

389
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,559
pretending to be dead.

390
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,920
Isn't that a bit too hasty?

391
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,440
Too—

392
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,759
Too much of a coincidence.

393
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,559
Let me be honest with you.

394
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,720
I'm with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, Second Route.

395
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,400
My name is Lu Changshan.

396
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,920
I'm a platoon leader.

397
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,720
Last autumn, our unit was scattered.

398
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,039
I've been looking for

399
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,440
my comrades who got separated.

400
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,480
At the same time, I've been trying hard

401
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,960
to gather more people.

402
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,680
Now, we've got more and more people.

403
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:47,960
But guns—

404
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,720
we really don't have enough.

405
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
After all this searching,

406
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
I ended up here with you.

407
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
If you really have guns,

408
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,640
sell them to me.

409
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:58,559
Can you?

410
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,359
Second Route Army—

411
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,799
I heard there's a commander named Lu Youde.

412
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,799
Do you know him?

413
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,480
Commander Lu—

414
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,599
He's with the Fifth Corps of the Second Route Army.

415
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,400
Just like you,

416
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:15,880
he used to

417
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,559
be with the Northeast Army.

418
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,759
Later, he joined the Communist Party.

419
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,720
During a battle,

420
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,480
a Japanese grenade

421
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,960
tore off his scalp.

422
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,160
He's half bald now.

423
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,119
He wields a big broadsword.

424
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,279
He's fierce and powerful.

425
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,680
Everyone calls him Lu the Broadsword.

426
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,640
I've heard of him.

427
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,279
How is he now?

428
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,240
I saw him last autumn.

429
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,359
Haven't heard from him since.

430
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,480
In war,

431
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,359
you're standing today,

432
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,079
but tomorrow

433
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,240
you might be lying down.

434
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,759
You take off your shoes and socks at night,

435
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,279
and by morning

436
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,799
you might not get to put them back on.

437
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,759
At a time like this,

438
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,599
won't you reveal

439
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,880
who you really are?

440
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,839
You're right.

441
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,160
I am Master Liu.

442
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,000
Master Liu,

443
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,759
please have some tea.

444
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,720
Thank you for your trouble.

445
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,359
Master Liu.

446
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,759
I really had no choice.

447
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,039
It was out of desperation.

448
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,000
Please, have a seat.

449
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:04,599
Alright.

450
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,960
Besides,

451
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,599
I'm worried the Japanese

452
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,319
are trying to bait me.

453
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,279
So, Eighth Master,

454
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,160
do we really have all this stuff here?

455
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,279
Is all this equipment real?

456
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,160
This is just a part of it.

457
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,200
Eighth Master, if today

458
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,640
I had just revealed it earlier,

459
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,039
what would you have done?

460
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,079
These guns

461
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,880
have been hidden in my secret room.

462
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,680
Lately, the Japanese

463
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,119
have been watching me more closely.

464
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,440
So I moved these guns

465
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,880
batch by batch

466
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,599
into my tomb.

467
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,400
And you showed up in the middle of it.

468
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,519
That's perfect.

469
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
Just what I wanted.

470
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,279
Eighth Master Liu,

471
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,440
Could you give me a few days?

472
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,240
What's wrong?

473
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,480
There are so many weapons.

474
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,079
I need to go back to the mountain

475
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
and get people to help move them.

476
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,759
No need.

477
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:57,079
You just need to lead the way.

478
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,359
What do you mean?

479
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,319
Everyone, clear out.

480
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,400
Here you go, sir.

481
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,519
Your pork knuckle is packed.

482
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,200
Take care.

483
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,839
Eighth Master,

484
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,559
When I first started watching you,

485
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,599
was I already exposed?

486
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,519
Well...

487
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:49,599
Take this.

488
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,640
No, Eighth Master, Eighth Master,

489
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,519
Take it.

490
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,160
I'm riddled with illness.

491
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,519
I can't fight on the battlefield anymore.

492
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,960
But my heart still wants to fight the Japanese.

493
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
That desire never fades.

494
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,440
My men will go with you to the mountain.

495
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,039
This is my way of contributing.

496
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,000
You must

497
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,519
hit the Japanese hard.

498
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,119
Drive those beasts out.

499
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,359
I don't even know

500
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,960
if I'll live to see that day.

501
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,839
I'm counting on you.

502
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,920
Eighth Master,

503
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,359
I, Lu Changshan,

504
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,119
on behalf of all

505
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,480
the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army fighters,

506
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,480
salute you, elder.

507
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,039
Did you all see that?

508
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,799
Whatever we wish for, we get.

509
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,359
As long as we

510
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,440
never lose the will to fight the Japanese,

511
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,880
one day the Japanese

512
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,720
will be driven out by us.

513
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:05,480
Right?

514
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,359
Right.

515
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,279
It's a sure thing.

516
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,400
It's just a matter of time.

517
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:12,559
Uncle,

518
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,559
You're a veteran taking charge.

519
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,559
You're worth two men.

520
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,559
Not just two,

521
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,799
more like ten.

522
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,039
Everyone, give him a round of applause.

523
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,240
Alright.

524
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:23,839
Uncle,

525
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,640
There are eight strangers with guns

526
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,519
coming this way.

527
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,559
Go up.

528
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,039
Brothers,

529
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,119
Brothers,

530
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,359
Which group are you with?

531
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,640
We're just passing through.

532
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,440
Can you let us through?

533
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,240
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

534
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,079
We're on the same side!

535
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,079
Don't shoot!

536
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,680
Squad Leader Zhao!

537
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,160
Brother!

538
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,720
These men are...

539
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,160
Zhao Youwang.

540
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,920
Lu Changshan.

541
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,519
Zhao Youwang.

542
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,880
You finally made it through.

543
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,440
We finally get to see you.

544
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,519
What took you so long?

545
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,200
Don't mention it.

546
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,400
We were trapped in Paozi Valley.

547
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,240
For three months.

548
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,640
We just broke out.

549
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,839
You all suffered a lot.

550
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,599
Why are there so many people?

551
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,519
That's not all.

552
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,519
There are dozens more up the mountain.

553
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,880
That many?

554
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,119
Old Lu,

555
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,559
I've been looking for people for a year.

556
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,400
First time seeing so many fighters.

557
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,680
Old Lu,

558
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,400
You really lifted our spirits.

559
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,640
We can't find the main force anyway.

560
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,920
Might as well do something.

561
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,839
Let's build up our strength.

562
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:19,720
Alright.

563
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,799
Come on, let's go chat.

564
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,519
Chat, chat, chat.

565
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,079
Old Mountain God really is

566
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,839
the savior of our Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

567
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,839
Old Mountain God,

568
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:36,480
Before he left,

569
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,720
he kept reminding me

570
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,960
to use the money from selling ginseng

571
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,799
for fighting the Japanese invaders.

572
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,599
I promised Old Mountain God

573
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,880
that once the Japanese are driven out,

574
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,640
this money

575
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,759
will be returned in full

576
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,319
to all the ginseng helpers.

577
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,680
We'll go door to door

578
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,839
and deliver it to their homes.

579
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,880
Their names

580
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,000
and their home

581
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:17,680
addresses

582
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,319
are all written here.

583
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
As Communist Party members,

584
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,759
we must keep our word.

585
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,519
Don't worry.

586
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,000
I'll make sure this list

587
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
gets to the commander.

588
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,039
Yes.

589
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,279
I originally planned

590
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,759
to use this money

591
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,119
to buy guns

592
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:38,440
and gather troops.

593
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,880
But nobody wanted it.

594
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,000
The money wasn't spent.

595
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,000
It's all here.

596
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:47,559
Here.

597
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,119
Oh, right.

598
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:55,920
Those new people we brought in,

599
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,039
needed food and drink.

600
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,119
We used up some supplies.

601
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,039
Xiaogui,

602
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,319
bring the ledger to Squad Leader Zhao.

603
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,200
Let him check the accounts.

604
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,839
What are you doing? No, no, no.

605
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,039
Why check it?

606
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,359
You think I don't trust you?

607
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,599
Don't talk nonsense.

608
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,440
Alright.

609
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,200
So then,

610
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,319
the people are back with the unit.

611
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,240
This money

612
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,119
should go back to the unit too.

613
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,359
Here.

614
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,400
That's what I was thinking.

615
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Let Xiaogui lead everyone

616
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,319
and go back to the main force with you first.

617
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,599
I still need to go to Songlin Town.

618
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,039
I have to find my squad members.

619
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,799
Uncle,

620
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,440
let me go with you.

621
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,839
Like I said before,

622
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,480
these people need you to lead them.

623
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,119
Oh, right.

624
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,960
You,

625
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,480
go to Hua'er.

626
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,519
Bring the Xiaobaima group

627
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,960
back to the main force too.

628
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:57,559
Alright.

629
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,799
Once I find everyone,

630
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,000
I'll meet up with you.

631
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,839
Okay.

632
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,400
It's settled.

633
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,039
Congratulations, Boss Gao.

634
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,320
What?

635
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,360
If you have something to say, just say it.

636
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,360
Why are you always humming?

637
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,920
Got a feather stuck in your throat?

638
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:45,760
Three words:

639
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,400
You've changed.

640
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:48,679
How have I changed?

641
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,000
Now,

642
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,119
you're not the old Gao Yunhu anymore.

643
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,960
Then who am I?

644
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,599
You're a man

645
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,119
who's been bewitched and hooked by a woman.

646
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,440
A man.

647
00:34:59,039 --> 00:34:59,840
Alright, alright.

648
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,320
You just look for trouble every day.

649
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,519
I think you,

650
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,000
sooner or later, you'll go back to Yelaihao.

651
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,800
and sleep on Dakuozhi's kang.

652
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,199
If I don't keep an eye on you,

653
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,119
there's still some hope.

654
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,719
I'm stuck in the middle.

655
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,920
I'd have left already.

656
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,599
Where are you going?

657
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,679
By myself.

658
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,519
I'm going to find the unit.

659
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,119
Where are you going to look?

660
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,199
Why do you care where I look?

661
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,400
I'll just look, that's all.

662
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,960
Look, look, look—what are you even looking for?

663
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,079
Just stay here.

664
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,719
There's still some hope for you.

665
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,280
You want to go out on your own.

666
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,159
You won't last two months.

667
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,159
Still looking for a unit?

668
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm not like you.

669
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,800
I was born a member of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

670
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,079
I'll die as one of them too.

671
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,519
Unlike you,

672
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,480
coward,

673
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,599
weakling.

674
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,840
So I'm a coward and a weakling, huh?

675
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,400
Come here.

676
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,280
Don't touch me.

677
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,840
Come here, come here!

678
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,599
Don't touch me.

679
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,280
See for yourself.

680
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:03,840
Let me ask you.

681
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,960
Why did I change the sign?

682
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,559
The sign's changed.

683
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,239
If our people come,

684
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
it'll be easier for them to find us.

685
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,440
Can you use your head for once?

686
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,079
That's why it's called Yunhu Mountain Goods.

687
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:21,960
Is that really what you thought?

688
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,679
What else would it be?

689
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,280
Then I blamed you wrongly.

690
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,440
Don't take it to heart.

691
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,079
No, no, don't touch me.

692
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,000
No, Wan Fuqing,

693
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,480
do you always

694
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,519
make a fuss every month?

695
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,000
Sometimes it's twice a month, isn't it?

696
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,920
I'll kick you to death!

697
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:38,559
Pack up the ladder! Pack up the ladder!

698
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,159
1940

699
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,159
February 23rd

700
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,280
Main founder of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

701
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,960
and one of its leaders

702
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,960
Commander-in-chief and political commissar of the First Route Army

703
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,360
Comrade Yang Jingyu

704
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,719
died heroically

705
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,639
at the age of thirty-five

706
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,000
The Japanese army beheaded him

707
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,679
After parading his head through the streets

708
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,360
it was sent to the Japanese Kwantung Army headquarters in Changchun

709
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,320
They also printed

710
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,280
200,000 victory flyers for distribution

711
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,679
Stop picking them up, stop picking them up

712
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,360
Go home quickly

713
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,599
Stop picking them up, stop picking them up

714
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,679
Why are you throwing these things

715
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,960
Everyone, disperse, disperse, disperse

716
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,559
Stop picking them up

717
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,719
Go home quickly, go home quickly

718
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,159
Go home, go home, go home

719
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,559
Why are you throwing these things

720
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,199
Go home, go home, go home

721
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:02,760
Everyone go home

722
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,599
Stop picking them up, stop picking them up

723
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,920
Tonight

724
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,599
is treating everyone in town to drinks

725
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,239
Zhi'er

726
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,719
Zhi'er, what are you doing

727
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,280
Come on, come on

728
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,840
Move aside, move aside, move aside

729
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:15,400
Zhi'er

730
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,400
What are you doing

731
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,280
Hurry up and clean up

732
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,599
Go call someone quickly

733
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,239
Go call someone quickly

734
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,039
Alert, alert

735
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,320
I'll have a bowl too

736
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,840
Respect heaven and earth.

737
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,079
Honor the heroes.

738
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,480
Honor the heroes.

739
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,519
Light the fire.

740
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:09,800
Put down your gun.
