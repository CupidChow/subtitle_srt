1
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,680
The blood on my hands

2
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,280
could drown me.

3
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,359
You think this business

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,280
is something anyone can do?

5
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,760
Watching helplessly

6
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,480
as easy money slips by, and you don't take it.

7
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,079
Your head

8
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,760
got slammed by a door,

9
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,920
or knocked by a cow?

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,520
What's up?

11
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,400
Getting stubborn again?

12
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,159
How about this, brother?

13
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,199
Give me something else to do.

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,360
Even errands are fine.

15
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,159
Tang Deyuan,

16
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,120
don't push your luck.

17
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,599
Remember back then,

18
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,159
I pulled you back from death's door.

19
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,319
You think I just wanted

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
to give you a regular job?

21
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,960
You think if you don't do this

22
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,080
the Chinese people

23
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,159
won't suffer from opium?

24
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,360
You know our situation.

25
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,520
We've got people above us.

26
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,840
Connections.

27
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,919
Brother Lao Yu

28
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,560
has looked out for us for over twenty years.

29
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,520
Plus Lao Guo's gun.

30
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,800
We control seventy percent in Mudanjiang.

31
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,560
Old Shao

32
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,400
only has thirty percent.

33
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
And he's still whining

34
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,919
trying to pull strings everywhere

35
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,599
to get a bigger share.

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,479
It's not easy to survive these days.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,560
Living well is even harder.

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,879
Sending someone to death's door

39
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,080
is much easier than saving them.

40
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,319
Brother,

41
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,800
what do you mean by that?

42
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,960
Think it over.

43
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,479
You're not the same as before.

44
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,560
Back then,

45
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,800
you only had to feed yourself.

46
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,360
Now you've got elders and kids to care for.

47
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,800
You're the pillar of your family.

48
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,280
The support.

49
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,639
I can't speak for others,

50
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,959
but this stuff

51
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,040
I, Tang Deyuan, will never touch it.

52
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,160
I'll only handle your grain business.

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,279
I'll guarantee you this amount every year.

54
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,639
Is that okay?

55
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,360
Can you do that?

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,759
Whether I can or not,

57
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,680
don't you know?

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,439
You said it yourself.

59
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,279
I did.

60
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,720
It's settled.

61
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,079
Brother,

62
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,439
sometimes what you say

63
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,160
really hurts.

64
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,079
Hurts or not,

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm just telling the truth.

66
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,279
Then I'll be honest too.

67
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
The warehouse for this stuff,

68
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,199
you'd better

69
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,839
not let me know where it is.

70
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,879
Brother,

71
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,240
don't you dare fall asleep.

72
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,879
Didn't you say

73
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,160
you're from Huachuan?

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,079
Let me tell you,

75
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,000
I've really been to Huachuan.

76
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,439
Oh my,

77
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,639
the Huachuan pork head

78
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,240
is so fragrant.

79
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
Take a bite,

80
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,040
it's full of juice.

81
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,759
I know you can't do it.

82
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,560
Just drop the knife.

83
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,079
Go take a leak in the woods.

84
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,519
Comrade Li Ermao,

85
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,639
Comrade Li Ermao,

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,639
Li?

87
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:42,959
What's wrong?

88
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,759
Nothing.

89
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,319
Just tired.

90
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,120
Is the wine good?

91
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,519
This one?

92
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,000
Looks like horse piss.

93
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
Director Xiao

94
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,399
just sent someone to deliver it.

95
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,000
He said

96
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,600
it's something fresh from Harbin.

97
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,519
for you to try.

98
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,720
What is this stuff?

99
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,560
This is worse than horse urine.

100
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,560
At least horse urine is warm.

101
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,000
This...

102
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,959
It's so bitter, it could pull your teeth out.

103
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,279
They specifically told us,

104
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,120
to rinse it with well water before drinking.

105
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,360
It's supposed to cool you down.

106
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,399
Really?

107
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,199
Here, have a taste.

108
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,079
I need to feed the baby soon.

109
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,079
Alright, alright, alright.

110
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,079
You've had a long day too.

111
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,639
Take a break.

112
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,839
What is it?

113
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,879
Did you clash with Xiao Tielin again?

114
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,560
You don't talk much usually.

115
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,199
Every time he comes back,

116
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,160
you get even more upset.

117
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,319
I'm just a woman.

118
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,399
It's hard for me to say anything.

119
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,240
But as the saying goes,

120
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,959
Serving a lord is like serving a tiger.

121
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,079
Maybe...

122
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,279
We should stop working for him.

123
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,079
Why are you laughing?

124
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,759
Let's just take it one day at a time.

125
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,879
Can't see your mom,

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,399
feeling sad, right?

127
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,600
Mom's talking to dad.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,960
Not sad anymore?

129
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
Not sad now.

130
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,440
Comrades,

131
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,559
Over the past few years,

132
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,440
you have gone through

133
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,000
harsh and rigorous training

134
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,879
and become outstanding soldiers.

135
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,720
Many of you

136
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,200
have been sent as small units

137
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
back to the homeland for missions.

138
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,440
Some returned,

139
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,320
some never came back.

140
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,159
Fourteen years have passed.

141
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,559
Our people did not die in vain.

142
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,440
Their blood was not shed for nothing.

143
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,480
Soon,

144
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,799
we will return home.

145
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,600
Victory is ahead of us.

146
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:29,960
Now,

147
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,200
we are going back to our homeland.

148
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,440
We must scout the Japanese army's

149
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,679
bunkers in the border areas,

150
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,600
fortifications,

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,799
ammunition depots,

152
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,279
water supply systems,

153
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,000
power stations and airports,

154
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,519
bridges and garrisons.

155
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,639
We need to gather intelligence,

156
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,399
eliminate traitors,

157
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,039
mobilize the masses,

158
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,559
and continue in the Northeast

159
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,840
to find Party organizations.

160
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Through the Northeast Party Committee,

161
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,600
we must quickly contact the Central Committee.

162
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,639
Establish communication.

163
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,120
Comrades,

164
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,279
before the counterattack begins,

165
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,080
you are the first group

166
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,000
of officers and soldiers to return home.

167
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,639
Every piece of intelligence you send back

168
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,279
will be compiled into battle manuals

169
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,480
and distributed to every commander

170
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,919
of the Soviet Red Army.

171
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
This will save

172
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,759
countless soldiers' lives.

173
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,000
Platoon leader,

174
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,080
why aren't we taking Little Donkey

175
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,279
on this mission?

176
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,919
Yeah, platoon leader,

177
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,279
Little Donkey is with another group.

178
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,879
I requested it from the instructor.

179
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Why?

180
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,559
You all know

181
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,960
how dangerous this mission is.

182
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,039
I just thought,

183
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,039
let Old Donkey keep his son.

184
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,799
The other group is safer.

185
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,039
Platoon leader,

186
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,759
You don't have to worry.

187
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,240
Yunhu and I will risk our lives

188
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,399
to protect him.

189
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,159
Of course we'll risk our lives,

190
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,919
even die if we have to.

191
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
But it's for the mission.

192
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,519
Every single day.

193
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,440
Why are you here?

194
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,320
Squad Leader, I...

195
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,720
I... I have to see you off.

196
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,600
You're doing this again.

197
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,720
How old are you now?

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,159
Just focus on your team's

199
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,120
assigned mission.

200
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,559
Little Donkey,

201
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,799
Do you trust what Yunhu says?

202
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,679
Yes.

203
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,639
Even though you're in another team,

204
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,440
we're all still here,

205
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,799
in the Songhua River and Mudanjiang area.

206
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,559
We'll run into each other sooner or later.

207
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,799
Stop crying.

208
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,600
Fuqing,

209
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,519
What are you doing?

210
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,759
Why are you whining?

211
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,399
You're a soldier.

212
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,799
Hold it in.

213
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,399
Yunhu is right.

214
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,720
Even though right now

215
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,799
we're acting separately,

216
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,279
one day

217
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,639
our main force

218
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,080
will reunite.

219
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,759
For your two brothers and your father,

220
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,240
take good care of yourself.

221
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,240
We have to

222
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,440
see the day of victory together.

223
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,360
Got it?

224
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,919
I don't want to leave you, Squad Leader.

225
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,559
Get out of here.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,519
Stop with that useless talk.

227
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,000
Yunhu, Fuqing,

228
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,799
I don't want to leave you guys.

229
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,399
Your mission back there

230
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,639
is to scout Datuziling's

231
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,519
military fortifications.

232
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,600
Comrade Fuqing

233
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,240
has built fortifications at Datuziling before.

234
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,519
At first,

235
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,360
he was the one who provided the intel.

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,679
Datuziling Ridge

237
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,399
Located in the Laoye Ridge mountain range

238
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,039
Very close to the Soviet border

239
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,320
Surrounded by Mudanjiang

240
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,840
Suifenhe

241
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,840
Dongning

242
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,919
All these places are

243
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,840
heavily guarded by Japanese troops

244
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,679
The fortified zone here

245
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,080
is not limited to Datuziling Ridge

246
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,159
But the Far East Command believes

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,799
Datuziling Ridge's

248
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,919
strategic position is very important

249
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,000
It is likely the core

250
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,639
of the Japanese eastern front line

251
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,440
One of the locations for the wartime underground command post

252
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,480
is here

253
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,039
It's also what the Japanese call

254
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,799
the location of the "special depot"

255
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,519
Previously, we

256
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,559
sent several reconnaissance teams

257
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,519
to scout Datuziling Ridge's

258
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,440
military installations

259
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,159
and made great sacrifices

260
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,320
The comrade you met before

261
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,679
who brought back news about Erluzi

262
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,879
and the sacrifice

263
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,279
has also gone missing

264
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,679
Their team

265
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,039
insisted on returning for

266
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,039
a second reconnaissance

267
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,840
The last message they sent was

268
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,600
that the Puppet Army's Bo Hu Regiment

269
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,559
was stationed in this area

270
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,000
and frequently entered Datuziling Ridge

271
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:33,480
Later

272
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,320
our reconnaissance found out

273
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,399
that this Bo Hu Regiment

274
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,240
was almost completely wiped out

275
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,200
But at that time, their commander

276
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,240
Xiao Tielin

277
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,200
was still alive

278
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,639
This Xiao Tielin

279
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,480
is Tang Deyuan's relative

280
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,120
his brother

281
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:49,919
As for the terrain features

282
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:50,879
Over the years

283
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,039
our previous teams

284
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,519
have already mapped and verified

285
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,480
What's wrong?

286
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,080
It's Tang Deyuan's

287
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,399
But

288
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,759
the nature of the defensive arrangements

289
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,159
is still unclear

290
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,440
Soviet intelligence found

291
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,360
that the Bo Hu Regiment

292
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,320
from 1935

293
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,879
to 1939

294
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,799
was responsible for all of Datuziling Ridge's

295
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,639
fortified zone supplies

296
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,720
and labor distribution

297
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,200
The brigade staff

298
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,399
has a bold hypothesis

299
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,840
that Xiao Tielin

300
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,120
most likely knows

301
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,559
the Japanese troops'

302
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,039
Border Defense Force's

303
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,240
troop deployment in the area

304
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:27,879
We want you

305
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,879
who know the local situation

306
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,120
to go to the heart of it

307
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,639
capture Xiao Tielin alive

308
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,519
and bring back the intelligence

309
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,879
After discussion by superiors

310
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,399
it was decided that Platoon Leader Lu will lead the team

311
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,639
to carry out the mission in Mudanjiang

312
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
Here's the mission briefing, take a look

313
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,039
Yes

314
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,080
You need to

315
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,080
get into Mudanjiang as soon as possible

316
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,440
Go to 78 Xinglong Street

317
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,240
Our comrade is there

318
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,720
and will assist with your mission

319
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,759
The mission is tough

320
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,960
You must succeed

321
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:57,840
Failure is not an option

322
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,240
If we were

323
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
air-dropped directly into Mudanjiang

324
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,200
we'd head straight to the dumpling shop

325
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,759
That would be great, right?

326
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,120
It'd be great for you

327
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,360
but you'd lose your life

328
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,879
Two minutes until we reach the drop zone

329
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,840
Roger

330
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:16,879
Get ready

331
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:23,720
Let's go

332
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,080
Okay

333
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,519
How is it?

334
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,000
Did you bury all the umbrellas?

335
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,400
Don't worry, they're all buried.

336
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,440
The radio wasn't damaged, right?

337
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,799
Relax, it's fine.

338
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,720
Even if I got smashed up,

339
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,640
I wouldn't let anything happen to it.

340
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,720
What are you doing?

341
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,480
Smell this, guys.

342
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,240
The scent in this forest

343
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,880
is really different.

344
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Why does it smell so good?

345
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,880
Stop showing off.

346
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,559
Put your hat on, quick.

347
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,279
Or your ears

348
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:47,960
will freeze off soon.

349
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,720
If they freeze off,

350
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,960
they'll just feed the mountains of Guandong.

351
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,559
Anyway, Lieutenant,

352
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,160
we're finally home.

353
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,240
That's right.

354
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,079
I've been cooped up for so long.

355
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,079
If I see

356
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,039
a Japanese soldier now,

357
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,400
I'd bite him to death.

358
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,400
I'm starving.

359
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,480
Let's rest up quickly.

360
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,640
Eat and drink our fill.

361
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:06,920
Then head straight to Mudanjiang.

362
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,400
Go over there.

363
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,480
My biscuits are in your bag.

364
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,799
When did you put them in my bag?

365
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:12,400
I couldn't find them.

366
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,279
I'm carrying the radio.

367
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,480
How could I take the biscuits too?

368
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,240
Here you go.

369
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:33,960
Thanks.

370
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,680
Hot steamed buns.

371
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,559
Great.

372
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,119
Nice.

373
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,119
Here, kid.

374
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,039
Come, it's hot.

375
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,759
Speaking of the Hero of Guandong,

376
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,960
he was eight feet tall.

377
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,119
He could travel a thousand miles a day.

378
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,279
Leap over rooftops and walls.

379
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,880
He was skilled with two pistols.

380
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,759
Never missed a shot.

381
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,640
Over the years,

382
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,640
he roamed all the Guandong mountains.

383
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
His blood stained Sanjiangkou.

384
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,559
Now, the Hero of Guandong

385
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,640
took advantage of the dark night

386
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,119
and hid himself

387
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,480
on the path the Doghead Lord had to take.

388
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,160
Bang!

389
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,279
He reached out

390
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,440
from his waist

391
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,599
and pulled out a three-inch steel dart.

392
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,039
With a flick, the Hero of Guandong threw the dart.

393
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,119
A cold flash streaked by.

394
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,680
Looking at the Doghead Lord Tule,

395
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,480
he was pierced right through.

396
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,000
Good, good!

397
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,279
Do another one! Tell another!

398
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,279
The moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky.

399
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,400
The moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky.

400
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,400
River maples and fishing lights, sleepless with sorrow.

401
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,799
River maples and fishing lights, sleepless with sorrow.

402
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,880
Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou.

403
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,839
Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou.

404
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,559
Midnight bell reaches the travelers' boat.

405
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,519
Midnight bell reaches the travelers' boat.

406
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,720
Class,

407
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,559
Very good.

408
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,880
Read it with me again.

409
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,720
The moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky.

410
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,400
The moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky.

411
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,759
River maples and fishing lights, sleepless with sorrow.

412
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,279
River maples and fishing lights, sleepless with sorrow.

413
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,400
Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou.

414
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,000
Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou.

415
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,480
Midnight bell reaches the travelers' boat.

416
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,039
Midnight bell reaches the travelers' boat.

417
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,079
Alright, class.

418
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,640
What are you teaching?

419
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,319
Tang poem "Mooring by Maple Bridge."

420
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,000
Idiot.

421
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:24,240
This is Japan's most famous Tang poem.

422
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
You must use Japanese only.

423
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,079
Sorry, it's my fault.

424
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,039
You're poisoning the future of Manchukuo.

425
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,839
Your class ends here.

426
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,119
I'll report you.

427
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,480
Go back and wait for punishment.

428
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Miss Maria

429
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,680
Miss Maria is here.

430
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,400
Come quickly.

431
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,119
Thank you.

432
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,400
Hello, everyone.

433
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,039
Sister Maria

434
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:35,839
Hello.

435
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,319
Miss Maria

436
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,359
You've grown taller, haven't you?

437
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,400
Miss Maria

438
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,160
I brought some bread for everyone.

439
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:43,880
Here.

440
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:44,680
Here, take it.

441
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,480
Thank you.

442
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,279
You're welcome.

443
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,000
Here, take it.

444
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,400
Come on, come on.

445
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Thank you.

446
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:50,440
Thank you, thank you.

447
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:50,839
For you.

448
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,920
Thank you.

449
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,920
Here.

450
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,079
Thank you.

451
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,519
Thank you, thank you.

452
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,559
Thank you.

453
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,799
Has anyone not gotten one yet?

454
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,960
Kids

455
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,839
Come on, come on.

456
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:05,599
Give it to uncle.

457
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,279
Go play now.

458
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,119
Thank you.

459
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:07,880
It's fine.

460
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,480
The person who died yesterday wasn't Kawano.

461
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,000
It was one of his deputies.

462
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:19,920
Named Matsushima Kuma.

463
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,160
But he was clearly

464
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,240
wearing the officer's uniform.

465
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,119
Kawano is very cunning.

466
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,240
Up to now,

467
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,359
no one has seen him.

468
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,960
Our comrades

469
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,839
have tried very hard.

470
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,920
But not even a single photo of him

471
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,559
exists.

472
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,720
Not even a sketch.

473
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,880
Looks like we

474
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,200
will need more time.

475
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:56,960
Mr. Kawano

476
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,160
Any progress?

477
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,279
Sorry.

478
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,079
I failed you.

479
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,759
You may leave now.

480
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,680
Yes.

481
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,680
You've been captured for two years.

482
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,519
From the Soviet Union.

483
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,119
Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Training Brigade.

484
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,839
I know.

485
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,480
Do you know why you were

486
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,400
transferred from Datuziling

487
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,519
and escorted here?

488
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,039
If the Soviets are brown bears,

489
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,240
then my intelligence network

490
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,119
is the fleas on the bear.

491
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,240
I can sense

492
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,759
every beat of your hearts.

493
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,960
But you can't find where I am.

494
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,119
You've all had special training.

495
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,200
This little pain

496
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,359
should be nothing to you.

497
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:18,880
Don't be nervous.

498
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,400
We're just getting to know each other.

499
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
I don't have any questions for you now.

500
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
If I ask you,

501
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,599
you won't say anything anyway.

502
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,000
I know a special place.

503
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:36,839
There,

504
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,720
maybe you can still

505
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,039
make some more contributions.

506
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,119
Dear Maluda (test subject)

507
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,319
Special transfer.

508
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:54,240
Yes.

509
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:36,759
Where are you going?

510
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,039
Meeting a friend.

511
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,880
We open in the afternoon.

512
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,319
No one's inside.

513
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,359
And you are?

514
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,160
Why do you care what I do?

515
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,240
Is that any of your business?

516
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,240
Come back in the afternoon if you want.

517
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,440
Sir,

518
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,720
Um,

519
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,599
I just want to rest inside for a bit.

520
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,200
Could I get some water?

521
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,160
Finish your drink and let's go.

522
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,559
I want the strongest drink you have.

523
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,559
And slice two more Russian sausages.

524
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,039
No. 78 Xinglong Street.

525
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,720
It was set up by the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Training Brigade.

526
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,359
They built it.

527
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,759
It's a secret contact point.

528
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm here to

529
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,240
provide cover and assistance.

530
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,759
Just call me Maria.

531
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,039
Comrade Maria.

532
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,839
Let me introduce someone.

533
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,599
This is Comrade Liu Jianbin.

534
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,319
He has always been in charge of Mudanjiang

535
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,920
and our brigade's

536
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,200
intelligence coordination.

537
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,519
Hello, comrades.

538
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,480
Welcome home.

539
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,400
Welcome back.

540
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,240
You've all worked hard.

541
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,519
From now on,

542
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,319
just call me Uncle Liu.

543
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,480
Uncle Liu.

544
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,680
Alright.

545
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,680
Come, have a seat.

546
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:08,119
Okay.

547
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:08,960
I'll step out for a moment.

548
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,000
I'll get you something to eat.

549
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,839
Alright, thanks.

550
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,960
Thank you.

551
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,079
Earlier,

552
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,319
the mission you received in the Soviet Union

553
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
was based on our investigation at Datuziling

554
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,400
after a thorough investigation.

555
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,440
Our intelligence department

556
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,640
provided the information.

557
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,559
During the construction at Datuziling

558
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,880
fortified zone,

559
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,519
Xiao Tielin and the Tiger Fighting Regiment

560
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,880
were responsible for

561
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,400
transporting supplies and laborers into the mountains.

562
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,559
Around 1940,

563
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,000
the Tiger Fighting Regiment was disbanded.

564
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,480
These people suddenly disappeared.

565
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,799
Xiao Tielin

566
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,000
used his connections among the Manchukuo leadership

567
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,640
to become

568
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,640
the chief of the Mudanjiang puppet police bureau.

569
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:54,720
Currently,

570
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:55,960
according to our

571
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,680
local comrades' intelligence,

572
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,000
he's been closely watched by the Japanese.

573
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,480
And in the past two years,

574
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,480
he hasn't left

575
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,920
the police bureau at all.

576
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,279
This makes

577
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,279
the mission to capture Xiao Tielin alive

578
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,680
even more difficult.

579
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,480
National Government Central Broadcasting Station

580
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,880
now interrupts with Allied

581
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,759
Pacific battlefield

582
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,759
latest news.

583
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,039
Under Chairman Chiang

584
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,559
and General Nimitz's

585
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:48,839
wise leadership,

586
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:49,920
after

587
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,559
hard-fought battles and sacrifices,

588
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,119
the Allies have

589
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,240
won a complete victory in the Battle of Iwo Jima

590
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
as of the day before.

591
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,680
The significance of this victory

592
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,519
is extraordinary and important.

593
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,799
We have reason to believe

594
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
that under Chairman Chiang's wise leadership

595
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,799
and the joint efforts of all military and civilians,

596
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,200
working together,

597
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,559
the defeat of Japanese fascism

598
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,039
is just around the corner.

599
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,200
Prepared especially for you.

600
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,160
Though it's not very authentic.

601
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,400
Is this acorn flour noodles?

602
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,759
Wheat flour hasn't been available for a long time.

603
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,200
We can only use acorn flour.

604
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,359
Also added some

605
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,720
rye for baking bread.

606
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:36,480
This is great.

607
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,960
It's been ages since I had noodles.

608
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,920
Take your time.

609
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,480
Thank you, thank you.

610
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,680
The reason we sent you here

611
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,559
is also for another reason.

612
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,680
In recent years, Xiao Tielin

613
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,240
has used the police station

614
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,039
to oversee monopolies

615
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,400
and control over supplies.

616
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,880
He made quite a bit of money on the side.

617
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,119
Currently,

618
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,039
he stays inside the police station.

619
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,000
Almost everything

620
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,839
is handled by one of his

621
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,440
trusted associates from his hometown.

622
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,880
This person takes care of things outside.

623
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,839
And this person used to be in the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

624
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,839
Xiao Tielin

625
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,000
seems to trust him a lot.

626
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,720
Look,

627
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,440
that's him.

628
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,359
Candied hawthorn.

629
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,400
Kid.

630
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,559
Here.

631
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,359
Dad, Mom.

632
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,880
Let Dad give you a hug.

633
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,079
How was today?

634
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,119
What did you learn?

635
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,079
Reading.

636
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,639
What book did you read?

637
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,199
The moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky.

638
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,320
River maples and fishing lights accompany my troubled sleep.

639
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,760
Outside Suzhou city, at Hanshan Temple,

640
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,559
the midnight bell reaches the guest boat.

641
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,119
Dear,

642
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,800
What are they teaching?

643
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,840
You,

644
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,840
was that a poem just now?

645
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:42,480
Alright.

646
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,599
Are all schools like this now?

647
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,440
Maybe.

648
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,280
Let's hire a private tutor.

649
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,119
Let's go.

650
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,639
According to our intel,

651
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,000
Tang Deyuan was once arrested.

652
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,000
After he was released,

653
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,960
he kept working for Xiao Tielin.

654
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,199
They're very close.

655
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:24,119
If we want to capture Xiao Tielin alive,

656
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,119
it might be better

657
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,519
to start with Tang Deyuan.

658
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,199
Old Tang working for the Japanese?

659
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,320
Impossible.

660
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:35,159
He's our

661
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,400
brother through life and death.

662
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,079
Don't jump to conclusions.

663
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,079
It's been so many years.

664
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:41,639
Don't forget,

665
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,360
Old Tang didn't come to Songlin Town back then.

666
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,960
I haven't forgotten.

667
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,199
I remember everything.

668
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:51,599
Platoon Leader.

669
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,239
Uncle Liu, please continue.

670
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,519
After

671
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,440
our recent investigation,

672
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,639
Tang Deyuan hasn't

673
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,039
had direct contact with the Japanese

674
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,159
in any way.

675
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,360
So your mission is

676
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,840
to first try to approach Tang Deyuan,

677
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:11,079
and persuade him to rejoin us.

678
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,239
Then, through him,

679
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,639
try to capture Xiao Tielin alive.

680
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,480
Obtain information about the fortified zone at Datuziling

681
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,800
and the Japanese Border Defense Force's

682
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,639
troop deployment there.

683
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,599
Or any other information

684
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,400
that Xiao Tielin might have.

685
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:30,840
Uncle Liu,

686
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,119
Mudanjiang is a big city.

687
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,320
We're new here,

688
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,480
could you

689
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,880
give us an introduction

690
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,000
to Mudanjiang?

691
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,360
Are there any other

692
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,519
underground anti-Japanese groups?

693
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,800
Let me tell you some good news.

694
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,159
In the mountains between Harbin and Mudanjiang,

695
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,440
in that area,

696
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,960
there are comrades from the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

697
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:54,239
who didn't go to the Soviet Union back then.

698
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,320
According to our intelligence,

699
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,880
over four years ago,

700
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,960
after they retreated into the mountains,

701
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,920
they've been continuing the resistance.

702
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,880
They've rebuilt their base.

703
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,280
They've held out for so long,

704
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,280
it's really not easy.

705
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,639
In Mudanjiang,

706
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,360
enemy agents

707
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,119
are everywhere.

708
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:16,159
Besides the puppet police

709
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,559
who are all over the place,

710
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,920
the Japanese Military Police

711
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,039
and Mudanjiang Tokkō

712
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,280
are our main enemies.

713
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,840
The head of Tokkō is Kawano.

714
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,800
In the past two years,

715
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,360
he has been in charge of

716
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,559
espionage operations against the Soviet Union.

717
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,679
He has arrested and harmed

718
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,480
many of our comrades.

719
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:24,599
The commander of the military police is Zaoki.

720
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,440
He is Kawano's henchman.

721
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,760
Eliminate Kawano when the time is right.

722
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,079
Undermine the Japanese side

723
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,159
and their intelligence infiltration against us

724
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:34,880
and sabotage.

725
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,800
This is also one of your squad's

726
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,000
missions while operating undercover in Mudanjiang.

727
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,320
One of your tasks.

728
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,400
Are there Japanese in the puppet police bureau?

729
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,239
Are there Japanese there?

730
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,760
Yes.

731
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,920
Just like in other places,

732
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,639
the puppet police bureau

733
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,039
Xiao Tielin

734
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,719
is just a puppet appointed by the Japanese.

735
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,559
The real person in control

736
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,760
of the Mudanjiang puppet police bureau

737
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,840
is Morita Saburo.

738
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,840
He is officially the deputy director.

739
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:05,960
Saburo,

740
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,639
Matsushima Kuma was assassinated.

741
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,239
He died for his teacher.

742
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,480
It is his honor.

743
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,480
Twelve years ago,

744
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,840
when I first arrived in Manchukuo,

745
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,000
I encountered the Jingpo Academy

746
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,000
being besieged by rioters.

747
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,360
At that time,

748
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,840
you were the calmest one.

749
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,280
You left a deep impression on me.

750
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,320
Many teachers who came to help

751
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
lost their lives in that incident.

752
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:36,880
It was your arrival

753
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,119
that truly saved us.

754
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,480
So, Morita,

755
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,239
what do you think of the current situation?

756
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,079
What's your opinion?

757
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:45,760
The Pacific front is tough.

758
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,599
The US military is indeed strong.

759
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,039
So many Chinese people

760
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,239
believe now is a good time to resist.

761
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,239
They are preparing to take action.

762
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,599
What about our northern neighbor?

763
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,440
Although the Soviets

764
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,199
have been gathering forces in the Far East,

765
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,000
we have signed a treaty with them.

766
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Before the outcome is decided in Europe,

767
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,639
they won't start a conflict in Manchukuo for now.

768
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,360
However,

769
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,239
their activities in Manchukuo

770
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,119
are becoming more and more rampant.

771
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,440
Our search team outside the city

772
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,239
right under our noses

773
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,280
found three PD-6 Soviet parachutes.

774
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,440
Is it the Soviet army?

775
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,679
It should be our old adversary.

776
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,719
The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Training Brigade.

777
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,880
Also,

778
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,199
Instructor Wang

779
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,320
will arrive in Mudanjiang soon.

780
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,000
The next mission

781
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:44,800
will be led by him.

782
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,920
His code name here

783
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:48,639
is Ji Shu.

784
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,360
Security is very strict here.

785
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,760
Everyone's actions

786
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,920
must be especially cautious.

787
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,039
Be very careful.

788
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,000
Between each squad,

789
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,000
communication is mostly one-way.

790
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,239
You should first go to the place

791
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,920
the organization has arranged for you.

792
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,480
Settle down there.

793
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,079
If you need any help,

794
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,320
come find me here anytime.

795
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,159
Uncle Liu

796
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:15,280
Can we take a look

797
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,199
at the map of Mudanjiang?

798
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,880
Sure.

799
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,199
You eat first.

800
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,639
I'll go get it for you.

801
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:20,599
Okay.

802
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,239
Recently,

803
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,320
near the Datuzi Ridge fortifications,

804
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,920
many spies have been spotted.

805
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,559
There are traces of their activity.

806
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,440
They are clearly very interested

807
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,159
in our fortifications.

808
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:33,880
Also,

809
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,760
Mudanjiang isn't far from Datuzi Ridge.

810
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,320
As far as I know,

811
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,159
the secrecy of the Datuzi Ridge fortifications

812
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:40,920
has always been well maintained.

813
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:44,599
All the Chinese laborers and insiders are dead.

814
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,239
No survivors.

815
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,440
No,

816
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,559
there is still one person.

817
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,480
It's your police bureau's

818
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,800
nominal chief, Xiao Tielin.

819
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,840
He delivers supplies to the fortifications.

820
00:41:59,239 --> 00:41:59,840
Sir,

821
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,280
I've been monitoring him.

822
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,159
He's very clever.

823
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:06,519
For the past two years,

824
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,679
he hasn't left the police bureau.

825
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,000
Please don't worry.

826
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,119
According to our intelligence,

827
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,320
these three targets

828
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,159
are likely heading toward Mudanjiang.

829
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,199
I'll strengthen surveillance in Mudanjiang.

830
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,280
I'll find these three targets.

831
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,599
Besides finding the person who returned from the Soviet Union,

832
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,079
I have a new task for you.

833
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,760
From now on,

834
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,639
you must closely monitor this person.

835
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:37,559
Sir,

836
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,639
I've seen this person before.

837
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,440
He's Xiao Tielin's right-hand man.

838
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,079
He often comes to the bureau to play mahjong with Xiao Tielin.

839
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,280
But why monitor him?

840
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,360
He used to be with the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army.

841
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,480
Watching him now

842
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,639
might yield unexpected results.

843
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,400
Understood.
