1
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:45,840
Come.

2
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,200
Little Wu.

3
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,439
Uncle.

4
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,719
You’re such a sweet talker.

5
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,840
Who’s this?

6
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,280
Sis.

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,920
You came back out of the blue and startled me.

8
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:06,719
Little Wu.

9
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,280
Sis.

10
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,680
This is my son.

11
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,560
Call her Aunt.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,479
Aunt.

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,159
Give me a hug.

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,879
What should he call you?

15
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Kid.

16
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,960
He’s really good-looking.

17
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:19,879
Sis.

18
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:20,639
You came at this hour.

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,719
Hope I’m not interrupting your business.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
Not at all.

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,639
Let’s go.

22
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,879
Let’s go to Aunt’s room.

23
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,280
Come on, let’s go to Aunt’s room.

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,759
Uncle.

25
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,280
Kid.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,280
Come here.

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,639
Take this and eat.

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,560
Thank you, Uncle.

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,599
You’re welcome.

30
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,280
Sis.

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,960
What’s going on in town?

32
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,080
It’s so quiet.

33
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,639
Isn’t it because of the Japanese trouble?

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,199
It’s the same everywhere.

35
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,319
No one’s by the river anymore.

36
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,400
What?

37
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,000
Did you go back to check?

38
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,520
Just passed by.

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,759
These past few years,

40
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,199
no one dares to go there.

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Those making a living at the border,

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,080
the ginseng gatherers,

43
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,240
herb pickers and lumberjacks,

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,080
all avoid that place.

45
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,080
Timber rafters can’t avoid it,

46
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,639
but even they go less often now.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,879
Those who lived dangerously are gone.

48
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,800
No more hosting guests.

49
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,039
Everyone who should leave has left.

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,639
What about my second and third sisters?

51
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,000
The year after you left,

52
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,319
your second sister went to the back hills.

53
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,080
And your third sister?

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,719
She went with someone.

55
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,719
She left with a border worker.

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,319
They all had hard lives.

57
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,759
Not many

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,919
are as fortunate as you.

59
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,159
The newcomers,

60
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,120
they’re all wary of each other.

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,319
Can’t look after both sides.

62
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,719
Like the fast northern current,

63
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,879
just passing by.

64
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,639
It’s nothing like it used to be.

65
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,360
Sis,

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,960
How are you doing?

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Still managing on your own?

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,960
Not looking for someone?

69
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,879
I'm not talking about myself, I'm talking about you.

70
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,919
Did you come back just to visit this time,

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,319
or is there something going on?

72
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,439
To be honest with you, sis,

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,120
my husband ran into some trouble.

74
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,599
We're worried something might go wrong.

75
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,039
So he let me and our child

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,079
come back and hide out for a few days.

77
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,399
Once things settle down,

78
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,560
he'll come pick us up.

79
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,680
No matter what happens,

80
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,920
just stay safe here at home.

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,639
We both saw it with our own eyes.

82
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
There really were agents pretending to be customers.

83
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,720
They left the restaurant and followed Fuqing.

84
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,240
After we shook them off,

85
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,079
they went to the Tokkō.

86
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,160
Waiting to report back.

87
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,759
Didn't expect so many people

88
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,519
were watching that place.

89
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,199
No wonder Old Tang didn't dare talk to us.

90
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:41,759
Also,

91
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,360
at Old Tang's restaurant,

92
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,399
the boss Tian who was eating there

93
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,680
was actually Morita.

94
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,720
He also went to the Tokkō later.

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,480
That's right.

96
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,560
If you ask me,

97
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,439
we should take care of Morita first.

98
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,160
Get rid of him.

99
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,040
Then we'll see

100
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,079
if Old Tang will still work with us.

101
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,759
Stop dilly-dallying.

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,360
Even if we take out Morita,

103
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,920
other Japanese will come.

104
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,480
Getting rid of Morita

105
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,439
will definitely give Tang Deyuan

106
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,680
a chance to breathe.

107
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,000
Besides, Morita

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,680
has been targeting Xiao Tielin.

109
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,879
If we eliminate him,

110
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,480
even if the Japanese

111
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
send someone else over,

112
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,720
it'll take some time.

113
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,920
By then, the police station

114
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,439
will be in total chaos.

115
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,120
Maybe

116
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,240
that's our chance to go after Xiao Tielin.

117
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,480
It's a good opportunity to strike.

118
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,920
So what should we do?

119
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,120
I'll disguise myself as a Japanese,

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,399
get close to Morita and take him out.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,360
We've all shown our faces at the restaurant.

122
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,839
We need someone new.

123
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,560
I'll report this to our superiors.

124
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,439
Xiaogui,

125
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,839
Are you okay?

126
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,199
I'm fine.

127
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,639
I had a nightmare and my leg cramped.

128
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,040
Are you really okay?

129
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm fine, Deyuan.

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,399
That's the whole situation.

131
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,720
So,

132
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,759
I want to ask the organization

133
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
to help us out.

134
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,480
Go ahead.

135
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,120
Eliminate Morita from the police station.

136
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,079
And this matter

137
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,000
must not involve Tang Deyuan.

138
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,519
Come again next time.

139
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,399
Hello, sir.

140
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,439
We're closed now.

141
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,600
Oh, it's you.

142
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,720
Please, come in.

143
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,680
You have a new mission.

144
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,560
The man in the car is Morita.

145
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,519
Figure out his routine.

146
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,639
Find a chance to kill him.

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,560
Because of our recent actions,

148
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,519
a series of operations,

149
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,519
they've become more cautious.

150
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,720
Stay for two more days.

151
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,480
Why stay here?

152
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,560
It's not easy

153
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,560
to come all the way to Mudanjiang.

154
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,800
I thought I'd show you around.

155
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,439
Isn't Harbin even bigger?

156
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,439
We should walk around both.

157
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,519
Is that okay?

158
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,680
Sure, I like walking around.

159
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,519
No, I need to go to the bathroom.

160
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,120
Don't move.

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,879
Come with me.

162
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,600
Brother Yunhu.

163
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,080
Who’s your brother?

164
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,120
I went to Tiantian Hao Da Restaurant to look for you.

165
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,919
They said you’d already left.

166
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,720
I want to ask you something.

167
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,360
Ask what?

168
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,000
Are you with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army?

169
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,720
What do you do?

170
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,159
Who sent you here?

171
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,440
Looks like I guessed right.

172
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,399
You didn’t guess anything.

173
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,200
My real name is Liu Wanchun.

174
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,679
Comrade Han Guang sent me.

175
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,320
Brother Yunhu.

176
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,399
I just saw you.

177
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,279
I really couldn’t leave just like that.

178
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,399
So I thought,

179
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,000
I’d take a risk and come ask you.

180
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,639
Then how did you know who I am?

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,960
I’m with Xiaohongzao

182
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,879
in the same opera troupe.

183
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,799
When she was chatting with me,

184
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,960
she mentioned what you did in Songlin Town.

185
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,360
When I was at Tiantian Hao Da Restaurant

186
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,240
performing,

187
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,360
I was also watching you.

188
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,320
Plus,

189
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,840
you showed up in Mudanjiang

190
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,519
at that place and time.

191
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,519
So I figured

192
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,840
you must be one of us.

193
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,000
The Party Central Committee is in Yan'an.

194
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,519
It has already established

195
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
a special Northeast Work Committee.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,159
At the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Bureau

197
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,039
and the Shandong Bureau,

198
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,559
they have also set up

199
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,279
special Northeast Work Committees.

200
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,399
Over the years, many people have been sent

201
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,000
outside the pass

202
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,120
to restore organizations and search for the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

203
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,559
Comrade Han Guang

204
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,120
is from the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Bureau

205
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,519
and is specifically in charge of Northeast affairs.

206
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,840
After I received the assignment,

207
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,679
I came to the Northeast.

208
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,960
I've been with the opera troupe for over two years.

209
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,759
Traveling all over the place,

210
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
looking for traces of the troops.

211
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,759
Some time ago,

212
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,399
Comrade Han Guang received instructions from Yan'an

213
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,159
to make sure I come to Mudanjiang

214
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,960
and find the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

215
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,720
Then reestablish contact with Yan'an.

216
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,279
So how can you prove

217
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,240
what you say is true?

218
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,919
I can't prove it.

219
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,720
When I left the pass back then,

220
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,200
to avoid inspection,

221
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,960
I burned all my documents.

222
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,559
Let me tell you,

223
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,639
the situation has changed now.

224
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,559
The Communist Party-led

225
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,240
Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army

226
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,960
have already launched local counterattacks.

227
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,039
Besides attacking the Japanese puppet army's

228
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,480
weakly defended strongholds

229
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,639
and transportation lines,

230
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,559
they are carrying out continuous offensive operations.

231
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,679
They have also sent troops to the outer lines,

232
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,639
advancing toward Henan,

233
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,000
the Hunan-Guangdong border,

234
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,480
and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui border.

235
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,240
Let me give you another good news.

236
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,159
Yan'an

237
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,000
is holding the Party's Seventh National Congress.

238
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,279
They are preparing for a major counteroffensive against Japan.

239
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:08,919
Getting ready.

240
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,000
Organizationally,

241
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,360
the Mudanjiang contact points provided

242
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,039
I've visited them all.

243
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,360
The Xinyi Trading Company on Guanshe Street now

244
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,279
used to be called Dayou Trading Company.

245
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,679
It was a contact place for the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army comrades.

246
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,039
It's been withdrawn.

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,039
You can verify this.

248
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,519
Today, I caught a lead.

249
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,240
He said he was acting on orders from Yan'an,

250
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,639
sent by the Party organization inside the pass.

251
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,919
How did he target you?

252
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:40,919
He

253
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,519
plays the banhu in an opera troupe.

254
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,080
There's a performer in that troupe

255
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,919
named Xiaohongzao.

256
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,039
I know her.

257
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,440
She helped me in Songlin Town.

258
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,879
He probably heard it from her.

259
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,919
Opera troupe—

260
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,679
that's a place full of all sorts of people.

261
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,080
It's a good place to hide.

262
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:55,720
Yes.

263
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,600
Eat.

264
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,919
There's also red sausage.

265
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,039
It's hot.

266
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,639
He said,

267
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,639
he was sent by Comrade Han Guang.

268
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,600
He came all the way from the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei region

269
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,840
to Northeast China to find the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,799
He even knew about

271
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,960
the contact point we closed before.

272
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,879
Dayou Trading Company.

273
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,639
And the way we exchanged information.

274
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,679
He described it in great detail.

275
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,799
I don't think he made it up.

276
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,039
So what did you agree with him?

277
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,720
I told him to go

278
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,679
wait for me at Anji Company tomorrow.

279
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,039
Squad Leader,

280
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,679
I know doing this

281
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,399
is a bit risky.

282
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,320
But haven't we always

283
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,919
been longing

284
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
to find the Party Central Committee?

285
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,840
Dayou Trading Company really was

286
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,360
our old contact point.

287
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,759
But just knowing this

288
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,240
isn't enough to prove if he's genuine.

289
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,360
If he really is from the Party Central Committee

290
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,440
sent here to look for us,

291
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,840
he can't just say it without proof.

292
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,960
Did he say anything else?

293
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,519
He did.

294
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,320
He said a secret code.

295
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,960
"Yong King, the tides change at sea"

296
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,879
"Twenty-eight lanterns shine upon your grace." (Note: This is a code phrase.)

297
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,360
That's right.

298
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,919
He said as long as we pass this phrase

299
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,639
back to the camp,

300
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,480
we can report directly to Commander Zhou.

301
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,039
I need to report this to our superiors

302
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,080
right away.

303
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,399
If it really is the Party Central Committee

304
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,879
coming here to look for

305
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,679
clues about us,

306
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,960
that's incredibly valuable.

307
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,240
Why are you calling me?

308
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,600
I still need to go back

309
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,639
and keep your sister-in-law company.

310
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,919
Deyuan,

311
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,879
you won't let me go out.

312
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,440
Just sit and chat with me.

313
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,879
Sit down.

314
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:03,759
Deyuan,

315
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
thank you for taking me in.

316
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,600
And for treating my leg.

317
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,279
Now you’re someone important.

318
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,039
Always greeting and seeing people off.

319
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,679
Smiling at everyone you meet.

320
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,120
And dressing so well.

321
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,039
I'm happy for you.

322
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,919
Really.

323
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,639
But honestly, seeing all this

324
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,320
still feels a bit awkward.

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,759
Why does it feel awkward?

326
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,720
The squad leader and I

327
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,879
got separated crossing the river.

328
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,879
I don’t know where they went after.

329
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,960
I have no idea.

330
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,480
Where were you then?

331
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,559
I don’t know either.

332
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,919
I never thought in this life

333
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,519
the few of us

334
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,720
could get together again.

335
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,679
Being together

336
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,080
is really nice.

337
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,200
Is it?

338
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,200
Being together

339
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,440
is good?

340
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,840
Why wouldn’t it be?

341
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,200
Did you forget what the squad leader said back then?

342
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,120
We have to rejoin the unit.

343
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,039
Gui’er,

344
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,440
listen to me.

345
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,879
If you want to survive,

346
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,399
stay away from them.

347
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,320
Deyuan,

348
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,840
you can't bear to leave your restaurant

349
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,600
and your family business, right?

350
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,240
Of course I can't bear to.

351
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,080
What are you thinking?

352
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,200
Then let me say something unlucky.

353
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,120
Go ahead.

354
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,320
As long as the Japanese are here,

355
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,279
your good days won't last.

356
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,720
Unless you want to be their dog.

357
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,200
You think being a dog is easy?

358
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:23,960
Let me tell you,

359
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,279
right now,

360
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,559
at best, I'm just a worm.

361
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,559
I'm leaving.

362
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,519
De Yuan, you can't fool me.

363
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,000
You're not that kind of person.

364
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,680
Since the year I joined the team,

365
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,480
I've only admired two people.

366
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,000
You and the squad leader.

367
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,599
The past

368
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,119
has nothing to do with now.

369
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,759
If it doesn't matter, why did you take me in?

370
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,720
Get your leg healed,

371
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:57,960
then you leave too.

372
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,680
Alright.

373
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,440
After confirming with Commander Zhou himself,

374
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,480
everything checks out.

375
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,079
Liu Wanchun's identity is genuine.

376
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:43,640
That's great.

377
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,680
Please.

378
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,599
I won't stand on ceremony.

379
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,039
Teacher.

380
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,519
Recently, a suspicious person showed up at Xinyi Trading Company.

381
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,519
Is he from the Training Brigade?

382
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,400
No.

383
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,880
This person is called Liu Banhu.

384
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,519
He came to the Northeast from inland two years ago

385
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,680
and has been with the opera troupe ever since.

386
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,519
We suspect he was sent by Yan'an

387
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,319
to reestablish contact with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

388
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,960
I first saw him at the opening of Tang's restaurant.

389
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,000
He was performing there with the troupe.

390
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,119
Liu Banhu.

391
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,519
Yes.

392
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,839
Banhu is the instrument he plays.

393
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,400
So,

394
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,920
Tang Deyuan was not only with the Anti-Japanese Army,

395
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,319
but also has ties to the Communist Party in the interior.

396
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,559
His wife has a special connection with the troupe.

397
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,319
Keep following Liu Banhu.

398
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,599
Closely watch who he contacts in Mudanjiang.

399
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,200
Tang Deyuan is a key figure.

400
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,160
The student group will step up surveillance on him.

401
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,960
I'll leave the arrest of Liu Banhu to you.

402
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,960
Once you catch him,

403
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,160
I want to interrogate him myself.

404
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,240
Alright.

405
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,200
Understood.

406
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,799
Huixian Teahouse.

407
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,200
There's an open courtyard.

408
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,480
It has front and back doors.

409
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,599
All the nearby alleys are connected.

410
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,440
No dead ends.

411
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,200
I'll wait for you at the teahouse.

412
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,559
Fuqing will keep watch.

413
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,519
If anything happens,

414
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,200
we'll use the code to communicate.

415
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,559
Adapt as needed.

416
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,279
Wild goods.

417
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,799
Selling wild goods.

418
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,319
One order of steamed dumplings.

419
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:20,559
Alright.

420
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,680
Wild goods.

421
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,559
After you eat, come with me.

422
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,559
Mushrooms, pine nuts.

423
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,720
Hazelnuts, black fungus.

424
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,640
Wild goods, selling wild goods.

425
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,319
Mushrooms, black fungus.

426
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,799
Pine nuts, hazelnuts.

427
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,680
Mushrooms, black fungus.

428
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
Hazelnuts, pine nuts.

429
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,920
Boss.

430
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,559
I'll leave it here.

431
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,400
Alright, alright.

432
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,279
Take care.

433
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,440
Wild goods.

434
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,960
Selling wild goods.

435
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,359
Hazelnuts, pine nuts.

436
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,359
Mushrooms, black fungus.

437
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,559
Selling wild goods.

438
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:06,839
Buy some wild goods.

439
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,279
Selling wild goods.

440
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,119
Here, your wine.

441
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,200
Sir, you've arrived.

442
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,000
Please come inside.

443
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,279
Pine nuts, hazelnuts, walnut kernels.

444
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,440
Cigarettes.

445
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,440
Cigarettes.

446
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,640
Take care.

447
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,319
I have a question.

448
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:15,759
Go ahead.

449
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,920
What year did you join the Party?

450
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,240
January, 1937.

451
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Who introduced you?

452
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:26,960
Han Guang.

453
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,039
Ma Shangde.

454
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
When did you arrive here?

455
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:32,559
How did you get here?

456
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,480
March, 1942.

457
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,799
By boat, landed at Yingkou.

458
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:39,960
Were you alone?

459
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,160
There were four others.

460
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,359
Tian Changfeng.

461
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,119
Gu Shuiliang.

462
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
Li Zaiqi.

463
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,640
Shen Yanqiu.

464
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:52,960
They all died.

465
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,079
Sorry about that.

466
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,160
There are too many enemy spies around.

467
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,559
We have to be extra cautious.

468
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,000
Hello, comrade.

469
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,680
Finally found you.

470
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,319
We’re all family here, no need for formalities.

471
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:24,960
According to the organization’s rules,

472
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
it’s right for you to be careful.

473
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,119
Fresh tea from Jiangnan just arrived.

474
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,000
Fresh Jiangnan tea is here.

475
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:50,440
Come in.

476
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:58,720
Director Morita.

477
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,720
Liubanhu went to meet someone unusual.

478
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,200
He’s left with that person now.

479
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,079
Our people are watching them.

480
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,000
What?

481
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,839
Xiaowuzi.

482
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,240
Enjoying a good life, huh?

483
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Living in such a big house.

484
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,279
Only a few get this kind of treatment.

485
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,920
Besides Aisin Gioro,

486
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,160
it’s just the two of us.

487
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,880
Work hard, make good money.

488
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,240
Work hard, make good money.

489
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,440
Hurry up, lead the way.

490
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,720
Yes.

491
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,839
Director

492
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,559
Director, Director

493
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:23,759
Director

494
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,759
So I raised you all for nothing, huh?

495
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,119
Count every step for me

496
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,839
Right?

497
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,920
Sorry, Director

498
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,839
Sorry to you

499
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,960
Where did you go?

500
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,160
They said they went to catch the Communists

501
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,680
Communists

502
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:42,759
Catch

503
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,640
Catch, catch

504
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,720
Watch closely

505
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,720
Tianhao Grand Restaurant

506
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,240
Deyuan,

507
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,319
Brother,

508
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,160
What are you busy with?

509
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,279
What else could I be busy with?

510
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,200
What's up? Something happened?

511
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Last time,

512
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
about what I told you,

513
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,400
Things have been tense lately.

514
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,480
While business is still good,

515
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,440
we should quickly find a new place.

516
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:49,799
The problem is,

517
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,839
the west,

518
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,200
the south,

519
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,319
and the north are all stirring.

520
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,039
This wave

521
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,559
has already reached Mudanjiang.

522
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,359
Pack up your valuables quickly.

523
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,759
Let's find a safe place.

524
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,039
No problem.

525
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,359
Got it.

526
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,319
No. 54 Yuanshan Road

527
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,640
Dayou Trading Company on Guanshe Street

528
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,559
They've all withdrawn.

529
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,400
I don't know if in Mudanjiang now

530
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,920
there are still people like you

531
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,240
who have lost contact

532
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,759
with the Central Committee, Anti-Japanese fighters.

533
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:37,839
There are.

534
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,599
That's great.

535
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,799
Some time ago,

536
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
at Anfu Inn in Songlin Town,

537
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,200
we re-established a liaison post.

538
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,000
As long as you

539
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,160
connect with the Party organization in Songlin Town,

540
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,880
make contact,

541
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,319
and get from Yan'an

542
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,759
the radio contact codebook I was asked to pass to you,

543
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,200
the radio contact codebook,

544
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,759
then you can directly

545
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,200
get in touch with Yan'an.

546
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,200
Songlin Town.

547
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,680
Yunhu.

548
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,079
I'm familiar.

549
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:07,799
What's wrong?

550
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,599
I'm fine, go on.

551
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,039
Here's the thing.

552
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
In the past, in Songlin Town,

553
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,279
we also had a liaison post.

554
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,839
But the Japanese wiped it out.

555
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,480
Now it's finally been re-established.

556
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
That's really great.

557
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,400
Director.

558
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,279
Where are they?

559
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,640
They're inside.

560
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,240
They followed from Anji Company all the way here.

561
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,880
How many people?

562
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
Three people.

563
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,799
We don't know about the others yet.

564
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,680
We already have two people guarding the back door.

565
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,480
Surround them.

566
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:49,880
Yes.

567
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,119
The rest, come with me.

568
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,200
Pine nuts, hazelnuts,

569
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,359
walnut kernels,

570
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,559
mountain goods.

571
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
monkey head mushroom.

572
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,640
Two big mushrooms.

573
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,799
Five monkey head mushrooms.

574
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:14,880
Darn it.

575
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,319
We've got a tail.

576
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,039
I'll go distract them.

577
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,480
Spread out and sit.

578
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,599
Monkey head mushroom.

579
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,480
Monkey head mushroom.

580
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,640
Cigarettes.

581
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:00,960
Hello sir, what would you like to drink?

582
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,160
A cup of tea, please.

583
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,559
Alright, coming right up.

584
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,960
Please enjoy your meal, sir.

585
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:14,920
Don't move.

586
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,279
Let's go.

587
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,559
Let's talk somewhere else.

588
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,280
Li Zhenghao

589
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,800
Hurry, go this way!

590
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,599
Yunhu, go!

591
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,800
Hurry!

592
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,039
Go!

593
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,599
Quick, this way!

594
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:07,559
What’s wrong?

595
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,760
I’m getting old.

596
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,920
I can’t outrun bullets anymore.

597
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,800
Platoon leader.

598
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,239
Fu Qing and I will draw the enemy away.

599
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,920
You go first.

600
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:15,639
Okay.

601
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,239
Be careful.

602
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,559
Come on, get up.

603
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:19,599
Hurry!

604
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,440
Get up!

605
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,760
Go!

606
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,159
Block off this road!

607
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,760
Yes!

608
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,440
After them!

609
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,320
Hurry up!

610
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,159
That way!

611
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:12,599
That way!

612
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,519
Papers.

613
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,400
Here.

614
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,639
Any suspicious people found?

615
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,000
No.

616
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:00,679
Keep searching.

617
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,119
Yes.

618
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:04,599
Come here, come here.

619
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,239
Damn, it's a dead end.

620
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,199
This way.

621
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,159
Come.

622
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:35,440
Come.

623
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,039
Come.

624
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:50,920
Go, quickly!

625
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,239
I can't leave.

626
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,800
We've never abandoned

627
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,719
any comrade.

628
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,199
Go!

629
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,239
I wish I could meet more comrades.

630
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,079
Hurry, go!

631
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:16,679
Shoot!

632
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,360
Look at that.

633
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:28,679
See?

634
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,280
It’s still bleeding, look.

635
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,159
Who is that?

636
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,320
A Japanese officer just said,

637
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,639
it’s a Communist.

638
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,360
How awful!

639
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,559
The Japanese are so cruel.

640
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,360
That’s outrageous.

641
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,159
Look over there.

642
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:45,880
There’s still blood.

643
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,639
You think of me in the dead of night,

644
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,840
and play the yaoqin for me.

645
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:25,639
I think of you at midnight,

646
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,239
and go to the garden to offer incense.

647
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:38,679
You think of me in the study,

648
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,960
unable to focus on the classics.

649
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:54,480
I think of you in the embroidery room,

650
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,599
too distracted to embroider mandarin ducks.
