1
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,799
Thanks to Captain Zaoji's recommendation,

2
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,519
I had the honor of meeting Section Chief Kawa.

3
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,319
Section Chief Zhao said

4
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,560
someone wants to kill me.

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,359
Yes.

6
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
It's absolutely true.

7
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,120
I heard it myself.

8
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,879
There have always been many

9
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,840
who want to kill me.

10
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,960
I don't mind adding one more.

11
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,000
But

12
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
this person is different.

13
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,360
He's Xiao Tielin.

14
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,360
A favorite of Director Xiao.

15
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,319
Since Director Morita left,

16
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,520
I've been concerned about

17
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:35,680
Director Xiao

18
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,599
and the safety at the police station.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,599
I'm willing to stay at the station

20
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,639
and help Section Chief Kawa

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
keep an eye on their every move.

22
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,280
Good.

23
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,879
Section Chief Zhao has done well.

24
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,159
Our Great Japanese Empire

25
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,319
needs loyal subjects like you.

26
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,560
Yes.

27
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,080
I'll let you get back to work.

28
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,240
I'm leaving now.

29
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,439
The fish are starving.

30
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,879
They'll take the bait soon.

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,520
Hold the fishing rod

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,560
a little tighter.

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,800
Send someone.

34
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,360
Alright.

35
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
Keep a close watch on Tang Deyuan's house.

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,639
Okay.

37
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,400
Every move he makes

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,960
and everywhere he goes

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,159
report directly to me.

40
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,599
Understood.

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,120
You go watch him yourself.

42
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:41,800
Alright.

43
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,680
While you were away these past few days,

44
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,840
something happened.

45
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,520
A warehouse by Xiaye River

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,400
was burned down.

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,840
Our people investigated.

48
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,919
It was filled with

49
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,039
Xiao Tielin's

50
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,719
stockpiled opium.

51
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,000
I think

52
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,079
Tang Deyuan probably did it.

53
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,399
Luckily, it's a deserted area.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,040
No one lives for miles around.

55
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,560
It was a good deed.

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,600
If Old Tang really did it,

57
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,800
there's nothing more to say.

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,839
It's clear what Old Tang is thinking.

59
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,040
Now

60
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,360
there's this trouble with Kawa.

61
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
For our nation and our families,

62
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,480
Platoon Leader,

63
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,160
what do you think?

64
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,439
Shouldn't we meet Old Tang

65
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,120
one more time?

66
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,920
Let him tell us himself

67
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,639
what he's thinking.

68
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:47,879
Yes.

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,800
I'm just worried

70
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,959
Old Tang might act alone.

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,360
Fuqing,

72
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
you keep

73
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,680
watching outside Deyuan's house.

74
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,120
Wait for a chance to call him out.

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,959
We'll meet him.

76
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,439
Alright.

77
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,439
What if he won't come with me?

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,560
To be blunt,

79
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,720
now is the best time

80
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
to win him over.

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,120
Tell him this:

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,519
Say we've

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,000
already got information on Kawa.

84
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Calm him down first.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,199
Don't let him

86
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,360
do anything rash.

87
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,040
Got it.

88
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,199
Let's do it.

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,079
So,

90
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,079
what about Xiaogui?

91
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,800
What should we do with Xiaogui?

92
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,160
Deyuan has now

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,959
sold his restaurant.

94
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,079
Xiaogui has nowhere to stay.

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,480
I found him

96
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,439
a temporary place to stay.

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,160
He keeps saying he wants to leave Mudanjiang.

98
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,319
Seems like he knows something.

99
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,920
Xiaogui

100
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,560
we can't give up on him either.

101
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,680
Even after the tiger shackles, you still have guts.

102
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,920
You're a real hero from the Northeast resistance base.

103
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,480
Truly not afraid of death.

104
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Hurry up.

105
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,279
My life is all I have.

106
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,839
You think dying is too easy.

107
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,639
Now that you're here,

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,680
it's not just about getting shot.

109
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:42,800
Well?

110
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,519
Think it over again.

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,560
Hurry up.

112
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,319
Don't waste my time being reborn.

113
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,399
You're a real man.

114
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,480
Have you heard of the plague?

115
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,480
After death,

116
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
the corpse turns purple-black.

117
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,360
Anyone infected with the plague

118
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,080
will look like this within three days.

119
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
Let me show you something else.

120
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,879
This is anthrax.

121
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,759
If you get infected with these bacteria,

122
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,159
you won't die so quickly.

123
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,320
It takes about ten days.

124
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,120
Your body will be covered in lumps.

125
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,080
The lumps turn into blisters.

126
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,159
The blisters will all rot away.

127
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,279
As you would say,

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,360
not a patch of skin left intact.

129
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,360
What you see are their memorial photos.

130
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,399
Do you know after the photos are taken,

131
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
where they go?

132
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,159
After the photos, they're sent to the dissection room.

133
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,840
Their illness is observed.

134
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,679
If they're lucky, they die quickly.

135
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,919
If not,

136
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,519
they keep "contributing."

137
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,559
Alive, watching themselves being cut open.

138
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,559
Not knowing which organ

139
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,960
will be taken before they die.

140
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,759
All the ways to die are here.

141
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,200
You choose.

142
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,120
Whatever.

143
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,240
Lift him up.

144
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:25,639
Hello.

145
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,639
Number 490.

146
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,960
Don't move.

147
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,720
This is the interrogation record of a Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army captive.

148
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,279
Injection.

149
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,879
Number 490.

150
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,600
The trials you've faced before

151
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,120
were all physical.

152
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,679
But this one

153
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,799
is the best fuel

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,159
we give our soldiers.

155
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,919
It can make you burn,

156
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,039
or make you explode.

157
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,240
From deep within your soul,

158
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,200
you'll come to love it.

159
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,559
Kid,

160
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,919
your leg—

161
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,799
let me take a look.

162
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,919
Section Chief Kawa also asked me to tell you

163
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,320
your mission

164
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,440
is to get close to them as soon as possible,

165
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,159
report their hideout

166
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,279
and their plans

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
to Section Chief Kawa in time.

168
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,480
Understood.

169
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,759
They will come.

170
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,480
They will come.

171
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,080
Section Chief Kawa's methods

172
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
you know well.

173
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,120
Those useless to the plan

174
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,600
will be punished.

175
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,919
Uncle

176
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,639
When did you get here?

177
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,200
I've been here for a while.

178
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Uncle,

179
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,080
I'm begging you.

180
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,120
Take me with you.

181
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:25,919
Can you?

182
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,320
I don't want to die here.

183
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,720
Do you not trust me?

184
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,279
If I didn't trust you,

185
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,559
why would I still care about you?

186
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,159
Uncle

187
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,720
Tell me,

188
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,240
if someone makes a deadly mistake,

189
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,639
does that mean

190
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,759
they don't even get a chance to turn back?

191
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
Don't overthink it.

192
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,600
In this world,

193
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,879
there's no obstacle you can't get past.

194
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,919
Everyone gets confused sometimes.

195
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,639
If you want to turn back,

196
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,159
it's never too late.

197
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,000
I wish it could really be like that.

198
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,919
Look,

199
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
even a car that takes the wrong turn

200
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,759
can still get back on track.

201
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,480
Let alone people.

202
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,240
Uncle

203
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,720
If I'm reborn in the next life,

204
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,200
I'll be your nephew again.

205
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,279
Is that okay?

206
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,679
Stop talking nonsense.

207
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,759
This life isn't over yet.

208
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,799
If in the next life

209
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,799
we're still connected,

210
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,480
you'll be my son.

211
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,440
My own son.

212
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,799
How about that?

213
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,960
It's windy outside now.

214
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,799
It'll sting your skin.

215
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,840
Just stay inside, don't go out.

216
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,320
I'll get medicine for you tomorrow.

217
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,120
You'll get better.

218
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,559
You will.

219
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,519
Section Chief Kawa is very cunning.

220
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,240
He often uses decoys.

221
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,319
So,

222
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,000
you must be sure to tell them apart.

223
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,799
Does he

224
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,359
have any distinguishing features?

225
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,240
According to Yunhu's description,

226
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,240
Uncle Liu

227
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,359
Why did you come looking for me here?

228
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,480
What’s wrong?

229
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,559
Don’t trust my skills?

230
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,599
Want someone else to treat you?

231
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,599
No.

232
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,799
No matter how fast you run,

233
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,720
you can’t get out of Mudanjiang.

234
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,079
Even if you escape Mudanjiang,

235
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,920
can you escape the Japanese?

236
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,680
What are you doing?

237
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,279
Thinking of leaving your father behind again?

238
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Uncle Liu, I’m not running.

239
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,880
I’m staying.

240
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,279
I was going to look for you.

241
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,359
Looks like you forgot.

242
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,160
It’s easy to die.

243
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,079
But dying well,

244
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,079
isn’t easy.

245
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,119
Uncle Liu

246
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,240
What is it?

247
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,839
Give me some medicine.

248
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
I’ll be able to finish my mission better.

249
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,400
I can prove myself.

250
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,599
Last time you reported,

251
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:08,960
you’d already infiltrated

252
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,079
the base of the Three Fish.

253
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:11,920
Section Chief Kawa

254
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,559
rushed back to Mudanjiang overnight.

255
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
But what happened?

256
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,799
They weren’t here.

257
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,240
I don’t know.

258
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,640
I thought

259
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,279
when they took me away,

260
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:24,640
it was to bring me back to the team.

261
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
To let me stay with them.

262
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,279
I didn’t expect

263
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,279
they’d leave me here.

264
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:30,680
I’m sure I can

265
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,160
find out the base location.

266
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:54,839
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

267
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,079
Thank you.

268
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,319
Uncle Liu

269
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,319
Uncle Liu

270
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,000
Uncle Liu

271
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:01,839
Uncle Liu

272
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,720
You want medicine, right?

273
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,000
Trade me solid

274
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,839
important progress for it.

275
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,880
Uncle Liu

276
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:26,920
Uncle Liu

277
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,000
Uncle Liu

278
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,680
Uncle Liu

279
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,079
You want to use the medicine, right?

280
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,680
Bring solid evidence

281
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,039
and trade it for important progress.

282
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,599
Your task

283
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,880
is to get close to them as soon as possible.

284
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,480
Find out where they're staying

285
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,759
and their action plans.

286
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,880
Report everything to Section Chief Kawa promptly.

287
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,839
Understood.

288
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,640
Now keep a close watch on Tang Deyuan.

289
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,240
Boss Tang,

290
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,519
Tongchun sent you some pastries.

291
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,359
Why are you here?

292
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
The Platoon Leader wants to see you.

293
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
He has news about Kawa.

294
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,480
I'll wait for him at Bao Bureau.

295
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:39,880
Alright.

296
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,079
Platoon Leader

297
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,960
How about I go with you?

298
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,319
It's not safe for you alone.

299
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,680
I'll talk to Deyuan by myself.

300
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,039
It's easier that way.

301
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,759
He doesn't have

302
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,920
anything else on his mind now.

303
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,319
If anything happens,

304
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,039
meet me at the back door.

305
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,640
They're here.

306
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,240
Two people.

307
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,119
Yes, at the Da Dongbao Bureau.

308
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
It's Section Chief Zhao.

309
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,000
Deyuan.

310
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,480
About the child.

311
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,680
I know you're upset.

312
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,200
I'm not upset.

313
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,839
I just want revenge now.

314
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,119
Tell me.

315
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,319
Where is Section Chief Kawa?

316
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,559
The mission to assassinate Kawa

317
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,839
is handled by another team.

318
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,680
They're in charge.

319
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,759
It's no longer

320
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,240
just your personal vendetta.

321
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,039
It's for our nation and our families.

322
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,839
Let's take revenge together, okay?

323
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,359
Right now, I only care about my family's pain.

324
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,799
Where is Section Chief Kawa?

325
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,559
Not going to say, huh?

326
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,440
Can you let me finish?

327
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,200
News about Kawa

328
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,359
I'll definitely tell you.

329
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,799
Speak up, you useless fool.

330
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,759
I... I have intel.

331
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,559
Someone from the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

332
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,680
came looking for Tang Deyuan.

333
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,160
They entered Da Dongbao Bureau.

334
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,400
They came over here.

335
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,440
It's us.

336
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,160
The former Platoon Leader.

337
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,279
The big fish has taken the bait.

338
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,759
Keep an eye on them for me.

339
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,160
My intel is reliable.

340
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,160
Uncle Liu.

341
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:56,960
I... I...

342
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,599
Can I go to the clinic?

343
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,240
If I don't get my shot soon...

344
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,000
Uncle Liu.

345
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:06,720
Uncle Liu.

346
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,720
Uncle Liu.

347
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,960
Uncle Liu.

348
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,039
Our mission

349
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,880
is to scout out Datuzi Ridge Fortress.

350
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:24,640
The fortified area.

351
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,440
That means the fortress's

352
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,680
defensive arrangements.

353
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,680
What does that mean?

354
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,640
For example,

355
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:38,559
the exact troop numbers and types,

356
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,759
and weapon placements.

357
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,960
As much information as possible.

358
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,839
What does any of this have to do with me?

359
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,160
Xiao Tielin.

360
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,240
He most likely

361
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,920
has this crucial intel.

362
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,160
How do you know

363
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,279
he has it?

364
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:54,920
Back then,

365
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,000
Xiao Tielin and his Bohu Regiment

366
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,960
were in charge of the outer defenses here,

367
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,960
including some

368
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,720
core fortifications,

369
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,599
personnel and supply distribution,

370
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,599
and transporting some laborers.

371
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,559
Everyone in the Bohu Regiment

372
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,559
so many people,

373
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,160
all suddenly disappeared.

374
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Now there's only

375
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,519
Xiao Tielin left.

376
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,400
If we catch him,

377
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,119
we can get

378
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,720
this vital intel from him.

379
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,000
And our fighters

380
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,960
will shed much less blood.

381
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,480
You mean you want me to help you

382
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,240
capture Xiao Tielin, right?

383
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,160
Yes.

384
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,119
Right now, only you

385
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,319
can get close to him.

386
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,640
Stop thinking about it.

387
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,559
I know.

388
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,680
Xiao Tielin is no good.

389
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,079
But he did save my life once.

390
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,160
Besides,

391
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,880
even if you catch him,

392
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,440
can you really

393
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,160
make sure he'll obey you

394
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,920
and do as you say?

395
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,680
Deyuan,

396
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,440
we've fought so many battles.

397
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,039
Which fight was ever decided

398
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,480
right from the start?

399
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,480
Battles are won with intelligence,

400
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,200
strength,

401
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,400
and belief.

402
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,240
Sometimes,

403
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,640
you need a bit of luck too.

404
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,759
He's been in there for ages.

405
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,599
Why isn't he out yet?

406
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,319
What's the rush?

407
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,759
It's not that simple.

408
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,279
The Platoon Leader is still talking.

409
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,440
And it's not like

410
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,640
it has to work out today.

411
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,440
What do you mean?

412
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,680
What do I mean?

413
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,599
Figure it out yourself.

414
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:48,480
First,

415
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,039
with Old Tang's temper,

416
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
you can't convince him

417
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,000
with just a few words.

418
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:52,519
Second,

419
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,839
his family went through so much.

420
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,720
He's still holding onto anger.

421
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,519
They might fall out today.

422
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,200
Third,

423
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,039
Enough already.

424
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,000
Stop listing things like Zhuge Liang.

425
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,279
Are you trying to act smart with me?

426
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,200
First,

427
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
if we can't get

428
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,000
Old Tang back on our side,

429
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,000
he's in danger.

430
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,000
Second,

431
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Our Platoon Leader always says,

432
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:11,799
as long as we survive,

433
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,759
we won't be scattered.

434
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,039
We're all together,

435
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,440
brothers through life and death.

436
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:16,599
Even now,

437
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
I don't believe Old Tang would just

438
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,440
Right?

439
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:21,759
Right.

440
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,599
Third,

441
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,279
besides finding Old Tang,

442
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:24,920
do we have any other options?

443
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,400
I'm asking you,

444
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,359
do we have any other way?

445
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,640
Yeah, you're right.

446
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,440
I was wrong.

447
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,759
Are you still arguing with me?

448
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,759
You keep arguing.

449
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,240
I can't win against you.

450
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,039
Right now,

451
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,200
arrogant Germany

452
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,839
has already surrendered unconditionally.

453
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,839
Fascism has collapsed.

454
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,279
And at home,

455
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,920
the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army

456
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,319
have started their counterattack.

457
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,720
Now in Yan'an,

458
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,799
the Party's Seventh Congress is underway,

459
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,839
preparing for the final offensive.

460
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,079
And us,

461
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:57,559
we're not like before,

462
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,960
helpless at Guaizi River,

463
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,839
leaderless Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

464
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,319
Now,

465
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,720
timing,

466
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,119
strength,

467
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:09,519
and luck

468
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,359
are all on our side.

469
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,400
Xiao Tielin may be full of evil,

470
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,240
but maybe this time

471
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,799
it's your benefactor's

472
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,160
chance to redeem himself.

473
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,000
Deyuan,

474
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,000
don't forget,

475
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,680
at Eight Pine Trees,

476
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,799
you carved the mark yourself.

477
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,799
I carved it myself.

478
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,960
Why bring it up now?

479
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,759
Once it's carved, it works.

480
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,719
Carved means carved.

481
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,440
That hundred-year-old tree

482
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,440
has seen more people and things than we ever have.

483
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,199
A lot more.

484
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,119
Northeast resistance base

485
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,800
has treated me well.

486
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:25,760
I said before,

487
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,960
as long as I have breath left,

488
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:28,599
I’ll bring all of you

489
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,920
back together.

490
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,599
But, Platoon Leader, have you thought about this?

491
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,599
The Japanese in the Northeast

492
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,440
have built so many

493
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,360
fortresses like the ones you mentioned.

494
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,920
If we only find this one,

495
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,840
what good does it do?

496
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:53,880
Do you think

497
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
it's just a few of us taking action?

498
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,119
We’ll track them down one by one

499
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,480
and find them all.

500
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,519
Then it’ll really matter.

501
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,519
Our major counterattack in the Northeast

502
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,880
is about to begin.

503
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,559
Take the Datuzi Ridge Fortress,

504
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,840
the Japanese defensive position.

505
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,000
It’s tied to countless

506
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:13,920
lives.

507
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,599
You know this very well.

508
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,280
If we’re not ahead of the enemy,

509
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
even by a step,

510
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,159
thousands of our fighters

511
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,159
will lose their lives here.

512
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,760
Alright, I'll go check downstairs.

513
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,639
Where are you going?

514
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,840
What does this mean?

515
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,400
Don't panic, hurry to the back door.

516
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,440
Second Master Tang is inside.

517
00:36:59,199 --> 00:36:59,960
It's really him.

518
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:00,840
Yes.

519
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,599
You four, watch the front door.

520
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,559
The rest of you, go to the back door.

521
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,360
Yes, yes.

522
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,840
The rest, come in with me.

523
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,320
Yes.

524
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,280
Here, they're coming.

525
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,119
One, two, three, four.

526
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,239
Two plainclothes, two police officers.

527
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,719
Why are they surrounding the Baoyu Bureau?

528
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,000
They're not here for the Platoon Leader, are they?

529
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,719
What should we do?

530
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,840
Don't panic yet, stay calm.

531
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,440
They might not be after the Platoon Leader.

532
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:50,639
Let me think.

533
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,039
But we do need to warn the Platoon Leader.

534
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,400
Here's what we'll do.

535
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,000
In a bit, go fire a shot at the door.

536
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,119
When the Platoon Leader hears the gunshot,

537
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,119
he'll know something's wrong.

538
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,880
So many police officers.

539
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,599
Did I call them here?

540
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,760
Are they here for the Platoon Leader?

541
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:12,920
What do we do?

542
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,400
What do we do?

543
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:29,880
What are you doing?

544
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,079
Don't go any further.

545
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,159
Go this way.

546
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,400
Search every private room carefully.

547
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,960
Alright.

548
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,280
Wait a moment.

549
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:51,960
I'll go out and check first.

550
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,800
Who is it?

551
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,000
Second Master.

552
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,519
Why are you coming out from here?

553
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,760
What, is that not allowed?

554
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:03,559
Second Master.

555
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,840
Section Chief Zhao gave orders.

556
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:05,800
This place

557
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,039
No one is allowed in or out.

558
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,079
Why not?

559
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,400
Is that Tang Deyuan?

560
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,079
Drive over there.

561
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,880
Back door.

562
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:21,960
You come with me.

563
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:22,679
Let's go.

564
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,000
Platoon Leader, get in the car!

565
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:25,519
Go!

566
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,920
Hurry, everyone get in! After them!

567
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,880
Get in, quick!

568
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:46,960
Hurry, hurry!

569
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,840
Drive!

570
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,679
Drive faster!

571
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,559
Follow the car ahead!

572
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,199
Drive faster!

573
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,039
I told you, don't worry about me.

574
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,920
Give me the gun.

575
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,239
Give me the gun.

576
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,159
