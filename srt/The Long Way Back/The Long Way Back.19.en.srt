1
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,640
Come.

2
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,439
Come.

3
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,239
Come.

4
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,759
Platoon Leader Lu

5
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Old Lu

6
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,000
Political Instructor

7
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,080
Hello, hello, hello.

8
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,080
Old Lu.

9
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,560
Our people

10
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,439
are all here now.

11
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,159
Good.

12
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,960
Everyone can

13
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,879
finally get a peaceful night's sleep here.

14
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,039
Rest well.

15
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,319
Once we've recovered,

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,039
we'll go back to fight the Japanese.

17
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:33,879
Alright.

18
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,000
Political Instructor.

19
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,240
In our unit,

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,199
there are still many

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,599
who haven't arrived yet.

22
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,400
Well,

23
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,680
you tell him about it later.

24
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,520
Platoon Leader Zhao is in charge of going back

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,680
to pick up the scattered comrades.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,240
Alright, alright.

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,919
Let's go.

28
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,439
I'll help everyone settle in first.

29
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,280
Okay.

30
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:50,879
Let's go.

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,840
Take a look.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,759
This whole area

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,560
was provided by the Soviets

34
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,520
for us to rest and recover.

35
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,759
There aren't many Soviets here.

36
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,680
The nearest place to here is called

37
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,800
Fei-Yasike.

38
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,319
It's about a hundred li away.

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Instructor Wang.

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,879
What are those people in the back doing?

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,319
They're building a training ground.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,719
When everyone comes,

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
we need a proper place to train.

44
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,080
Yes, that's right.

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
They're not just building the training ground,

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,639
but also a canteen and barracks.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,199
We have to build all of it.

48
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,120
It's getting cold.

49
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,319
We

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,919
can't keep squeezing into tents.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,639
Besides, there aren't enough tents.

52
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,439
The Soviets provided us

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,800
with a place to rest.

54
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,360
For everything else,

55
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,000
we have to rely on ourselves.

56
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,039
Alright.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
Those two tents

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,080
don't have many people.

59
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,759
Let's stay there for now.

60
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,919
Okay.

61
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,719
Everyone, follow me.

62
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,639
Tian Xiaogui's family lives on a hillside.

63
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,120
They're a big family.

64
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,840
They have both land and houses.

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,479
Congshan Xiaobaima

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,800
is a well-known bandit.

67
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,719
His wife

68
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,879
is called Lanhua.

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,759
She's a medic in our unit.

70
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,719
This couple

71
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,319
brought all the people from the mountain

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,439
down to join us.

73
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,879
They joined the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

74
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,319
During the retreat,

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
they got separated.

76
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,600
Hua still

77
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,959
had a

78
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,040
nursing baby with her.

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,920
The Japanese did all this.

80
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,199
Someday,

81
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,360
we'll pay them back with interest.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,160
You, remember this.

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Got it? Look here.

84
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:35,839
Tang Deyuan

85
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,319
Tian Xiaogui

86
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,600
Xiaobaima

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,639
Lanhua

88
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,680
What did you draw here?

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,480
It's hard to recognize.

90
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,120
That's the point.

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,279
If this notebook

92
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:49,879
ever falls into

93
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,639
Japanese hands,

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,240
they won't understand a thing.

95
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,240
Right.

96
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,160
What about these?

97
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,720
These are all

98
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,720
our brothers.

99
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,800
All of them.

100
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,480
Look.

101
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,319
Come here.

102
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,839
How many can you find?

103
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,279
You came to the right place.

104
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,040
When are you leaving here?

105
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,800
I'll leave in a bit.

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,759
There are still so many comrades across the river.

107
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,959
They're waiting for me to bring them back to the unit.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,560
Youwang.

109
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,439
I'm counting on you.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,480
Has Deyuan come back?

111
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,160
Yes.

112
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:12,839
It's Deyuan.

113
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,279
Deyuan.

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,839
Deyuan.

115
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,240
Deyuan.

116
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,199
What happened, Deyuan?

117
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,120
Mom.

118
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:22,759
Dad.

119
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,120
Lie down.

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,279
Lie down, lie down.

121
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,480
You two.

122
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,560
Why are you here?

123
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,360
The Xiao family sent word.

124
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,040
They said you'd be back today.

125
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,040
Your dad and I

126
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,759
have been waiting here since early morning.

127
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,000
It was Tielin who saved you again.

128
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,600
Now we owe the Xiao family a favor.

129
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,079
How can we ever repay them?

130
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,279
Dad

131
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,840
I'm back

132
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,799
Xiao Xiao

133
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,159
Dad

134
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,679
If you want to hit me or scold me

135
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,320
I'll take it

136
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,720
Can you

137
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,279
let me have some noodle soup first?

138
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,679
You rascal.

139
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,679
How did this happen?

140
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,879
What’s wrong with you?

141
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
Alright, alright.

142
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Don’t burn yourself.

143
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,919
Look at this mess.

144
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,799
Dad.

145
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,159
I’m still alive.

146
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
I’m alive.

147
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,039
I want to eat meat.

148
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
Can you stew some meat for me?

149
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,000
Wait a bit.

150
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,799
Stewed meat.

151
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:55,840
Come on, come on.

152
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:56,679
Come here, come here.

153
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,759
Come here.

154
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,639
Go over there.

155
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,320
Go to that side.

156
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,840
Son.

157
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,679
You’re not leaving this time, right?

158
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,799
If you really want to go,

159
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,039
I can’t stop you.

160
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,960
But my crying

161
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,080
will follow you for two miles.

162
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,360
Dad.

163
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,399
I’m sorry, Dad.

164
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,120
Aren’t you just talking like a child?

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,679
There are unfilial children,

166
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,519
but no cruel parents.

167
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,279
If you still miss

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,519
our warm home,

169
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,600
I’d even

170
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,879
take off my knucklebones

171
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,000
and let you play with them,

172
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,799
I’d be happy to.

173
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,000
How could I dare?

174
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,519
You rascal.

175
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,159
You just need a lesson.

176
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,200
Wait a moment.

177
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,799
I’ll catch a pig.

178
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
And stew some meat for you.

179
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,279
Dad.

180
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,559
Take it slow.

181
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,279
Hold on, hold my hand.

182
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,919
I'll fight you all.

183
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,679
Fuqing, Fuqing.

184
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,159
Fuqing.

185
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,200
Fuqing.

186
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,960
Had a nightmare.

187
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,320
It's okay, it's okay.

188
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:32,879
Go to sleep.

189
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,120
Close your eyes, close your eyes and sleep.

190
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,200
Hey, what are you doing?

191
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,080
I dreamed of Lao Tang last night.

192
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:01,919
What did you dream about him?

193
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,039
I dreamed of him

194
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,399
and those who didn't escape the labor camp

195
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,200
the ones who couldn't get out.

196
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,240
They were all buried alive by the Japanese.

197
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,960
A huge mass grave.

198
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,679
Can you say something positive?

199
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,399
I keep dreaming about Lao Tang.

200
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,080
There's no news about him.

201
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,399
What news do you want?

202
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,840
Instructor Wang.

203
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,879
Instructor.

204
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,440
Nothing.

205
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,039
About Fuqing,

206
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,559
he used to be with a comrade of ours

207
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,039
named Tang Deyuan.

208
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,320
At Datuziling,

209
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,360
he helped the Japanese build fortifications.

210
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,320
He suffered a lot.

211
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,080
Well, well...

212
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,360
He's been having nightmares lately.

213
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,840
Datuziling.

214
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,039
Which Datuziling?

215
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,120
I can't remember which one.

216
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,000
I just remember

217
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,639
after escaping,

218
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,360
the first town I passed

219
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,279
was Jingyang Town.

220
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,039
Jingyang Town.

221
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,320
What kind of fortifications did you build?

222
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,159
We just moved stones every day.

223
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:51,879
Dug pits.

224
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,159
Built barracks and such.

225
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,840
We weren't allowed in the important areas.

226
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,720
They didn't let us go there.

227
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,759
But it was built on a large scale inside.

228
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,279
This needs to be reported.

229
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,159
It was around the start of autumn.

230
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,799
I was captured in autumn.

231
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,960
When I got out,

232
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,879
it was about early winter.

233
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,720
That's when I escaped.

234
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,879
Inside, every day

235
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,159
we worked day and night.

236
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,759
If you ask me exactly

237
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,519
how many days I was there,

238
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,600
I can't remember.

239
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,679
He said he was captured in autumn,

240
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,600
and escaped in early winter.

241
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,120
He can't recall exactly how long he stayed.

242
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,360
Because he worked day and night inside.

243
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,600
Here's how it is.

244
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,879
Just now, our soldier

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,919
said that

246
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,440
it's Datuzi Ridge.

247
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,600
It's here.

248
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,039
It covers hundreds of miles around.

249
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,159
That Jingyang Town

250
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,600
is at the

251
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,919
southeast corner of Datuzi Ridge.

252
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,039
Right here.

253
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,519
Here.

254
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,480
He said Datuzi Ridge is here.

255
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,519
It covers hundreds of miles.

256
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,080
Jingyang Town is at the

257
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,399
southeast corner of Datuzi Ridge.

258
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,519
Do you know what's being built there?

259
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,080
The lieutenant colonel is asking you.

260
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,960
Do you know over there

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,840
what they're building?

262
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,559
We

263
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,759
sometimes build roads,

264
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,120
sometimes build bridges,

265
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,120
sometimes even construct

266
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,600
barracks and such.

267
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,639
Our labor camp

268
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,600
has over a hundred people.

269
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,840
But I've heard

270
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,159
camps like ours

271
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,960
number about ten to twenty.

272
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,600
But what they do

273
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,759
we don't know.

274
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,200
But we

275
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,279
while working every day,

276
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,000
can hear

277
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,440
them blasting the mountains.

278
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,399
The sound is really loud.

279
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,360
They blast every day.

280
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,840
Alright.

281
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,240
If I say too much, it can't be translated.

282
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,840
He said they're building warehouses and barracks inside.

283
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,360
Building roads and bridges.

284
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,200
After building the roads,

285
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,919
what was it again?

286
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,840
A lot of people.

287
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,960
He said about a hundred people.

288
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:45,799
Such barracks

289
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,639
number about ten to twenty.

290
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,519
What's being built there

291
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,320
he doesn't know either.

292
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,039
But he knows they often

293
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,720
blast the mountains.

294
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,080
Blast the mountains.

295
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,240
They tie

296
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:55,799
the Japanese

297
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,279
tie explosives to people

298
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,399
and force them at gunpoint

299
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
to go into the caves.

300
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:00,600
After they go in,

301
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,720
they blow them up.

302
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,039
It's like tying a firecracker

303
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,799
to a rat's tail.

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,240
The rat will run forward, right?

305
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,960
They tie explosives to people.

306
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,759
The Japanese.

307
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,640
Rat? What's a rat?

308
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,519
A rat.

309
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,279
It's a mouse.

310
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:13,680
A mouse.

311
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,079
He said they tied explosives to a rat.

312
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,559
The rat goes to blow up the mountain.

313
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,279
No, it's tying a bomb to a person.

314
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,240
Then the person goes in to blow up the mountain.

315
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,880
But why blow up the mountain?

316
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,200
Them.

317
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,519
Why do they want to blow up that mountain?

318
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,079
No idea.

319
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,799
Tie explosives to a rat.

320
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,720
Tie a bomb to a person.

321
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,880
The person goes to blow up the mountain.

322
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,880
So it's a person who blows up the mountain in the end.

323
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,440
Right.

324
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,400
But they must be

325
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,599
up to something.

326
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,000
Up to something.

327
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,880
What is it?

328
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,119
Not sure what exactly.

329
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,599
Yeah.

330
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,359
I don't know what he's up to.

331
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,640
I have no idea what he's doing.

332
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,160
Don't know what they're doing.

333
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,519
Any other questions?

334
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,599
No more questions.

335
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,440
He said it's all good here.

336
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,240
He knows everything now.

337
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,680
It's fine.

338
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,640
You can head back first.

339
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:01,240
It's okay.

340
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:02,480
You go back first.

341
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,519
Did you understand?

342
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,640
Yes, I understood.

343
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,240
Alright.

344
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,200
Yes.

345
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:27,559
Comrade.

346
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:28,759
Comrade.

347
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,920
Wait a moment.

348
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,839
Comrade.

349
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,000
Vasily.

350
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,720
You speak Russian so well.

351
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,960
I only know this one word.

352
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,720
Comrade.

353
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,960
But your Chinese is excellent.

354
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,960
How do you speak so well?

355
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,799
I'm a half-Russian.

356
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,240
Why do you put yourself down like that?

357
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:44,920
I'm not.

358
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,279
My mother is Chinese.

359
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,920
She's from Huashu Village in Aihui.

360
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,000
Your mother is from Huashu Village in Aihui?

361
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,240
Yeah.

362
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,839
So, what's your name?

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,359
My name is Wan Fuqing.

364
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,640
Your people

365
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,759
all have to get

366
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,359
a Soviet name when they come here.

367
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,640
Because our officers can't pronounce

368
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,759
your name.

369
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,400
Say it again.

370
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,480
Wan Fuqing.

371
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,319
Wan Fuqing.

372
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,240
Call you Ivan.

373
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:06,279
Ivan.

374
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,839
Easy to say, right?

375
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,720
What does it mean?

376
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,000
It doesn't really

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,519
mean much.

378
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,920
Actually, it's similar to your name.

379
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,960
It's easy to say.

380
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,440
Ivan.

381
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:13,920
Ivan.

382
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:14,920
Alright, sounds good.

383
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,559
Okay.

384
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,839
Then help our platoon leader

385
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,880
and Gao Yunhu and the others

386
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,799
get Soviet names too.

387
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:19,680
Gao Yunhu.

388
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,440
Yeah, yeah.

389
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,400
Give him a Soviet name.

390
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,960
Tiger.

391
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,519
Sir.

392
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,680
He's sleeping like a log.

393
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,319
What?

394
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,720
Don't make a fuss.

395
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,160
He's still breathing.

396
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,279
What's this thing?

397
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,119
Let me take a look.

398
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,680
Crops after a long drought.

399
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't flood them now.

400
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,400
Last night, this kid

401
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,000
ate four pig's feet in one go.

402
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,079
Wow.

403
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,839
The young master is finally recovering.

404
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,559
Since he came back,

405
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,799
I haven't even heard him fart.

406
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,359
I just heard one now.

407
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,880
It was a long one.

408
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,720
That's because he's full.

409
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,160
The meat pushed it out.

410
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,119
Old Tian.

411
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,559
Headman

412
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:36,759
Headman

413
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,279
Still calling him Headman

414
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,759
Just got used to saying it, right?

415
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,359
I'm getting forgetful

416
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,440
He's the mayor now

417
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:44,079
That's right

418
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,039
Forgive me, Mayor

419
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,000
Forgive me

420
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,839
I saw the sign put up

421
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:49,839
Exactly

422
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,119
It was hung up early this morning

423
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,359
The flag is up too

424
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,279
It's up

425
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,400
Look, once it's up

426
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,880
The yard looks so bright

427
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,440
Looks neat and tidy

428
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,359
Hope we didn't cause you any trouble

429
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
Mayor, don't say that

430
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,799
We know this brings honor to our family

431
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
Yes, yes

432
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,599
Old Wu from across the street

433
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,400
He wants to join the Concordia Association too

434
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,480
I didn't agree

435
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,640
Do you know why?

436
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,279
Why?

437
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,440
That guy has questionable thinking

438
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,000
So as the branch vice president

439
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,039
You can't just do it for nothing

440
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,519
Right

441
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:22,880
You need to contribute more

442
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:23,799
Yes, yes

443
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,559
I'm very clear about this

444
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,839
The mayor looks out for us

445
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,000
From now on, for grain requisition

446
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,039
We'll pay every month

447
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
As for Japan-Manchuria Friendship Songs

448
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640
We'll lead the singing

449
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,200
I've even taught Lian Changshun the song

450
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,279
It'll definitely make us proud

451
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,960
When you do things

452
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm at ease

453
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,319
Don't drag it out

454
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,160
That's enough, that's enough

455
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,920
Don't drag it out

456
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,079
So, Mayor, you came today

457
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,720
Is it official business?

458
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:02,680
What is it?

459
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,839
Can't I visit if there's nothing?

460
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,519
Just dropping by

461
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,680
Can't I help you out a bit?

462
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,839
Alright, that's enough

463
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,519
You really shouldn't

464
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,279
I wouldn't dare

465
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:12,960
Put it down quickly

466
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,119
How could I let you do it yourself?

467
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,480
Come inside and warm up

468
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:16,880
Come in

469
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,559
Warm up

470
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,680
The yard is really tidy

471
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,079
Yes, yes

472
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,279
Got guests at home?

473
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,039
No

474
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,359
Walk slowly

475
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,359
It's slippery here

476
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,200
Where are you going?

477
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,279
The mayor is here

478
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,079
Yes

479
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,279
Did you see?

480
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
Even the housekeeper speaks better than you

481
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,079
Yes, you should call him Mayor

482
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,240
Set up the charcoal brazier

483
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,880
Xiaogui is back

484
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,160
No

485
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,359
Why set it up if he's not back?

486
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,119
The charcoal brazier, I mean

487
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,440
It's cold

488
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,480
I just went in to warm up

489
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,119
You warmed up in Xiaogui's room

490
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,799
Set up the charcoal brazier

491
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,279
Well

492
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,480
Big family, big business

493
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,000
Big family, big business

494
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:26,759
In this freezing weather

495
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,039
Let me get the cart to take you home

496
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,000
Look at this setup.

497
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,880
There's a lot of fat here.

498
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:37,920
You're stewing meat.

499
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,039
No.

500
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,119
Last month I sold pork.

501
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,200
Had a bit of fat left over.

502
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,240
I rendered some lard last night.

503
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:45,480
That's not it.

504
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:46,960
No, no, that's not right.

505
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,599
I can smell it.

506
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,960
I can smell the pork knuckle.

507
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,119
Ribs.

508
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,279
Tenderloin.

509
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,440
Pork belly.

510
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,720
And blood sausage.

511
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,240
I'm telling you,

512
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,640
My nose is sharper than a dog's.

513
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:02,359
So what?

514
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,640
Shouldn't we

515
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,000
treat the mayor?

516
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,400
Mayor, what are you saying?

517
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,519
An honored guest comes by,

518
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:10,559
how could we hide anything from you?

519
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,680
That's true.

520
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,160
Yes, yes.

521
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,920
Just joking with you.

522
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,720
As the saying goes,

523
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,880
you don't visit at mealtime, right?

524
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,119
You enjoy it yourselves.

525
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,359
Mayor.

526
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,079
Have lunch at home.

527
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,559
Make a few dishes, have a couple drinks.

528
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,519
No, no.

529
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,839
I have official business.

530
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,039
Maybe another day.

531
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,680
Alright, I'm leaving.

532
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,519
Young master.

533
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,920
You've been wronged.

534
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,119
Come out.

535
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,319
Young master.

536
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,839
Young master.

537
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,039
The floor is cold.

538
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,480
Get up and sleep on the bed.

539
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,079
It's me.

540
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,160
Where am I?

541
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,680
You're at home.

542
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,519
Me.

543
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,200
I thought I was still up in the mountains.

544
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,279
I was wondering what was going on.

545
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,839
You scared me to death.

546
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,119
Young master.

547
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,519
The hot water is ready.

548
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:28,880
Go ahead and take a soak.

549
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,079
Relax a bit.

550
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,400
Young master.

551
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,559
What's wrong this time?

552
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,480
Nothing's wrong.

553
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Nothing's wrong.

554
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,200
Come out quickly.

555
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,279
Let me tell everyone something real.

556
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,200
Our Fuqing here,

557
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,720
has really made a big contribution this time.

558
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,079
Let's give him a round of applause!

559
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,640
Don't make a fuss, guys.

560
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,240
What did I do?

561
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,960
Really.

562
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,920
The instructor told me today,

563
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,000
that

564
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,720
the information provided by Comrade Fuqing

565
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,720
is very important.

566
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,640
It got the attention of

567
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,359
senior Soviet officers.

568
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,759
I didn't say much.

569
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,799
Besides, I don't even know

570
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,920
what's truly important.

571
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,680
That just shows

572
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,839
the intel you gave is extremely valuable.

573
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,400
This, this...

574
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,920
the fortifications built by the Japanese

575
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,160
these defenses,

576
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,880
must be very secret.

577
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,279
And very dangerous.

578
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,160
Yeah, pretty secret.

579
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,839
Pretty dangerous.

580
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:40,720
Platoon leader.

581
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,680
Why didn't you warn me earlier?

582
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,640
I could've prepared better.

583
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,839
And reported it properly.

584
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,920
Also,

585
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,839
it's been so long,

586
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,039
I haven't slept well.

587
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,160
I have nightmares every night.

588
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,799
Even when I go out to pee at night,

589
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,680
I feel like something's following me.

590
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,839
What could it be?

591
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,440
A little ghost.

592
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,079
Get outta here!

593
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,119
We're Communist Party members.

594
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,240
Don't talk nonsense.

595
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,839
Ghosts, big or small.

596
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,079
You look more like a ghost.

597
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,279
Yeah, the platoon leader's right.

598
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,359
When the red star shines,

599
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,920
all the Japanese run away.

600
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,519
Be good, Fuqing, stop fussing.

601
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,920
Tonight, Yunhu will sleep with you.

602
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
I'm not sleeping with him!

603
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,200
I'm afraid he'll wet the bed.

604
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,559
You're the one who wets the bed!

605
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,920
Brother Fuqing

606
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,319
Brother Fuqing

607
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,119
Donkey

608
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,599
Stop shouting

609
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,279
Let him get some peaceful sleep

610
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,839
Cover your ears a bit

611
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,359
Dad

612
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,240
Uncle

613
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,000
Young master

614
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,039
Why did you come out?

615
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,559
I just wanted some fresh air.

616
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,680
What fresh air do you need?

617
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,160
You kid, honestly.

618
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,079
Dad

619
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,480
I've come back and caused you trouble.

620
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,960
Made your life uneasy too.

621
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,119
What are you saying?

622
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,400
I'm your father, you're my son.

623
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,119
If I don't let you have good days,

624
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,000
who else would I give them to?

625
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,039
Say that again.

626
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,480
If I can't protect you in this home,

627
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,119
then I'm not much of a father.

628
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,960
Look at you.

629
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,480
Young master

630
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,319
Let's make do with this lunch for now.

631
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,519
I made some eggs.

632
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,839
Cooked cabbage and stewed meat.

633
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,960
Baked some flatbread.

634
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:20,839
Is that enough for you?

635
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,160
It's enough.

636
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,559
What are you looking at?

637
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,160
Dad

638
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,799
What's that thing?

639
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,720
Why do we hang that in our house?

640
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,720
Silly kid, you don't get it, do you?

641
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,559
That's our family's protective charm.

642
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:40,799
Alright.

643
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,039
Once it's ready,

644
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:42,880
I'll bring it over to you.

645
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,599
Go back first.

646
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,519
If someone climbs over the wall

647
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,799
and sees you, what then?

648
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,359
Go back quickly.

649
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:48,759
Hurry, hurry.

650
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,480
Go back quickly.

651
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,279
Slow down.

652
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,079
Valodya

653
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:14,880
Is Ivan your soldier?

654
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,279
Ivan

655
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,079
Yes, Ivan.

656
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,039
He escaped from Japan

657
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,640
from a secret facility.

658
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,680
The staff has studied it carefully.

659
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,160
It's something we didn't know before.

660
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,880
So we'll soon send people

661
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,720
to recon the Bald Ridge he mentioned.

662
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,039
Are you sending Ivan?

663
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,880
I can train him individually.

664
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Not Ivan.

665
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,000
We need unrelated soldiers.

666
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,920
To verify what he reported.

667
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,480
What do you think of Ashole?

668
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:51,559
He's good.

669
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,880
When

670
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,319
will we get to eat canned meat too?

671
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,359
That's for officers only.

672
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:07,839
Has nothing to do with us.

673
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,559
Stop daydreaming.

674
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,279
Comrade Ashole

675
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,839
Here

676
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,799
Captain Grigory

677
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,039
asks you to go to his office.

678
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:16,839
Yes

679
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,440
Reporting

680
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,920
Comrade Ashole

681
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,720
During training,

682
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,119
you performed very well.

683
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,759
The higher-ups have decided to send you

684
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,720
across the border for a special mission.

685
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,720
Comrade Ashole

686
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,960
Because in training

687
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,359
you performed exceptionally well,

688
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,599
the higher-ups have decided to send you

689
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,160
with several Chinese soldiers

690
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,480
to form a task force

691
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,599
for a special cross-border mission.

692
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,599
Your comrades have arrived.

693
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,759
You'll go to the meeting room soon

694
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:48,559
to get an introduction

695
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,039
to the details.

696
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,440
Remember,

697
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:54,480
all missions are confidential.

698
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,200
The other teammates

699
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,960
are already here.

700
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,759
We'll take you to the meeting room now.

701
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,039
A designated comrade

702
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,119
will brief you on the details.

703
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,559
But you must remember

704
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,599
that regarding this mission,

705
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,440
the specifics

706
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,680
must be kept secret.

707
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:07,920
Yes

708
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,680
Reporting, Captain.

709
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,039
What is it?

710
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,039
I have a request.

711
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,240
I would like

712
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,039
a can of meat.

713
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,160
He wants a can of meat.

714
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,960
Alright, no problem.

715
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:27,799
Thank you, Captain.

716
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,079
Er Donkey.

717
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,279
After the mission is done,

718
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,279
can you make a detour

719
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,359
to visit your father?

720
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,039
Uncle.

721
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,640
I was thinking the same.

722
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,839
About my eldest brother,

723
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,400
my father should know.

724
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,039
Uncle.

725
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:52,920
Third Brother.

726
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:53,920
I'm leaving it to you.

727
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,000
Don't worry.

728
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:56,640
Get lost.

729
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,160
I'm leaving.

730
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:04,640
What are you doing?

731
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,559
No one is allowed to see me off.

732
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,039
I'll be back.

733
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,279
Don't start this.

734
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,039
Wait.

735
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:18,920
I made it myself.

736
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,119
Don't dislike it.

737
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:24,799
Nice craftsmanship.

738
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,920
You're willing to give it away.

739
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,319
There's nothing to be unwilling about.

740
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,599
If I can't come back,

741
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,599
at least the knife should.

742
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,759
Got it.

743
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,279
I'll stab a couple for you when the time comes.

744
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,039
Good job.

745
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:35,759
I'm off.

746
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:37,160
Brother.

747
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:38,920
What's up?

748
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,359
It's nothing.

749
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:48,799
See you when I'm back.

750
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,880
It's fine.

751
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,880
When spring comes,

752
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,160
and the river ice melts,

753
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,000
your brother will return.

754
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,800
According to our intelligence,

755
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,880
at Bald Ridge,

756
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,760
there's a secret Japanese fortification.

757
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:29,639
Your mission

758
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,960
is to verify this information.

759
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,760
If it's there,

760
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:32,800
you must reconnoiter

761
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,320
its purpose and scale.

762
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,440
Report back promptly.

763
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,159
Your mission

764
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,119
has a three-month timeframe.

765
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,400
The border department will be arranged

766
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,159
to receive you then.

767
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,519
But remember,

768
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,960
no matter the progress,

769
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,480
you must return on time.

770
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,440
Yes.

771
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,800
Rest here for a while.

772
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:12,960
If there's danger,

773
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,480
use the agreed signal

774
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:17,800
to notify you.

775
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,079
Alright.

776
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:19,880
Got it.

777
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,079
Rest first.

778
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:32,199
Have some biscuits.

779
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:51,960
Let's go.

780
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,320
Old Li, five jin of millet.

781
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,199
Mrs. Song.

782
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Five jin of sorghum.

783
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,119
Wait a moment.

784
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,760
You eat like this,

785
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,719
doesn't it hurt your teeth?

786
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:31,760
Take it back.

787
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:32,519
Hurry up.

788
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,840
The higher-ups' policy is good.

789
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,760
We have to deliver grain on schedule.

790
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,920
Slow and steady.

791
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,760
The Imperial Army treats us well.

792
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,760
We should be grateful.

793
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,199
So,

794
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,599
no one should have any bad ideas.

795
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,159
Mayor.

796
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,840
Why does the Imperial Army eat so much?

797
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,719
Old Wu, shut up.

798
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,679
Acting all cocky.

799
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,800
What are you saying over there?

800
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:03,800
I'm telling you,

801
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,000
if you weren't an old bachelor,

802
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,639
I'd have sent you to the training camp long ago.

803
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,920
The Imperial Army keeps you safe.

804
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,239
What's wrong with them eating some of your grain?

805
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,480
Coming, coming.

806
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,559
Here they come.

807
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,639
Can a few people help unload the truck?

808
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:24,559
Come on, come on.

809
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,679
Help with the unloading.

810
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,280
Mayor.

811
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,800
Our rice and fine flour,

812
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,280
are all milled and ready.

813
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,000
Not a bit of sand mixed in.

814
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,199
Look at Old Tian.

815
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,360
That's a good example.

816
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,800
If he's a role model, we should learn from him.

817
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,840
Don't wait for me to search every house.

818
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,519
If I find hidden grain,

819
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:49,880
you'll be embarrassed.

820
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,159
Come on, come on.

821
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,960
If you have no grain,

822
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,559
pay with money instead.

823
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,320
Old Tian.

824
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,159
Don't show off just because you have a little money.

825
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,159
Stop flaunting it here.

826
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,880
Maybe I should hand in my grain too.

827
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,559
Should I turn it in as well?

828
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,639
Me?

829
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,920
Grain requisition

830
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,159
is only natural.

831
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,559
Every dynasty,

832
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,800
has done it this way.

833
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,119
We saved up bit by bit too.

834
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,079
Scraped together from nothing.

835
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,360
It's been about ten days.

836
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,199
Only your chimney has smoke.

837
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,760
Last year's New Year,

838
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,920
lasted until spring.

839
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,559
If you slaughter a pig, just do it.

840
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,159
Afraid of people hearing,

841
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,119
you tied up the pig's mouth.

842
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,599
So we wouldn't hear.

843
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,519
You wanted to eat it, right?

844
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,000
And your big rooster,

845
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,880
crows three times before dawn.

846
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,519
It's been quiet lately.

847
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,079
Did you stew its mate?

848
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:40,760
Cooked it in a pot?

849
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,440
See that?

850
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,679
Even gave up the hen.

851
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,159
Such a big show.

852
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,039
Who are you entertaining?

853
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,480
Stop running your mouth here.

854
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,639
Don't gossip all over town.

855
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,039
Believe me, I'll deal with you.

856
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,000
Am I wrong?

857
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:55,719
You dare?

858
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,079
Look at you.

859
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,199
Sir, sir.

860
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,800
Look at Old Tian.

861
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,519
He's an honest man.

862
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,039
There's only one well by the river.

863
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:04,760
Changshun.

864
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,280
He carries water three or four times a day.

865
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,239
He lives carefully.

866
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,199
Can you two drink three vats of water?

867
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,760
Old Wu.

868
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,760
Stop talking nonsense.

869
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,440
So what if they eat pork?

870
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,320
Only your family eats cornbread?

871
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,599
Or only your family eats green onions?

872
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,320
Enough talk.

873
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,559
Bring the grain.

874
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,519
Or I'll send you away.

875
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,199
Mayor.

876
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:28,719
Did you hear?

877
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:29,480
You.

878
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,320
Go prepare the grain.

879
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,960
We're all neighbors.

880
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:37,239
Alright.

881
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,440
I'll scrape together a little too.

882
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,760
Stop talking nonsense.

883
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,039
Mayor.

884
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,480
Come home for lunch at noon.

885
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,599
It's all prepared.

886
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,280
We've been waiting for you.

887
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,400
Alright.

888
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,280
Young master.

889
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,559
Let's go.

890
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:16,639
Let's go.

891
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,280
It's fine now.

892
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,599
Let's go home.

893
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,599
Always hiding everywhere.

894
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,559
When will it end?

895
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:27,679
Young master.

896
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,519
As long as the green hills remain,

897
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,719
there will always be firewood.

898
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,360
Staying at home

899
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,320
is better than being outside.

900
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,400
When spring comes and we're busy,

901
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,639
things will get easier.

902
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,360
Let's go.

903
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,239
Come.

904
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,880
Please, you should go back.

905
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,559
No, no, no.

906
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,599
Look at this.

907
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,360
This is all we have left.

908
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,199
We've tried everything we could.

909
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,159
For the sake of our community,

910
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,079
on account of that,

911
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,679
please give me a straight answer.

912
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,800
Take it, take it.

913
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:31,599
Hurry up.

914
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,679
He has tuberculosis.

915
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,599
It's incurable now.

916
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,199
It's up to fate now.

917
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,960
Don't.

918
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,159
Please, look, look.

919
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:42,199
Get up, get up.

920
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
You mustn't, you mustn't.

921
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,920
Please get up.

922
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:44,719
Get up, please.

923
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,280
We really have no other way.

924
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
If he really can

925
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,079
survive a trip to death's door,

926
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,920
and come back alive,

927
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,639
he'll be a new man.
