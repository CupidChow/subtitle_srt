1
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,560
The south wind is warm, the north wind is gentle.

2
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,000
East village has gold, west village has oil.

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
If you eat well, you won't worry next year.

4
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,599
If you eat well, you won't worry next year.

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,159
Come on, come on.

6
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,319
Slow down, don't fall.

7
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,000
This kid.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,519
Thank you.

9
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:54,760
Come on, come on.

10
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,640
Sir.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,879
Sir, sir.

12
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,239
They're giving out buns over there.

13
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,319
Why don't you go get some?

14
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:02,879
These days...

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,959
There are still people giving out food.

16
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,920
That's right.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
Every year at this time, Sister Zhi

18
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,639
gives us buns.

19
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,919
Where do these buns come from?

20
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,080
Over there, the shopkeeper.

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,719
Take care of the shop.

22
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,719
Okay, okay.

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,599
Buns are given out here.

24
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,199
Why didn't you come earlier?

25
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,319
They're gone.

26
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,240
Bring me the two I saved.

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,199
Shopkeeper.

28
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
Those two are for you.

29
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,599
Just go when you're told.

30
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,039
Wait a moment.

31
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,199
I really don't know how to thank you.

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,319
No need to thank me.

34
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,719
If life at home was good,

35
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,319
who would want to beg for food?

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Yes, yes.

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,159
Where are you going?

38
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,680
Even if I told you, would you understand?

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,599
That looks heavy.

40
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,159
Let me help you carry it.

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:13,960
No need.

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,879
Just eat your food.

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,159
No, no.

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,919
I can't eat these buns for free.

45
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,840
No gains without pains.

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,599
You're quite particular.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,199
Let me help you.

48
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,240
Let me do this job.

49
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,759
I'll feel better that way.

50
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,039
This rack could be blown over by the wind.

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,520
What if my things get dropped again?

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,960
No way, no way.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,759
I'm strong.

54
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,919
You can give it a try.

55
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,919
Hold it steady.

56
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,639
Alright, we're here.

57
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,639
Give me my things.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,879
What are you looking at?

59
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,840
Give me my things.

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,960
Now you can relax.

61
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,360
Thank you.

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,160
You're back.

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,800
Everyone's standing here.

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,519
Why are you still asking?

65
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,759
Look at you,

66
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,079
always picking on me.

67
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,439
It's because I care about you.

68
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,600
The food box isn't light.

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,519
How many dishes did you make?

70
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,319
Six.

71
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,720
All your favorites.

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
I told you already,

73
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,399
don't make so much.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,879
I'm just worried that if I'm not home,

75
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,879
you'll go hungry.

76
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,600
Have you lost weight?

77
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,040
No.

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,560
You're looking so well-fed.

79
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,560
Not skinny at all.

80
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,240
I need to nourish you.

81
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,000
On this trip back home,

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,639
why has the shop sign changed?

83
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,720
It's better to use your own name.

84
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,360
I couldn't find the door.

85
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,600
As soon as I got back,

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,959
Xiao Tongtui told me.

87
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,360
Now I understand.

88
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,879
Your Xiao Tongtui

89
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,240
is your lookout.

90
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,560
Always watching me.

91
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,439
Right?

92
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,480
I wouldn't watch anyone else.

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,360
Did you miss me?

94
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,160
Why do you always ask that?

95
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,279
Put it down, put it down.

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
Alright, go eat.

97
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,079
Wait for me to finish.

98
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:48,800
Go inside and eat.

99
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,639
Go inside and eat.

100
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,720
I'm not done yet.

101
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,240
Hey,

102
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
why are you still here?

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,120
Platoon leader, platoon leader!

104
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,199
We missed you so much!

105
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,279
I...

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,399
I missed you all too.

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,639
Missed you.

108
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,639
How did you find us?

109
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,600
That thing at the door—

110
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,839
That, that sign.

111
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,600
The plaque.

112
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,680
I hung it up on purpose.

113
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,319
I did it on purpose.

114
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,879
You're more clever than me.

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Alright, I'm not mad at you anymore.

116
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,399
Get out of here!

117
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,040
What's wrong?

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Are you two fighting?

119
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,399
No, no.

120
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,199
Just messing around.

121
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:43,959
Just joking.

122
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,800
Platoon leader.

123
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,319
Why did you take so long to find us?

124
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm bored out of my mind here.

125
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,959
It's been so long.

126
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,839
Where have you been?

127
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, uh—

128
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,199
It's a long story.

129
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:53,800
Me too.

130
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,720
I almost didn't get to see you.

131
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,360
Alright, alright.

132
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,279
Wait a moment.

133
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,240
Platoon leader.

134
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,240
You're still hungry, right?

135
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,199
Yeah, let's eat, let's eat.

136
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:00,480
That's right.

137
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,959
Let's eat first.

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,720
Your friend just now

139
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,000
gave me two buns.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,040
That's not enough.

141
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,079
I've got some fresh ones here.

142
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,600
I'll go get them.

143
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,439
Wait here.

144
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,319
I didn't expect

145
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,199
you all went through so much.

146
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
No matter how tough things get for us,

147
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,519
it's still better than

148
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,639
those comrades who sacrificed themselves.

149
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,240
Anyone who survived till now

150
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,160
isn't living comfortably.

151
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,160
If anyone is comfortable,

152
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,399
Listen to yourself.

153
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,759
Didn't I almost die too?

154
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,399
You were just a little short.

155
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,160
I was two points short.

156
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,519
Who knows how many points the platoon leader was short.

157
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,639
Platoon leader, look at him.

158
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,879
Why do you love to pick fights?

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
As long as we survive,

160
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,879
good things will come.

161
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,399
Come on.

162
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,240
Drink up.

163
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,680
Platoon leader.

164
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
Tell me, about Lao Tang—

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,160
what is he really thinking?

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,480
What do you mean, what is Lao Tang thinking?

167
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,120
Lao Tang is over at Eight Pine Trees.

168
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
He's already made arrangements.

169
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
So what do you think he's thinking?

170
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,360
Those arrangements—

171
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,240
Alright, alright, I'm done talking to you.

172
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,120
Deyuan,

173
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,040
he must have his own troubles.

174
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,399
Look at us,

175
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
after all these years,

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,639
we've been through life and death together.

177
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,600
Not one of us is a coward.

178
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,240
As long as we're not killed,

179
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,279
we won't be separated.

180
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,000
Right?

181
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,679
Come on.

182
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,480
Let me tell you some good news.

183
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,120
I've found the main force.

184
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,519
Really?

185
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,759
That's great!

186
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,679
Xiaogui

187
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,879
has already joined them.

188
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,279
I think Hua'er

189
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,879
should have joined them too by now.

190
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,039
I left as soon as I decided.

191
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,879
It's up to you now.

192
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,679
I'll leave as soon as I decide too.

193
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,320
Platoon leader

194
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,039
Give me a little more time.

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,799
Wait, why are you grumbling?

196
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,120
You changed your mind.

197
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,399
When did I say I changed my mind?

198
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:19,919
Platoon leader

199
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,519
There's a rat in our unit.

200
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,799
Who are you calling a rat?

201
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,679
You hit me twice today.

202
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,600
So what if it's the third time?

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,919
Me?

204
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,759
What are you doing?

205
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,720
No rush.

206
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,919
Let's drink first.

207
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,639
Come on.

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,679
Yunhu

209
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,759
If you're having trouble,

210
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,600
then Fuqing and I

211
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,159
will go ahead first.

212
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,519
Whenever you want to leave,

213
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,240
it's up to you.

214
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,159
Don't blame Deyuan.

215
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,840
I've talked to his father too.

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,240
You all,

217
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,000
have suffered a lot and endured much hardship.

218
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,080
You've nearly lost your lives several times.

219
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,840
Who doesn't want a peaceful life?

220
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,519
Sleeping on a warm kang.

221
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,720
There's nothing wrong with that.

222
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,759
You can't force yourself to fight the Japanese.

223
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,279
Even if you're pushed into it,

224
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,399
your spirit

225
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,679
won't be lifted.

226
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,879
Let alone muster any strength.

227
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,759
So,

228
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,200
whether you go or not,

229
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,200
it's your decision.

230
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,960
To speak from the heart,

231
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,960
you are the soldiers I led.

232
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,879
I came here just to see

233
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,320
if you're still alive.

234
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,399
As long as you're alive, that's better than anything.

235
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,200
If you're all gone,

236
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,879
I wouldn't have anything to look forward to either.

237
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,600
You startled me.

238
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,440
So early in the morning.

239
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,120
You missed me?

240
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,919
I wanted to talk to you.

241
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,200
Let's talk inside.

242
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,720
What is it that needs to be said indoors?

243
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,480
Perfect timing.

244
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,600
The kang is still warm.

245
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:23,840
Let's warm up some wine.

246
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,840
I'll wait for you inside.

247
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,840
Go ahead.

248
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,080
Even if the sky falls,

249
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,759
I can handle it.

250
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,840
I respect you.

251
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,960
I came here so early

252
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,399
because I wanted to say goodbye.

253
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,720
You saved my life.

254
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,240
You've always treated me with kindness and loyalty.

255
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,159
Are you leaving for a while,

256
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,519
or will you never come back?

257
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,519
What about your mountain goods shop?

258
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,879
Can you take care of the shop for me?

259
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,399
Keep the money.

260
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,399
It was yours to begin with.

261
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,639
Don't bother with that.

262
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,440
If you really think I'm loyal,

263
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,080
then say something from the heart.

264
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,039
Our people have contacted me.

265
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,720
I have to go.

266
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,880
I knew it.

267
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,279
You have

268
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,680
a different aura from others.

269
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,920
Fu Qing is the same.

270
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,920
He has the same aura as you.

271
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,400
You said

272
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,200
you'd always listen to me.

273
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,279
As long as I don't let you leave,

274
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,799
you won't go.

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,960
Did you say that?

276
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,880
I did.

277
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,680
I did hesitate.

278
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,000
Why?

279
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,759
Because of you.

280
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,079
That's enough.

281
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,920
Those two words are enough.

282
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
The country is in crisis.

283
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,319
Men like you

284
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,559
if they lack this courage,

285
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,599
our country

286
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,519
would truly be doomed.

287
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,319
Gao Yunhu,

288
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,200
go ahead.

289
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,319
But remember,

290
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,799
I'm still here in Songlin Town.

291
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,440
I'll be waiting for you.

292
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,440
The door of Yelaigood

293
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,079
is always open for you.

294
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,079
If you ever feel tired,

295
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,519
just come back to me.

296
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:13,920
Let's go.

297
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,599
Yunhu.

298
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,680
Actually, we're not in such a hurry.

299
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,119
Why don't you go back and chat a bit more?

300
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:19,759
Yeah.

301
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,160
Once we head out like this,

302
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,839
who knows when we'll be back.

303
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,920
Talk a little longer.

304
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,279
It'll put everyone's mind at ease.

305
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,359
Let's go.

306
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,559
I sit quietly in the embroidery tower,

307
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,559
gazing toward the capital.

308
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,559
Thinking of my second brother,

309
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,759
Master Zhang.

310
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,079
Second brother went to the capital for the imperial exam.

311
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,759
Stop singing.

312
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:32,799
Guests have arrived.

313
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,319
Welcome, sir.

314
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,400
Please watch your step.

315
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,759
Mind your feet, please board the boat.

316
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,359
Alright, alright.

317
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:37,960
Come on.

318
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:38,759
Please come inside, please.

319
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,319
Alright, alright.

320
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:39,759
Sir.

321
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,839
Is it just you three?

322
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,759
Yes, just three.

323
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,400
Who said that?

324
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,079
I'm coming too.

325
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,079
We're doomed.

326
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,759
Why are you standing there?

327
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,920
Give me a hand, help me onto the boat.

328
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,480
Stop messing around.

329
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,039
It's not for nothing.

330
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:08,920
Can't fool you.

331
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,000
What are you afraid of?

332
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,200
I'm just here to see you off.

333
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,519
Take care.

334
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:44,640
What are you doing?

335
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,039
Remember this pain.

336
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,599
Remember this mark.

337
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:29,960
Let's go.

338
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,839
I'll do it.

339
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,799
Yunhu

340
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,839
I’ve taken over the mountain goods shop.

341
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,640
I want to keep it as a memento.

342
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,839
This is all the money I have.

343
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,839
If you think it’s not enough,

344
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,480
wait until you come back.

345
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,039
I’ll pay you the rest.

346
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:16,480
When I return,

347
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,559
I’ll come back.

348
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,039
Around 1940

349
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,880
Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

350
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,000
entered an extremely difficult period.

351
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,960
To preserve the only anti-Japanese armed force in Northeast China,

352
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,200
representatives from the Jidong and North Manchuria Provincial Committees of the Communist Party of China

353
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,240
Zhou Baozhong,

354
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Feng Zhongyun, and Zhao Shangzhi

355
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,160
were invited by Khabarovsk in the Soviet Union

356
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,559
and the regional party organization

357
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,799
as well as the Far Eastern Army.

358
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,240
They arrived in Boli, Soviet Union, one after another.

359
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,799
After several rounds of meetings and discussions,

360
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,079
which lasted two months,

361
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,559
they finally achieved important results.

362
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,480
When the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army units suffered defeats in battle

363
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,640
or for other reasons,

364
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,920
and needed to temporarily relocate

365
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,279
to Soviet territory,

366
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,319
the Soviet side would accept them

367
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,720
and provide support.

368
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,880
The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

369
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,440
while continuing to fight the enemy,

370
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,039
and maneuvering in battle,

371
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,519
along the Heilongjiang

372
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,920
and Ussuri River border areas,

373
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,240
secretly established

374
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:01,119
three crossing routes over the river.

375
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,519
What did you say?

376
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,880
You want us to cross the river and move

377
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,720
to the Soviet side?

378
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:06,279
That's right.

379
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
The commanders and the Soviet Red Army

380
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,319
have already discussed it.

381
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,720
It's very difficult right now.

382
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:11,400
Let's take the troops over there first

383
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,359
and regroup.

384
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,480
Regroup?

385
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,359
This...

386
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:16,799
Isn't this wrong?

387
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,599
Why is it wrong?

388
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,160
When we get over there,

389
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,200
we won't know anyone or anything.

390
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,400
Even speaking,

391
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,920
we won't understand each other.

392
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,839
If something happens,

393
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,200
what will we do?

394
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,960
And at such a critical moment,

395
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,799
we're just leaving like this.

396
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
How will the people see us?

397
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,039
They'll think we're running away.

398
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,279
This decision was made

399
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,960
after careful consideration by the Party.

400
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,039
Our top priority now

401
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,279
is to preserve our strength

402
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,440
and keep the spark alive.

403
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,240
No,

404
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,599
I already told the soldiers

405
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,000
that

406
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
we're going to join the main force.

407
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,119
We want to fight with the main force

408
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,359
against the Japanese.

409
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,640
The commissar said

410
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,599
this war is a protracted war.

411
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,960
Only by surviving do we have hope.

412
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,400
Only by staying alive

413
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,359
can we win the final victory.

414
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,519
We have a long way to go.

415
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,839
We carry a mission.

416
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,880
Besides,

417
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,119
comrades from South and North Manchuria

418
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:10,920
have all gone over.

419
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,279
Old Lu,

420
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,440
we are Party members.

421
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,880
At this time, we must

422
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,000
firmly obey orders.

423
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,440
Old Zhao,

424
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,759
now I understand what you mean.

425
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:24,640
As Party members,

426
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,599
we must obey the organization's orders.

427
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,480
Please tell the organization

428
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,599
not to worry.

429
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,839
When we get there,

430
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,400
we will cooperate actively

431
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,480
and make sure to complete the mission.

432
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:35,279
Good.

433
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,839
This is the river crossing route.

434
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Remember, be quick.

435
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,799
In the autumn and winter of 1940,

436
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,519
after suffering great difficulties and setbacks,

437
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,000
according to the agreement with the Soviet Army,

438
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,480
starting from late October 1940,

439
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,640
they crossed the border into the Soviet Union one after another.

440
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,319
On the way, they were pursued and blocked by Japanese forces.

441
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,240
They suffered heavy casualties.

442
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,720
The situation was dire.

443
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,160
Why is everyone so quiet?

444
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,319
After several ambushes by the enemy,

445
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,559
you all seem discouraged.

446
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,160
Show me

447
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,480
your full spirit.

448
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,079
Keep carrying out the mission.

449
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,160
Did you hear me?

450
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,240
If the river isn't frozen solid,

451
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,039
what should we do?

452
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,319
Then we'll have to swim across.

453
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,160
But we've been on the move for so long.

454
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,319
We're still far from the crossing point.

455
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,279
The enemy's ambushes along the way

456
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,079
haven't stopped.

457
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,079
I'm just worried we won't make it.

458
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,680
Just...

459
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,519
What are you afraid of?

460
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,160
We can all get through.

461
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,200
I think Xiao Gui is right.

462
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,559
The enemy blocks us at every turn.

463
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
If we walk the whole way,

464
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,640
how long will it take?

465
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,720
Right, platoon leader?

466
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,839
But the organization

467
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,920
has already given the order.

468
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,720
We must follow it.

469
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,000
Everyone, rest up.

470
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,119
We'll continue tomorrow.

471
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,119
If only we had horses.

472
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,799
We could travel so much faster on horseback.

473
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,240
A plane would be even better.

474
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,079
Where can we get horses?

475
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,240
We're deep in the mountains and forests.

476
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,400
Can't find any horses here.

477
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,240
But we still have three donkeys, don't we?

478
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,319
Wait,

479
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,400
are you saying

480
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,319
you want the three of us to carry you across?

481
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,119
What do you mean, ride you three?

482
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:43,160
Why do you always take things so literally?

483
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,000
You...

484
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,200
Doesn't your family raise horses?

485
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,599
You actually reminded me.

486
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,680
We really do have horses.

487
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,000
See?

488
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,319
But we can't get them out.

489
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,319
Are you talking about

490
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,599
the horses the enemy took?

491
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,400
Uncle,

492
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,519
fifty li west of Wild Horse Beach

493
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,640
is the enemy's horse ranch.

494
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,839
Our family still has three horses

495
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:12,400
inside there.

496
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:12,839
That's right.

497
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,880
Whenever I mention this,

498
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,519
I get furious.

499
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,119
Yeah.

500
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,480
If I don't get revenge,

501
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,559
even in my coffin

502
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,680
I won't rest in peace.

503
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,839
The enemy's horse ranch

504
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,480
should have

505
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,799
quite a few guards.

506
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,039
Uncle,

507
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,119
not that many.

508
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,680
Just a few dozen people.

509
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:32,680
How do you know?

510
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,119
I was thinking about our horses,

511
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,119
so I sneaked in once.

512
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,240
How did you get in?

513
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,319
With a big cart.

514
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,559
Wait, hold on.

515
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,279
What's a big cart?

516
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,960
I have a friend

517
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,559
named Zhang Dache.

518
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,839
He delivers fodder to the ranch.

519
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,799
What are you all overthinking?

520
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,200
What's so hard about this?

521
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:04,960
Just take it.

522
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,680
We can get your horse back.

523
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
And kill some Japanese soldiers.

524
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,960
Isn't that killing two birds with one stone?

525
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,119
Let's do it.

526
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,359
We're good at this.

527
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,240
That's right.

528
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,680
Our family knows how to handle this.

529
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,720
No offense, but

530
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,240
Comrade Little White Horse,

531
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,240
You're not a bandit anymore.

532
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,519
You're a Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army soldier now.

533
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:29,039
You can't just solve everything by stealing.

534
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:31,759
Then what do you suggest?

535
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,039
This matter,

536
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:34,960
If you ask me,

537
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,960
it's doable.

538
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:39,759
We're not familiar with it yet.

539
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:44,319
That guy, Zhang Dache,

540
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:45,880
Is he reliable?

541
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,880
We have a life-and-death bond.

542
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,279
My big brother saved his life.

543
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,359
If we ask him to do it,

544
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,000
it's almost a sure thing.

545
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,400
As long as we get inside,

546
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
and find the lead horse,

547
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,359
everyone will respond to our call.

548
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,319
We can wipe them all out.

549
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,079
With so many horses,

550
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,400
how do we find the right one?

551
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,160
Uncle, you forgot again.

552
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,519
We're horse breeders.

553
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,599
That's true.

554
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,880
That's right.

555
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,519
Let's settle it then, Uncle.

556
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,440
I'll go in.

557
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,680
If I get you inside,

558
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,079
that's all I can do.

559
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,599
Whether it works out or not,

560
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,599
depends on your luck.

561
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,200
You've already done enough.

562
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:29,599
Don't worry.

563
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,160
If I get caught,

564
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,039
I'll say I snuck in alone.

565
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,119
I won't give you away.

566
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,720
Brother,

567
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,480
If I were afraid of dying,

568
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,839
I wouldn't take this job.

569
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,119
If it weren't for my mother,

570
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,720
I'd want to kill some Japanese soldiers too.

571
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,599
Just for the thrill.

572
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,400
Come on, stay close.

573
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,880
Everyone in the back, stay close.

574
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,440
Stop.

575
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,799
Papers.

576
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,440
Come.

577
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,240
Everyone, get your papers ready.

578
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,160
This is mine, Imperial Army.

579
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,119
Brother,

580
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,639
I can hide inside the cart.

581
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
Right up against the side.

582
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,360
They definitely won't find me.

583
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,800
But just in case, brother,

584
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,360
Dache,

585
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:28,320
Heaven knows who's good or bad.

586
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,840
Yours, eat.

587
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:53,960
Okay, okay.

588
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:00,679
Alright.

589
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,400
Go.

590
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:02,719
Okay.

591
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,079
Come on, let's go.

592
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:04,639
Go.

593
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,559
Oh my, my stomach...

594
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,320
Imperial Army,

595
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,440
My stomach hurts.

596
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,079
I...

597
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,480
My stomach hurts.

598
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,679
I just...

599
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,119
My stomach right now...

600
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,320
hurts like it's being stabbed.

601
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,320
Stomach pain.

602
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,039
I just need to take a dump.

603
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,920
Over there.

604
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,840
Okay.

605
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,480
I wonder how the big brother is doing.

606
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,599
How things are for him in there.

607
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,400
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

608
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,320
How do you know he'll be fine?

609
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,760
Don't you trust big brother?

610
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,039
If something happened,

611
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,719
would the Japanese be so quiet?

612
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,679
That's true.

613
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,519
After all, he's our brother.

614
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,320
Let me take a look.

615
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,400
I can't see anything from here.

616
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:18,079
Brother

617
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:19,840
Is it?

618
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,360
Yes

619
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,280
Go

620
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,199
Notify the platoon leader

621
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,119
We can move now

622
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:29,920
Okay

623
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,000
Platoon leader

624
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,800
How is it, Little Donkey?

625
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,519
How is it?

626
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,519
My brother sent word

627
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,679
That's great

628
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:55,800
Squad One, Squad Two

629
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,440
Move out

630
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,280
The rest stay here

631
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,079
Let's go

632
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,039
Go on

633
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,280
Sister-in-law

634
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,559
Why are you standing there? Go

635
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,360
Let's go

636
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,760
Big brother

637
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,480
Force them back inside.

638
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,360
Retreat.

639
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Blow up the vehicle.
