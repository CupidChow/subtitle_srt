1
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,120
Changshun?

2
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,480
Changshun.

3
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:57,799
What's wrong?

4
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,879
I hear a commotion outside.

5
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,680
What's going on?

6
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,840
I'll go take a look.

7
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,120
Open all the main gates.

8
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,039
Lift up all the cellar covers.

9
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,599
Search the back hill too.

10
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,120
Turn over the local earth god temple.

11
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,879
Every household.

12
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,159
Open all the main gates.

13
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,039
Lift up the cellar covers.

14
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,680
Search the back hill too.

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,479
Turn over the earth god temple.

16
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:34,879
Mayor.

17
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,159
What's going on here?

18
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,080
Yesterday, in the corn stacks,

19
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,280
we found two Anti-Japanese Allied Army members.

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,800
They'll be taken to the yard and executed soon.

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,280
Really?

22
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,199
They're really Anti-Japanese Allied Army?

23
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,759
What do you think?

24
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,319
The Kwantung Army is involved.

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,479
How could it be fake?

26
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:56,960
Hurry.

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,319
Check everything carefully.

28
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,719
Look closely.

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,479
This time, there won't be a next time.

30
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,960
If anyone hides strangers again,

31
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,719
they'll all be brought here.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,479
Settle it all at once.

33
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,439
Go, go, go.

34
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,879
Take everything you need.

35
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,039
I've been prepared for this.

36
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:44,800
But this time,

37
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,479
we really can't stay home anymore.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,400
We have to run right away.

39
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,439
Take all of this.

40
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,280
Dad.

41
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm not running this time.

42
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,800
If I leave, what about you?

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,599
Don't talk nonsense.

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,199
Here, give it all to him.

45
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,639
Alright.

46
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,600
Xiaogui's father

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,879
Old Tian

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,720
They've all entered the yard.

49
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Then we can't go out the front.

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,720
You do this

51
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,079
Go through the window and over the wall.

52
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:31,759
Okay

53
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,879
I'll go to the front and handle things.

54
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,759
Remember, child

55
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
As long as the flag is hanging in our yard

56
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,000
you can come back.

57
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,319
Hurry and go

58
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,720
Young master

59
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,000
Go now

60
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,560
Young master

61
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,560
Xiaogui's father

62
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,639
Coming, coming

63
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,480
The mayor is here

64
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,439
Sorry for not welcoming you properly

65
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:56,639
Taikun

66
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,600
Taikun

67
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,160
Mayor

68
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,560
Let the Taikun sit in the main room

69
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,360
Today's lunch

70
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,680
will be at home

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,319
I'll make a few good dishes

72
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,120
Um

73
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,519
Please tell the Taikun

74
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,560
the Tian Xiaogui he's looking for

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,879
is his son

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,040
That kid must be hiding

77
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,560
Taikun

78
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,639
Tian Xiaogui is his son

79
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,759
You know the policy, right?

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,040
Yes, I know

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,839
He was in the Anti-Japanese Allied Army

82
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,120
What's the charge?

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,560
Execution

84
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,839
That's right

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,240
Someone has reported

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,160
that your son Tian Xiaogui

87
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,360
was in the Anti-Japanese Allied Army

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
and is hiding at home now

89
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,199
No

90
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,519
Absolutely not true

91
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,079
Alright, alright

92
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,199
Where is he hiding?

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,399
I...

94
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,279
I'm being framed

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,399
Someone must have a grudge against our family

96
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,560
They're making things up

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,480
We're all Chinese

98
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,199
Please explain to the Imperial Army for me

99
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,360
Young master

100
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,399
Young master

101
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,519
Young master, you...

102
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:04,800
Father

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,480
I'm sorry

104
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,800
I've failed as a son

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,480
Young master

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,519
Slow down

107
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,279
Alright.

108
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,040
Stop talking nonsense.

109
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,600
Hand him over right now.

110
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,800
The officer knows exactly what's going on.

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,000
He's right here in Yimianpo.

112
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,439
Everyone knows your son Tian Xiaogui

113
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,639
studied in Harbin.

114
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,879
He didn't finish school.

115
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,120
Then he ran off

116
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,319
and joined Ma Zhanshan's troops.

117
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,199
Isn't that right?

118
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,560
He joined the Volunteer Army after that.

119
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,720
He was in the guerrilla forces too.

120
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,040
Now he's with the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, right?

121
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,079
All these years,

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
he's come back so many times.

123
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,120
Two years ago,

124
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,000
he took your guards and guns

125
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,040
and took them all away.

126
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,879
Where did he take them?

127
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,879
He must've brought them to his unit.

128
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,040
Just hand him over now.

129
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,600
Don't think I don't know.

130
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:04,959
Old Tian,

131
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,600
I've always treated you well.

132
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,439
I have a family to look after too.

133
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,639
The officer is already involved in this.

134
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,360
You can't hide it.

135
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,360
If you want to blame someone,

136
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,240
blame Old Wu.

137
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,720
He's joined the neighborhood association now.

138
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,160
It was him

139
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,920
who told the officer about you.

140
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,240
Hand him over right away.

141
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,360
Only if you hand him over

142
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,279
can the villagers have peace.

143
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,600
I'm being framed!

144
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,959
There's nothing like that!

145
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,319
Mayor.

146
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,199
Officer.

147
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm innocent!

148
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,040
Officer, I'm innocent!

149
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,600
Officer.

150
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,319
He's definitely hiding inside.

151
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,800
That's not true.

152
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
Really, Officer, it's not true.

153
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Sir! Sir!

154
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,399
Sir, this...

155
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,240
You guys,

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,439
go flip the sign at the door

157
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,319
over for me.

158
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,160
Yes, sir.

159
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,320
Mayor.

160
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,919
What's going on, Mayor?

161
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,159
What's happening?

162
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,480
Under special surveillance.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Draw a talisman.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,080
To keep things calm.

165
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,960
Sir.

166
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,960
Sir.

167
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:46,639
Sir.

168
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,639
June 1941.

169
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
The Soviet-German War broke out.

170
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,039
In July,

171
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,519
the Japanese army, under the pretense of

172
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,840
a "special Kwantung Army exercise,"

173
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
moved large numbers of troops and supplies

174
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,360
into Northeast China.

175
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,639
The Kwantung Army grew to 700,000 men.

176
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,240
The Japanese government prepared to

177
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,360
respond to changes in the Soviet-German War

178
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,080
and, when conditions were right,

179
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,720
launch a war against the Soviet Union.

180
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,799
Launch a war against the Soviet Union.

181
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,519
To defend our cities and villages,

182
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,639
we will fight to the last drop of blood.

183
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,240
We must not waste

184
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,879
a single moment.

185
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,399
We won't miss any

186
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,399
opportunity to fight the enemy.

187
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,440
Everything for the front line.

188
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,960
Everything for victory.

189
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,960
Salute!

190
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,440
Down with German fascists!

191
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,039
Down with German fascists!

192
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,080
Four, six, seven, six.

193
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,759
No, no, that's not right.

194
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,919
Three, two, one, four.

195
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,879
I'm exhausted, I'm exhausted, I'm exhausted.

196
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,759
I'm worn out.

197
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,240
Vasily.

198
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,440
What are you doing?

199
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,320
Why are you here?

200
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,080
What are you writing?

201
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,080
Ashole was killed.

202
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,200
Which Ashole?

203
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,159
Not your brother.

204
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,080
It's my good friend Ashole.

205
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,600
Vasily.

206
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,840
What happened?

207
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,200
Where?

208
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,240
How did he die?

209
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,000
On the way to support the front line.

210
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,879
He was in a troop transport.

211
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,759
It hit a landmine.

212
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,480
He just finished training.

213
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,000
He hadn't even been to a real battlefield.

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,360
The higher-ups know we're close.

215
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,759
So they gave me the job of notifying his family.

216
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:11,960
They assigned it to me.

217
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,240
This letter...

218
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:17,639
How do I write it?

219
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,360
What should I say?

220
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,360
Third platoon, roll call!

221
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,399
Attention!

222
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:44,720
Count off!

223
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,919
One, two, three, four, five, six.

224
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,879
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

225
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,159
Where's Little Donkey?

226
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,279
Little Donkey.

227
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,360
Little Donkey.

228
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,639
Dress right!

229
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,320
Stop training, everyone.

230
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,879
Go back and wait for orders.

231
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,399
Yes, sir.

232
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,279
Little Donkey.

233
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,759
Platoon Leader Lu.

234
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,440
Here!

235
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,480
Stop training.

236
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,039
Take your men

237
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,440
and wait in the tent for orders.

238
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Did something happen?

239
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,120
A rifle went missing from the armory.

240
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,879
All activities are canceled today.

241
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,240
Go back and await instructions.

242
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:16,879
Yes, sir.

243
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,879
Right turn!

244
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,759
March!

245
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,720
You all heard that.

246
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,080
Dismissed.

247
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,960
Little Donkey.

248
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,240
He didn't really run off, did he?

249
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,200
What do you mean?

250
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,480
Stop stalling, just say it right away.

251
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,600
He said he couldn't sleep last night.

252
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,240
He wanted to go out and talk with me.

253
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,440
I forced myself to stay awake.

254
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
And went out with him.

255
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,279
Bro.

256
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,279
Can you do me a favor?

257
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,840
What favor?

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,559
I want to go to the officers' quarters.

259
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,840
What for?

260
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,799
I want to find Grigory.

261
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,919
Ask about my second brother.

262
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,679
Why are you so stubborn?

263
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,399
We're soldiers. We have rules.

264
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,519
Even if you want to ask,

265
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,919
the platoon leader should be the one to ask.

266
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,159
Besides,

267
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,080
your second brother is fine.

268
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,799
Why ask?

269
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,039
I just feel

270
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,639
I just feel I should do something.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,559
Even if you do, wait until tomorrow.

272
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,080
It's the middle of the night.

273
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,480
Anyone you look for now will be annoyed.

274
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,159
Brother, please.

275
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,120
Come with me to take a look.

276
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,399
What if they're still awake?

277
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,799
So I went with him.

278
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,279
We checked around the officers' quarters.

279
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,240
All the lights were out, pitch dark.

280
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,120
He gave up.

281
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,360
Then we came back and went to sleep.

282
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,080
Yunhu.

283
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,679
You two, take the whole platoon.

284
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,799
Go look for Little Donkey.

285
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,320
Yes, sir.

286
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,919
Hurry and get Little Donkey

287
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,600
and bring him back.

288
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,919
The lost rifle

289
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,360
had better have nothing to do with him.

290
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,480
If you can't find him,

291
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,440
he might be labeled a deserter.

292
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:11,960
Desert...

293
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,559
Instructor, you...

294
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,080
How can you say that?

295
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,639
Little Donkey

296
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,440
is someone I brought from Wild Horse Beach.

297
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,600
I brought him here myself.

298
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,120
He has two older brothers.

299
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,159
The eldest

300
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,679
died crossing the river.

301
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:24,960
The second brother, at the start of this year,

302
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,879
went back on a mission.

303
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,080
He still hasn't returned.

304
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,440
Now the youngest soldier in the barracks

305
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
is Little Donkey.

306
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,600
I treat him like my own son.

307
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,159
How could he possibly desert?

308
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:34,720
Enough.

309
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,120
Just hurry and find him.

310
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,080
Little Donkey.

311
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,000
Little Donkey.

312
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,039
Little Donkey.

313
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,879
Little Donkey.

314
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,519
Where are you?

315
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,960
Little Donkey.

316
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,840
We've searched the whole camp.

317
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,080
Still no sign of him.

318
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,039
He must've acted on impulse.

319
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,639
Probably ran back home.

320
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
He's been here so long.

321
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,279
Who wouldn't want to go back?

322
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,240
If he really makes it back,

323
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,519
I'd respect him as a real man.

324
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,360
Cut it out.

325
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
It's flood season now.

326
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,879
The river's wide and the water's high.

327
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,639
If Little Donkey's carrying a rifle,

328
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,440
could he swim across?

329
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,639
Platoon leader, what do we do now?

330
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,960
What should we do?

331
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,279
Honestly,

332
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,440
if Little Donkey

333
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
can make it back alive,

334
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,120
that's fine.

335
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,519
I'm just worried

336
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,600
Osrik

337
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,559
was brought back by car.

338
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,039
Where was he found?

339
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,120
Osrik

340
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,759
was found by farmers in a downstream village.

341
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,279
He was lying unconscious by the river.

342
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,080
Then the farmers saw

343
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,279
he was wearing our uniform.

344
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,440
So they rescued him.

345
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:42,440
Then

346
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
they reported it to the nearby camp.

347
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,759
So, what are the higher-ups

348
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,559
planning to do?

349
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,720
That's all I know.

350
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,039
About this matter,

351
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,039
it's really not Little Donkey's fault.

352
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,400
Little Donkey's second brother,

353
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:12,960
when he went back

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,519
to carry out his mission, he said

355
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,240
he'd be back in three months.

356
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
But now it's been over half a year.

357
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,720
There's no news at all.

358
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,759
It's not just Little Donkey who's anxious.

359
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,680
Even I,

360
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,200
am worried too.

361
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,720
So you're saying

362
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,240
you have a point?

363
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,160
Of course.

364
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,319
Right, Instructor, you said

365
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,200
our unit

366
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,480
has been resting here

367
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,200
for almost a year now.

368
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,079
Every soldier

369
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,640
keeps saying they want to fight back.

370
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,440
When I press down one problem,

371
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,920
another pops up.

372
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:48,880
Every day,

373
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
after finishing training,

374
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,799
I gather them all

375
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,039
together in one place

376
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,039
to study Comrade Mao Zedong's

377
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,079
"On Protracted War."

378
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,319
Now every soldier

379
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,880
studies "On Protracted War"

380
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,960
very seriously.

381
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,000
But yesterday, just for a moment,

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,359
this happened.

383
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,839
Instructor, I think

384
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:18,440
this isn't just

385
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,440
Little Donkey's problem.

386
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,400
It affects our unit's morale.

387
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,119
People are one thing,

388
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,920
but that rifle was supplied by the Soviets.

389
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:31,720
It's a serious matter.

390
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,000
If we

391
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,440
can find that rifle,

392
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,759
what do you want me to do?

393
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
Why so mysterious?

394
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,319
Just tell me what's going on.

395
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:53,720
Vasily.

396
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,359
Osric.

397
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,200
Where exactly is he being held?

398
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,119
What do you want to do?

399
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,119
I want to ask him face to face

400
00:18:59,119 --> 00:18:59,960
what really happened.

401
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,400
I can't tell you.

402
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,160
Vasily.

403
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,240
Don't forget,

404
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,279
you're from Birch Village.

405
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,599
You have to help us.

406
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,200
Then you must promise

407
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,839
not to do anything else.

408
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,200
I promise.

409
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:24,880
Brother.

410
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,079
So you still call me brother.

411
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,599
What are you doing?

412
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,559
What do you think I'm doing?

413
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,039
Do you know how much trouble you've caused?

414
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:34,599
Keep your voice down.

415
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,359
If you keep acting tough with me,

416
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,440
lower your voice.

417
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,240
Why are you getting physical now?

418
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,240
I've already promised Vasily.

419
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,319
Don't lock him up.

420
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,559
Did you take the rifle or not?

421
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,200
Yes.

422
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,119
Where's the rifle?

423
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,200
Lost it.

424
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,079
Lost it.

425
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,920
Where did you lose it?

426
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,160
In the river.

427
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:56,960
In the river.

428
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,160
Well,

429
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,559
when I was crossing the river,

430
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,400
it got swept away.

431
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,599
Otherwise, I would have...

432
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,079
Stop.

433
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:03,960
Seriously.

434
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,680
Where exactly did you lose it?

435
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,079
Thinking...

436
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,480
Why didn't you fall into the river?

437
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,720
Vasily, Vasily, Vasily!

438
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,960
Vasily!

439
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm thinking about it right away!

440
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,160
This Little Donkey

441
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
How can he be labeled a deserter?

442
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
Leaving the unit without permission

443
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,160
If that's not desertion, what is it?

444
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:23,960
No

445
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,880
He went back to fight the Japanese

446
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's still desertion

447
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,759
If everyone goes back to fight the Japanese

448
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,839
What happens to discipline?

449
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:35,759
So tell me

450
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,400
What do you want to do?

451
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,000
Listen, Old Lu

452
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,279
Are you out of your mind or just confused?

453
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,359
What should we do?

454
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,640
Is it up to me?

455
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,920
The situation has already been reported

456
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,440
As for how to handle it

457
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,240
The commanders will decide

458
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:54,519
At best, he'll be confined

459
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,599
At worst, he'll be executed

460
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,200
Instructor

461
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,799
I want to confess to you

462
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,519
Little Donkey crossed the river

463
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,599
I gave him permission

464
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,079
What's going on with you?

465
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,000
What do you mean?

466
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,160
Last year

467
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,000
I went to Wild Horse Beach to look for men

468
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,400
I met Old Donkey and his family

469
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,720
This old fellow

470
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,400
Gave me his three sons

471
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
He entrusted all of them to me

472
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,480
I told him then, old brother

473
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,640
Keep the youngest one

474
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,119
Let him stay and take care of you

475
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,359
He said no

476
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,119
All three of my sons

477
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,480
Are good fighters against the Japanese

478
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,160
If I keep any one of them

479
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,119
He won't be able to hold his head up

480
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,440
Now

481
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,359
The eldest has died

482
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,880
We don't know if the second is alive or dead

483
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,519
Only Little Donkey is left

484
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,319
He told me

485
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,920
He wants to go back to find his second brother

486
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,640
And

487
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,319
He wants to fight the Japanese to avenge his eldest brother

488
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,960
I softened

489
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,640
So I agreed

490
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,880
I also said

491
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,839
Go back and visit your father too

492
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:57,880
Instructor

493
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,200
You can't fight the Japanese empty-handed

494
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,599
You need a gun

495
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,759
I went to the armory

496
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,000
And stole a gun for him

497
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,720
So

498
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,799
It was me

499
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:16,920
Who agreed

500
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,480
To let Little Donkey cross the river

501
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,200
He was following my orders

502
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,519
If anyone gets executed

503
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,839
I should be first

504
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:33,680
Old Lu

505
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,039
Are you playing me for a fool?

506
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,799
Even if the commanders

507
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,200
Come down to investigate

508
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,599
I'll still say the same

509
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:44,920
Alright

510
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,000
Old Lu

511
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,000
Platoon leader

512
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,200
Why

513
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,240
Did you leave without saying anything?

514
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,799
I told you

515
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,920
As if you'd let me go

516
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,160
But you can't just desert

517
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,240
I'm not a deserter

518
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,519
If you're not a deserter, why did you run?

519
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,519
I went to find my second brother and fight the Japanese

520
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,519
So you're the brave one

521
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,319
We're all cowards, huh?

522
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,160
Why is your whole family

523
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,400
So stubborn?

524
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,440
I didn't make it

525
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:50,839
I accept the punishment

526
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,599
Alright, platoon leader, you can go

527
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,799
I can't go anywhere now

528
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,680
Because I didn't manage my men strictly

529
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,720
I'm locked up here too

530
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,240
Someone, come

531
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,160
Someone

532
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,759
Let the platoon leader out

533
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,720
This has nothing to do with him

534
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,079
Stop shouting, come here

535
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
Is anyone there?

536
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,240
Is anyone there?

537
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,160
Come here

538
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,960
Sit down

539
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,759
That's an order

540
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,000
If something happens to you

541
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,599
when Er Donkey comes back

542
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,640
how will I explain it to him?

543
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,279
My second brother won't blame the platoon leader

544
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,400
He knows me

545
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,240
The army has its rules

546
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,960
Who doesn't want to go home?

547
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,799
If everyone was like you

548
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,680
just leaving whenever they want

549
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,279
how would we fight this war?

550
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,160
Discipline

551
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,039
Do you know what discipline means?

552
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,400
P-Platoon leader

553
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,160
According to the rules

554
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,440
how should I be punished?

555
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,279
It's a special time now

556
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:14,119
If they call you a deserter

557
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,880
that's deadly

558
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,799
Don't be afraid, kid

559
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,240
I'm still here for you

560
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,799
As long as you know you were wrong

561
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,880
If it really comes to that

562
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,200
I'll take the blame for you

563
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:40,920
No matter what

564
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,440
I have to give your father, Old Donkey

565
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,160
an explanation

566
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,000
Third platoon, assemble!

567
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:13,640
Brothers

568
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,200
You all know

569
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,000
Little Donkey made a mistake

570
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,119
and was locked up

571
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,799
The platoon leader wasn't strict enough

572
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,240
so he was locked up too

573
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,480
Do you believe

574
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,559
Little Donkey is a deserter?

575
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,200
No, we don't

576
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,839
I don't believe it either

577
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,160
Because I know

578
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,359
he ran back

579
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,799
because he missed home

580
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,920
and wanted to fight the Japanese

581
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,000
Since Little Donkey isn't a deserter

582
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,359
should the platoon leader be locked up?

583
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,759
No, he shouldn't

584
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,599
Brothers

585
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,000
I want to ask you all something

586
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,079
Do you miss home?

587
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,160
Do you want to fight the Japanese?

588
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,039
Yes

589
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,519
I want to ask everyone here

590
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,640
Do you miss home?

591
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,720
Yes, we do

592
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,440
Do you want to fight the Japanese?

593
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,599
Yes, we do

594
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:14,920
Then we should

595
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
let the commander know

596
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,839
we're just like Little Donkey

597
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,119
we all miss home

598
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,559
we all want to fight the Japanese

599
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,559
Isn't that right?

600
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,720
That's right

601
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,519
Third platoon, listen to orders

602
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,480
Turn left

603
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,039
March forward

604
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,759
My home

605
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,400
is on the Songhua River in Northeast China

606
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:54,240
There are forests and coal mines

607
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,200
and also

608
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:04,200
fields full of soybeans and sorghum

609
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,319
Did you hear that?

610
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,680
On the Songhua River in Northeast China

611
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,480
We heard it

612
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,279
This must be

613
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,759
Yunhu and Fuqing leading everyone

614
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,440
asking for you

615
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,599
Is it any use, platoon leader?

616
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,839
From the sound of it

617
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,880
there are quite a few people

618
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,400
It should help a bit

619
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,119
On the Songhua River in Northeast China

620
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:40,759
Platoon leader

621
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,240
I've made up my mind

622
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,799
You don't have to die for me

623
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm not afraid to die

624
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,880
I just feel

625
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,519
that dying like this

626
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
is too humiliating

627
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,160
My home

628
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,559
is on the Songhua River in Northeast China

629
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:22,079
There are forests and coal mines

630
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,960
and also

631
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:32,240
fields full of soybeans and sorghum

632
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,160
My home

633
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,880
is on the Songhua River in Northeast China

634
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:48,640
My fellow countrymen are there

635
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:59,720
and my aging parents

636
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,519
September 18th

637
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,519
September 18th

638
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:14,920
Since that tragic time

639
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,480
Someday, we

640
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,359
will fight our way back.

641
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,039
When that day comes,

642
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,039
our Party Central Committee

643
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,359
will lead

644
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,279
our troops from inside the pass

645
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,559
to drive all the Japanese

646
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,960
one by one

647
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,759
back to their homeland.

648
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,920
You know

649
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,519
what happens next?

650
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,839
Those on land

651
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,359
will cross the Great Wall.

652
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,039
Those by sea will cross the Bohai Sea.

653
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,920
Then we'll coordinate

654
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,640
inside and outside attacks.

655
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,200
In a grand march,

656
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,319
we'll cross the river and fight back.

657
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,400
Planes overhead,

658
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
red flags waving on the ground,

659
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,519
torches held high.

660
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,400
All our fighters

661
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,920
will appear where the Japanese

662
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,759
least expect.

663
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,400
Everyone will show up.

664
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,240
All over the hills and fields.

665
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,920
By then, they might not even

666
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,640
have time to cry.

667
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,079
Platoon leader,

668
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,359
can that day really come?

669
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,680
As long as we believe,

670
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,640
it will come.

671
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,400
Donkey,

672
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,440
you're up.

673
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
You didn't sleep, did you?

674
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,119
Platoon leader,

675
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,519
I've made up my mind.

676
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,480
This matter

677
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,159
must not involve anyone else.

678
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,960
Don't overthink it. This

679
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,920
isn't for us to decide.

680
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,400
No, platoon leader,

681
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,840
no,

682
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,440
it's not about our decision.

683
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:00,519
I...

684
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,599
I'll take responsibility myself if needed.

685
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,440
I'll set an example for our unit.

686
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,760
Hey, what's wrong there?

687
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,599
Maybe when I went into the river,

688
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
a branch scratched me.

689
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:18,840
Take it off.

690
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,960
I'll sew it for you.

691
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,000
What,

692
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,199
you want me to undress you myself?

693
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,320
Is it here?

694
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,840
It should be here.

695
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,159
It fell down here.

696
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,400
No idea where it's drifted by now.

697
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:45,880
The key is, we don't know

698
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,320
if Donkey was right.

699
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,239
Is this the spot?

700
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,679
How about this:

701
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:50,880
Let's search section by section.

702
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,320
We're not just looking for a gun.

703
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,519
That's Donkey's life.

704
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,400
As long as the gun is in the river,

705
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,639
we must get it out today.

706
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
Keep searching, don't shout.

707
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,400
Let's do this:

708
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,239
I'll go in here.

709
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,480
I'm better in the water than you.

710
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,599
You guys go downstream.

711
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,480
Okay, okay.

712
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,280
Ten meters apart.

713
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,159
Right, right.

714
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Ten meters apart.

715
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,639
How are we supposed to find it?

716
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,199
Why are you staring at me?

717
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,280
Recite a passage.

718
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:37,840
Recite what?

719
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,599
The non-isolated nature of China's war.

720
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,320
The non-isolated nature of China's war.

721
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,639
It is not only generally based on

722
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,079
international support,

723
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,920
but also specifically on

724
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,000
the aid from the Soviet Union.

725
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,719
China and the Soviet Union are geographically close.

726
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:54,679
This fact

727
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,079
increases Japan's crisis

728
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,679
and benefits China's resistance.

729
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,960
China and Japan are geographically close,

730
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,159
which makes China's resistance more difficult.

731
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:03,840
However,

732
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,400
the proximity of China and the Soviet Union

733
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,760
is an advantage

734
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,639
for China's resistance.

735
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,280
Comrade Mao Zedong put it so well.

736
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,719
Our Anti-Japanese War

737
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,679
is a war of attrition.

738
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,159
We've been fighting for ten years.

739
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,519
If needed, we'll fight another ten years.

740
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,719
The harder things get,

741
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,239
the more we must stay calm.

742
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,880
As long as the green hills remain, there's no need to worry about firewood.

743
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,800
Don't take your own life lightly.

744
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,119
Everyone misses home.

745
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,679
Mainly, it's my own thinking

746
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,400
and my political work that haven't been good enough.

747
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,360
I should take the main responsibility.

748
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,960
Please give me disciplinary action, commanders.

749
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:52,320
Platoon leader.

750
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,239
It's already noon, isn't it?

751
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,159
Platoon leader.

752
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,800
Do you know why I want to go back?

753
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,519
Why?

754
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,719
Because across the river is my home.

755
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,599
My father is there.

756
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,000
My second brother.

757
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,519
All the villagers are there.

758
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,119
Our family graves are on Wild Horse Beach.

759
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:44,199
The Japanese took our horses.

760
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,639
They burned our house.

761
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,000
They seized our land.

762
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,679
What am I doing?

763
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,559
I have to go back for revenge.

764
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,119
I'll shoot one with every bullet.

765
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,480
One shot, one kill.

766
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,679
I have to wipe out all of them at Wild Horse Beach.

767
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,679
All the Japanese.

768
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,280
That's bold talk.

769
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,800
But your actions weren't so great.

770
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,039
Platoon leader.

771
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,719
I know I was wrong.

772
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,320
I was the one who stole the gun.

773
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,639
I was also the one who sneaked out.

774
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,519
If I get executed,

775
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,920
please pass a message to my father for me.

776
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,800
Just tell him—

777
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,360
Shut up.

778
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,719
Stop talking nonsense.

779
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,360
Say something lucky.

780
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:47,840
You eat.

781
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,719
How long has Fuqing been down there?

782
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,679
He hasn't shown up for a while.

783
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,639
Hurry and look for him, Fuqing!

784
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,519
Yes.

785
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,639
The gun's been found.

786
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,840
The gun's been found.

787
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,440
The gun's been found.

788
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,239
Found it.

789
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,559
Little Donkey can be saved now.

790
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,760
Found it.

791
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,719
Found it, found it.
