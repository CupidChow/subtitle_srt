1
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,519
Carry him away.

2
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,319
One, two, three.

3
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:08,919
Hurry up.

4
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
One, two, three.

5
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
Why are your hands so frozen?

6
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,159
It's not from the cold.

7
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,199
It's from their tiger shackles.

8
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,360
What are you thinking?

9
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Are you stupid?

10
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,919
Thinking about big things.

11
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,080
Darn it.

12
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,520
This time it'll take ages.

13
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,120
We won't see each other.

14
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,159
We're heading to the Soviet Union.

15
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,280
You're still laughing.

16
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,840
When we get to the Soviet Union,

17
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,919
we won't understand a word they say.

18
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,039
Their food's different from ours.

19
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,599
Anything's better than eating tree bark.

20
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,199
Why do you compare everything to tree bark?

21
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,039
What do Soviet people look like?

22
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
You mean men or women?

23
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,479
Both.

24
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,360
Where'd you get that?

25
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,479
Don't worry about it.

26
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,280
Go, go!

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,879
Hua'er.

28
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,000
Come here.

29
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:35,840
Wait a second.

30
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,639
Give me the child. Come.

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,199
I just got the baby.

32
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,479
Let me hold him a bit longer.

33
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:40,879
What are you doing?

34
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,159
I'm the father, I want to hold him too.

35
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,680
He's asleep.

36
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,879
His eyes look just like yours.

37
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,759
Little rascal.

38
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,960
If he bullies his mom when he grows up,

39
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,039
I'll teach him a lesson.

40
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:56,960
Come.

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,120
Come, Hua'er.

42
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,199
Uncle.

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,639
This horse is really fast.

44
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,199
I think in half a day

45
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,319
we'll reach the riverbank.

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,879
So when we get to the Soviet Union,

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,839
when can we come back?

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Missing home, huh?

49
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,199
Even if I want to, I don't dare go back.

50
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:30,839
How about this—

51
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,240
When the war is over,

52
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,040
I'll go with you.

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
We'll go home together.

54
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
We'll apologize to your father.

55
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,680
No need for that.

56
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,079
I'm his son.

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,040
He won't eat me, will he?

58
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,399
Take cover!

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,319
Those Japs—

60
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,439
Which way did they come from?

61
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,839
Uncle, I'll go check.

62
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,800
Come back!

63
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,680
You, come back!

64
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,240
My horse!

65
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,439
Big brother! Big brother!

66
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,360
Spread out!

67
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,839
Scatter and run!

68
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,560
Third brother!

69
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,879
Spread out! Scatter and run!

70
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,480
Move aside.

71
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,959
Big brother! Brother!

72
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,360
Big brother!

73
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,959
I'll fight you to the end!

74
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,959
You two, shut up!

75
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,120
Can I let you two handle this?

76
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,480
If I, as the big brother, don't go,

77
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,279
when I see Dad,

78
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,759
he'll kill me for sure.

79
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,480
It's easy to be a dog, hard to be a man.

80
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,079
We're all Chinese.

81
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,000
We must live with

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,240
the unyielding spirit of the Chinese.

83
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,160
You understand?

84
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,160
I understand, Dad.

85
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:47,800
Let's do it!

86
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,079
I'll fight you to the end!

87
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,600
Let me go!

88
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,600
I'll fight them to the end!

89
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,240
Let me go!

90
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,160
Bastard! Bastard!

91
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,759
You're asking for death.

92
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,079
You want revenge?

93
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,279
Survive first.

94
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Take Little Donkey and go.

95
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,680
Hurry!

96
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,720
Hurry!

97
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,360
Let's go.

98
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,600
Let's go.

99
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,680
Go quickly!

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,480
Go!

101
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,240
I'm exhausted.

102
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,519
Let's rest a bit.

103
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,840
Let's rest.

104
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,759
Sir.

105
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,679
Sir.

106
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,799
What did you say?

107
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,080
I didn't steal anything,

108
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
nor did I rob anyone.

109
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm really a good citizen.

110
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,360
Sir.

111
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,919
I know.

112
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:07,639
And then?

113
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,960
Xiao Tielin.

114
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,360
Really is.

115
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,840
He's your relative.

116
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,080
Can you come up with something new?

117
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,240
Sir.

118
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,879
Don't tell me

119
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,840
you think I'm really with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army?

120
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,639
I'm really not.

121
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,679
Sir.

122
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,399
Believe what you want.

123
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,679
So what if I am?

124
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,559
Let me tell you,

125
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,080
you've been inside too long,

126
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,240
you don't know what it's like outside.

127
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,840
Out there now,

128
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,120
it's the Imperial Japanese Army's world.

129
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,399
The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army?

130
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,720
They've been wiped out long ago.

131
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,039
Still talking about the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army?

132
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
Why?

133
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,639
Why what?

134
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,200
Does it have anything to do with you?

135
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,720
I mean,

136
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,840
why are you torturing me like this?

137
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,519
You want to know?

138
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,399
I don't know either.

139
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,039
Maybe it's just fun beating you.

140
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,000
Someone!

141
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,200
Take him back.

142
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:52,960
Squad leader

143
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,360
Fu Qing

144
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,039
Yun Hu

145
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,240
Oh, right

146
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,600
What about Hua'er and White Horse?

147
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,639
We got separated

148
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,000
Did you see Xiao Gui?

149
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,120
No, I didn't

150
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,399
What about your brother?

151
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,200
Alright then

152
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,879
Let's wait for them at the rendezvous point

153
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,279
Let's go

154
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,720
Everyone, get ready

155
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,840
We're crossing the river

156
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,120
Squad leader

157
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,200
I'm a good swimmer

158
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll scout ahead

159
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,440
Hold him back

160
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,360
Stop him

161
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,200
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

162
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,720
Once those cotton clothes get wet

163
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,200
They'll be heavier than a weight

164
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,639
You fool

165
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:51,679
Squad leader

166
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,279
Come check on Xiao Dengzi

167
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,639
He's lost all his blood

168
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,080
You two

169
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,320
Sink Xiao Dengzi in the river

170
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,000
Squad leader

171
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
We can't let the Japs know

172
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
where we entered the water

173
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:16,960
Hurry

174
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,519
Yes

175
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,840
Yun Hu, Fu Qing

176
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,360
Here

177
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,720
You two lead everyone across first

178
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,639
Yes

179
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,559
What about you?

180
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,720
I'll cover the retreat with Er Donkey

181
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,240
And wait for Hua'er and the others

182
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,120
Squad leader

183
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,960
I'll stay too

184
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,279
Get the hell out!

185
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,000
Go, now!

186
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,200
Listen up

187
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,279
Take off your cotton clothes

188
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Take everything off

189
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,320
Tie them with your rifles

190
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,480
Strap them to this wooden frame

191
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,879
Pat each other

192
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,759
Keep patting until your skin turns red

193
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,080
As long as you keep this warmth

194
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,759
You'll make it across

195
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,240
Understand?

196
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,200
Got it, got it, got it

197
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,200
Let's go

198
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,919
Hurry up and strip

199
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,600
Come.

200
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,000
This way, this way.

201
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,399
Here.

202
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,720
Come.

203
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,600
Uncle.

204
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,559
Go ahead.

205
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,360
Hua'er.

206
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,559
Little White Horse.

207
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,200
Xiaogui and the others.

208
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,120
Can they make it here?

209
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,799
They can.

210
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,320
They definitely can.

211
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,480
They all know the route.

212
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,679
Oh right, Er Donkey.

213
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
If, in a moment,

214
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,919
the Japs and puppet army show up,

215
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,120
we'll split and run in two directions.

216
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,039
Run and shoot at the same time.

217
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,639
We must draw the enemy away.

218
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,759
Don't let them find out

219
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,840
where we're crossing the river.

220
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,120
Okay.

221
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:38,519
Sir

222
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:39,559
Sir

223
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:42,559
He's here.

224
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,480
No.

225
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,119
It's time to go.

226
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,480
Let's go.

227
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:00,680
Let's move.

228
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,319
Platoon Leader

229
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,200
He's gone

230
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,000
Report.

231
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:51,960
All roads leading to the riverbank

232
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,240
have been cut off.

233
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,000
The Chinese are very cunning.

234
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,319
The nearby villages

235
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,480
must be thoroughly searched.

236
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,920
Don't let a single one slip by.

237
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,480
Yes, sir.

238
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:43,839
Hua'er

239
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,480
I can't go on anymore.

240
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,200
I want to see my child.

241
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,039
Look.

242
00:21:59,079 --> 00:21:59,599
Look.

243
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,759
Hua'er

244
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,839
Leng

245
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,880
Hua'er

246
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:10,599
Leng

247
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:12,519
Leng

248
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,039
You've never lost out by being with me in this life.

249
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,200
I haven't let you down, have I?

250
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,960
Live well.

251
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,599
In the next life,

252
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,200
I'll come find you again on a white horse.

253
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,839
Is that okay?

254
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,720
It's a promise.

255
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,680
Absolutely.

256
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,400
Hua'er

257
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
You really are

258
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,440
beautiful.

259
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,400
What's your name?

260
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,079
Lan Hua'er.

261
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,880
That's a nice name.

262
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Lan Hua'er.

263
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,279
Hua'er, don't worry.

264
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,400
Your mother's grudge

265
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,920
is my grudge too.

266
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,119
Hua'er.

267
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,400
I'm really lucky.

268
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,759
That's great, Hua'er.

269
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,920
That's great.

270
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,119
Hua'er.

271
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,640
I'm a father now.

272
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,880
Take a break.

273
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,319
Take a break.

274
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,200
Let's go.

275
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,519
Move, move.

276
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,279
Come on.

277
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,880
Go.

278
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,880
Platoon Leader

279
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,720
That's it.

280
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,160
Is that a building?

281
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,119
It could be their outpost.

282
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,200
Right, let's head there.

283
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,000
Go, go.

284
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:03,839
Let's move.

285
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,000
Who goes there?

286
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,319
Stop!

287
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,319
Stop!

288
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,599
Stop!

289
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,519
Stop!

290
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,000
Who are you?

291
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,559
We are—

292
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,799
Chinese.

293
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,759
From the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

294
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,920
They're Chinese.

295
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,880
From the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

296
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,640
Put down your guns.

297
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,559
Tell them to put down their guns.

298
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,839
Please put your guns down.

299
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,319
Why are we surrendering our weapons right away?

300
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,359
Enough talk.

301
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:57,799
We're on their turf now.

302
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,119
Follow their instructions.

303
00:30:59,319 --> 00:30:59,720
Hurry.

304
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,720
Take out your guns.

305
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:01,839
Put them on the ground.

306
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,839
Put them on the ground.

307
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,279
Come with me.

308
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,519
Come with me.

309
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,640
Alright, let's go.

310
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,920
This is a Chinese unit.

311
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,519
Yes.

312
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,160
God knows what they've been through.

313
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,079
This is what a real battlefield looks like.

314
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,279
May heaven protect them.

315
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,559
May heaven protect us too.

316
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,480
Platoon Leader.

317
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,400
What else do we have to do?

318
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,440
We've been checked for half the day.

319
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,240
This setup looks—

320
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,200
Why is it so intimidating?

321
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,079
This scene reminds me—

322
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,839
I've seen it somewhere before.

323
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,960
Like a pig slaughter at a landlord's house.

324
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:06,599
Just like this.

325
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,640
I know what comes next.

326
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:09,920
Scalding the pig's hair.

327
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,839
Two people go in first.

328
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:14,599
Uh—

329
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,079
You've all been through this, right?

330
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,599
Then you two go in first.

331
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,319
Go, go.

332
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,400
You two, go in.

333
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,160
Go on, go on.

334
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,200
Come, sit down.

335
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,480
What are they going to do?

336
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,720
Comrades.

337
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,480
What are you doing?

338
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,319
Strictly follow the medical inspection procedure.

339
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,119
Sit down and stay quiet.

340
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,160
Bro, aren't we just taking a bath?

341
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,240
Why are they all women?

342
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,440
Feeling shy?

343
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,079
Come on, let's go.

344
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,680
Where are we going?

345
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,519
What are you doing?

346
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,160
Sit down.

347
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,079
Why are you like this?

348
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,839
Look, there are lots of parasites.

349
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,480
It's a lot of work.

350
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,319
Don't touch inside.

351
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,680
Let's get started.

352
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,279
They're going to shave our heads.

353
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,279
No, no, no.

354
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,480
You can't shave my hair.

355
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,480
My brother told me to keep this.

356
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,519
Let go.

357
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,759
Why can't you do it?

358
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,079
I've already cut mine.

359
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:29,839
What's your problem?

360
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,839
Stop with the nonsense.

361
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,839
If you're a soldier, you follow orders.

362
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,279
Don't disgrace the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

363
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,359
Do it.

364
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,400
Don't move.

365
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't move.

366
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,360
Alright.

367
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,480
Let's go.

368
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,480
Don't go, don't go!

369
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,880
Come back! Come back!

370
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,360
What are you doing?

371
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,920
What are you doing?

372
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,599
Take off your clothes.

373
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,039
No.

374
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,320
You take them off.

375
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
Why are you taking off my clothes?

376
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:49,920
Don't move.

377
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:50,440
You...

378
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,119
You moved.

379
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,039
Wait, I can't take off my clothes!

380
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,360
Don't pull my waistband!

381
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,559
He's embarrassed.

382
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,760
I'll do it myself.

383
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,199
Don't strip me.

384
00:34:59,199 --> 00:34:59,840
Little Donkey.

385
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,320
Stop talking nonsense.

386
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,679
We can't disgrace the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

387
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,920
That tickles.

388
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,760
Don't touch my waistband!

389
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,079
Listen to this.

390
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,360
Like a pig slaughter at the landlord's house.

391
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,920
Not bad.

392
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,079
Hey, slow down.

393
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,800
Come on, open the door!

394
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:35,400
Hey, bro.

395
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,400
Inside.

396
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,159
It does smell a bit.

397
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,519
Move aside.

398
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,719
We're almost done for.

399
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:08,559
Come on.

400
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,480
Come on.

401
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,480
Come on, bro.

402
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,039
He's almost dead.

403
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,760
What's wrong, bro?

404
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,079
Why did you hit him so hard?

405
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,519
He's my brother.

406
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,559
Didn't you know?

407
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,880
Were you trying to kill him?

408
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,639
Good thing I got here in time.

409
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,159
Otherwise, this kid's life

410
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,760
would've been gone already.

411
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:24,440
Get lost.

412
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:25,760
Bro, don't be mad.

413
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,719
We didn't know you were close.

414
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
Alright, I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

415
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,719
Later,

416
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,880
I'll find you a doctor.

417
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,000
Once you're healed,

418
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,119
just go home.

419
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,280
Bro.

420
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,440
Thank you.

421
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,880
You can actually say thanks?

422
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,519
Tang Deyuan.

423
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,679
You got me this time.

424
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,559
Do I owe you,

425
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,239
or am I in your debt?

426
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,760
Am I pathetic or what?

427
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,639
When your dad was sick,

428
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,159
I found him a doctor.

429
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,239
When you were sick,

430
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,199
I found you a doctor.

431
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,280
If I ever get sick,

432
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,400
just don't bring me a wolf.

433
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,800
Uncle.

434
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,679
You look sharp after shaving.

435
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,280
Squad Leader, Yun Hu.

436
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:04,559
Did those women

437
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,559
strip your clothes too?

438
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,800
No, they didn't.

439
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,679
We've got hands and feet.

440
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,920
We cleaned ourselves up.

441
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,840
No,

442
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,320
then why were we stripped?

443
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,639
Look at you two.

444
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:16,960
What?

445
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,039
You feel wronged?

446
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,440
We're at war right now.

447
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,440
Who cares about men or women?

448
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,639
Can you toughen up a bit?

449
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,639
No,

450
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,280
but it's so embarrassing.

451
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,880
Enough.

452
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
I already told you,

453
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,480
don't ask, but you keep asking.

454
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,119
Squad Leader.

455
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,079
Last time we got this clean,

456
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,480
I can't even remember when that was.

457
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,760
Squad Leader.

458
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,559
What are you thinking about?

459
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,679
I'm just hoping

460
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,800
everyone who didn't make it is okay.

461
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:51,840
Let's go.

462
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,480
Come on.

463
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,199
Over there.

464
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:33,679
Hurry, chase them!

465
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,440
I, Lan Hua'er, am a soldier.

466
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,480
Always a fighter of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

467
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,360
Women dare to fight the enemy.

468
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:23,519
We die without our bodies intact.

469
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,840
This is what it means to be Chinese.
