1
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,719
Platoon Leader, where are we heading?

2
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,280
Head into the woods.

3
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,359
Once we're in the woods,

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,159
they won't be able to catch us.

5
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,519
Alright.

6
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,159
Platoon Leader.

7
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,920
How did you know there was danger?

8
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:52,799
We heard

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,000
someone shouting outside.

10
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,760
So we came out.

11
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,159
It was Xiaogui.

12
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,479
Get out.

13
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:34,599
Move.

14
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,759
I can't walk anymore.

15
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,840
Let's rest for a bit.

16
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,800
Deyuan.

17
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,479
Welcome back to the unit.

18
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,319
I never agreed.

19
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
For you all to rejoin.

20
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,840
And also,

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,599
What you did today,

22
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,840
No matter if I

23
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,000
got on your truck,

24
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,560
or how I go back,

25
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,479
If I can't explain, I can't return.

26
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,800
They definitely won't believe me.

27
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,680
So that plan you mentioned before,

28
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
I don't think it'll work.

29
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,439
Don't worry.

30
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm still here.

31
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,759
What do you mean?

32
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,639
Yunhu, Fuqing.

33
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:41,879
Here.

34
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,480
You two are a team.

35
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,040
Hide first.

36
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,079
Don't rush into town.

37
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,519
Wait until things settle down inside.

38
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,000
Then we'll talk.

39
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,759
What about me?

40
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
You're with Deyuan.

41
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,160
You,

42
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,439
after those two leave,

43
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,480
lead the enemy here.

44
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,079
What the heck?

45
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,480
What kind of plan is this?

46
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,399
If only Xiaogui were here.

47
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,759
I'll do it.

48
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,720
Your hand.

49
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,800
Platoon Leader.

50
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,959
Platoon Leader.

51
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,000
What's wrong with you?

52
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:13,920
Platoon Leader.

53
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,519
What are you doing?

54
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,680
What's going on?

55
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,600
Platoon Leader.

56
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,360
Platoon.

57
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,279
Platoon Leader.

58
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,439
Platoon Leader! Platoon Leader! Platoon Leader!

59
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,000
Platoon Leader.

60
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:31,920
Platoon Leader.

61
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,000
Platoon Leader, what's wrong?

62
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,600
Don't shout.

63
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,959
Don't shout.

64
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,199
Platoon Leader.

65
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,120
Platoon Leader.

66
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:08,839
Platoon Leader.

67
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,480
Platoon Leader.

68
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,319
Platoon Leader.

69
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,519
Platoon Leader.

70
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,399
Platoon Leader.

71
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:40,680
You...

72
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,720
You got shot, why didn't you say anything?

73
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,439
Platoon Leader.

74
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,959
Platoon Leader.

75
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,000
If you leave, what will we do?

76
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,960
Didn't you say you would

77
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,120
lead us to victory together?

78
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,120
Platoon Leader.

79
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,639
Old Tang.

80
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,000
What are you really thinking?

81
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,519
Gao Yunhu.

82
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,240
Gao Yunhu.

83
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,320
Here.

84
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,919
Wan Fuqing.

85
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,720
Here.

86
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,639
Obey.

87
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,720
Platoon Leader's orders.

88
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes.

89
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,240
Let's go.

90
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,080
Platoon Leader.

91
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,679
Deyuan.

92
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:35,960
At Eight Pine Trees.

93
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You carved that mark yourself.

94
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,440
Why bring it up now?

95
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,639
If it's carved, it works.

96
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,559
Carved means carved.

97
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,919
Now it's no longer

98
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,320
just your personal vendetta.

99
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,080
It's national and family hatred.

100
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,120
Can we avenge it together?

101
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,039
Take this Bald Ridge for example,

102
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,200
the Japanese defensive works here

103
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,360
are tied to

104
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,639
thousands and thousands of lives.

105
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,919
You know that deep down.

106
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,840
If we

107
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,720
don't act before the enemy,

108
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,519
countless soldiers

109
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,440
will lose their lives here.

110
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,799
As long as I, Old Shandong,

111
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,799
have a breath left in me,

112
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,519
I'll make sure everyone returns to the unit.

113
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,279
You killed him.

114
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
Just this one.

115
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,639
There were supposed to be two more.

116
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,840
But they scattered right at the start.

117
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,279
Who is he?

118
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,120
Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

119
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,240
Just returned from the Soviet Union.

120
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,559
His name is Lu Changshan.

121
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,200
He used to be my Platoon Leader.

122
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,159
An old comrade.

123
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Why did you kill him?

124
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,240
They took me hostage.

125
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,840
Wanted to lure my brother out.

126
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,879
For what?

127
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,399
They wanted to kill my brother.

128
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,799
Said it was to eliminate traitors.

129
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,120
Seems like that's also

130
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,919
one of their missions.

131
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,279
Who’s your brother?

132
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,799
Xiao Tielin.

133
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,840
Chief of Mudanjiang Police Department.

134
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,639
Just now,

135
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,759
you said that was one of their missions.

136
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,039
Put it down.

137
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,720
What about the second mission?

138
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,679
They

139
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,320
have an assassination mission.

140
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,480
Assassinate who?

141
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,840
Assassinate someone named

142
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,159
Kawano Sōsuke.

143
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,519
They're pretty determined.

144
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,159
How did you kill him?

145
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,720
I waited till he wasn't paying attention.

146
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,679
Grabbed his gun.

147
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,679
He tried to run.

148
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,600
I shot him in the back.

149
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,440
Where's the gun?

150
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,919
Tokarev TT-33.

151
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,399
It came from over there.

152
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,559
Lift him up.

153
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,480
Yes, yes.

154
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,399
Here.

155
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,320
Should be a bit farther.

156
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,200
A bit farther.

157
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,440
Here.

158
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,320
That's about right.

159
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,559
Come here.

160
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,519
Fire another shot for me.

161
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,960
Let me see how you shoot.

162
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,799
No, I...

163
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,480
What's wrong?

164
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,519
Are you scared?

165
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,440
Let him go.

166
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,600
Wait.

167
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,879
I have a request.

168
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:37,519
Go ahead.

169
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,039
I want to bury him myself.

170
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:45,759
Is that okay?

171
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,519
Sure.

172
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:53,799
Thank you.

173
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,360
I forgot to introduce myself.

174
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,640
I

175
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,920
am Kawano Sosuke.

176
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,200
Retreat.

177
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,039
Move.

178
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,240
Chief

179
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,599
You just let him go like that?

180
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,680
What's wrong?

181
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,559
Just now,

182
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,160
You told him to shoot, but he didn't.

183
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,839
That means there's something fishy.

184
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,359
Chinese people respect the dead above all.

185
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,000
If he'd shot without hesitation,

186
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,759
then that would be truly suspicious.

187
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,880
You trust him that much?

188
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:19,680
No.

189
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,240
The person I trust most now is you.

190
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,799
Do you believe that?

191
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,400
No.

192
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
I swore an oath.

193
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:48,599
As long as I'm alive,

194
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,079
all of you,

195
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,599
must be found.

196
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,440
If Deyuan comes back,

197
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,440
have him send us a message.

198
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,200
As long as we know

199
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
he's safe, that's enough.

200
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,200
The Japanese inside the pass

201
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,079
got beaten badly by us.

202
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,920
We've been bullied for so long.

203
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,519
Finally, we see the dawn.

204
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,240
Before, the Japanese were strong and we were weak.

205
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,720
Now it's our turn to stand up.

206
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,000
We're gonna fight them.

207
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,839
No matter what,

208
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:48,400
Xiaogui

209
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,079
saved us yesterday.

210
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,240
If he hadn't made such a fuss,

211
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,960
we would've all been caught.

212
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,720
Right?

213
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,279
I just don't get it.

214
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,000
Why did he

215
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,400
show up at Da Dongbao Station then?

216
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,359
Why is it always such a coincidence?

217
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,319
Then, you...

218
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,640
Did you forget the Platoon Leader?

219
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,559
Before he died,

220
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,440
he kept talking about Xiaogui.

221
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,839
Didn't he always say

222
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,599
we're

223
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,039
family.

224
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,960
We need to rejoin the team.

225
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,359
We all have to go home.

226
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:58,680
We...

227
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,160
Can we give up on Xiaogui?

228
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:04,640
Can we?

229
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,000
Tell me.

230
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,839
Let's go to the distillery.

231
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,880
I said, let's go to the distillery.

232
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,559
If he runs away out of guilt,

233
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,640
it'll be obvious.

234
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,759
Number 490 woke up.

235
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,160
He said

236
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,319
he saw the police suddenly arrive.

237
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,759
It might alarm your "fish".

238
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,880
The plan we told him

239
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,480
was different.

240
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,000
He wanted to help us stop the police.

241
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,440
But he was alone.

242
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,039
He had no other way.

243
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Um...

244
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,400
What did Zhao Qingtian say?

245
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,119
He said he was eager to protect you.

246
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,440
He saw Tang Deyuan trying to connect

247
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,799
with some shady forces.

248
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:20,880
So he arranged

249
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,839
related actions.

250
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,440
That guy's a complete fool.

251
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,359
He's way too impatient.

252
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,880
Rushing for promotion, eager for credit.

253
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,079
He messed things up.

254
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,200
Also,

255
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,440
Zhao Qingtian suspects

256
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,960
Number 490 is with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

257
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,279
He made noise at the door on purpose.

258
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,799
What do you think?

259
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,119
No one

260
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400
can escape the control of Pafedin.

261
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,279
Number 490

262
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,039
We've already gotten close to the enemy's core.

263
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,839
Give him a taste of success first.

264
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:04,720
But warn him.

265
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,319
Next step,

266
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,119
we must do whatever it takes

267
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,240
to get back among them.

268
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,599
I believe

269
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,480
they'll move forward soon.

270
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,559
Their next move.

271
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,160
Plus, Tang Deyuan is still one of the three fish.

272
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,039
Mr. Liu,

273
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,559
do you know that in Japan,

274
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,279
during this season,

275
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,200
the first bonito is heading north?

276
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,559
Especially in Kanto,

277
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,799
early summer bonito sashimi

278
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,759
is considered worth spending a fortune

279
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,920
just to taste.

280
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,480
They scatter live sardines

281
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,640
and use rods with fake bait.

282
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,799
The bonito, thinking there's a school of sardines,

283
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,920
gather together.

284
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,640
Then they're caught.

285
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,640
Fighting such fish

286
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,759
takes about fifteen minutes.

287
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,720
And Tang Deyuan

288
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,519
is just like that fish.

289
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,400
You mean

290
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,440
Tian Xiaogui is like the sardine?

291
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,559
No.

292
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,920
The key is the fake bait.

293
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,400
Director Xiao,

294
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,400
you're still not careful enough.

295
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,039
Captain Zaoji of the Military Police

296
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:28,759
told me

297
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,240
while handling

298
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,960
Mr. Morita's affairs,

299
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,519
he discovered that Director Xiao

300
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,200
had some financial issues.

301
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:37,960
Sir,

302
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,720
I, Xiao,

303
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,880
have no way to defend myself.

304
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,559
I did all this for one reason only,

305
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,279
for Mudanjiang,

306
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,640
to make the Special Higher Police's funds

307
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,160
more abundant.

308
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,640
To serve the Empire of Japan

309
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,920
more smoothly.

310
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,799
Considering

311
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,319
you've worked with Mr. Morita for years

312
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,599
and achieved some results,

313
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,240
I've spoken on your behalf.

314
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,480
Sir,

315
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,480
thank you very much.

316
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,720
Looks like

317
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,640
Director Xiao in this police station

318
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,920
still doesn't get much news.

319
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,880
Things have changed lately.

320
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,039
Your Emperor

321
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,759
and his top officials

322
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,160
are going through major changes.

323
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,519
If certain things get exposed,

324
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,119
even if I want to protect Director Xiao,

325
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,920
I'm afraid I can't help.

326
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,839
Sir

327
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,519
For all these years

328
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,079
I've served the Empire of Japan,

329
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,200
for the sake of my work,

330
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,440
please show me a way out.

331
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,119
Remember a few years ago,

332
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
the patriotic businessman Zhang Benzheng

333
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,839
donated

334
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
forty planes to the Empire.

335
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,000
The Emperor himself ordered

336
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,200
his achievements

337
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,680
to be written into Japanese textbooks.

338
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,240
This matter

339
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,839
Director Xiao knows about it, right?

340
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,319
Sir

341
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,920
Chairman Zhang Benzheng

342
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,119
is famous in Northeast China.

343
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,400
Everyone knows him.

344
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,559
He's as rich as a nation.

345
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,599
If you want to go, just donate one plane.

346
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,759
Think about it.

347
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,599
No need to think.

348
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:12,599
I'm willing.

349
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,000
As long as I can serve the Empire of Japan,

350
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,720
I'm willing to do anything.

351
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,839
I'll give my money

352
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,160
to help the Empire.

353
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,000
Alright then.

354
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:24,160
Inform Captain Zaoji in advance.

355
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,599
Bring enough money

356
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,920
and go to our Hailang Airport.

357
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,240
Someone will

358
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,480
arrange for you to board the plane.

359
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,119
You'll go to a free country.

360
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,920
Yes.

361
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,319
Thank you very much, Sir.

362
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,799
Xiaogui

363
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,119
How did you get hurt like this?

364
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,079
You didn't get hurt anywhere else, right?

365
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,839
I'm fine.

366
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,559
Brother Fuqing

367
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,880
Brother Yunhu

368
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,759
You came to take me away, right?

369
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,599
Let's go.

370
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,079
Xiaogui

371
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,759
The Platoon Leader is gone.

372
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,119
Before he left,

373
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,319
his last words were

374
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,359
"If only Xiaogui were here."

375
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,720
Gui'er, Gui'er

376
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,839
Slow down, slow down, Gui'er

377
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,799
How could he be gone?

378
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,359
How could he die?

379
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,920
Alright, alright, alright

380
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,279
Let me ask you

381
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:15,680
how did you know

382
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,880
we were at Bao Bureau that day?

383
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,000
I just

384
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,400
wanted to follow Second Squad Leader.

385
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,960
Why did you follow him?

386
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,799
I missed you all.

387
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,079
I thought if I followed him,

388
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,359
maybe I could find you.

389
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,319
I didn't expect to see the Platoon Leader.

390
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,079
How could he be gone?

391
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,200
How could he die?

392
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,200
Did I

393
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,240
make you leave Mudanjiang?

394
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,440
Did I tell you to go?

395
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,480
Why didn't you go?

396
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,680
Why didn't you go?

397
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,440
Don't shout.

398
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:20,680
Don't shout, don't shout, don't shout.

399
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,359
Don't cry.

400
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,880
Even if we cry ourselves to death now,

401
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,519
it won't help.

402
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:34,920
The Platoon Leader is gone.

403
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,079
Now it's just you left.

404
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,799
Me,

405
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,319
Yunhu and Old Tang.

406
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,200
We have to stick together.

407
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,920
The Platoon Leader used to say,

408
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,839
We must get Xiaogui back to the unit.

409
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,920
He said we're family.

410
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,160
Brother Fuqing,

411
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,680
Take me away from here.

412
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,960
I don't want to stay here anymore.

413
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,519
Please take me with you.

414
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,079
Xiaogui.

415
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,039
Xiaogui.

416
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,519
Let's go.

417
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,279
Xiaogui.

418
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Brother Yunhu, take me with you.

419
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:13,839
Take me away.

420
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,640
No rush, no rush.

421
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,799
Listen to me, listen to me.

422
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,480
Listen to your brother.

423
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,079
Heal your wounds first.

424
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,359
We'll come get you once everything's set.

425
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,880
Be good.

426
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,480
Be good.

427
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,240
Alright.

428
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,720
Alright now.

429
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,160
Alright, alright.

430
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:02,759
Hey.

431
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:04,839
What's up?

432
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,599
Still mad?

433
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:07,960
How could I not be?

434
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,599
Planning to ditch me, huh?

435
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,720
Spit it out, what's up?

436
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,279
Come by my place tonight.

437
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,200
We need to talk about something important.

438
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,559
I'm here.

439
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,480
Where's your wife? Not back yet?

440
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:44,920
She's at the grave.

441
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,759
What do you need me for?

442
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,720
Chief, how did I get in here?

443
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,720
See, there's even a guard at the door.

444
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,480
Qingtian, wow.

445
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,720
Now you're

446
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,759
a favorite of the Japanese Military Police.

447
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,640
Your future looks bright.

448
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,240
I wouldn't dare.

449
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,880
Don't be so polite.

450
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,720
Many hands make light work.

451
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,359
Good things are coming.

452
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,079
Yes, yes.

453
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,599
Old Tang is here too.

454
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,559
You guys talk.

455
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:25,680
I...

456
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,279
Get outta here.

457
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,319
Deyuan,

458
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:46,759
I called you here

459
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,519
because I wanted to tell you something.

460
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,799
Things have changed.

461
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,039
The money we've made these years

462
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,720
might all go down the drain.

463
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,559
Why?

464
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,720
Times have changed.

465
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,559
The Japanese are about to collapse.

466
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,960
Once they're done for,

467
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,079
we're finished too.

468
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,800
Luckily,

469
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,519
the Japanese came to me.

470
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,440
They said if I donate a plane...

471
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,079
Hold on.

472
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,320
The Japanese came to you?

473
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,880
Which Japanese?

474
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Was it Kawano?

475
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,960
Are you done or not?

476
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,920
In your eyes,

477
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,639
every Japanese is called Kawano.

478
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,400
Right?

479
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,639
What are you doing?

480
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,440
Tang Deyuan, you should learn from me.

481
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:49,519
Only by looking ahead can you go far.

482
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,039
Don't let your parents down.

483
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,480
They gave you such a good name.

484
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
As long as we get a plane,

485
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,079
we can go to Japan.

486
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,320
Big Japan.

487
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,880
As long as we leave Manchukuo,

488
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,280
the two of us can stay alive.

489
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,599
We...

490
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,679
Who do you mean by "we"?

491
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
You and me.

492
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,920
What does you going to Japan have to do with me?

493
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,639
Doesn't it?

494
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,559
Aren't you scared being here?

495
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,679
What would I be scared of?

496
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:45,559
Me?

497
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,119
I never worked for the Japanese.

498
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,199
Why should I be afraid?

499
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,079
You didn't work for the Japanese?

500
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,800
You worked for me, right?

501
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,400
I worked for the Japanese, right?

502
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,400
Isn't this...

503
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,239
working for the Japanese?

504
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,320
That counts?

505
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,239
Doesn't count, doesn't count.

506
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,960
No, it doesn't count.

507
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,760
But as far as I know,

508
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,039
a couple days ago,

509
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,639
a platoon leader from the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army died.

510
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,360
That was you, wasn't it?

511
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,199
Of course.

512
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,880
I don't care why you killed him.

513
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
You did it, right?

514
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,800
From what I know,

515
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,920
your organization

516
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,960
keeps a close account.

517
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,800
There's an old saying,

518
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,039
You can dodge the first, but not the fifteenth.

519
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:37,719
Aren't you afraid?

520
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,360
So...

521
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,239
about that plane,

522
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,639
how much do we have to donate?

523
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:09,880
The Japanese said

524
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:13,880
they want fifteen hundred taels of gold.

525
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,000
That much?

526
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,000
Who do you have to squeeze for that?

527
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,559
No, that's way too much.

528
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,079
That's their price.

529
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,679
The problem is, where do we get it?

530
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,320
Yeah, exactly.

531
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,360
It's really hard to scrape together.

532
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm worried too.

533
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,320
But...

534
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,599
I'm your brother after all.

535
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,039
Let me figure something out.

536
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,440
I'll invite Lao Guo and Lao Shao over.

537
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:44,679
Get them all here.

538
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,119
I'll talk to them.

539
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,199
And you...

540
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,599
just agree.

541
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,599
We brothers have to get through this together.

542
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,440
Deyuan.

543
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,639
Tang Deyuan.

544
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,559
It really is you.

545
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,480
Don't you recognize me?

546
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,440
Xu Laosì.

547
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,400
The one who interrogated you at the station.

548
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,920
What are you doing here?

549
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:36,360
I'm hooked on smoking.

550
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,400
Master Tang.

551
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,239
Give me a couple coins.

552
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,960
Let me have a puff.

553
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,199
I didn't bring any money.

554
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:49,519
And I don't have any of that.

555
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,559
Wait, Master Tang, Master Tang!

556
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:52,800
Master Tang, Master Tang!

557
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,199
I'll trade you a secret.

558
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,639
Xiao Tielin's secret.

559
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,760
Xiao Tielin's secret.

560
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,519
Let's hear it.

561
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,159
Back then,

562
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,199
it was Xiao Tielin

563
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,480
who told me to lock you up for a year.

564
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,840
Had nothing to do with me.

565
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,519
Xiao Tielin ordered me,

566
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,719
doesn't matter if he's a dragon or a tiger,

567
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,400
lock him up for over a year.

568
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,800
When he gets out,

569
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,000
no matter what he was, he'll turn into

570
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,079
an obedient dog.

571
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,639
I've told you everything.

572
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Now give me a couple coins.

573
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:35,800
Quick, let me have a puff.

574
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,159
Xiao Tielin told you that?

575
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,840
I swear to heaven,

576
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,280
it's all true.

577
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,360
What are you laughing at, Old Tang?

578
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,239
I'm not lying to you.

579
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,199
I was wrong back then.

580
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,519
I shouldn't have hit you.

581
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,559
I was wrong, I shouldn't have hit you.

582
00:39:59,079 --> 00:39:59,519
Old Tang.

583
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,199
I trust you.

584
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,400
But the thing is,

585
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,639
I thought it was something serious.

586
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
Is this even a big deal?

587
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,360
Old Tang.

588
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:17,239
Old Tang.

589
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,519
Old Tang.

590
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:19,760
Old Tang.

591
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,119
Old Tang.

592
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,440
How big of a deal is this, Old Tang?

593
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,079
Chief Kawano said

594
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,559
you did well this time.

595
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,119
As a reward,

596
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,400
and to prevent

597
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,760
you from making mistakes when you meet them again,

598
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:52,840
showing any flaws,

599
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,199
here's a bottle of oral stimulant.

600
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,440
Keep it ready.

601
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,480
If anything happens later,

602
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,400
report to me right away.

603
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,079
No matter how long this war lasts,

604
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,320
victory will be ours.

605
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,159
Our passionate blood

606
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,679
will be shed

607
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,079
on these white mountains and black waters.

608
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,400
Xiaogui.

609
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
As long as I'm still breathing,

610
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,760
even if it's just one last breath,

611
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,519
I'll lead everyone back to the unit.

612
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,280
Uncle.

613
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
But you managed to

614
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,039
get up from your warm bed,

615
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:18,920
Good job.

616
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,280
If we're fated in the next life,

617
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,519
you'll be my son.

618
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,519
How about it?

619
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,039
Comrade Tian Xiaogui,

620
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,559
from now on, you'll lead

621
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,719
thousands of troops.
