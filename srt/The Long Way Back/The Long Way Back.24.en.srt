1
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,439
This is a gunshot wound.

2
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,840
What do you actually do?

3
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,959
Let me tell you,

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,519
if you don't tell the truth in times like these,

5
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,640
no one can save you.

6
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm with the Anti-Japanese Alliance.

7
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,480
Second Master.

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,200
I know that before,

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
you were also with the Anti-Japanese Alliance.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,560
Look,

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,959
for the sake of the past,

12
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,280
when we fought the Japanese together,

13
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,800
can you help me out?

14
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,599
You're with the Anti-Japanese Alliance?

15
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,319
Which unit?

16
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,000
Third Army, Third Division, First Regiment.

17
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,759
Have I met you before?

18
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:25,919
Really?

19
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,360
Guaizi River.

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,199
The battle at Guaizi River.

21
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,680
We weren't far from your unit.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,639
Back then, your regiment

23
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,759
your platoon

24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,039
charged the hardest.

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,800
That's right.

26
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,680
Fought the Japanese with bayonets.

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,639
Didn't you?

28
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,360
Yes, yes.

29
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,759
That battle

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
was really brutal.

31
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,919
Yeah.

32
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,639
Which battle wasn't brutal?

33
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,240
Your platoon leader

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,879
was actually from my hometown.

35
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,520
Named

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Wang Dashun.

37
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,039
That's right.

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,080
Wang Dashun.

39
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,520
How is he now?

40
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,680
He was killed in action.

41
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,599
Wait here.

42
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,360
I'll get you some gauze.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Let me treat your wound.

44
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,080
Wait for me.

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,719
Okay.

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,800
Hello?

47
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,240
Connect me to the Mudanjiang Police Station.

48
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,919
Sir, come again!

49
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,319
Take care, sir.

50
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,039
Goodbye, sir.

51
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,000
Step back.

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,800
Step back.

53
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,520
Let go of me!

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,680
Let go of me!

55
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,240
Second Master!

56
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,719
Second Master, help me!

57
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,080
Second Master, save me!

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,080
Second Master!

59
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,360
Second Master!

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Second Master, save me!

61
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,879
Second Master!

62
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,079
Second Master!

63
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,360
Finished watching.

64
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,199
Get back to work.

65
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,639
You need patience for intelligence work.

66
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,519
He refused to take our bait.

67
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,000
Seems like a tough enemy.

68
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,319
Is the restaurant still changing staff?

69
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,600
Yes.

70
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,800
Then,

71
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,279
the ones who haven't been replaced

72
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,560
are even more suspicious.

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,120
Have that student take people to arrest them right away.

74
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,519
No.

75
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,959
It's not the right time yet.

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,079
No rush, Morita.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,480
Tang Deyuan's restaurant is backed by Xiao Tielin.

78
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,680
We may not fear Xiao Tielin,

79
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,639
but we still have to consider those above us.

80
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,160
More importantly,

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,319
if we act rashly without certainty,

82
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,439
and don't hit the target in one strike,

83
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,279
we'll only alert them.

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,560
It seems

85
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,240
we need to upgrade our plan too.

86
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,800
Here, smell this. Does it smell good?

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,560
Smells good, right?

88
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,759
The filling is mixed really well.

89
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,199
The dough still needs to rest a bit.

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,839
Right?

91
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,120
Come here.

92
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,759
Let me take a look.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,560
Smell it.

94
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,160
Seems a bit bland.

95
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,759
Yeah, it's bland.

96
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,519
I'll go get some salt.

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,120
Okay.

98
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,600
It's not even a holiday.

99
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,519
What's all this for?

100
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,079
Your sister-in-law wants to give you a welcome dinner.

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,160
She's making dumplings for you herself.

102
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you, sister-in-law.

103
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,600
No need to be polite.

104
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,360
I'll go get some salt.

105
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,639
Old Tang,

106
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,399
white flour,

107
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,399
that's a controlled supply.

108
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,160
We're making dumplings.

109
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
Doesn't matter if it's white flour, cornmeal, or any flour.

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,399
It's all about having fun together.

111
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,399
Enjoying the lively atmosphere.

112
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,959
Right, kid?

113
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,600
Yeah.

114
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,800
That's right.

115
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,319
Come here.

116
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,279
Uncle wants a hug.

117
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,680
Here's the salt.

118
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,959
Do you want to eat dumplings?

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,560
Kid,

120
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,600
Were you being naughty again?

121
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,800
No.

122
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,360
Come down.

123
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,680
Let's make dumplings.

124
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,160
Go ahead.

125
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
I'll wash my hands and join you.

126
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,519
Kid,

127
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
Don't be naughty.

128
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,360
If you are, no dumplings for you.

129
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,279
Wait, wait, wait.

130
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,399
Right, okay.

131
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,319
I've washed my hands.

132
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,360
Why are you just standing there?

133
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,959
Can you roll out the wrappers?

134
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,959
Yes, I can.

135
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,319
That's good.

136
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,120
No problem, still got the skills.

137
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,360
It's nothing.

138
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,600
Put it down carefully.

139
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,720
Here, let me wrap one.

140
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,319
Looks beautiful.

141
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:53,959
Let Dad wrap one.

142
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,240
Okay.

143
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,680
Morita,

144
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,000
have you ever killed a fish?

145
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,480
No, sir.

146
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,360
With the same fish,

147
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,160
if the method isn't right during slaughter,

148
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,319
the taste will be bad.

149
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,279
In Hokkaido,

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,439
there was a craftsman

151
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,360
who invented the blood extraction method for killing fish.

152
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,480
The key to this method

153
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,799
is to destroy the fish's central nervous system.

154
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,000
No matter how fierce the fish,

155
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,240
it can be killed with one strike.

156
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,320
It also keeps the meat fresh and tasty.

157
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,919
These are interrogation records of Anti-Japanese Alliance prisoners.

158
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,200
Among them,

159
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,919
there's a special group.

160
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,039
They tried to cross the river to the Soviet Union

161
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
but failed and were captured.

162
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,000
They were all once members of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army training brigade,

163
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,200
comrades of the Anti-Japanese Alliance fighters.

164
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,039
To find these migrating fish,

165
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,639
we need their old friends

166
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,480
to identify them personally.

167
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,600
The officer has a perfect plan.

168
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,919
We call it

169
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,919
the Blood Extraction Plan.

170
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,600
The boss

171
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,200
is asleep.

172
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,960
He's asleep.

173
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,039
Take him home first.

174
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,600
Okay.

175
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,480
Sister-in-law

176
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,840
Thank you for your hard work.

177
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,559
Take your time drinking.

178
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,159
I'm heading out.

179
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,120
Kid

180
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,600
Let's go home.

181
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,159
We're leaving.

182
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,840
Come back early.

183
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,320
Alright.

184
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,720
Take it slow.

185
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,360
Okay.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,919
Kid

187
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,279
Your eldest son is really good.

188
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,799
He goes to bed early.

189
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,720
Old Tang

190
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,320
Now, besides

191
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,639
your wife, child, and a warm bed,

192
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,240
you don't want anything else.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,559
That's right.

194
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,039
So what about you?

195
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,879
You want me to go to Onion Mountain with you

196
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,399
and become a bandit?

197
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,159
By the way,

198
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,559
here, take this.

199
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,279
Let me tell you,

200
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,159
you can't get by here without this.

201
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,000
Where did you get this?

202
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,360
At the police station.

203
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,759
You must have good connections at the station.

204
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,039
You just got it so easily.

205
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,080
Alright.

206
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,320
Thanks.

207
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,159
Old Tang

208
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,320
I want to ask you something.

209
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,000
You...

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,799
You want to ask

211
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,679
about the Anti-Japanese Alliance today, right?

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,440
They're our comrades, after all.

213
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,039
How could you

214
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,440
report them just like that?

215
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,799
Yunhu,

216
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,240
let me explain.

217
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,639
Do you know how many eyes

218
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,600
are watching me here,

219
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,639
openly and secretly?

220
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,679
Let me put it this way:

221
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,360
If I don't report him,

222
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,159
my whole family,

223
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,399
including you,

224
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,679
won't be safe.

225
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,720
Do you believe me?

226
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,879
Then let me ask you,

227
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,879
the mark on the Eight Pines back then,

228
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,039
was it you who carved it?

229
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,200
I did.

230
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,159
We agreed

231
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,279
to meet at Songlin Town.

232
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,200
Why didn't you show up?

233
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,039
I changed my mind halfway.

234
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,879
I understand.

235
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:49,919
Old Tang

236
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,120
I get you.

237
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,679
Really.

238
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,039
You're living well now.

239
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm happy for you.

240
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,960
But after all these years,

241
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,600
haven't you ever thought

242
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,720
about looking for the platoon leader and the others?

243
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,519
Did you try?

244
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,399
I wanted to.

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,240
Be honest with me.

246
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,720
Are you still connected

247
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,559
to the Anti-Japanese Alliance?

248
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,519
The Alliance has been gone for years.

249
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,879
There's nothing left.

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
Just say yes or no.

251
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,159
No.

252
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,320
Good.

253
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:54,960
Come on.

254
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,279
Mr. Morita

255
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,720
After Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army fighters are captured,

256
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
they usually endure long

257
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,240
and brutal interrogations.

258
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,120
Some die,

259
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,200
some survive the torture,

260
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,320
but still refuse to confess.

261
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,519
To make the most use of them,

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,879
they are usually sent to Unit 731.

263
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,000
I will personally select

264
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,879
bait from among them

265
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,080
to create the perfect specimen.

266
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,559
On the European battlefield,

267
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,080
it's called Pervitin.

268
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,559
A small dose injection

269
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,120
can heal both body and soul,

270
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
relieving all pain.

271
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,279
It makes you feel like you're in heaven.

272
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,720
It's truly a wonderful treat.

273
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,200
Sir.

274
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,399
If you keep injecting it regularly,

275
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,960
it causes strong dependence.

276
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,879
Once you stop using it,

277
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,639
you'll experience unimaginable withdrawal.

278
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,279
Their bodies and minds

279
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,600
will suffer a hundred times more pain.

280
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,720
Hello.

281
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Number 490.

282
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:40,279
Stop.

283
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:45,120
Come here.

284
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,159
What are you doing?

285
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,200
I'm from Tian Tian Hao Restaurant.

286
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,799
Where are you going so late?

287
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,000
We're out of wine.

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,759
Your papers.

289
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,559
Papers.

290
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,039
Here.

291
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,559
We're out of wine.

292
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:12,759
I'm restocking.

293
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:13,519
That's right.

294
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,279
Search him.

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,759
Nothing.

296
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,480
He's clean.

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,480
What?

298
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,000
You don't bring money to restock?

299
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,279
I don't have any money.

300
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,640
I'm just a messenger.

301
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,200
The boss pays after the goods arrive tomorrow morning.

302
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,160
The boss settles the bill.

303
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:45,640
Get lost.

304
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,720
What's going on?

305
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,960
Say something.

306
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,359
I'm not sure.

307
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,240
What do you mean?

308
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,680
Just tell me.

309
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,759
Old Tang.

310
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,640
Did he work for Xiao Tielin or not?

311
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,200
He probably did.

312
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,960
I've followed him a few times.

313
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,559
He often goes to the police station at night.

314
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,359
Old Tang is now Second Master Tang.

315
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,920
He mingles with

316
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,200
all the important people.

317
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:35,839
He gets along with the police and the puppet army.

318
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,960
They're like brothers.

319
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,160
You could say in Mudanjiang,

320
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
he's quite a figure.

321
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,400
He's doing well.

322
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,799
What's his family like?

323
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,720
His wife is Cai Feng.

324
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,119
She seems honest.

325
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,440
He has a son.

326
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,519
No.

327
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,839
How does he treat you when he sees you?

328
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,759
How does he act towards you?

329
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,480
I can only say the bond is still there.

330
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,880
But I can't say about anything else.

331
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,640
If the bond is there, that's good.

332
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,000
Right, Captain?

333
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,279
But yesterday at his restaurant,

334
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,000
someone came in.

335
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,880
He was from the Anti-Japanese Alliance.

336
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,119
He wanted Old Tang to help him.

337
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,279
But Old Tang reported him.

338
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,359
Old Tang reported someone from the Alliance?

339
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,880
No, no.

340
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,440
The Alliance wanted Old Tang—

341
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,279
Don't rush, don't rush.

342
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,119
I'm not finished.

343
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,200
But that guy was probably fake.

344
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
I noticed something off.

345
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
So what's the real story?

346
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,000
How could he be fake?

347
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,920
Can you just listen to me?

348
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,480
If he was from the Soviet Union,

349
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,759
I'd definitely know him.

350
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,319
If he's from the Northeast,

351
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,200
from around here,

352
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,599
Didn't Uncle Liu say

353
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,640
the Alliance in this area

354
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,960
retreated to the mountains long ago?

355
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,480
It's been four or five years now.

356
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,119
So many died in the western campaign.

357
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,440
Even if someone came down from the mountains

358
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,480
to carry out a mission,

359
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,039
how would he know

360
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,599
Old Tang used to be in the Alliance?

361
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,119
That's way too much of a coincidence.

362
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:43,640
Darn it.

363
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,799
Elder Tang is being watched.

364
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,000
If this person

365
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,279
is a fake Anti-Japanese Alliance member,

366
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,079
then he's here to test

367
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,279
Tang Deyuan.

368
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
Is that possible?

369
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,400
What about Deyuan?

370
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,680
Just like you,

371
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,440
he noticed something was off about this guy.

372
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,960
He reported him on purpose.

373
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,759
That's turning the tables.

374
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,200
First, it ensures

375
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,839
his and his family's safety.

376
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,759
Second,

377
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
it also protects Yun Hu

378
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,839
from being exposed.

379
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,640
That's possible.

380
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:20,599
Right.

381
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,279
I told you so.

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
The fire in Elder Tang's heart

383
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,200
won't go out.

384
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,079
About Elder Tang,

385
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,359
we can't rush things.

386
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,319
He's not alone anymore.

387
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,440
He's living a good life now.

388
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,799
If we just

389
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,400
charge in recklessly,

390
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,240
what if something goes wrong?

391
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,079
It's not just one person involved.

392
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,240
It's his whole family.

393
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,599
Besides,

394
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,200
if Elder Tang doesn't want to get involved anymore,

395
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,079
and just wants a peaceful life,

396
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,440
I can understand that.

397
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,599
You must understand too.

398
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,319
Wait, what do you mean?

399
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,359
We're talking about Elder Tang,

400
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,640
why are you dragging me into this?

401
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,559
Everyone has a family.

402
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,359
Doesn't the platoon leader?

403
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,440
He left his family behind too.

404
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,079
And he's still fighting here.

405
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,119
But people aren't all the same.

406
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:03,680
If everyone was the same,

407
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,640
what would we even talk about?

408
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,680
Elder Tang and I,

409
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,640
we survived the labor camp together.

410
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,240
You want me to believe he's changed?

411
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,200
I can't accept that.

412
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,799
How about this—

413
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,519
I'll go ask him myself.

414
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,440
Where are you going?

415
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,119
Enough, enough.

416
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,759
Why are you getting so worked up?

417
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,680
What Tang Deyuan is thinking now,

418
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,319
we can't figure out.

419
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,119
First, take care of yourself, okay?

420
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:29,920
Just do what you need to do.

421
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,640
Even if the fire in his heart

422
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,480
has gone out,

423
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,400
we should find a way

424
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
to light it again.

425
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,039
Sir.

426
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,480
Number 423 just gave us a new lead.

427
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,279
Please take a look.

428
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,759
I'm begging you.

429
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,319
Please, I'm begging you.

430
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,559
Give me another shot, please.

431
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,640
Number 423.

432
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,039
It seems now

433
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,039
we can be friends.

434
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,519
As soon as Cui Yingying enters the garden,

435
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,599
she looks up

436
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,039
at all the flowers in the garden.

437
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,400
Little Red Date.

438
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:13,720
What are you doing?

439
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,279
You scared me!

440
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:14,680
Keep your voice down.

441
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,000
Why are you performing in Mudanjiang?

442
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,920
Why did you come to Mudanjiang?

443
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,839
Why can you come but I can't?

444
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,799
I don't care who it is,

445
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,839
I sing for whoever pays the most.

446
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,039
How's your sister?

447
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,960
Now you remember my sister?

448
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,000
As long as she's fine.

449
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,160
When did I say she was fine?

450
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,680
Then what's wrong with her?

451
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,480
Your eyes aren't blind, are they?

452
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,240
And your legs aren't broken.

453
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,400
If you really cared,

454
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,599
would you still be asking me here?

455
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,839
What's wrong with you?

456
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,599
A lifelong waiter finally turned into a spirit, huh?

457
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,240
Can't live without serving tea and pouring water.

458
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,799
Can't survive without running dishes in the restaurant.

459
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,920
Little Red Date,

460
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,960
what are you doing?

461
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,400
You're really carefree.

462
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,960
What are you chatting about over there?

463
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,319
You've passed by twice already.

464
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,359
Can you hurry up?

465
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:12,480
I'm coming.

466
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,599
Seriously.

467
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,079
What's wrong with your sister anyway?

468
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:16,960
What's up?

469
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,960
Can't live without you, huh?

470
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:18,759
Let go.

471
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,079
Annoying.

472
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,599
Brother Shunzi,

473
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,279
I think our new skit

474
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,200
turned out pretty well.

475
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,839
Of course it's good.

476
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,559
Look at the others,

477
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,920
what a mess they've made.

478
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,160
Liu, the banhu.

479
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,960
I'm checking if I dropped anything.

480
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,240
I've been scatterbrained all day.

481
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,799
Hurry up.

482
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,559
I'm still looking for my banhu,

483
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,240
but it's on my back.

484
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,799
Isn't this like looking for a donkey while riding one?

485
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,319
So absent-minded all day.

486
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,279
Always doing foolish things.

487
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:14,759
Stop nagging me, hurry up.

488
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,200
Everyone's waiting for you over there.

489
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,480
So slow.

490
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,279
Dragging your feet.

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,480
Boss.

492
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,200
Boss.

493
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,319
Boss.

494
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,759
Finish up and go home to sleep early.

495
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,559
Alright.

496
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,119
Alright.

497
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
The one who just went in

498
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,799
is Boss Shao from the Treasure Bureau.

499
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,440
Rumor has it

500
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,960
Xiao Tielin is a gambler.

501
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,039
That's good.

502
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,759
Guo Jinshan is here too.

503
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,119
Only Elder Tang hasn't arrived yet.

504
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,519
It's said the Japanese

505
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,920
didn't dare touch Xiao Tielin.

506
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,079
First,

507
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,839
they considered his connections with the higher-ups.

508
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:25,920
Second,

509
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,039
he has a few sworn brothers like Guo Jinshan

510
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,839
who hold military power.

511
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,119
These Japanese

512
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,799
would care about a few minor regiment commanders?

513
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,640
They don't care at all.

514
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,440
What they care about is morale.

515
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,039
If the puppet army rebels too,

516
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,359
others will follow their example.

517
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,599
Who would still

518
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,799
risk their lives as cannon fodder for them?

519
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,519
See that?

520
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,279
Old Tang,

521
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,119
you really have sharp eyes.

522
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,480
What's he holding in his hand?

523
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,319
A lunchbox.

524
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,200
Your eyesight is pretty good too.

525
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,799
They don't even let cars into the yard.

526
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,400
Security is tight.

527
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,160
Even Old Tang has trouble getting in and out.

528
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:42,839
Sorry, sorry.

529
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,240
Really sorry.

530
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,480
I'm late, I'm late.

531
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,000
Being late deserves a penalty.

532
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,799
A penalty is needed.

533
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,559
I brought you all some late-night snacks.

534
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,119
Elder Tang's restaurant is always packed.

535
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,799
It's hard for him to get away.

536
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,279
Come on.

537
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,000
It's all about showing respect.

538
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,039
We all get to share in the good fortune.

539
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,240
No, no, Boss Shao.

540
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,000
You can't say that.

541
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,920
What good fortune do I have?

542
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,880
I rely on my brother.

543
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,519
He's my God of Wealth, right?

544
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,559
God of Wealth!

545
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,559
Deyuan, what's the bet?

546
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,039
I'll go with your call.

547
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,079
The usual rules.

548
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,039
The usual rules.

549
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,720
Let's do it.

550
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,359
Let's do it.

551
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:17,920
Come on.

552
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,680
Commander Guo

553
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,319
What's going on in the streets lately?

554
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,880
Why is it so lively?

555
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,559
Don't even mention it.

556
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,039
The Japanese search teams

557
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,240
found something deep in the forest

558
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,640
They discovered three parachutes.

559
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,039
They insist the Anti-Japanese Alliance is back.

560
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,359
What are they called now?

561
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,759
Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Training Brigade

562
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,680
No one knows why they've returned.

563
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,960
You be the dealer.

564
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,319
Me? The dealer?

565
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:51,880
Sure.

566
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,480
I've been exhausted lately.

567
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:56,720
The police station

568
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,200
searched the whole city.

569
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,680
I personally led troops to guard the city gates

570
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,319
and the train station.

571
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,200
Every day, countless travelers and merchants

572
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,759
number in the thousands.

573
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,200
Any unfamiliar face must be checked.

574
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,599
Commander Guo

575
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,839
That's a lot of work for you.

576
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,759
You even have to do it yourself?

577
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,559
They just want to embarrass me.

578
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,920
I'm just a minor commander.

579
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,079
Even a small captain from the military police

580
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,000
I have to act humble before him.

581
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,240
The Anti-Japanese Alliance was wiped out long ago.

582
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,359
They searched every village and household for years.

583
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,039
Even those who once joined the Volunteer Army

584
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,519
were tracked down at home.

585
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,559
They uprooted everyone.

586
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,559
If you ask me,

587
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:38,759
the Japanese in the Northeast

588
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,880
have fully settled in.

589
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,119
The newspapers say every day

590
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,279
the Imperial Army defeated the Americans.

591
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,200
But the broadcasts inside the pass say

592
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,480
the Americans beat the Japanese.

593
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,480
Which one is true?

594
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,759
Who cares if it's true or not?

595
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,240
Cold hard cash is the only thing that's real.

596
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:58,359
That's right.

597
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,000
Whether the Americans won or not,

598
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,640
we don't know.

599
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,960
But the Soviets win all the time.

600
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,960
Life's going to get tougher from now on.

601
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,119
One Bamboo

602
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,119
Winning hand.

603
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,480
Winning hand.

604
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,000
Elder Tang really knows how to play.

605
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,359
I've been waiting for One Bamboo for ages.

606
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,359
He's been holding onto One Bamboo forever.

607
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,519
As soon as Chief Xiao heard

608
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,960
he discarded One Bamboo.

609
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,559
Really?

610
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,799
Take a look.

611
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,039
Wasn't I waiting for One Bamboo?

612
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:40,519
See?

613
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,279
Look at this mess.

614
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,519
Next time, I'll let you win.

615
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,119
Everyone,

616
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,400
Just a reminder,

617
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,839
What we say here stays here.

618
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,039
Chief Xiao

619
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,680
It's been so many years.

620
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,079
You still don't trust us?

621
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,799
I don't trust you.

622
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,640
Could you even get into the police station?

623
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,200
Pay up.

624
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,759
It's for you, out of respect.

625
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,119
The Japanese search teams

626
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,359
found something deep in the forest

627
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,759
They discovered three parachutes.

628
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,000
They insist the Anti-Japanese Alliance is back.

629
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,599
What are they called now?

630
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,400
Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Training Brigade

631
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,480
What's wrong?

632
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,839
Getting ready to sleep?

633
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,240
Let's have a drink.

634
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,160
Alright.

635
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:53,119
Let's drink.

636
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:15,960
Come on.

637
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,119
It's so late.

638
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,000
Aren't you going home to your wife and kids?

639
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,079
You're here with me instead.

640
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,759
I heard something.

641
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,400
They say the Japanese found

642
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,079
some parachutes in the forest.

643
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,960
They say it's the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Training Brigade.

644
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,039
What brigade?

645
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,440
The ones who returned from the Soviet Union.

646
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,759
Why are you telling me this?

647
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,119
I just want to say,

648
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,400
things are too chaotic these days.

649
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,960
These Japanese,

650
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,599
they're like mad dogs.

651
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,119
I heard recently,

652
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,280
they caught a member of the Anti-Japanese Alliance,

653
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,320
and released several wolfhounds.

654
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,119
He was bitten to death.

655
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,039
So what are you saying?

656
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:49,559
Come on.

657
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,880
Maybe you should leave.

658
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:05,800
What do you think?

659
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,639
You still don't trust me.

660
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,159
But it's fine.

661
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,239
If you want me to go,

662
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,639
I won't stay here.

663
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,360
Don't worry.

664
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,280
I understand.

665
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,320
I'm not trying to drive you away.

666
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,320
I know.

667
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,199
Look, I have a family to care for.

668
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:34,679
Really.

669
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,480
I can't take these risks.

670
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,800
Look at you.

671
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,760
Always calling me brother,

672
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,559
but it's just words.

673
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,239
You should mean it.

674
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,280
Newspapers for sale!

675
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,880
Newspapers for sale!

676
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,800
Newspapers!

677
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,559
How much to fix the shoes?

678
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,480
Twenty-five cents.

679
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:42,679
What's wrong?

680
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,079
The Japanese in the mountains

681
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,400
found a Soviet-style parachute.

682
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,679
They think it's ours.

683
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,960
Someone from the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Training Brigade.

684
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,920
They've returned to Mudanjiang.

685
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,599
Elder Tang is worried I'm trouble.

686
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:53,840
He wants me to leave.

687
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,079
Did Deyuan see through you?

688
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,480
Did he send you to deliver a message?

689
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,119
I'm not sure about that.

690
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,480
But he does want me gone.

691
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,239
I definitely can't stay at the restaurant.

692
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,119
I can't stay any longer.

693
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,280
We don't have time

694
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,519
to keep playing guessing games with him.

695
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,320
Since he knows

696
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,400
our people are back,

697
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,400
let's just be direct with him.

698
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,679
If he wants to talk, we'll talk.

699
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,239
If he's really unwilling,

700
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,119
we won't force him.

701
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,119
We'll find another way.

702
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,360
What if he betrays us?

703
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,000
He wouldn't.

704
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,239
If he wanted to betray you,

705
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,840
whether you're real or not,

706
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,360
he would've told the Japanese already.

707
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,480
Since he told you

708
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,760
about the parachute,

709
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,480
and asked you to leave right away,

710
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,519
it means he still values your past friendship.

711
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:48,840
He hasn't forgotten.

712
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:58,880
Have a drink, come on.

713
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,079
Mr. Gao.

714
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,639
Elder Tang isn't here yet.

715
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,320
He's not going to skip, is he?

716
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,000
Isn't this nerve-wracking?

717
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,719
Don't worry.

718
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,079
He'll come when it's time.

719
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,320
This monk

720
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,360
no matter how far he runs,

721
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,639
he'll return to this temple.

722
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,320
Just hope the temple isn't too small

723
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:47,679
to support him.

724
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,480
You clay idols.

725
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,400
Platoon Leader.

726
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,440
Hope you've been well.

727
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,039
Second Squad Leader.

728
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,360
Have a seat.

729
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,639
Business is booming.

730
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:36,880
Quite a setup.

731
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,119
No matter how grand,

732
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,880
it's not as bold as you guys.

733
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,760
The whole city is hunting people now.

734
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,039
Yet you dare come here.

735
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,639
Do you know where this is?

736
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,079
This place is

737
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,599
right under the tiger's nose.

738
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,639
You can't touch the tiger's tail.

739
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,159
Even scratching its chin is risky.

740
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,239
Come on.

741
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,400
Is this fun to you?

742
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,679
Why beat around the bush like this?

743
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,719
Just say what you want.

744
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,199
I swore an oath.

745
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,320
As long as I'm alive,

746
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,360
all of you

747
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,880
must be found.

748
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,599
Feels like it was all in another life.

749
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,280
Looks like you’re doing well now.

750
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,519
Little carts, big mules,

751
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,559
big pipes, gold bracelets.

752
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,800
No matter how things turned out,

753
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,440
the past

754
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,800
shouldn’t be forgotten.

755
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,920
It’s only in the last two years

756
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,519
that I’ve slept peacefully.

757
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,039
If it were two years ago,

758
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,440
lying in bed,

759
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,480
I’d suddenly jolt awake.

760
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,079
In that blanket,

761
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,239
the north wind would whistle through,

762
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,559
chilling my neck.

763
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,480
I’d reach out and touch

764
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,559
to make sure my head was still there.

765
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,760
Back then, I just overthought everything.

766
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,360
What do people really live for?

767
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:50,760
Just to have a full meal,

768
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,320
and a warm bed.

769
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,840
Think about the past—

770
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,599
hiding in cellars, crawling into doghouses,

771
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,760
eating roots with ice shards,

772
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,360
risking our lives in the ravines.

773
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,360
Any moment,

774
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,840
someone could stab you in the back.

775
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:10,440
Out in the wild, eaten by wolves or carried off by eagles.

776
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:11,840
And when it happens,

777
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:12,960
all that’s left

778
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,119
is just a pile of bones.

779
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,239
Who would even remember you?

780
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,159
Is that any way to live?

781
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,320
Look at you all now.

782
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,079
Hiding here and there,

783
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,599
is this even a life?

784
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:25,960
In the forest,

785
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,559
wolves starve standing up.

786
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,639
In the city,

787
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,599
dogs eat meat lying down.

788
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:33,639
But people—

789
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,840
should stand tall.

790
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:39,280
Whether it’s the sun

791
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,000
or the moon above,

792
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,760
shining on you, on the ground,

793
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,159
you should cast a shadow.

794
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:45,119
That’s what it means to be human.

795
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,039
What do you mean by all this?

796
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,320
Why are you telling me this?

797
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,679
What’s the point?

798
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:55,000
Because we all swore an oath.

799
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,960
This blood in our veins

800
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,639
is meant to be shed on the white mountains and black rivers.

801
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,440
What blood?

802
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,239
My blood’s long since run dry.
