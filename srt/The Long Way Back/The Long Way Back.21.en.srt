00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,040
Instructor Wang

2
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Attention, everyone.

3
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,319
Stand at attention.

4
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:00,920
Salute.

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,079
Thank you, Instructor Wang.

6
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,920
Thank you, Instructor Wang.

7
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:08,919
Dismiss salute.

8
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,840
After discussions with the camp commander

9
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,159
and negotiations with the Soviet side,

10
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,599
your brother's situation

11
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,319
has been resolved.

12
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,879
Xiao Lüzi

13
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:49,800
In spring,

14
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,680
we went to patrol Datuziling.

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,680
to verify intelligence.

16
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,199
We had two squads in total,

17
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,719
twelve people.

18
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,280
Er Lüzi

19
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,879
was the leader of the first squad.

20
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,400
I was the leader of the other squad.

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Both squads

22
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,360
agreed to meet at the rendezvous point.

23
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,360
They arrived first.

24
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,919
Unexpectedly,

25
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,800
they ran into a Japanese ambush.

26
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,319
The Japanese

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,719
took them all to the town.

28
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,680
According to the townspeople,

29
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,319
the Japanese, right in front of them,

30
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,479
sawed off a soldier's legs.

31
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,199
Who are you?

32
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,919
What are you here for?

33
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,680
Speak up!

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
Do you see clearly?

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
This is what happens to those

36
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,560
who sabotage "Japan-Manchukuo Friendship."

37
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
This is their fate.

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,360
I surrender.

39
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,159
I'll talk, I'll talk.

40
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,759
Speak.

41
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,759
Who are you?

42
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,520
The Imperial Japanese Officer asks who you are.

43
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,920
We are from the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

44
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,120
We are here on a mission.

45
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,439
I am the leader of this operation.

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
He is the squad leader.

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,319
Why are you here?

48
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,399
The Imperial Japanese Officer asks,

49
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,399
what are you here for?

50
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,040
If I tell you,

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,319
will they survive?

52
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,199
Sir, he says he'll talk.

53
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,000
Will his men survive?

54
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
Only you will live.

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,519
The Imperial Japanese Officer means only you will live.

56
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,920
Then I have a condition.

57
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,560
Give me a gun.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,360
Why do you want a gun?

59
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,199
What I have to say,

60
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,319
they can't hear it.

61
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,240
Sir,

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,279
we are brothers.

63
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,839
I'll personally send them on their way.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,439
He wants to kill them himself.

65
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,199
At that time,

66
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,040
I was leading my squad

67
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,759
heading to the rendezvous point.

68
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,439
I happened to hear gunshots.

69
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,839
First, two shots in quick succession,

70
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,480
then one shot,

71
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,759
then another two shots,

72
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,040
and then one more shot.

73
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,560
This was our prearranged signal.

74
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,759
Retreat.

75
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,600
The last shot

76
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,879
was probably for himself.

77
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,319
Don't worry.

78
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,720
I promise you.

79
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,480
I'll live for you.

80
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,240
To see the day of victory.

81
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,399
Do you know what river that is over there?

82
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,079
In China,

83
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,879
we call it the Heilongjiang.

84
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,639
On this side,

85
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
it's called the Amur River.

86
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,399
Our father is over there.

87
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,759
Our elders and villagers are there too.

88
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,840
And our ancestors' graves at Wild Horse Beach.

89
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,120
When can you come back?

90
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,840
The Japanese took our horses.

91
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,240
Burned our houses.

92
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,120
Seized our land.

93
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,720
We must go back and take revenge.

94
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,159
If we die,

95
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,279
let it be in China.

96
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,960
Don't talk about dying.

97
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,279
If anyone dies, it should be the Japanese.

98
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,679
It must be the Japanese who die.

99
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,000
Lao San,

100
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
if I go on a mission

101
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,600
and don't make it back,

102
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,360
tell our father

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,840
that in our Lüzi family,

104
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,720
there are no cowards.

105
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,000
You have to come back.

106
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,840
We must return to Wild Horse Beach together.

107
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,080
Big Brother,

108
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,039
show Second Brother the way.

109
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,159
He can't find his way home.

110
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,679
Big Brother

111
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,600
Show Second Brother the way

112
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,360
He can't find his way home

113
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,799
1941

114
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,799
The Kwantung Army was conducting a campaign

115
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,919
against the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

116
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,799
To prevent trees from catching fire,

117
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,960
and smoke rising

118
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,360
which could reveal troop numbers and positions,

119
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,480
they demanded the puppet government supply

120
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,799
500,000 tons of charcoal.

121
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,679
The puppet government then passed

122
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,919
this heavy burden

123
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,519
onto the common people.

124
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,159
Already overwhelmed,

125
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,200
the people of Northeast China

126
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,879
suffered even more.

127
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,159
Hurry up!

128
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,320
Move faster!

129
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,360
What's going on? Hurry!

130
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:02,679
Mom

131
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,080
Dad

132
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,919
Deyuan

133
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,200
Why are you out here?

134
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,679
Second Aunt

135
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,960
Didn't your mother say

136
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,759
you're afraid of the wind?

137
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,360
It's fine.

138
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,519
I'm almost recovered.

139
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,080
I've been cooped up for over half a year.

140
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,320
I need to get some fresh air.

141
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,559
Child,

142
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,120
it's not easy to survive.

143
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,200
Look at all this smoke outside.

144
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,080
Go back quickly.

145
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,320
Second Aunt, what are you doing?

146
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,919
It's nothing.

147
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,440
Now broadcasting the latest

148
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,679
news of victory.

149
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,200
Under the great Emperor's

150
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,840
wise leadership,

151
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,039
the Imperial Japanese Army has

152
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,519
completely eliminated those stubborn rebels.

153
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,320
They've been wiped out.

154
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,559
The remaining Communist elements in Sanjiang Province

155
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,240
have now been eradicated.

156
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,039
Where's the charcoal you handed in?

157
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,399
Take it away.

158
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,240
Sir

159
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,039
Sir

160
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,080
This person is sick.

161
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,080
What?

162
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,080
Lying.

163
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,759
He's faking it.

164
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,000
Take him away.

165
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,559
Yes.

166
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,039
It's true.

167
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,879
It really is.

168
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,360
Director Xiao issued a certificate.

169
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,039
He's a law-abiding citizen.

170
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,759
He's been wronged.

171
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,840
Xin'an prison

172
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,799
He was held there for over a year.

173
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,919
He suffered a lot.

174
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,039
He's only been out for less than a year.

175
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,440
He hasn't recovered yet.

176
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,360
Thank you, Sir.

177
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,799
Tielin has told you many times

178
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,000
to take care of yourself.

179
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,039
You've been to the brink of death

180
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,440
and made it back.

181
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,039
What's going on?

182
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,799
Just watching.

183
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,679
They caught a Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army member.

184
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,759
Parading him through the streets.

185
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,759
Tielin cares about you so much.

186
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,240
You need to value your life.

187
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,600
You've been at home for half a year,

188
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,679
so you don't know

189
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,039
things aren't like before.

190
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,559
Imperial Japanese Army drills, forced quotas.

191
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,600
Those villages and hamlets,

192
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,519
some handed in flour,

193
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
some handed in rice.

194
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,720
Luckily, Tielin has connections.

195
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
We only had to hand in charcoal.

196
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,360
At least we still have food to eat.

197
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,159
Bodhisattva bless us.

198
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,600
Alright.

199
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,559
Go home and rest.

200
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,720
I have things to do.

201
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,240
Let me tell you,

202
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,799
you've been inside too long.

203
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,799
You don't know what it's like outside.

204
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,720
Now out here,

205
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,759
it's the Imperial Japanese Army's world.

206
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,799
The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army?

207
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,200
They've been crushed long ago.

208
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,039
Swearing to heaven and earth,

209
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,160
beating their chest and saying

210
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
they'd drive out the Japanese.

211
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,400
Did they succeed?

212
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,880
If he really could

213
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,519
survive the brink of death

214
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,680
and come back alive,

215
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,720
he'd be a changed man.

216
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,160
At this stage,

217
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,079
the Soviet side

218
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,480
is also facing difficulties.

219
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,759
We must do a good job with the soldiers' morale.

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,079
After this incident,

221
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,319
it was a lesson for me too.

222
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,440
Old Lu,

223
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,559
there's more bad news.

224
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,359
Platoon Leader Zhao has been killed.

225
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,640
When did this happen?

226
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Two months ago.

227
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,559
How did he die?

228
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,519
A comrade from the Southern Camp

229
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,279
told me.

230
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,480
Platoon Leader Zhao

231
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,799
was covering several wounded soldiers

232
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,960
on the way to the Southern Camp

233
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,240
when he was ambushed and killed.

234
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,480
In the battle at Guaizi River,

235
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,640
we were scattered.

236
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,599
It was still Platoon Leader Zhao

237
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,720
who found us.

238
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,359
Before he died,

239
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,079
he asked a comrade from the Southern Camp

240
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,160
to pass a message to you.

241
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,599
You were imprisoned at that time.

242
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,440
You were looking for Tian Xiaogui and Tang Deyuan,

243
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,079
but couldn't find them.

244
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,279
The ones you wanted to find, Xiaobaima and Hua'er,

245
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:03,720
were killed.

246
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,319
So,

247
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,440
what about their children?

248
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
Yang Mingzhi

249
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,240
Ten cents

250
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,079
He Xiaojun

251
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,000
Twenty cents

252
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,960
Cai Xiaocui

253
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,319
Twenty cents

254
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,920
Zhang Degui

255
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,039
Sixty cents

256
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,839
Wait a moment

257
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,680
Zhang Laosan

258
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,240
Heart

259
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,319
Not sincere

260
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,640
Sincere

261
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,680
Sincere

262
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,279
Otherwise

263
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,000
Should I offer this to the Imperial Japanese Army too?

264
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,839
Go away

265
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,799
The Imperial Japanese Army doesn't care about your junk

266
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,400
Everyone, listen up

267
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,680
This offering

268
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,720
is not for the Imperial Japanese Army

269
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,400
Amaterasu is watching from above

270
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,599
There's an old saying

271
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,720
If you keep saving, you'll end up with a hole to fill

272
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,400
This is money for safety

273
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,480
Anyway, I, Ma, have donated two hundred

274
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,359
As for you all

275
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,319
Decide for yourselves

276
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:44,880
Continue

277
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,480
Wang Jiashun

278
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,400
Ma, look

279
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:50,799
Thirty

280
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,119
Alright

281
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,119
Wang Jiashun

282
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
Thirty

283
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,480
Please don't hold a grudge against me.

284
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,480
This offering money,

285
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,640
I'll split half with you.

286
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,799
An outsider monk

287
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,119
isn't as close as a local.

288
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,960
Before Buddha,

289
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,400
please save me a seat.

290
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,000
Boss,

291
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,279
There was gunfire outside just now.

292
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,960
It was nothing, just for good luck.

293
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,039
Come on.

294
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,519
Lately, my health

295
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,119
has been really weak.

296
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,400
Gui'er,

297
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,759
come with me into the mountains.

298
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,440
Let's hunt two flying dragons for soup.

299
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,359
To nourish ourselves.

300
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,160
Let's go.

301
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,160
Alright.

302
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:14,920
Your hat, Boss.

303
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,759
Xiao Gui,

304
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,599
You said you came from the bandits.

305
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,000
That's why you don't have a permit.

306
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,400
If you can hunt a few more flying dragons today,

307
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,799
I'll help you get your permit.

308
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,720
How about it?

309
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,000
Boss, you have to keep your word.

310
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,960
Would I ever lie to you?

311
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,039
Thank you, Boss.

312
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,359
I'll do my best.

313
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,200
Let's go check over there.

314
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,839
Gui'er,

315
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:46,640
Hurry up!

316
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:14,839
Boss,

317
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:15,759
Xiao Gui,

318
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,519
Nice shooting.

319
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,960
Just lucky, Boss.

320
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,960
Pure luck.

321
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,440
Good luck, then.

322
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,440
We've got soup for tonight.

323
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:23,839
Let's go.

324
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,039
Let's head back and make soup.

325
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:30,720
Hello, Ma Ye.

326
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,200
Gui'er,

327
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,640
Walk around it.

328
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,720
What do you mean?

329
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,240
Nothing, Boss.

330
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,880
An outsider monk

331
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,000
isn't as close as a local.

332
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,799
I'm just afraid of worshipping the wrong spirits.

333
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,599
Buddha might not save me a seat tomorrow.

334
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,920
You don't look like

335
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,200
someone who worships spirits.

336
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,960
Me?

337
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,839
I think your shooting is pretty good.

338
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,480
How about

339
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,640
you shoot two more times?

340
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,839
Boss, what should I shoot?

341
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,200
Shoot that.

342
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,039
Come on.

343
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:16,920
Shoot.

344
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,599
Missed.

345
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:38,880
Come on.

346
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,839
Let's head back then.

347
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:52,799
Everyone,

348
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
I've got something new here.

349
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,039
What's new?

350
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,880
A secret game.

351
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,559
Dare to join?

352
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,559
A secret game, a secret game.

353
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,279
We don't even know what we're betting on.

354
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,400
How do we join?

355
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,160
Thirty-seven bets on a single hand.

356
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,559
Winner takes all.

357
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,759
If you bet with the dealer,

358
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,880
your stake doubles twice.

359
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,599
So, what do you say?

360
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,799
Bet or not?

361
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,440
We're not going up the mountain to catch wolves again, are we?

362
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,880
What exactly are we betting on?

363
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,200
No mountain.

364
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,160
Crossing water.

365
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,359
Not crossing water either.

366
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,319
Alright then.

367
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,200
As long as it's not catching a fox spirit,

368
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,160
I'm in.

369
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:30,960
Wang Jiashun,

370
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,799
Ten.

371
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
I bet five.

372
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,079
Ten.

373
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:34,960
Five.

374
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,680
Let me tell you all,

375
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,839
this time we're catching a Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army member.

376
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,279
Anti-Japanese Army, catching one, Anti-Japanese Army.

377
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,880
The Imperial Japanese Army already caught them all.

378
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,960
Where can we find one?

379
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,000
What year is it now?

380
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,200
Catching an Anti-Japanese Army member

381
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,319
is harder than catching a mythical fox spirit.

382
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,119
Yeah.

383
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,359
He ran away.

384
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,400
Go after him!

385
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,359

Set it down.

442
00:31:59,079 --> 00:31:59,759

You must first undergo

448
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,680
crucial training.

449
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,599
This is high-altitude parachuting.

450
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,519
Comrades,

451
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,839
Train hard.

Stand still

469
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,680

471
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,119

chance to prove yourselves

478
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,920
You must beat them

479
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,519
Are you confident?

480
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,599
Yes!

481
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,880

It's you?

487
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,039
I thought you were dead

488
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,400
I thought you were dead too

489
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,039
That's great

490
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,800
You're in the Third Company?

491
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,320
You're jumping today too?

492
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,599
I won't go easy on you

493
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,679
I won't go easy on you either

494
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,480
Hurry up and get on

498
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,119
What's wrong, Squad Leader?

499
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,880
I don't know

500
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,599
In my head

501
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,920
I keep thinking about someone

502
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,400
Who?

503
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,320
My child's mother

504
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,400
Attention

505
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,079

It's fine

507
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,320
Don't be nervous

508
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,639
What, you're not nervous?

509
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,320
I'm fine, I've got experience

510
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,119
What experience?

511
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,960
I've jumped off cliffs before

512
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,360
You're something else

513
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,480
Attention, we're about to arrive

514
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:13,559
Here you go

515
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,679
Everyone, pay attention

516
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,960
We're at one thousand meters

517
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,679
Remember the key points

518
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,320
Form up

00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,920
Quit dawdling, hurry up

521
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,320
Let me check

522
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,800
What are you thinking? Let's go

523
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,960
Stop.

524
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,559
Who are you delivering to?

00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,119
Which Er Ye?

528
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,920
Sir.

529
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,519
Official business account.

530
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,199
Where's the permit?

531
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,280
I have it.

532
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,440
What's inside?

533
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,920
Corn kernels.

534
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:04,920
Corn kernels.

535
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,880
Sir.

536
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,119
Do you know

537
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,000
this is all restricted goods?

538
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,599
You dare smuggle it?

539
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,119
But I have a permit.

540
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,079
Rules have changed.

541
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,280
Last month, permits.

542
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,320
This month, we check stamps.

543
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,079
Your sack is missing an official stamp.

544
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,840
Confiscate it.

545
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,400
Wait—

546
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:23,760
Sir.

547
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,280
Move.

548
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:25,719

552
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,079
Why are you here?

00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,079
Sir.

554
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:56,400
The policies change every day.

555
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,719
Please be understanding.

556
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,079
Is it okay now?

557
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,920
I'll open the door for you.

558
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,480
Er Ye, please.

559
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:08,679

560
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,719
Your goods are over there.

561
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,119
I have official business.

562
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,199
Please go ahead.

563
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,360
Thank you for your effort.

564
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,400
Er Ye, this way.

565
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:21,679
Let's go.

566
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,320
Wait, wait, wait.

567
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:28,639
Er Ye.

568
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:29,639
What's wrong?

569
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,800
What do you mean? Tie it tight.

570
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,079
Er Ye, Er Ye.

571
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,119
Let me, let me, let me.

00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:34,920
Let me.

Let me, let me.

575
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,000
Let me, let me, let me.

576
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:43,800
Let's go, Er Ye.

577
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:44,599
Wait.

578
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,199
What's wrong now, Er Ye?

579
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,920
Open it.

580
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,079

It's here.

582
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:55,239
Isn't this inappropriate?

583
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,760
Er Ye.

584
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,119
Er Ye.

585
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,239
It's not my fault.

586
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,079
Director Xiao's orders—

587
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,280
How could I dare not obey?

588
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,280
You're here.

589
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,760
Is something wrong?

590
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,760
I found this in the rice.

591
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,599
I can't do this business.

592
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,400
Why not?

593
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,159
Why? This is opium.

594
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,519
Smuggling opium is illegal.

595
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,639
Tell me first,

596
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,239
what is law?

597
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,639
Here in Mudanjiang,

598
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,119
I am the law.

599
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,239
If I say it's fair, it's fair.

600
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,719
If I say it's right, it's right.

601
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,159
Besides,

602
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,880
this rice and flour

603
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,400
are also controlled goods.

604
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Aren't you trading them every day?

605
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:05,639
That's not the same.

606
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,599
How is it different?

607
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,000
Does rice harm people?

608
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,800
This stuff does.

609
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,119
I'm saying,

610
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
hearing that from you

611
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,079
is really something.

612
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,840
Are you mocking me?

613
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,000
Why did I become the director?

614
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,159
I just wanted

615
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,679
to make some money

616
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,000
and bring some fortune to my brothers.

617
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,159
Well, well.

618
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,519
No, saving money like this

619
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,400
will bring retribution.

620
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:35,840
Retribution?

621
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,559
Tang Deyuan,

622
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,239
if you talk about retribution,

623
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,320
let me tell you,

624
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,159
the blood on my hands

625
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,760
could drown me.

626
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,000
Enough.

627
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:53,000
Don't get carried away.

628
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,880
You think this business

629
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,719
is something anyone can do?

630
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:00,280
Just watching

631
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,639
all that money slip by and not earning it?
