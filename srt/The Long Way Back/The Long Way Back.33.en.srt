1
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,799
Xiao Gui

2
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,239
Xiao Gui

3
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,159
Xiao Gui

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
Did you fall into the outhouse?

5
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,960
Xiao Gui

6
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,560
Xiao Gui

7
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,719
Are you okay?

8
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,800
If you don't answer, I'm coming in.

9
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,919
I'm fine, Brother.

10
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,800
My legs went numb from squatting.

11
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,680
Why do you look so pale?

12
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,080
Are you alright?

13
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,199
Maybe I caught a chill.

14
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,879
Hurry back inside.

15
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,080
Brother

16
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,080
Do we have a mission tonight?

17
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,719
No.

18
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,439
We're on standby.

19
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,759
Are you hungry?

20
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,159
Should I go outside

21
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,120
and find something to eat?

22
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,240
I can handle being hungry.

23
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,199
It's just my foot.

24
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,079
I twisted it last night.

25
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
It hurt at first.

26
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,199
I didn't think much of it.

27
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,360
But when I woke up this morning,

28
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,240
it started to feel numb.

29
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,920
You know the saying,

30
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,360
pain isn't scary, numbness is.

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,000
Since this morning

32
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,959
it's been the whole day.

33
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Now my ankle

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
isn't working right.

35
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,079
I'm worried if we get a mission now,

36
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,759
I'll mess things up.

37
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,439
Xiao Gui

38
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,240
I heard from Second Squad Leader

39
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,199
the one who treated your leg is a miracle doctor.

40
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
Can you take me to see him?

41
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,040
Sure.

42
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,959
Or I can bring him here.

43
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,199
Let him check your foot.

44
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,759
Xiao Gui

45
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,279
Only our own people

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,560
can come to this base.

47
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,600
We can't bring outsiders.

48
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,639
How about

49
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,639
you take me there

50
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,639
so he can see me in person?

51
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
Maybe give me a couple of acupuncture needles.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,920
I think it might help.

53
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,000
But he

54
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,920
travels around treating people.

55
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm not sure

56
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,120
if he's at the clinic now.

57
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,639
Let's go check anyway.

58
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,480
With my foot like this,

59
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,879
if we get a mission,

60
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,759
I'll slow us down.

61
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,360
We can't risk

62
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,279
going to another clinic.

63
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Just take me to see him.

64
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,439
Alright.

65
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,120
Slow down.

66
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,800
Take it easy, slow down.

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,079
Okay, let's go.

68
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,360
How is it?

69
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,160
Aside from numbness,

70
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,560
there's no other feeling.

71
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,600
It's fine.

72
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,240
No damage to the tendons or bones.

73
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,439
Apply medicine a few times and you'll be fine.

74
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,759
Rest here for now.

75
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,079
Let Xiao Gui

76
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,759
come with me to get the medicine.

77
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,360
Okay.

78
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,319
Let's go.

79
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,560
You haven't come to see me these past days.

80
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,480
Now you bring him here today.

81
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,560
What are you up to?

82
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,319
I have to

83
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,040
wait for them to tell me everything, right?

84
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,759
If I

85
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,560
contact you and they get suspicious,

86
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,560
it'll ruin

87
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,480
Mr. Kawano's plan.

88
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,399
Uncle Liu

89
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,000
I have important information.

90
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
Their plan is

91
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,759
to capture someone named Xiao Tielin alive.

92
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,600
He's a police chief.

93
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,360
They say

94
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,600
he was at the labor camp

95
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,879
transporting supplies

96
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,360
and saved Tang Deyuan.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,639
They're sworn brothers.

98
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,160
They grew up together.

99
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,879
That's all you know?

100
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,680
That's everything, that's everything.

101
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,680
I just found out too.

102
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,560
Uncle Liu, hurry and give me the medicine.

103
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,120
If I'm exposed,

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,319
and can't finish the mission,

105
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,160
it'll be a big problem.

106
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,759
Uncle Liu

107
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,320
Hurry!

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,039
Jade must be carved to become a gem.

109
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,519
A man must be pushed to become talented.

110
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,480
No one

111
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
can escape the control of Pafedin.

112
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,600
Is your foot okay, Brother Fu Qing?

113
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,159
It's fine.

114
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,039
Find me that miracle doctor.

115
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,960
Didn't I already say?

116
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,360
My injury didn't hurt the bones or tendons.

117
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,399
If back then

118
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
I had crossed the river with you all,

119
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,600
how great that would have been.

120
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,519
Now that you're back,

121
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,679
isn't this good too?

122
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,639
Now,

123
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,039
things are completely different.

124
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,960
You all are more capable than me.

125
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,200
You know more than I do.

126
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,480
You are the brains.

127
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,639
I'm just a helper.

128
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,200
A disabled one at that.

129
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
A useless helper.

130
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,679
Xiao Gui,

131
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,000
don't think like that.

132
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,639
You're still so young.

133
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,320
You're younger than all of us.

134
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,320
You have plenty of time ahead.

135
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,080
Once your hand heals,

136
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,799
I'll teach you to drive first.

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,919
Then I'll teach you to send telegrams.

138
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,080
With me here, you won't have trouble learning.

139
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,399
Alright.

140
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,320
As long as I don't hold you back,

141
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,559
being with you all

142
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,960
is enough for me.

143
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,559
See?

144
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,639
You're being negative again.

145
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,440
What do you mean by holding us back?

146
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,320
Let me tell you,

147
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,480
we all have to survive till the end.

148
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,200
What do you mean by "the end"?

149
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,559
Victory in the war.

150
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,480
When will that be?

151
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,759
Once this mission is done, it's soon.

152
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,000
Will that day really come?

153
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,600
Of course.

154
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,240
Otherwise, why are we here?

155
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,720
Here,

156
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,080
will I live to see that day?

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,320
The float has moved.

158
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,080
It's time to lift the fishing rod.

159
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,759
They want to capture Xiao Tielin.

160
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,879
Let's make it easier for them.

161
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,480
Let that foolish Zhao Qingtian

162
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,480
be temporarily suspended.

163
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,720
Ease the security.

164
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,240
Your mission

165
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,799
was completed very well.

166
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,720
It far exceeded my expectations.

167
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,559
Serving the Empire,

168
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,559
I dare not slack off.

169
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,360
The next mission is crucial.

170
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,159
Go inform Agent 490.

171
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,759
Make sure to learn Tang Deyuan and their

172
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,519
exact plan to kidnap Xiao Tielin

173
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,320
and what information

174
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
they want to extract from him.

175
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,480
Specifically what it is.

176
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,960
Also, as I mentioned,

177
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,600
their base in the city—

178
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,720
I suspect the Soviets are behind it,

179
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,720
maybe even the Communists.

180
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,759
Yes.

181
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,120
Tell Agent 490

182
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,799
if

183
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
any uncontrollable incident occurs,

184
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,840
shoot Xiao Tielin first.

185
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,919
He must not be allowed to live

186
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,840
and fall into enemy hands.

187
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,279
Understood.

188
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,399
I'll monitor Agent 490 at all times.

189
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
From now on,

190
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,000
Operation Blood Extraction's

191
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,440
Operation Yellow Sparrow

192
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,759
is officially launched.

193
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,519
Should we send someone

194
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,000
to follow this cicada?

195
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,600
Follow.

196
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,759
From a distance.

197
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,039
I'm not afraid of alerting the cicada.

198
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,799
I'm afraid of alerting the mantis behind.

199
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:48,799
Brother,

200
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,039
it's almost done.

201
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,960
The gold bars will be ready the day after tomorrow.

202
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,480
Sounds reliable.

203
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,480
Bring the gold here.

204
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
We'll leave tomorrow night.

205
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:07,759
I'm talking about

206
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,519
We can only gather everything the day after tomorrow.

207
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,080
Also,

208
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,639
I always feel

209
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,720
carrying these gold bars in the police station

210
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,679
in and out

211
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,639
isn't very convenient.

212
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,600
How about we change the location?

213
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:23,960
Change the location?

214
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,480
Why?

215
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,039
Didn't I just say

216
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,639
I think it's not convenient here.

217
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,840
Plus,

218
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,240
Zhao Qingtian is always watching us closely.

219
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,320
We have to be careful.

220
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,480
Deyuan,

221
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,519
You don't have any other intentions, do you?

222
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,320
What intentions could I have?

223
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:48,799
Alright then.

224
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,080
I'll bring it to you the day after tomorrow.

225
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,879
Deyuan,

226
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,279
Let's go with your idea.

227
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,399
You pick a place.

228
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,759
Alright.

229
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,759
I'll think of a place.

230
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,360
I'll let you know later.

231
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,559
Deyuan,

232
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,559
Or maybe let's forget it.

233
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,399
Let's just bring the stuff

234
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,240
here instead.

235
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:18,919
Okay.

236
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,720
Uncle Liu,

237
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,600
490,

238
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,200
You did well last time.

239
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,039
Section Chief Kawano

240
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,799
is very satisfied.

241
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Please, have a seat.

242
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,240
Come.

243
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,600
This time,

244
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,320
there's a more important mission

245
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,279
for you.

246
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,240
Your comrades,

247
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,240
after capturing Xiao Tielin,

248
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,840
you must report their hiding place

249
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,759
to me immediately.

250
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,559
Section Chief Kawano

251
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,000
wants to

252
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,919
wipe them out completely this time.

253
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,000
Also,

254
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,440
if they try any tricks,

255
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,879
you must find a chance

256
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,519
to deal with Xiao Tielin

257
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:00,320
and eliminate him.

258
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,480
Do you understand?

259
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,599
I...

260
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

261
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,920
You can't do it?

262
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,920
Do you have any other choice?

263
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,200
You're just a dog now.

264
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,880
Only by obeying like a dog

265
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,759
and following orders

266
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,039
is your only way out.

267
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,640
Do your best.

268
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,640
Otherwise, next time

269
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,559
won't be this easy.

270
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,559
Get lost.

271
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,119
Go away.

272
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,559
Xiao Gui, I don't need to soak my feet anymore.

273
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,519
Why are you washing my feet?

274
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,720
You went to see that miracle doctor.

275
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,640
Didn't they all say

276
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,920
there's nothing wrong with my foot?

277
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,000
Why hasn't Brother Yun Hu come back yet?

278
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,000
He hasn't been home for days.

279
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,039
Xiao Gui, stop washing my feet.

280
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,000
Let me do it myself, okay?

281
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,119
When will I see

282
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,960
Squad Leader and Brother Yun Hu again?

283
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,200
Once they finish their mission,

284
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,319
you'll see them.

285
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,519
I miss the platoon leader.

286
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,680
Brother Fu Qing.

287
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,440
Your foot

288
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,000
will get better after a few more soaks.

289
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,559
Brother Fu Qing

290
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,559
I'm going out for some fresh air.

291
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,279
Don't go too far.

292
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,960
The day after tomorrow, we'll officially carry out

293
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,480
the plan to capture Xiao Tielin.

294
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Yun Hu, you and I will act together.

295
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,240
Fu Qing, Xiao Gui,

296
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,000
you two go to Songlin Town to support us.

297
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:46,799
There's a problem.

298
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,279
Since Xiao Tielin

299
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,000
is so important,

300
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,039
if the Japanese

301
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,200
find out he didn't board the plane,

302
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,240
they'll definitely lock down Mudanjiang.

303
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,400
So,

304
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,720
we must get him out before they notice.

305
00:21:58,759 --> 00:21:59,680
Get him out.

306
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:01,799
Xiao Gui,

307
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:02,759
Fu Qing,

308
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,200
you must

309
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,599
go ahead to the outskirts of Songlin Town

310
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,279
to the woods at the Black Pine Ridge fork.

311
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:07,920
Wait there to support us.

312
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,559
Okay.

313
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,839
When do we move?

314
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:11,960
Wait for my signal.

315
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,839
Little Parrot,

316
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,400
It's just the two of us today.

317
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
I want to talk to you about what's on my mind.

318
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,160
You and I,

319
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,000
we really depend on each other.

320
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,640
I've been feeling down lately.

321
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,000
Can't eat, can't sleep.

322
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,759
Things are about to change.

323
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,599
The situation

324
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,200
is about to change drastically.

325
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,839
Tell me,

326
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,240
what if the Imperial Japanese Army

327
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,319
these Japanese

328
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,720
change their mind and don't let me leave?

329
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,240
What should I do?

330
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,640
And Tang Deyuan,

331
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:21,480
do you think he's really loyal?

332
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,000
I honestly can't tell.

333
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,839
It's driving me crazy.

334
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,799
About this matter,

335
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,519
who can I talk to?

336
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,359
With Deyuan?

337
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,440
Not appropriate.

338
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,400
I can only talk to you.

339
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,359
But you probably don't understand a word I'm saying.

340
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,799
What can I do?

341
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,119
Alright then.

342
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,720
I'll

343
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,000
draw a tile.

344
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,759
One Bamboo.

345
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,960
One Bamboo.

346
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,640
Isn't One Bamboo just a single line?

347
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,319
Right?

348
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,599
I'm going down this road to the end.

349
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,759
It's a dead end for me.

350
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,720
Don't move.

351
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,599
Hands up.

352
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,000
Chief Zhao.

353
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What are you doing?

354
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
What was that act about the other day?

355
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,359
You keep coming and going,

356
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,039
whispering behind closed doors,

357
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,640
carrying boxes,

358
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,799
in and out all the time.

359
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,759
What's in those boxes?

360
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,960
What are you up to?

361
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:22,839
You want to know?

362
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:23,720
Of course.

363
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,720
Talk.

364
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,039
Let's sit and talk.

365
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,839
Let's go.

366
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,839
So Xiao Tielin donated a plane

367
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,240
and is going to Japan.

368
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,480
That bastard,

369
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,240
kept making empty promises to me.

370
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,559
Turns out he's running away.

371
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,240
But Tang Deyuan

372
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,359
can leave.

373
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,119
You can't.

374
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
What are you thinking?

375
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,759
Of course I can't leave.

376
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,440
Do you think Xiao Tielin

377
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,480
would take me with him?

378
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,799
So you're unlucky too.

379
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,279
In the end,

380
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,119
you get nothing either.

381
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,480
Exactly.

382
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,599
So many gold bars,

383
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,240
he gets to take them all.

384
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,440
Chief Zhao,

385
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,200
all this fighting between us,

386
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
what's the point?

387
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,160
Given the current situation,

388
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,480
have you ever thought about

389
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:37,119
us two unlucky guys

390
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,240
working together for once?

391
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,079
Hello?

392
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,279
De Yuan,

393
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,759
Why are you calling so late?

394
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,680
Calling me at this hour?

395
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:20,359
What's up?

396
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,680
Let's do as you suggested.

397
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,880
What happened? Why did you change your mind again?

398
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,359
Didn't we agree

399
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,799
to send the stuff to your place?

400
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,000
You make a good point.

401
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,440
Did you find a place?

402
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,519
I do have a place.

403
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,680
Where?

404
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,359
Don't worry, it's definitely safe.

405
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,240
De Yuan,

406
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,759
At this critical moment,

407
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,039
only you can help me.

408
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,799
You're truly my good brother.

409
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,240
This is the final stretch.

410
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,039
Don't mess it up.

411
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,519
Little Parrot

412
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,759
Look, what is this?

413
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:02,599
Life.

414
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,799
Each one is a living life.

415
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,359
My head,

416
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,880
has been hanging by my belt

417
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,359
for more than ten years.

418
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,160
Now, it's time.

419
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,920
All that's left of me

420
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,559
is just these fifty kilos.

421
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,359
Little Parrot,

422
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,880
I'm leaving.

423
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,279
Even the Aisin Gioro dynasty

424
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:36,039
can't hold on anymore.

425
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,279
I've been in this room

426
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,000
for these years.

427
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,759
I should be happy to leave.

428
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,559
I should be glad, right?

429
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,920
But I feel a bit reluctant.

430
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,160
I really envy you.

431
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,799
You have wings.

432
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,319
You can fly.

433
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,319
You can go wherever you want.

434
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,839
Me,

435
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,400
Even with wings, I couldn't escape.

436
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,240
Little Parrot,

437
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:30,960
Go on.

438
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,160
Work hard and earn money.

439
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,799
Work hard and earn money.

440
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,359
Work hard and earn money.

441
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:31,960
I'm here, Brother.

442
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,039
Where's the stuff?

443
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,039
Do you want some?

444
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,079
I'll bring it up from the car for you.

445
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,279
Brother.

446
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,119
What's going on?

447
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,239
Tang Deyuan.

448
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,960
I'm really upset.

449
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,119
You didn't tell me the truth.

450
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,360
What do you mean?

451
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,760
What, is the count off?

452
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:20,159
Come out.

453
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,880
I saw you.

454
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Who did you see?

455
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,360
No one.

456
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Then let's

457
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,960
be honest with each other.

458
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,400
Let's not talk about that yet.

459
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,599
I saved your life two years ago.

460
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,320
Just talking about these past two years,

461
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,960
everything about you,

462
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,599
I've always had your back.

463
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,360
I turned you from

464
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,000
a rat that everyone wanted dead

465
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,840
into a respectable man.

466
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,400
Boss Tang, Second Master Tang.

467
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm hurt, all my kindness

468
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,320
goes unappreciated.

469
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,440
I appreciate it.

470
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,599
I truly do.

471
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,880
The day you saved me,

472
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,639
I still haven't forgotten.

473
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,079
Xu Laosi.

474
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,639
He told me everything, every detail.

475
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,800
He told me all about it.

476
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,000
You're my real brother.

477
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,480
My real little brother.

478
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,400
Words can get twisted.

479
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,360
They can change in passing.

480
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,760
My intentions for you

481
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,880
you really don't understand.

482
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,559
Yes, yes, yes.

483
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,119
You helped me raise money.

484
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
But your little schemes

485
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,000
and tricks in your heart,

486
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,320
I know them all.

487
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,559
I, Xiao Tielin, will settle this score.

488
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,840
So you and me, as brothers,

489
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,880
have grown apart.

490
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,559
How can we go on like this?

491
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,280
I said there was someone.

492
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,159
I guess I've been played by you.

493
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,599
You...

494
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,519
Xiao Tielin, you can't leave.

495
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,320
Didn't expect this, did you, Chief Xiao?

496
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,360
The mantis stalks the cicada,

497
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,400
but Qingtian is behind.

498
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,079
Zhao Qingtian.

499
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,559
I've always treated you well, haven't I?

500
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:05,559
You have.

501
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,079
You even gave me the chief's position.

502
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,599
Chief Xiao, impressive skills.

503
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,480
Going to Japan to enjoy a good life, huh?

504
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,719
I can see that.

505
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,559
That's right, that's right.

506
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,639
That's exactly what I thought.

507
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,480
If I didn't do this,

508
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,519
would you have this chief's position?

509
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,119
Given the current situation,

510
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,880
who doesn't know?

511
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,079
The Japanese could be finished any time.

512
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:33,840
Second Master Tang.

513
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,280
Just now, Chief Xiao

514
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,480
was holding a gun,

515
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:38,400
pointed at your head, right?

516
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,199
That old bastard

517
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,079
has no loyalty to you at all.

518
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,480
Why not

519
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,159
cut off that old Caiyang's head?

520
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,679
Just like we agreed,

521
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,480
we split the gold bars fifty-fifty.

522
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,639
You take your own path,

523
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,000
and I'll cross my own bridge.

524
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,239
How about it?

525
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,280
Tang Deyuan.

526
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,000
This isn't your plan, is it?

527
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:11,000
You want me to kill him?

528
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,320
Why should I?

529
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,559
Why don't you do it?

530
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:16,800
Tang Deyuan.

531
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,800
Is this really your plan?

532
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,360
Shut up.

533
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:21,480
I'm asking you.

534
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,679
I promise,

535
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,880
if you kill Xiao Tielin,

536
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,440
I'll pretend I didn't see it.

537
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,079
You said it.

538
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,960
Yes.

539
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,840
Brother.

540
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,480
Sorry.

541
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,480
De Yuan

542
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:45,639
De Yuan

543
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,119
Go

544
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:53,639
Xiao Tielin

545
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,920
Let me tell you

546
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,679
Don't think you can escape

547
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,119
Take him away

548
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,559
Take care, take care

549
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,599
We've been waiting for so long.

550
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,159
Brother Yunhu and the others

551
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,159
Why aren't they here yet?

552
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,599
Don't worry.

553
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,519
I'm not worried.

554
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,599
I'm just thinking about them.

555
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,280
Let's wait a bit longer.

556
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,920
Stand up

557
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,320
Go

558
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,360
The mission is finally complete

559
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,199
Captain Zaoji

560
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,880
Everything is going according to plan

561
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,280
If they resist

562
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:38,800
Eliminate them all

563
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,280
Yes

564
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,360
I will do my best

565
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:47,039
Split into two columns

566
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:48,960
Move out

567
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:23,119
Here they come.

568
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,039
Where are they?

569
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,000
They're over there.

570
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,840
Quick, get them in the car.

571
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,440
Get up.

572
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:30,800
Thanks for your hard work.

573
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:31,960
Be careful.

574
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,000
Get in the car, hurry.

575
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:51,199
