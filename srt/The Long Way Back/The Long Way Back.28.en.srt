1
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,760
Like Zhu Bajie looking in the mirror.

2
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,120
You’re always running around all day.

3
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,079
You barely touch the ground.

4
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,079
You leave halfway through your meal.

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,519
Who are you rushing off to mourn?

6
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,640
What nonsense are you talking?

7
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,319
I have official business.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Official business, my ass.

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,680
Who are you trying to fool?

10
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,879
Isn’t it just that riverside brothel?

11
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,240
Has Xiaowuzi come back?

12
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,599
All these years, in your heart,

13
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,000
you’ve always been thinking about it.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
You really are long-haired and short-sighted.

15
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,639
I really have official business.

16
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,400
I can’t afford any delays.

17
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,560
I can’t afford delays.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,680
What business?

19
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,000
Tell me about it.

20
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,639
If you don’t explain today,

21
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,479
down to every detail,

22
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,639
you’re not going anywhere.

23
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:40,960
You—

24
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
Mudanjiang called.

25
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,080
An important person is coming.

26
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,680
Really?

27
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,199
How could I make that up?

28
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,599
Would I joke about my own livelihood?

29
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,400
Come here.

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,159
Why didn’t you say so earlier?

31
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,479
You should’ve just explained from the start.

32
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,199
Take a bite.

33
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,400
Come back early.

34
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,759
Sir,

35
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,360
Are you staying at the inn?

36
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,159
Innkeeper, do you have any rooms?

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,080
Yes.

38
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,560
How many people?

39
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,159
Just me. I need a single room.

40
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,439
There are two rooms upstairs on the second floor.

41
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,280
One faces the street, the other is inside.

42
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,360
Do you prefer a quieter room

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,319
or a brighter one?

44
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,199
How about

45
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,400
I take you up to have a look first?

46
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:04,960
No need to look.

47
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,159
I want the one facing the street.

48
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,800
Alright, please wait a moment.

49
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,560
No rush.

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,080
Innkeeper,

51
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,639
I'm here in town to meet a friend.

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,719
We arranged to meet.

53
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,079
We're meeting at your inn.

54
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,079
What friend?

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,240
My friend is with the opera troupe.

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,000
His name is Liu Banhu.

57
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,560
Not sure if he's arrived yet.

58
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,319
The opera troupe, huh?

59
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,600
They haven't been here for a while.

60
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,439
Looks like I got here first.

61
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:34,680
Don't worry.

62
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,879
Staying here is just like home.

63
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,279
I'll keep an eye out for you.

64
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:38,959
Sir,

65
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,240
How should I address you?

66
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,360
My surname is Zhu.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Just call me Mr. Zhu.

68
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,120
Mr. Zhu.

69
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,519
I'll let the staff downstairs know

70
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,319
to keep an eye out as well.

71
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,079
If Liu Banhu from the opera troupe

72
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,759
shows up,

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,600
we'll tell him

74
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,160
Mr. Zhu is already here.

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,720
Thank you, Innkeeper.

76
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,199
Alright.

77
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,439
I'll take you upstairs.

78
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,920
Okay.

79
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,399
Once you're settled in,

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,879
just come down to register.

81
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,319
Mr. Zhu,

82
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,240
This way.

83
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,879
Mom, the fish is delicious.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
You still haven't had enough?

85
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,040
Xiaowuzi,

86
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,000
Innkeeper Tong, another guest has arrived.

87
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,879
Whose house did you eat at today?

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,519
Went to Fourth Aunt's for stewed fish.

89
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,319
You've been here for days now.

90
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
I haven't cooked for you yet.

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,920
I'll have the kitchen make something next time.

92
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,839
We'll eat here at the inn.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,399
No rush.

94
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,639
Wait till the boss comes.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,439
He'll have a few drinks with you.

96
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,839
Sounds good.

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,839
Let's go, Mom.

98
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,399
The innkeeper is well-liked.

99
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
Your inn must do good business.

100
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,079
In this town,

101
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,360
there aren't many decent inns.

102
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,800
Anyone with a bit of money

103
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,759
prefers to stay here.

104
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,720
They come for the peace and reliability.

105
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,720
Mr. Zhu,

106
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
Why did you come back?

107
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,879
I understand.

108
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,680
Rules.

109
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,000
I won't ask.

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,519
When are you leaving?

111
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
Afraid I'll make you stay?

112
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,839
You're underestimating me.

113
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,519
Why do you keep watching me?

114
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,959
Am I getting old?

115
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,480
Don't care about me anymore?

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,199
I do care.

117
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,279
Master Pang

118
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,040
What brings you here at this hour?

119
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,319
I'm looking for Mr. Zhu.

120
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,639
Which room is he in?

121
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,879
Mr. Zhu

122
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,279
He's in the upstairs room facing the street.

123
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,279
I'll take you up.

124
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,759
No need.

125
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:50,839
Go on with your work.

126
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,439
Alright.

127
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,279
That's impossible.

128
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,439
Songlin Town

129
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,639
It's such a small place.

130
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,560
Besides, it's been so many years.

131
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,639
No one has the guts anymore.

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,560
It's over.

133
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,680
Try it.

134
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,040
No unfamiliar faces in town?

135
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,360
Everyone coming and going these days

136
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,159
is all registered here.

137
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,080
Those visiting relatives,

138
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,440
I've checked every household.

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,559
Those staying at the inn,

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,360
are all regular traders.

141
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,320
No strangers.

142
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,320
Your records aren't complete.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,879
They're absolutely complete.

144
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,879
The woman next door

145
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,120
and her child aren't registered.

146
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,879
You mean Caifeng and her kid?

147
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,039
Caifeng is originally from Songlin Town.

148
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,600
She left here.

149
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,759
She's just visiting her family.

150
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
So I didn't register her.

151
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,000
Errenzhuan troupe

152
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,799
When did they come?

153
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,039
Errenzhuan troupe

154
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,039
During the March 3rd festival recently.

155
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,720
The town invited a troupe.

156
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
They performed for two days.

157
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,960
Liu Banhu was there too.

158
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,960
Liu Banhu

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,399
Liu Banhu

160
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,960
You mean the one under Wang Laohao?

161
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,840
That Liu Banhu?

162
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,039
It wasn't their troupe on March 3rd.

163
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,559
What about Mantianhong?

164
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,639
They're really popular now.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,440
You have to book them months in advance.

166
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,039
At most, they come twice a year.

167
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,840
Don't worry.

168
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,320
Songlin Town is very peaceful.

169
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,120
There are definitely no Communists.

170
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:33,960
Absolutely.

171
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,519
Would you bet your life on it?

172
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
I wouldn't dare.

173
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,039
Let me tell you,

174
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,480
Liu Banhu is a Communist.

175
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:50,679
He

176
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,720
Chief

177
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,320
This troupe travels all over.

178
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,480
He's not from Songlin Town.

179
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,039
This matter,

180
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,120
can't be blamed on

181
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,200
Songlin Town.

182
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,960
I'm just reminding you.

183
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,440
In recent years, Songlin Town

184
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,759
has had quite a few major events.

185
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,120
You, as an official,

186
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,879
don't lose your head before retirement.

187
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,519
Don't get yourself killed.

188
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,399
In the past two years,

189
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,480
which businesses have changed their signs?

190
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,519
To be honest,

191
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,320
business is tough.

192
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
Changing signs happens often.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,159
I'll go back and check right away.

194
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,679
I'll report to you when I'm done.

195
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,240
What about Yelaihao Inn?

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
Is it still the same owner?

197
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,399
The owner of Yelaihao Inn

198
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,519
is a local,

199
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,320
from Songlin Town.

200
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,799
There's definitely no problem there.

201
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,360
Not absolutely.

202
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,200
You can't say "definitely."

203
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
If you have any doubts,

204
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll fully cooperate with your investigation.

205
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,879
But Yelaihao Inn

206
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,320
what problem could it have?

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,080
A few years ago,

208
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,559
two people came to Songlin Town.

209
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,639
They stayed for a while and left.

210
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,440
They even opened a shop selling mountain goods.

211
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,320
When they first arrived,

212
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,639
they stayed at Yelaihao Inn.

213
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,799
Wipe yourself off.

214
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,399
I was just thinking,

215
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,799
these past two years in town,

216
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,919
I don't think I've ever told you

217
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,919
about myself.

218
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,080
Right?

219
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,600
Me,

220
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,399
I grew up relying on the kindness of many families.

221
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,279
I don't even know what my parents looked like.

222
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,240
I've never seen them.

223
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,240
If I hadn't met

224
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,480
our group,

225
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,039
I probably would've starved to death long ago.

226
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
But because I met

227
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,519
our group,

228
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,399
I finally lived like a real person.

229
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,720
I learned what I should do.

230
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,600
Later, by accident,

231
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,399
you ended up saving me.

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,759
So ever since I left town,

233
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,039
there's been someone

234
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,120
I've been thinking about.

235
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,600
These past years outside,

236
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,840
I've crossed mountains,

237
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,679
waded through rivers,

238
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,120
braved wind and rain,

239
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,240
and never forgot what I should do.

240
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,600
I've never forgotten.

241
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,960
Zhi'er,

242
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,399
Zhi'er.

243
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,159
Master Pang,

244
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,840
Closing up so early?

245
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,240
Master Pang,

246
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,919
do you need something?

247
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,960
Do I need to report to you?

248
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,919
Neighbors look out for each other.

249
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,919
Someone I care about,

250
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,759
I've never forgotten either.

251
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,559
Really.

252
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,039
Look at this four-legged table,

253
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,200
and this open jar.

254
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,759
Haven't you seen enough?

255
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,360
Innkeeper,

256
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,240
Master Pang,

257
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,600
do you want to watch me bathe and change too?

258
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,320
Stop talking nonsense.

259
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,039
What the heck?

260
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,519
Innkeeper,

261
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,559
Are you messing with me?

262
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,600
Just a few dishes and you're this drunk?

263
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,159
What's up?

264
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,000
Did your wife kick you out?

265
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,399
Is someone in your room?

266
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,399
Come on, call them out.

267
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:08,879
Let me see.

268
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,519
Call them out to drink with you.

269
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,519
Or just a cheers?

270
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,200
Is it your wife or someone else?

271
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,279
Someone you can't show?

272
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,000
Master Pang, just say what you want.

273
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,279
I have something to ask you.

274
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,279
Back then, I got you

275
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,879
two ID papers.

276
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,240
Who were those two people?

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
Where are they now?

278
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,960
You mean those two?

279
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,279
Don't mention them.

280
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,519
They thought my place was too small.

281
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,919
They left after a few days.

282
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,080
Heard they opened a mountain goods shop.

283
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,879
People who used to be bandits

284
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,600
can't handle the hardships of business.

285
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,720
They quit soon after.

286
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,799
They left.

287
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,879
If they weren't distant relatives,

288
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,639
I wouldn't have bothered.

289
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,919
After they left Songlin Town,

290
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,360
where did they go?

291
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,000
You really don't know?

292
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,279
You can't stop the rain or a woman from remarrying.

293
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,399
How could I control that?

294
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,080
They're grown men with two good legs.

295
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,480
What distant relatives?

296
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,559
Probably lovers.

297
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,480
Master Pang figured it out.

298
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,000
All these years,

299
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
I've met plenty of men.

300
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,480
But a man like this

301
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,080
I've never seen before.

302
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,039
He ate my food, drank my drinks,

303
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,639
and in the end,

304
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,519
he even took my money and left.

305
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
Used me up and left nothing behind.

306
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,799
Ran off slick as oil.

307
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,120
Didn't even look back.

308
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,600
Tell me, am I

309
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,320
like a hunter blinded by an eagle?

310
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,879
You men,

311
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,720
not a single one is decent.

312
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,399
Take you, Master Pang.

313
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,559
Here in Songlin Town,

314
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,200
you've got money and status.

315
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,159
But you're still messing around.

316
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,120
Always coming here to sweet talk me.

317
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,039
Talking nonsense for no reason.

318
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,120
Bah!

319
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,080
You really think I'm

320
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,240
an old lady's soft persimmon?

321
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,080
Easy to squeeze?

322
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,039
Dakuozhi, who are you cursing?

323
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,960
Who am I cursing?

324
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,799
Whoever annoys me, I curse.

325
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,879
Dakuozhi.

326
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,200
Dakuozhi.

327
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:22,919
Zhi'er.

328
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,759
Get lost!

329
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,320
Why do you turn on me so fast?

330
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm just doing my job.

331
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,120
You...

332
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,200
Women are so fickle.

333
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,039
What are you staring at?

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,759
He's gone.

335
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,000
Done cursing?

336
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
If not, hit me a couple more times.

337
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,120
Idiot.

338
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,279
Alright, I should go.

339
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,519
I'm at the Old Walnut Coffin Shop

340
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,559
found a spot in the wasteland

341
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,360
to rest for a while.

342
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,319
You're leaving now?

343
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,920
No.

344
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,039
If Pang Sihai is asking questions now,

345
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,440
something's definitely up.

346
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,799
I can't drag you into this.

347
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,559
Besides, I have important things to do.

348
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,440
Does it have to be today?

349
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,240
Time waits for no one.

350
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,480
I need to go to Anfu Inn.

351
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,000
Are you stupid?

352
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,640
Pang Sihai just left.

353
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,279
If you go out now, you'll run into him.

354
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,000
What will you do?

355
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,799
How about this:

356
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,759
Me and Xiaotongtui

357
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,400
will check around for you.

358
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,279
See where the trouble

359
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,240
is coming from.

360
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,359
You can leave later.

361
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,920
Stop worrying.

362
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,680
Today in Songlin Town,

363
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,279
only this bed can keep you safe.

364
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,799
From now on,

365
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,519
I'm the owner of Yelaihao Inn.

366
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,680
Alright, then I'm the manager.

367
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,039
Why are you so fierce?

368
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,279
Mr. Zhu.

369
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,559
All the shops that changed hands these two years,

370
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,359
we checked them all today.

371
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:40,960
Anyone coming and going,

372
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,519
I've recorded everything.

373
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:47,960
Go contact

374
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Wang Laohao from the opera troupe.

375
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,720
Ask him if Liu Banhu has

376
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,039
any

377
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,559
close relatives or friends in town.

378
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,720
I'll wait here.

379
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,599
Also,

380
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
lock down Songlin Town immediately.

381
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,759
All exits.

382
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,119
Don't let anyone escape.

383
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,279
Alright, alright.

384
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,279
You rest.

385
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
What's your name?

386
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,759
Gayazi.

387
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,160
Gayazi.

388
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,519
Full name?

389
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,880
Tang Chengjiu.

390
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,440
Where are you from?

391
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
Mudanjiang.

392
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,359
Is your family in the city?

393
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,480
Do you have a big restaurant?

394
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,799
Tian Tian Hao Restaurant.

395
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,279
Sure.

396
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,400
How's your leg?

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,440
It's almost healed.

398
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,759
Uncle Liu said a few more doses,

399
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,920
and it won't leave any lasting damage.

400
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,759
Looks like Uncle Liu is pretty skilled.

401
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,359
Xiaogui.

402
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,319
Here, take this.

403
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,480
Brother.

404
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,440
Why are you giving me so much money?

405
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,000
I've been

406
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,319
doing well lately.

407
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,079
Won some money at the gambling house.

408
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,359
Sold the restaurant.

409
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,119
What?

410
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,640
Why?

411
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,440
No reason.

412
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:42,680
Just don't want to do it anymore.

413
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,839
I've realized

414
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,240
Mudanjiang

415
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,680
isn't a place for people to stay.

416
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,519
You're leaving?

417
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,599
Brother Deyuan.

418
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,640
I don't want to stay here either.

419
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:01,720
If you're leaving,

420
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,680
Brother, take me with you.

421
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,359
I want to leave Mudanjiang too.

422
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,799
Let's leave Mudanjiang together.

423
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,599
Is that okay?

424
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,240
Take you with me?

425
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,920
Forget it.

426
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,839
Let me tell you,

427
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,759
right now I'm like

428
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,359
a sparrow stuck in a muddy ditch.

429
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,799
I don't even know the way out.

430
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,839
How could I take you with me?

431
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,920
Then what am I supposed to do if you leave?

432
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,400
That's why I'm giving you money.

433
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,119
Brother Deyuan, no matter what,

434
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,119
the days I spent with you

435
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,519
were the most comfortable I've had in years.

436
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,720
The most peaceful days.

437
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,279
I won't forget your kindness.

438
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,440
As long as you remember.

439
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,359
Then can you tell me

440
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,440
where Old Platoon Leader and the others are?

441
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,599
If I don't go with you, I'll go find them.

442
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,880
You're not letting this go, huh?

443
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,400
I don't know where they are.

444
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,559
Brother Deyuan.

445
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,640
It's come to this,

446
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,440
and you still won't tell me

447
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,400
where they are, I...

448
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:14,799
I'll go out on my own.

449
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,559
I'll really be like a wandering ghost.

450
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:17,759
No.

451
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,039
Right now, they

452
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,680
are like wandering ghosts too.

453
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,759
Where would I even find them?

454
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,640
Impossible.

455
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,599
You can't not know

456
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,279
where they are.

457
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,319
You're just lying to me on purpose.

458
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,319
You don't want to tell me.

459
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,319
Why?

460
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,440
Why?

461
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,200
Do you all want me dead?

462
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,480
If you don't want me dead,

463
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,319
then tell me where Old Platoon Leader is.

464
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,160
Brother Deyuan.

465
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,559
I'm begging you.

466
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,400
You must know.

467
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,440
Just give me a way to survive.

468
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,319
Brother.

469
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,160
I know things are tough for you.

470
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
They're tough for me too.

471
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,079
There's nothing we can do.

472
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,880
None of us have a choice.

473
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,440
Isn't that right?

474
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,920
How is it?

475
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,920
I've checked everything out.

476
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,279
Innkeeper Tong is back.

477
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,880
Master Pang

478
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,799
is not in town right now.

479
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,759
You can go.

480
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,799
Alright.

481
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,000
Be careful.

482
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,680
Don't worry.

483
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,160
What are you humming?

484
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,000
Does it sound good?

485
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,960
It does.

486
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,559
Uncle.

487
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,480
Do you even know him? Why call him uncle?

488
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,519
Where are you from, sir?

489
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:05,880
Fengtian.

490
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,400
Fengtian.

491
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,920
What kind of room would you like?

492
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,119
Sorry to trouble you.

493
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,240
Find me a

494
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,119
clean and cheap room.

495
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,039
Don't worry.

496
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,000
All my rooms here

497
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:18,720
are clean.

498
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,039
Mr. Zhu.

499
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:24,920
Hey,

500
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,359
this brother here

501
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,759
looks a bit familiar.

502
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
Have we met somewhere before?

503
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,240
Sir,

504
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,640
you must be mistaken.

505
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,119
We probably haven't met.

506
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,240
Where are you from, brother?

507
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,359
Fengtian.

508
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,720
That's not close at all.

509
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,599
So you're here

510
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,079
to visit family back home?

511
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,559
Just passing through Songlin Town.

512
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,559
Thought I'd stop and rest.

513
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,079
Where are you from?

514
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,319
Mr. Zhu is here to meet a friend.

515
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,400
Are you heading out?

516
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,640
Just stepping out.

517
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,000
Take care.

518
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,079
Let me show you the room.

519
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,279
Alright.

520
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,920
Okay.

521
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,319
Let's go.

522
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,200
This way, sir.

523
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,400
How about this room?

524
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,160
It's a bit small,

525
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,160
but very quiet.

526
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,039
As expected,

527
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,000
your inn is clean and affordable.

528
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,599
A friend of mine said the same.

529
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,200
His surname is Liu.

530
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,799
He's good at playing the banhu.

531
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,279
Innkeeper Tong,

532
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,799
I heard you used to

533
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,319
be in the fur business too.

534
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,359
Then you must know

535
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,480
there used to be a fur shop

536
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,839
here in Songlin Town.

537
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,680
Yes, there was.

538
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,960
The owner was an honest man.

539
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,599
Unfortunately,

540
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,680
he's been gone for years.

541
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,559
May I ask why

542
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,400
you stopped the fur business after that?

543
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,480
I got tired of traveling around.

544
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,319
So I settled down in Songlin Town.

545
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,759
Tired? Let's sit and talk.

546
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,559
Let's sit and chat.

547
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,440
The tides shift on the sea of Yongwang.

548
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,039
Lanterns shine, reflecting your grace.

549
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,720
Who are you?

550
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:04,839
Gao Yunhu.

551
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,720
I came from across the river.

552
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,359
Which side of the river?

553
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,720
There's a dish from over there.

554
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,519
I wonder if you know it, Innkeeper Tong.

555
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:16,839
I'd like to learn how to make it.

556
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,039
So my friends and family can try it.

557
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,119
Which dish?

558
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,279
Borscht.

559
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,119
That soup is something else.

560
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
It's red.

561
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:35,640
You are from...

562
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,839
Comrade.

563
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,359
Comrade Wanchun has died.

564
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,279
Before he died, he told me to come

565
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,720
to Anfu Inn in Songlin Town.

566
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,920
Are you heading out far?

567
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,599
Uncle.

568
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,680
Comrade Wanchun.

569
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,119
He sacrificed himself to protect us.

570
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,440
He died in Mudanjiang.

571
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,519
He was from the central region.

572
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,799
Our organization here

573
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,599
was established after they arrived.

574
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,160
It gradually grew and took shape.

575
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,960
The goal was to

576
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,240
connect with the Anti-Japanese forces across the river

577
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,000
as soon as possible.

578
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,160
This is bad.

579
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,440
What happened?

580
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,680
That Mr. Zhu from earlier

581
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,319
was also looking for Liu Banhu.

582
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,119
He also came from Mudanjiang.

583
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,799
He knows Caifeng and her husband.

584
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,839
Seems like it.

585
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,400
After he arrived in town,

586
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,279
who else did he meet?

587
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,240
Master Pang.

588
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,359
The two of them

589
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,559
spent the whole day together in town.

590
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,799
So our suspicion was right.

591
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,000
Comrade Wanchun's identity

592
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
was probably exposed early on.

593
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,279
Then this person

594
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,920
is very likely

595
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,440
a Special Higher Police agent from Mudanjiang.

596
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,960
He traced things all the way to Songlin Town.

597
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:23,920
No wonder

598
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,319
Master Pang treated him that way.

599
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,000
Mr. Zhu is up to no good.

600
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,279
He’s probably

601
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,200
here to investigate the communication station.

602
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,319
No, Innkeeper Tong.

603
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
We need to leave quickly.

604
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,559
Wait a moment.

605
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,960
This was brought back from Yan'an.

606
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,000
With this,

607
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,440
we can contact Yan'an.

608
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,079
Alright, don’t worry.

609
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,119
I’ll make sure

610
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,400
it gets to the higher-ups.

611
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,119
Hurry and get out of here.

612
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,559
You go first.

613
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,039
Before I leave,

614
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,599
I need to spread the word

615
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,960
that the communication station here has been evacuated.

616
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,440
Take care.

617
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,680
Take care.

618
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,160
Step back.

619
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,039
Brother.

620
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,559
What’s going on up ahead?

621
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,920
Those Japanese

622
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,000
are acting crazy for some reason.

623
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,359
They said they’re sealing off the whole town.

624
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,400
The entire town

625
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,920
all the exits

626
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,880
are completely blocked.

627
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,119
They’re only letting people in, not out.

628
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,559
Did they say

629
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,359
when it’ll be lifted?

630
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,400
Who knows?

631
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,400
This is Brother Xu’s

632
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,839
undershirt he left in the room last time.

633
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,680
It’s been washed.

634
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,079
Just waiting for you to pick it up.

635
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,359
Thanks, I’ll head out now.

636
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:07,799
Alright.

637
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,480
You’re back.

638
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,319
Please, upstairs.

639
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,960
Sir, please go upstairs.

640
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,839
Xiaoranzi.

641
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,839
Xiaoranzi, come here.

642
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,839
Boss.

643
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,440
There are so many people, I can’t get away.

644
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,160
I’ve been holding it in for ages.

645
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,880
Keep an eye out.

646
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,599
I’m going to the restroom.

647
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,279
Alright.

648
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:22,720
Okay.

649
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,920
Uncle

650
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,000
Thank you, Uncle.

651
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:39,599
Uncle.

652
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,039
Take me with you wherever you go from now on.

653
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:43,559
Is that okay?

654
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,480
Don't leave me behind again.

655
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,840
When have I ever left you behind?

656
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,559
Then from now on,

657
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,639
wherever you go, I go.

658
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,679
Whatever you do,

659
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:58,840
I'll do it too.

660
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,440
Is that alright?

661
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,760
Alright.

662
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,360
Really?

663
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,760
Really. Why would I lie?

664
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,320
You...

665
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:10,880
Well...

666
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,119
When are we leaving Mudanjiang?

667
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,599
Why do we have to leave here?

668
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,639
Mudanjiang isn't a place for people to stay.

669
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,679
Then where do you want to go?

670
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:29,920
To the mountains.

671
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,079
Let's go back and fight as guerrillas.

672
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,880
If we could've stayed in the mountains back then,

673
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,039
why would we have left?

674
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,679
Uncle.

675
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
The city is already

676
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,280
under Japanese control.

677
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,480
We can't stay here much longer.

678
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,760
Let's hurry and leave.

679
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,480
It's not time to leave yet.

680
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,159
I've been running for years, I'm tired of it.

681
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,760
I really don't want to be chased anymore.

682
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,480
Now you have us.

683
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,079
What are you afraid of?

684
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,480
I'm afraid I'll hold you back.

685
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,360
Afraid I'm useless.

686
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,679
Let me do it, let me.

687
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,119
There's a draft here.

688
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,599
You can't light it.

689
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,360
Give it to me.

690
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,039
I won't smoke anymore, I won't.

691
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,239
I won't smoke.

692
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:17,800
Gui'er.

693
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,000
Gui'er, Gui'er, Gui'er.

694
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,280
Gui'er, Gui'er.

695
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,920
Uncle

696
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,760
My hand can't hold a gun anymore.

697
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,440
Don't talk nonsense.

698
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,920
As long as you still have your hand,

699
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,280
you'll be able to hold a gun sooner or later.

700
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:27,639
Come with me.

701
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,239
I'll find you a place.

702
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:33,639
Where to?

703
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,840
We've wandered everywhere.

704
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,000
We've already walked all around.

705
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,679
There are only a few streets in town.

706
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,599
How much more can we wander?

707
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:51,679
Alright.

708
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,199
Mom, look at my pinwheel!

709
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,440
You really like your little pinwheel, huh?

710
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,559
Gayazi, don't run off.

711
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,639
I know, I won't run off.

712
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:19,599
Waiter

713
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,480
Boss

714
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,800
The guest who came at noon,

715
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
the one who looked lively,

716
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,760
did he check in?

717
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:24,960
Boss

718
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,239
Which guest are you asking about?

719
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:27,679
I've got quite a few guests.

720
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,360
I can't recall right now.

721
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,920
Gayazi, come here.

722
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,840
In Grandpa's room

723
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,719
there are lots of fun things.

724
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:51,599
Do you want to

725
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,679
go see Grandpa's room?

726
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,320
Come on, let's go.

727
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,960
Is it fun?

728
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,800
Grandpa will peel a candy for you.

729
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,800
Come here.

730
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,280
Gayazi

731
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:19,880
Why didn't your dad

732
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,760
come with you?

733
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,199
Dad said we should go first.

734
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,719
He'll come pick us up in a few days.

735
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:26,840
Good boy.

736
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,119
Today, downstairs

737
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,239
the uncle you called out to,

738
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,320
do you know him?

739
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,559
Yeah, I know him.

740
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,440
How do you know him?

741
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,920
He played with me at our house.

742
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,119
Mr. Kawano

743
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,280
There's news about the Communist Party.

744
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,719
I've contacted the opera troupe.

745
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:56,920
The troupe said

746
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,880
this Innkeeper Tong

747
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,760
is a distant relative of Liu Banhu.

748
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,480
Tong left at noon

749
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,320
and hasn't come back yet.

750
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,880
It's probably him.

751
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,639
Take your men and work with the military police.

752
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,679
Search all around Songlin Town.

753
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,199
Gayazi

754
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,159
Gayazi

755
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:34,840
Gayazi

756
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:46,519
Hurry up.

757
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,239
Hurry up.

758
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,719
Squat down.

759
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,719
Everyone, everyone.

760
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,519
You, your papers.

761
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:57,639
Dakuozhi

762
00:41:59,239 --> 00:41:59,800
Where are you going?

763
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:00,920
Where are you headed?

764
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,280
What kind of official are you?

765
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,119
You're nothing.

766
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:04,800
A child is missing in Songlin Town.

767
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,159
Whose child?

768
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,880
Caifeng's son Gayazi is missing.

769
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:09,960
Don't stop me, I need to go look for him.

770
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,519
Wait a minute.

771
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,360
The other day, in your room—

772
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,199
No strangers came, right?

773
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,280
Stop talking nonsense.

774
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,400
There's never a day at Yelaihao Inn without strangers.

775
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:18,599
Sis.

776
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,280
Sis, I searched again.

777
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,480
Still couldn't find him.

778
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,599
Master Pang, my child is missing.

779
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,639
Can you have your men help me look?

780
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,760
I'm handling official business.

781
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,400
Don't make trouble.

782
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,639
What do you mean by official business?

783
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,800
A commoner's problem isn't official business?

784
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,800
You ignore the people's problems,

785
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,480
but you come to my place looking for things.

786
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:35,199
Dakuozhi.

787
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,119
Don't push your luck.

788
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,840
Don't think that I—

789
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,360
—won't do anything to you.

790
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,519
Pang Sihai.

791
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,400
My whole family and business,

792
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,480
are all here in Songlin Town.

793
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,840
If you're worried,

794
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:46,280
I'll open my doors for you to search.

795
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,599
If you find nothing,

796
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,719
we'll settle this between us later.

797
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,800
You, you, you—

798
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,880
Step back.

799
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,360
This area is sealed off.

800
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,000
Move back.

801
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:01,199
Wait, why can't we leave?
