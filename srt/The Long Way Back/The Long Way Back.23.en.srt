1
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,159
Thank you for your support.

2
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,359
Come in, please come inside.

3
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,640
Boss Tang.

4
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,319
Chairman Qi.

5
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,000
Congratulations!

6
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,599
Congratulations.

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,560
Director Ma.

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,439
Boss Qiu, what a rare guest!

9
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,000
Come, please.

10
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,719
Commander Guo, Boss Shao.

11
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,840
Congratulations!

12
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,799
Congratulations.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Thank you, thank you.

14
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,520
No need to be so polite, we're family.

15
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,000
Second Master Tang.

16
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
That's not quite right.

17
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,719
We should be even more courteous among ourselves.

18
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:17,960
Alright.

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Then I'll accept it.

20
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,199
Anyway, later on,

21
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll probably lose it back to you at cards.

22
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:32,879
Alright.

23
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,800
Excuse me, make way.

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,319
Move aside, move aside.

25
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Excuse me, make way.

26
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,280
Make way, make way, make way.

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,719
Boss Shao, Commander Guo.

28
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,319
Congratulations, Boss Tang.

29
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,280
Section Chief Zhao.

30
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,199
Why trouble yourself?

31
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,520
You came in person.

32
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,439
Who doesn't know?

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,719
Boss Tang.

34
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,479
Your status in Director Xiao's eyes

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,960
is second to none.

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
He specially told me

37
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,759
to personally bring the golden plaque

38
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,120
to congratulate Boss Tang.

39
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:58,719
Alright.

40
00:02:59,319 --> 00:02:59,960
Open it and take a look.

41
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,240
Lift the cover.

42
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,520
Then please thank Director Xiao for me.

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,639
Of course.

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,120
Let's go inside and chat.

45
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,520
Let's go.

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,439
Alright, please, please.

47
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,360
Please, please.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,319
Just a small token.

49
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,800
Section Chief Zhao, you went to too much trouble.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,319
It's only right.

51
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:27,879
Please.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,319
Band leader.

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,319
Please.

54
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,560
The young lady is sitting in the back room.

55
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,400
At dusk, she lifts the shop sign and steps outside.

56
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,199
The shop sign hangs outside the main door.

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,240
She stands sideways and greets the guests.

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Travelers from the south and north,

59
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,080
those heading to the capital, those taking exams,

60
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,159
all come to stay at the inn.

61
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,039
Come in for food and lodging.

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,319
I, your humble servant, will serve you.

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,439
Section Chief Zhao.

64
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,920
Please take a seat.

65
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,360
Pour the wine.

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Section Chief Zhao, have some.

67
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,600
Alright.

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,879
Let me toast everyone first.

69
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,360
Thank you, thank you.

70
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,800
Thank you for your support, thank you.

71
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,800
I'll drink first to show my respect.

72
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,720
Enjoy your meal.

73
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,720
I'll be right back.

74
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,759
Alright.

75
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,040
One day, riding a horse,

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,839
I rode forward.

77
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,920
Suddenly, something flashed before my eyes.

78
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:16,959
Let me do it, let me.

79
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,319
Boss Lady.

80
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,120
Let me do it, let me.

81
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,480
How can you do this kind of work?

82
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,800
I've been through worse, this is nothing.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,560
Besides,

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,480
it's our grand opening today.

85
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,639
I want to join in the fun too.

86
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,839
If the boss sees this,

87
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
he'll surely give us both a slap.

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,240
Let me do it instead.

89
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,920
You just rest.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,639
Boss Lady.

91
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,839
It's smoky here, hard to breathe.

92
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,879
Go outside and rest.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,639
We've got it covered here.

94
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,839
Alright, alright, you go ahead.

95
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
Are you saying you're the owner, sister-in-law?

96
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,120
Mentioning the boss,

97
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,279
I'm just a servant.

98
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,800
Stop.

99
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,920
Change to another piece.

100
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,759
This part is boring.

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
Alright, sir, let's switch to another piece.

102
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,079
As long as we know how to sing it,

103
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:04,959
you can request anything you like.

104
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,040
If we don't sing it well,

105
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,279
please give us some pointers.

106
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,720
You—

107
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,759
Get lost.

108
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,680
It's early spring.

109
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,680
Why are you bundled up so tightly?

110
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,120
It's such a wonderful day.

111
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,600
Make everyone happy.

112
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,639
Sing a piece for me.

113
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,000
Eighteen Touches (a traditional erotic song).

114
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,120
How about it?

115
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
Good, that's a great choice.

116
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,480
Sir, you—

117
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,560
How about today,

118
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,160
you listen to the full version of Scholar's Portrait first?

119
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,000
For good luck.

120
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
It's a special day.

121
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:43,920
Then in a few days,

122
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,879
when the weather gets warmer,

123
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,879
I'll sing for you officers

124
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,600
in a private show.

125
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,439
With so many people around,

126
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,240
everyone's so impatient.

127
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,319
It's embarrassing.

128
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh my!

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Little beauty,

130
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,920
you're really quick with words.

131
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
Sir, sir, sir—

132
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,199
On this stage,

133
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,399
no touching allowed.

134
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,519
Just one touch.

135
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,040
It's not like you'll lose a piece of flesh.

136
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,040
What,

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
is singing so precious now?

138
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,480
That's not what I mean.

139
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,920
I just want to touch.

140
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,680
Business is business.

141
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,240
You—

142
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,399
Sir, what are you doing?

143
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,240
With all these people here,

144
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,600
you're still getting rough?

145
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,480
I know.

146
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,920
I came with money in my pocket.

147
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,560
Go get the boss.

148
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,040
Alright.

149
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,360
Tonight,

150
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,079
you're coming home with me.

151
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:19,759
Sir—

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,839
Sir, please let go.

153
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:21,879
Sir, sir—

154
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,839
Let go, let go.

155
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,759
Don't make things hard for her.

156
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,720
I invited this troupe.

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,439
Sis, it's fine.

158
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,319
I can handle it.

159
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,560
I've dealt with people like this before.

160
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,480
Boss lady,

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,160
don't misunderstand.

162
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,800
These are Liu's men.

163
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,079
They dare to cause trouble here.

164
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:42,639
Commander Guo.

165
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,720
No rush.

166
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,199
Wait until De Yuan comes in.

167
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,879
Then we'll go down.

168
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,720
Second Master

169
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,480
Vice Officer Xu seems a bit upset.

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,160
The lady boss asked you to go check.

171
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,040
Got it.

172
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
This opera troupe,

173
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,879
was invited by your lady boss.

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,399
Then I have to show respect.

175
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,160
How about this,

176
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
tonight,

177
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,399
you all come to my barracks

178
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,399
and perform a show for me.

179
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,560
Whatever you usually get paid,

180
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,839
I'll pay double.

181
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:18,839
How's that?

182
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,879
This troupe

183
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,199
I've already booked them

184
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,360
to perform here for three days straight.

185
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,040
If you want to book them,

186
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,360
you'll have to wait.

187
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,199
Lady boss,

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,800
you're not giving me any respect?

189
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,720
Isn't that troublesome?

190
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,600
Don't be ungrateful.

191
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,000
Vice Officer Xu,

192
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,519
What's going on here?

193
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,120
Look how busy I am.

194
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,960
Come on, help me set up the chairs.

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,159
Sorry for not taking better care.

196
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,519
Sorry, sorry.

197
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,320
Come on.

198
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,279
How about this,

199
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,120
I'll drink a penalty cup.

200
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,440
Let me apologize to you.

201
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,559
No, no, no.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,879
Second Master Tang,

203
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,559
Business is business.

204
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,879
What does that mean?

205
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,200
In front of all these people,

206
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,039
I just want to invite a performer for a drink.

207
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,399
And you won't even give me that respect?

208
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,399
How will I look in front of my men after this?

209
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,879
How am I supposed to get by?

210
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,080
These brothers,

211
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,200
once they leave this door,

212
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,759
I can't control them anymore.

213
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,440
How about this,

214
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,639
I'll drink for them, problem solved.

215
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,440
It's just a drink, right?

216
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,159
That's the officer showing us respect.

217
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,799
I'll drink it.

218
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,480
Here.

219
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,039
I'll drink for her.

220
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:40,840
Caifeng.

221
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,840
Alright.

222
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,960
I have to give Madam some respect.

223
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,679
Let's let the drinking incident go.

224
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,159
Okay.

225
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,759
But—

226
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,799
Commander Liu.

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,639
His birthday is coming up soon.

228
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,759
I can't even get an opera troupe for him.

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,480
How am I supposed to explain this when I go back?

230
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,159
How about this?

231
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,440
I—

232
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,120
I'll set up a few special tables then.

233
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,759
Invite Commander Liu and his men.

234
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,679
Alright, alright.

235
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,519
That's for later.

236
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,440
That Xu guy—

237
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,000
Had a couple shots of horse piss.

238
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,919
Now he doesn't even know what he's doing.

239
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,519
Really?

240
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't push your luck.

241
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,399
Get lost.

242
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,919
Tell Commander Liu—

243
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,879
If he's not happy,

244
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,720
let's see whose gun is tougher.

245
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,559
Fine.

246
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,039
Today,

247
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,360
I'm here on behalf of Commander Liu.

248
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,759
To support Second Master Tang.

249
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
Since

250
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,399
Commander Guo and Second Master Tang

251
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,600
aren't giving Commander Liu any respect,

252
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,000
Brothers,

253
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,320
we'll just accept it.

254
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,039
Right?

255
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,759
We'll see about that in the future.

256
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,120
Brothers,

257
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,679
Let's go.

258
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,559
Take care, Deputy Xu.

259
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,440
You all carry on.

260
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,519
Thank you, Second Master Tang.

261
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,360
Everyone,

262
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,679
eat and drink as you please.

263
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,159
Sorry about that.

264
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,720
Sorry.

265
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,639
Come on.

266
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,399
Band leader,

267
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,799
please.

268
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,080
Grasshopper.

269
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,840
He really thinks he's a lobster.

270
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,240
They're all here just to stir up trouble.

271
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,639
Running this restaurant—

272
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,799
a lot of people are jealous.

273
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,279
Good thing Commander Guo was here.

274
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,320
Otherwise, today would've been hard to handle.

275
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,320
We're family, don't be polite.

276
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,639
Chief Xiao's business

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,960
is my business too.

278
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,559
Thank you.

279
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,879
Thanks.

280
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,480
Let's go upstairs.

281
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,960
I'll have a few more drinks with you two.

282
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,159
Let's go.

283
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,639
Close the door.

284
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:14,720
What's wrong?

285
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,960
Boss,

286
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,919
Did I cause you trouble?

287
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,360
No, you didn't.

288
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,840
I know.

289
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
Those people are all about guns.

290
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,440
They're not easy to deal with.

291
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,320
But I invited the opera troupe.

292
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,320
I can't just stand by

293
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,039
and watch them get bullied.

294
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,679
Of course we can't let them be bullied.

295
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't understand these social situations.

296
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,480
You need to teach me more.

297
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,799
I promise I won't do this again.

298
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
From now on, I'll listen to you in everything.

299
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:39,799
Is that okay?

300
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,559
You said it.

301
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,639
Alright then.

302
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,960
No more drinking that kind of liquor.

303
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,240
I know.

304
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,279
You know, but you still drink it.

305
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,960
I just craved the taste.

306
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,519
You're driving me crazy.

307
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,360
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

308
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,919
Section Chief Zhao.

309
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,080
I've conveyed Director Xiao's message.

310
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,320
It's not convenient to stay long.

311
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,120
So I don't hold up

312
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,240
Boss Tang's business.

313
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,240
No,

314
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,200
you're actually

315
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
the real God of Wealth here.

316
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,399
Without your permission,

317
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,480
who would dare open for business?

318
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,159
Right?

319
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,480
Are you mocking me?

320
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,320
No.

321
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,440
You're just the section chief for economics.

322
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,120
You only manage

323
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,879
iron pots, copper kettles, and small hardware.

324
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,879
Shovels, pokers, and ear picks.

325
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,200
Second Master Tang's big business

326
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,799
is out of our league.

327
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,399
Anyway,

328
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,720
from now on, business here

329
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,399
will need Section Chief Zhao's support.

330
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,879
I'll set up two tables next time

331
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,360
just to apologize to you.

332
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,600
No need for apologies.

333
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:41,720
Goodbye.

334
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,559
Take care.

335
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,159
Almost forgot.

336
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,039
Director Xiao said

337
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,200
he'll be waiting for you tonight.

338
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,279
He also said

339
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,720
the wind's strong lately, eat more pork skin.

340
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,440
And dress warmly.

341
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,159
Got it.

342
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,320
Finally got to eat here.

343
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,600
Who are you?

344
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,960
Boss Tang.

345
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
Slow down while eating.

346
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,080
Where did you come from?

347
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,320
From Congshan.

348
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,639
I was a bandit.

349
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,320
Had no choice.

350
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,240
Just trying to survive.

351
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,639
So why did you come down?

352
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,000
Couldn't stand up to the Japanese.

353
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,200
They attacked and tried to recruit us.

354
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,879
The bandits in Congshan couldn't last.

355
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,600
I hid in the mountains for two years.

356
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,399
But I just couldn't hold out anymore.

357
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,399
So I thought I'd come down and find a way out.

358
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,039
Begged my way into the city.

359
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,679
Haven't been here long.

360
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,000
I just wanted

361
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,919
to find some short-term work.

362
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,519
Fill my stomach.

363
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,080
But the Japanese are checking too strictly.

364
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,039
No one dares to hire me.

365
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,159
Every day I just

366
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,480
beg here, steal there.

367
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:16,960
Never thought

368
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,360
I'd end up stealing from you today.

369
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,440
How did I end up like this?

370
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,120
Boss Tang.

371
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,480
Looks like you've done well these years.

372
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,399
Life's been good for you.

373
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,759
You've got a solid background.

374
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,240
Built up such a big business.

375
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,759
This business

376
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,039
isn't something just anyone can do.

377
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,519
What are your plans next?

378
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,120
No plans.

379
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,600
Just taking it one step at a time.

380
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,879
Honestly, I never thought

381
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,039
I'd run into you today.

382
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,359
Boss Tang.

383
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,640
You gave me this meal.

384
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,559
I'm really grateful.

385
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,720
Don't worry.

386
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,759
I promise I won't cause you trouble.

387
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,039
I'll leave as soon as I'm full.

388
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
What are you saying?

389
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,440
It's pitch dark out.

390
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,279
Where would you go?

391
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
We've been through life and death together.

392
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,279
Did you forget?

393
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,240
Listen,

394
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,920
Stay here for now.

395
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:26,680
Remember,

396
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,000
as long as I have food,

397
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,039
you'll never go hungry.

398
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,440
No matter how long this war lasts,

399
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,599
victory

400
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,599
will definitely be ours.

401
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
If anyone

402
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
can make it out alive,

403
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:30,920
head straight

404
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,359
to Mudanjiang,

405
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,039
Songlin Town,

406
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,039
to the eight pine trees north of town.

407
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:36,759
Find

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,799
the thickest

409
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,279
and tallest pine tree.

410
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,000
Carve your number

411
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,200
onto it.

412
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,400
Then in Songlin Town,

413
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,119
hide yourself well.

414
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,240
Wait for regrouping.

415
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,880
As long as I, Old Shandong,

416
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,839
have a breath left,

417
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,200
I'll lead everyone back to the team.

418
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,599
Let me tell you,

419
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,160
you've been inside too long.

420
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,279
You don't know what it's like outside.

421
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,359
Now out here,

422
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,480
it's all under the Imperial Army's control.

423
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,519
The Anti-Japanese Allied Forces?

424
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,960
They're long gone.

425
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:26,839
Second Master,

426
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,839
sorry about this.

427
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:28,559
Here.

428
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,160
Alright.

429
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,440
Second Master, this bag of yours

430
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,359
must be

431
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,759
Chief Xiao's stuff, right?

432
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,640
Are you blind?

433
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,359
You don't even recognize Second Master Tang,

434
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,079
who comes here all the time?

435
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,279
Section Chief Zhao.

436
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,599
It's just the rules, no problem.

437
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,240
Come on, come on.

438
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:45,920
Here.

439
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,240
Let the brothers have a treat.

440
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,119
Thank you, Second Master.

441
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,279
Second Master Tang is always generous.

442
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,640
It's nothing, times are tough for everyone.

443
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,400
Alright, I'll head over.

444
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:52,920
Okay.

445
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,920
Thank you, Second Master.

446
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,599
Brother,

447
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
come on.

448
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,599
Wet your throat.

449
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,680
No rush.

450
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,480
I've brought all the gift money

451
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,400
over for you.

452
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,119
Gift money?

453
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,640
And

454
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
I turned all the gifts

455
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,039
into cash.

456
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,200
This

457
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:52,880
is the gift list.

458
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,920
Take a look.

459
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,039
Boss Tang sure has face.

460
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,440
Brother,

461
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,079
who are they here for?

462
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,200
You don't know?

463
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
Commander Liu,

464
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,119
about Vice Officer Xu's situation,

465
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,119
I want to apologize to you.

466
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,480
They said another share was added.

467
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,519
Morita went too.

468
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,400
Morita went too.

469
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,640
Didn't you notice?

470
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:20,279
Look,

471
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,200
he even gave a gift of money.

472
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,640
Boss Tian is actually Director Morita.

473
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,799
Here in Mudanjiang,

474
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,160
how many Boss Tians are there?

475
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,319
I didn't recognize him.

476
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,880
It's mainly because there were too many guests today.

477
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,759
It's fine.

478
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,680
Go ahead.

479
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,400
He can't find out anything anyway.

480
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,359
Nothing will come of it.

481
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,319
Don't worry.

482
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,160
Deyuan,

483
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,799
our restaurant

484
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,519
is finally thriving.

485
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,240
In all of Mudanjiang,

486
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,480
everyone knows

487
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,119
it's run by me, Xiao Tielin.

488
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,359
Take a look,

489
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,799
at these golden-yellow yellow croakers.

490
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:07,799
They're lively and fresh.

491
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,400
They came swimming right to you.

492
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,039
Come on, come on.

493
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
Work hard.

494
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,359
Brother,

495
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,920
That's a lot.

496
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
Take it.

497
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,680
Deyuan,

498
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,599
these times

499
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,039
are not like before.

500
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,000
We don't know how long the Japanese

501
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,240
can hold out.

502
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,359
While things are like this,

503
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,079
grab what you can.

504
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,519
Well then,

505
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,160
thank you, brother.

506
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,119
So,

507
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
how does it feel to touch the yellow croaker?

508
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,039
It's different, right?

509
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,079
It is.

510
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,440
Hurry up, hurry up!

511
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:17,400
Move faster!

512
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,200
Open up, make it lively, welcome the guests!

513
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,559
Everyone, show some spirit.

514
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,359
Bring out your energy.

515
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,759
Sir, please come inside.

516
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,200
Our restaurant is newly opened.

517
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
Whether business will prosper

518
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,200
depends on all of you.

519
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,559
I won't say much else.

520
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,759
If you work well,

521
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:48,599
money

522
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,640
won't be lacking.

523
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,400
Let's get started.

524
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,880
Let's begin!

525
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:55,400
Boss Lady,

526
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,839
what you just said

527
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,839
was really clear and straightforward.

528
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,880
Very open and bright.

529
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,000
Even the managers of century-old shops

530
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,440
can't compare to you.

531
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,079
Alright, let's get to work.

532
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,519
Get busy.

533
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,880
Brother Gao, are you awake?

534
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,200
Brother Gao,

535
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,519
I've been so busy this morning, I'm all confused.

536
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,119
I'm Tang Deyuan's wife.

537
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:28,880
My name is Caifeng.

538
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,119
Sister-in-law,

539
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,440
the boss

540
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,799
asked me to bring you a set of clothes.

541
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,799
They're newly bought.

542
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,240
I think you two are about the same size.

543
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,039
Both tall guys.

544
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,119
They should fit you well.

545
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:37,799
No, no, no.

546
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,119
No, sister-in-law, this...

547
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,599
No need to be polite.

548
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,640
Your old clothes

549
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,359
when you change out of them,

550
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,519
I'll have someone wash them for you.

551
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,440
Alright.

552
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,640
Sorry to trouble you, sister-in-law.

553
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,599
It's no trouble at all.

554
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,799
The boss said

555
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:48,960
since you're here at our home,

556
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,000
just rest and recover for a few days.

557
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,079
Don't worry about anything.

558
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
If you need anything, just let me know.

559
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,799
Alright, sister-in-law.

560
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,400
I'll head back to my room now.

561
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,839
Excuse me, make way please.

562
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,640
Make way.

563
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,000
Excuse me, make way please.

564
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,000
Move aside, move aside.

565
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,200
Take care.

566
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,960
Take care.

567
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,039
Sorry, sorry.

568
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,079
Young Master.

569
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,119
Young Master.

570
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,079
Don't chase me, don't chase me.

571
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,039
Careful, watch the steps.

572
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:36,680
Watch the steps.

573
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,119
You shouldn't play like that.

574
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:40,839
Kid.

575
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:41,640
Come here.

576
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,599
Come over here.

577
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,000
Mom, he's chasing me.

578
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,160
Thank you, Boss Lady.

579
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,599
I'll get back to work then.

580
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:50,960
Alright.

581
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,480
Were you being naughty again?

582
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:56,319
No.

583
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,640
Then why did you take that?

584
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,160
Sister-in-law.

585
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,920
Changed into it.

586
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,799
Fits well.

587
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,480
It fits.

588
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,400
Thank you.

589
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,079
This kid is so sturdy.

590
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,119
Just like Boss Tang.

591
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:08,440
Kid, say uncle.

592
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:09,319
Uncle.

593
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,200
Mom, I'm going to play now.

594
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,119
Alright, go ahead.

595
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,440
Don't be naughty again.

596
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,119
This kid is really good.

597
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:19,559
Sister-in-law.

598
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,559
Building such a big business with Boss Tang,

599
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:22,839
isn't easy.

600
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:24,480
It's alright.

601
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,920
Sister-in-law, where are you from?

602
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,400
Born in Phoenix Mountain.

603
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,559
It's almost noon.

604
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,920
I'll have the kitchen make a couple of dishes.

605
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,880
Don't bother, Sister-in-law.

606
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,240
No dietary restrictions, right?

607
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,279
None.

608
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,440
I eat anything, not picky.

609
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,319
That won't do.

610
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,599
The boss is busy right now.

611
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,759
But he gave special instructions.

612
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,880
He said you two

613
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,839
are sworn brothers.

614
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,480
You must be served the best.

615
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,319
Just wait a moment.

616
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,240
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

617
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,240
It'll be quick.

618
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,160
Stop.

619
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,359
What are you doing?

620
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,359
Where's your travel permit?

621
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,319
I'm delivering wine.

622
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:29,799
Inspection.

623
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,519
Don't poke holes in it.

624
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,839
How am I supposed to explain this to my boss?

625
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:39,920
It's real wine.

626
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,039
Go, go, go.

627
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,839
Hurry up.

628
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,960
Stop dawdling, move faster.

629
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,240
Where are you going?

630
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,440
Alright, enjoy your meal, take your time.

631
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,039
Serve another jar to Chairman Ma's table.

632
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:56,960
Bring another jar of wine.

633
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,640
Put it on my tab.

634
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Thank you, Second Master.

635
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,279
No need to thank me.

636
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:00,960
It's my duty.

637
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:15,880
Why did you come out here?

638
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,480
Just getting some fresh air.

639
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,039
This is what the provincial capital is like.

640
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,279
Everyone's eating well and drinking fine wine.

641
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,400
Downstairs, it's just

642
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,519
the lean season right now.

643
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,839
Let me put it this way.

644
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,920
Anyone dining here

645
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,599
isn't an ordinary person.

646
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,160
I can't afford to offend anyone.

647
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,119
No.

648
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,640
That outfit suits you.

649
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,480
No, it doesn't.

650
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,319
Why not?

651
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
The clothes are too fancy.

652
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,759
Doesn't fit a rough guy like me.

653
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,559
What are you trying to say?

654
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,319
Just say it.

655
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:47,920
I...

656
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:49,960
Boss.

657
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,759
Maybe I'll just wear this.

658
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,720
Since I'm here with you,

659
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,160
I can't just eat and drink for free.

660
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,440
I've done this job before.

661
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,400
I'll definitely do it well for you.

662
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,759
Go to the kitchen.

663
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,000
Alright.

664
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,000
Okay.

665
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,640
Sir, you've had enough to drink.

666
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,319
You're treating me to wine?

667
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,119
Take care, take care.

668
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,640
Alright.

669
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,119
I'll save your wine for you.

670
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,720
I'll take you to a good place.

671
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,839
Hope you enjoyed your meal, sir.

672
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,799
Take care.

673
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:24,759
Take care.

674
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,920
There are people everywhere on the streets.

675
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,000
Police and secret agents.

676
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,880
Mudanjiang is bigger than before.

677
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,720
It’s expanded quite a bit.

678
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,200
Those are all Japanese.

679
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Newly built houses.

680
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,119
There are also puppet army checkpoints.

681
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,079
Every main street has them.

682
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,240
I roughly counted.

683
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,359
There must be dozens of them.

684
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,640
How’s the police station area?

685
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,160
I pretended to be a wine delivery guy.

686
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,079
No one stopped me.

687
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,359
But I didn’t dare get too close.

688
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,680
I just took a look from afar.

689
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,960
That Mudanjiang police station,

690
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,319
It was complicated even before.

691
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,839
After the Japanese came,

692
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,440
They added another wall outside.

693
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,000
Now, I think,

694
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,720
Even a fly can’t get in.

695
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,599
If we want to get in,

696
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,759
It’ll be really tough.

697
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,359
These days,

698
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,000
I’ve been wandering the streets too.

699
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,799
I even followed a few puppet police.

700
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,200
Wanted to see

701
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,400
where they like to go.

702
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,039
But those places,

703
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,799
I didn’t see

704
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,880
any sign of Xiao Tielin.

705
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,880
That guy really doesn’t leave home.

706
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,039
Not even a step outside.

707
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,799
Looks like if we want to get close to him,

708
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,480
we’ll have to rely on Deyuan.

709
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,079
What about Yunhu?

710
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,240
Why isn’t he back yet?

711
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,880
You know,

712
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,160
if Yunhu can stay at Deyuan’s place,

713
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,079
and settle down there,

714
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,240
that’s a good thing.

715
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,720
Hope when Yunhu comes back,

716
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,759
he brings Boss Tang back too.

717
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,279
Band master,

718
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,400
please.

719
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,799
Drums beat at midnight.

720
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,759
It’s the middle of the night.

721
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,440
Liu Jinchan is upstairs.

722
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,559
She calls for her maid.

723
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,279
Come, come.

724
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,240
Hurry up.

725
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,960
Above the main street,

726
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,839
bring the lanterns to see.

727
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,000
The maid walks ahead.

728
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,440
Miss Liu Jinchan follows behind.

729
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,519
One in front, one behind, moving quickly.

730
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,799
The main street is just ahead.

731
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,160
Remember Liu Jinchan.

732
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,400
Let’s leave that aside for now.

733
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,079
Let’s hear from Li Bao.

734
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,880
Li Bao isn’t slacking off here.

735
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,000
What happened just now?

736
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,759
What do you mean?

737
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,680
You tell me.

738
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,799
Ran into an old acquaintance.

739
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,640
An old flame?

740
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:23,960
These past two years,

741
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,759
have I been too nice to you?

742
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,279
Are you asking for trouble?

743
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,400
Daring to boss me around now?

744
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,799
No, I wouldn’t dare.

745
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,160
I really wouldn’t dare.

746
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,160
Wouldn’t dare ask, Miss.

747
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Who was that acquaintance?

748
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,759
May I ask where they live?

749
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,039
And which county?

750
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,559
Why did Miss go to see the lanterns?

751
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,480
Didn’t see them all?

752
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,720
See your head, more like.

753
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,640
He’s just a jinx.

754
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:47,519
Better not mention him.

755
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,480
You miss me,

756
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,839
in the middle of the night,

757
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,960
and play the zither.

758
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,759
That rich guy from Songlin Town,

759
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,519
do you still remember?

760
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:06,440
What happened?

761
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
Such a charming rich guy.

762
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,199
Always kept the door open for him.

763
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,079
Almost wanted to give him everything.

764
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:12,840
But look at him,

765
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,119
didn’t want the person or the money.

766
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,599
Left the rich guy and ran off.

767
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,159
So if he didn’t want this or that,

768
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,840
what did he want?

769
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:21,280
No idea.

770
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,480
Judging by his attitude,

771
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,039
he probably joined the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

772
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,199
Otherwise my sister

773
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,599
wouldn’t still be thinking about him.

774
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,880
If you ever treat me like this again,

775
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,360
just watch what I do to your arms and legs.

776
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,599
I'll break them for sure.

777
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,280
You pinched my thigh, it's all bruised.

778
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,880
If you break them, how am I supposed to play the fiddle?

779
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:45,800
I take care of you.

780
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,559
Who's taking care of who?

781
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,079
I'm taking care of you!

782
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,280
Damn fiddler, you—

783
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
What are you two doing?

784
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,400
Auntie.

785
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,360
Boss lady, what's up?

786
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,280
Any orders?

787
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,639
It's time to go on stage, hurry up.

788
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,840
It really hurts.

789
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,519
Hurts my ass.

790
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,480
Quit showing off.

791
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,599
Go, get out there and perform.

792
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:03,039
Zaor.

793
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:06,000
Why did you just call her auntie?

794
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,480
I'm used to calling her that.

795
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,159
It slipped out.

796
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,119
Don't let it slip halfway through.

797
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,280
Tell me what's going on.

798
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,159
Seven prostitutes, eight actors, nine musicians.

799
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:17,840
Do you get it?

800
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,719
We're actors.

801
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,519
So by the rules,

802
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,719
we have to call her auntie.

803
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,239
From the brothel.

804
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,119
You—

805
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Keep your voice down.

806
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,039
She doesn't do that anymore.

807
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,000
So you can't call her that now.

808
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,440
But you used to

809
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,000
play the horn for funerals.

810
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,440
By the rules,

811
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:35,719
you should call me auntie too.

812
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,599
Call you auntie?

813
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,360
What?

814
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,679
Call me auntie.

815
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,400
Auntie.

816
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,400
What auntie?

817
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,000
It's time to go on stage.

818
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:41,719
Little auntie.

819
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:00,679
I'm back.

820
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:05,800
Going to sleep.

821
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,119
I'm going to wash up.

822
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:12,639
Boss.

823
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,199
Your brother came to join you.

824
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,199
Why'd you put him to work in the kitchen?

825
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,079
What's wrong with that?

826
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,679
Am I supposed to support him?

827
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,320
I, Tang Deyuan, never support freeloaders.

828
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,920
By the way,

829
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,320
business at the restaurant is good now.

830
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,400
Later, put up

831
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
the hiring sign outside.

832
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,800
From now on, if you see anyone

833
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
slacking off or being lazy,

834
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,280
let them go.

835
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,239
Alright, I'll do as you say.

836
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,360
Put it here, put it here.

837
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:50,840
Alright.

838
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:53,719
A little to the right.

839
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,400
Alright.

840
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:55,960
Okay, okay, that's good.

841
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:56,519
It's good.

842
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:11,920
Teacher

843
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Today's performance seems different from usual.

844
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:20,039
Around the fortifications in Suifenhe,

845
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,159
we've also confirmed their traces.

846
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,440
There's no doubt.

847
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:31,199
Their target is our military stronghold.

848
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,519
I've already reported to my superiors.

849
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,599
I don't care about other areas.

850
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,360
The "migrating fish" in Mudanjiang

851
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,760
must be found as soon as possible.

852
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,679
My men have already set up

853
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,519
checkpoints and mobile patrols in and around Mudanjiang.

854
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,800
They've also checked all the inns.

855
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,320
No suspicious people have been found so far.

856
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,079
When Matsushima Kuma was assassinated last time,

857
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,119
the gun, the location, the retreat—

858
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
it was all planned.

859
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,440
One person couldn't have done it alone.

860
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,760
I've already investigated the place

861
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,400
where Matsushima Kuma was killed.

862
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Someone there spotted

863
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,920
a person resembling our target.

864
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,239
This person used to be

865
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
an employee at Dayou Trading Company.

866
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,480
By the time my men arrived,

867
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,880
that person was already gone.

868
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,719
The owner had changed too.

869
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,679
They said the original owner

870
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:17,119
had already left Mudanjiang.

871
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,239
It's now renamed Xinyi Trading Company.

872
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:22,719
In other words,

873
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,440
this trading company

874
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,320
could be an underground station for the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

875
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,800
They'll come back.

876
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,320
Keep watching that place patiently.

877
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,079
Yes.

878
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,599
That's also

879
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,480
why I chose to work in secret.

880
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,280
In the face of war,

881
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,599
a single valuable piece of intelligence

882
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,119
can be worth an entire division.

883
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,800
It can even decide the outcome of the war.

884
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,400
Yes.

885
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:50,400
I understand.

886
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,440
So,

887
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,039
what about Tang Deyuan?

888
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,760
Recently, they've used the police station's rationing rights

889
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,239
to open a new restaurant.

890
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,199
In my view,

891
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,360
Xiao Tielin is a parasite of the Manchukuo government.

892
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Tang Deyuan is his accomplice.

893
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,239
They only care about money.

894
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,400
Are there any new faces around him?

895
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,039
Tang Deyuan is very cunning.

896
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,480
Since opening, he often hires and replaces staff.

897
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
There are always new faces coming and going.

898
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,559
So it's very hard to investigate.

899
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:25,480
What?

900
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,880
What an interesting opponent.

901
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,159
Teacher

902
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,000
Please give me a little more time.

903
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,480
Don't rush, Morita.

904
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,679
If there are fish,

905
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,000
they'll bite the hook for sure.

906
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,039
Find someone who used to be in the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces

907
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,360
and send him to Tang's restaurant to test the waters.

908
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:48,679
Yes.

909
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:10,840
Kid

910
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Stay at the door.

911
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,880
Don't wander off too far.

912
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,840
Okay.

913
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,000
Hey, kid.

914
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,079
I'm thirsty.

915
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,480
Can I

916
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,559
get a drink of water at your house?

917
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,000
Thank you.

918
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:42,840
You're welcome.

919
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,119
Kid

920
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,559
Dad

921
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,400
What's going on?

922
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,800
Second Master

923
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,960
This guest got thirsty while walking

924
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,559
and asked for a bowl of water.

925
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,880
Here.

926
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,280
Take the kid

927
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,079
out to play for a while.

928
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,079
Okay.

929
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,280
Go on, go play outside.

930
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:08,880
Let's go.

931
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:09,840
Come on, kid, let's go.

932
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:15,840
Are you

933
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:17,760
Second Master

934
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,039
Please have mercy

935
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,239
I'm hurt

936
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,519
There are police checking outside

937
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:25,440
Can you

938
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:26,960
let me hide here?

939
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,480
Where are you hurt?

940
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,360
My leg

941
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:33,559
Come

942
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,360
Sit down, sit down

943
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,079
That's a gunshot wound

944
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,480
What do you really do?

945
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,639
Let me tell you

946
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:56,199
If you don't tell the truth in times like these

947
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,320
no one can save you

948
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,800
I'm with the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces
