1
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,519
Papers.

2
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,480
Get in.

3
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Move it.

4
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,400
Get in.

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,879
Hurry.

6
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:02,879
What are you doing?

7
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:03,879
Brother.

8
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,519
I've got a big deal for you.

9
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:05,959
Interested?

10
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:06,840
What deal?

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,080
Let's go.

12
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,000
Move.

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm just delivering vegetables.

14
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,280
What vegetables?

15
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,240
Hey, what are you doing?

16
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:26,840
Move it!

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,639
Just making up the numbers.

18
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,879
Making up numbers? What do you mean?

19
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,639
Move, move, move!

20
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,120
Everyone, listen up.

21
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,039
You all,

22
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,960
just need to cooperate with the investigation.

23
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,240
If there's nothing wrong,

24
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,680
you'll be released.

25
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,560
Don't be afraid.

26
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,800
Everyone, listen to me.

27
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,039
You're just going back

28
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,199
for some questioning.

29
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,639
Just cooperate.

30
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,759
If there's no problem,

31
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,400
you'll be let go.

32
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,039
Don't be scared.

33
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,039
Move, move, move!

34
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,240
Hurry up, move!

35
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,280
Faster.

36
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,439
Cooperate, you hear me?

37
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
If nothing's wrong, you'll be released.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,000
Move, move, move!

39
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Don't be afraid.

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,280
Just cooperate.

41
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,360
Cooperate, cooperate.

42
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,159
Brother.

43
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,280
Second Master Tang.

44
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,360
What's going on here?

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,199
Catching communists.

46
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,719
Sorry, Second Master.

47
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,199
Well...

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
You'll have to wait a bit.

49
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,120
Sorry for delaying you.

50
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,680
It's fine.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,800
You.

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,439
Liu Laosi.

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
Second Master.

54
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,199
What are you looking at? Come here.

55
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm talking to you. What are you staring at?

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,840
Come here, come here.

57
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,560
Come on, over here.

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
Second Master, Second Master.

59
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,680
What are you doing here?

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,439
The boss sent me west to get supplies.

61
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,360
Said it's cheaper there.

62
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,680
What east or west?

63
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,199
The restaurant's waiting for your delivery.

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
I-I didn't know.

65
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,480
He's the restaurant delivery guy.

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,120
Forget it.

67
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,920
Take him away.

68
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,680
We don't need him.

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,600
No, no, please!

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,199
Second Master, Second Master!

71
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,279
Come in, come in.

72
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,839
Why are you standing there? Get in!

73
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,279
Alright, alright.

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,120
Let him come over.

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,639
Let him come.

76
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,319
Come here.

77
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,519
This way, this way.

78
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,600
Come closer this way.

79
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,759
Okay, okay.

80
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,839
Hurry up.

81
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,720
You're holding up the kitchen.

82
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,639
I'll deal with you later.

83
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,399
Second Master.

84
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,439
Second Master, calm down.

85
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,480
Calm down, calm down.

86
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm so mad.

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,879
It's fine, it's fine.

88
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,120
Alright, brother.

89
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,439
Thank you.

90
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,560
I'll call a few buddies next time.

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,639
We'll have a feast at my place.

92
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,279
Thanks.

93
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
Thank you, Second Master.

94
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,560
Seal the vehicle.

95
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,720
No more bets, no more bets.

96
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,680
Big, big.

97
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,519
No more bets, no more bets.

98
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,560
Three, four, five. Big.

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,439
Big.

100
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,480
No more bets, no more bets.

101
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,560
Second Master Tang.

102
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,920
The restaurant business was doing so well.

103
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,279
Why quit all of a sudden?

104
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,079
No choice.

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,079
Running a restaurant ties you down.

106
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,680
Can't do any other business.

107
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,040
Does Director Xiao know?

108
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,920
Of course he knows.

109
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,600
Got it.

110
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,040
Well then.

111
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,120
Second Master.

112
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,519
What price do you want?

113
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,519
This restaurant is just a bunch of

114
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,920
tables and chairs.

115
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
At your price,

116
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,120
five gold bars?

117
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,920
That's asking way too much.

118
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:00,399
Fine.

119
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,079
Might as well ask for more.

120
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I'll give you fifty.

121
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,839
Boss Shao.

122
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,920
If that's how we're talking,

123
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,680
then you'll have to talk to my brother yourself.

124
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,800
Alright then.

125
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,160
Old Shao,

126
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,120
I've thought it over.

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,519
The Mudanjiang opium share,

128
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,079
I can give you a portion.

129
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,399
The goods still in the Xiaye River warehouse,

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,399
I can give you those too.

131
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,279
But the price

132
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
won't be what you said.

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
Not that price anymore.

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,600
So how much do you want?

135
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
It's not expensive.

136
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,399
Just double it.

137
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,279
They call me Black Shao,

138
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,519
but in all of Mudanjiang,

139
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,759
your brother Xiao Tielin is the most ruthless.

140
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,960
What are you doing here?

141
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,759
Hurry back inside.

142
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,679
Go inside.

143
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,320
Get in, now.

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,320
What was that gunfire outside just now?

145
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,120
What does the gunfire have to do with you?

146
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,320
Get inside.

147
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,080
I'm telling you,

148
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,960
stay put in the house.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,679
Don't wander around.

150
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,200
Wait.

151
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,200
What really happened?

152
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,480
Is it about Old Platoon Leader

153
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,279
and his people?

154
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,799
How would I know?

155
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,720
You definitely know.

156
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,759
I just saw them arresting people.

157
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,039
Did they arrest Old Platoon Leader and his group?

158
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,320
That's right.

159
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,000
They really are arresting people.

160
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,559
They're arresting communists now.

161
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,080
And the resistance too.

162
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,879
You want to get caught too?

163
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,000
Didn't you want to rejoin the unit?

164
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,519
Aren't you with the resistance too?

165
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,559
Yes.

166
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,200
Yes.

167
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,399
I am.

168
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,240
Then what are you?

169
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,600
What am I?

170
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,759
Anyway, I'm not on your side.

171
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:43,720
Over there.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,440
Let's go.

173
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,120
Old Lu, hurry!

174
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,200
Quickly!

175
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,120
Hurry!

176
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,279
Come.

177
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,399
Come on.

178
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,840
Come, everyone, have a seat.

179
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,320
Old Lu.

180
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,879
Tell me,

181
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,639
what exactly happened today?

182
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,200
Instructor Wang.

183
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,840
At first, I was observing in the teahouse.

184
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,480
There was no ambush inside.

185
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,759
Those people from the police station

186
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,639
were definitely following Comrade Wanchun

187
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,960
and the others here.

188
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,559
This is my responsibility.

189
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,759
I didn't notice

190
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,559
we were being tailed.

191
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,279
Comrade Wanchun

192
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,840
covered our escape with his life.

193
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,039
We can't let his sacrifice be in vain.

194
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,840
At the teahouse,

195
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,039
after meeting with Comrade Wanchun,

196
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,799
Morita suddenly showed up.

197
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,639
We were even discussing

198
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,840
whether to take the chance

199
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,039
and take him out.

200
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,480
But then,

201
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:08,879
Li Zhenghao

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,320
Yes.

203
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,480
Comrade Li Zhenghao

204
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,480
acted first.

205
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,679
It was him, I saw it myself.

206
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,080
It was a coincidence.

207
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,320
Comrade Li Zhenghao

208
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,440
was following our original plan

209
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,679
and had been tracking Morita recently.

210
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,679
Today,

211
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,159
he followed Morita

212
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,200
all the way to the teahouse.

213
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,759
He realized the ones being followed

214
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,559
were actually you.

215
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,480
There was no time to report.

216
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,600
To cover your escape,

217
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,440
Comrade Li Zhenghao fired his gun.

218
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,279
What about him?

219
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,480
Did he get away?

220
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,720
He got away.

221
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,720
Given what happened today,

222
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,159
you've definitely been exposed.

223
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,080
This place

224
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,120
is the backup spot

225
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
I mentioned to you before.

226
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,759
You can

227
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,240
stay here for now.

228
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,799
Also,

229
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,840
for the time being,

230
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,759
it's best you don't show yourselves.

231
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,200
Especially

232
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,480
don't go to Tang Deyuan's restaurant again.

233
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,679
As for Tang Deyuan,

234
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,440
Instructor Wang,

235
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,879
I only escaped this time

236
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,840
thanks to Tang Deyuan.

237
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,639
I think we have a good chance

238
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,360
of winning him over, right?

239
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,679
Yes, yes, Instructor Wang.

240
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,919
Although

241
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,320
this is a good sign,

242
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,799
in this situation,

243
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,600
we all need to be extra cautious.

244
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:31,639
Especially

245
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,679
with people like Tang Deyuan.

246
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,919
We must be even more careful.

247
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,120
We can't risk other comrades' lives

248
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,320
just to win him over.

249
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,919
No unnecessary risks.

250
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,960
Comrades,

251
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,200
if Tang Deyuan

252
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,240
gets in the way of our mission,

253
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,360
you know what to do.

254
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,120
Instructor Wang.

255
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,360
Old Lu.

256
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,399
When it comes to the mission,

257
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,480
we can't let emotions get in the way.

258
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,480
If it really comes to that,

259
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,480
and you can't do it,

260
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,679
we have other comrades who will.

261
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,519
Yunhu

262
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,279
Before Comrade Wanchun sacrificed himself,

263
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,360
he entrusted you with something.

264
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,480
Report it to the instructor.

265
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,519
Comrade Wanchun said before he died

266
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,879
that he had already set up

267
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,240
a new liaison station in Songlin Town.

268
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,960
As long as we get

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,639
the codebook from the Central Committee in Yan'an

270
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
that was given to us,

271
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,879
we can let the Mudanjiang area

272
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,480
Anti-Japanese forces connect directly with Yan'an.

273
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,440
Establish direct contact.

274
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,480
Songlin Town

275
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,799
must be visited.

276
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,559
But today's events

277
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,039
have drawn a lot of attention.

278
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,399
I'll send

279
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,600
members from another group.

280
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,759
Instructor,

281
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm familiar with the situation in Songlin Town.

282
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,399
I know it well.

283
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,440
Let me go.

284
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,799
I promise to complete the mission.

285
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,519
Squad Leader

286
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,320
It's late, why aren't you sleeping yet?

287
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:33,799
Is it because

288
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,399
the instructor mentioned Second Master Tang?

289
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,120
Are you still bothered by it?

290
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,600
Not entirely.

291
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,039
Then what's wrong?

292
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,440
I've got a knot in my heart.

293
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,720
I can't untangle it.

294
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,960
Honestly, I've got a knot too.

295
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,159
You go first.

296
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,159
What's your knot about?

297
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,000
Xiao Gui.

298
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,720
And you?

299
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,640
That's quite a coincidence.

300
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,480
Mudanjiang is so big,

301
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,000
yet when we went to see Second Master Tang,

302
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,000
he showed up right at that moment.

303
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,720
He appeared.

304
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,279
How about this?

305
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,160
Before I leave,

306
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,480
I'll go see Xiao Gui.

307
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,960
No, no, no.

308
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,240
Let me go see him instead.

309
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,359
Alright.

310
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,119
Um...

311
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,880
About Xiao Gui,

312
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,440
don't tell Fuqing yet.

313
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,480
Got it, got it.

314
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,240
On this trip back to Songlin Town,

315
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,079
be careful with everything.

316
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,720
Finish the task and come back right away.

317
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,200
Alright.

318
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,319
Don't worry.

319
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,000
Go get some sleep.

320
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,000
You're still up?

321
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,079
Sleep, sleep.

322
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,240
Go to bed early.

323
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,559
Watch the heat.

324
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Don't let the soup boil dry.

325
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,079
Alright.

326
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:07,839
You're recovering well.

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,839
A few more times,

328
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,279
and you can walk without the cane.

329
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,200
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

330
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,839
I'll never forget your kindness.

331
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,319
Get some good rest.

332
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,319
I'll head out now.

333
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,279
Victory to the holy war!

334
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,799
Dear listeners,

335
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,559
the glory of the Empire of Japan

336
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,799
is shining over East Asia.

337
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
A major victory.

338
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,440
On May 5th,

339
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,000
in the southern occupied area of Okinawa,

340
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,000
the US forces defeated the Japanese commander

341
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,160
Ushijima's large-scale counterattack.

342
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,559
In one day,

343
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,680
the Japanese army lost about 5,000 men.

344
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,359
All tanks were destroyed.

345
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:56,519
Come in.

346
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:01,759
Director.

347
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,200
The Imperial Army's Military Police are here.

348
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:05,680
How many came?

349
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,640
Three.

350
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:07,759
Got it.

351
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:08,440
Go ahead.

352
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,039
Yes.

353
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,960
Sir.

354
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,880
Hello.

355
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,079
Morita Saburo has died in the line of duty.

356
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,400
While on duty.

357
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,319
Sir.

358
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,440
Everyone here mourns deeply.

359
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:42,839
Director Morita.

360
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,480
Morita's belongings—

361
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,799
Has anyone touched them?

362
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,039
No.

363
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,319
I've ordered

364
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,880
no one is allowed near

365
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,400
Director Morita's office.

366
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,319
Good.

367
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,680
You're not needed here anymore.

368
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,319
Sir, take care.

369
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,599
You're not needed here either.

370
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,319
Yes.

371
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,680
Captain Hayaki

372
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,359
Please take a look at this.

373
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,519
And this one too.

374
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,640
Opium.

375
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,720
Who did you get this from?

376
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,319
Where did it come from?

377
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,839
Director Xiao sold it privately.

378
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,599
Besides opium,

379
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,279
there are other supplies as well.

380
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,400
Anything controlled by the police station,

381
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,839
he sells some of it on the side.

382
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,720
He lines his own pockets.

383
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,119
These pieces of evidence

384
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,720
should have been handed over

385
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,839
to Director Morita.

386
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,119
But I didn't expect the director, he...

387
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,240
You.

388
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,160
What's your name?

389
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,480
Zhao Qingtian.

390
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,359
Mudanjiang Police Station.

391
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,000
Chief of the Economic Security Division.

392
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,720
Selling off the Empire's

393
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,319
important controlled supplies.

394
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,480
You.

395
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,200
Chief of the Economic Security Division.

396
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:51,559
This is a serious dereliction of duty.

397
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,400
I admit my fault.

398
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:55,599
But...

399
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,839
But these matters

400
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,880
Director Morita also knew about them.

401
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,599
It's just that...

402
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,119
Director Xiao

403
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
has people above him.

404
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,720
I don't dare to interfere.

405
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,119
Salute.

406
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,039
At ease.

407
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,119
Sir.

408
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,400
Please take care.

409
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,279
Soon,

410
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,519
someone will take over

411
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,160
Morita's duties.

412
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,079
The glasses suit you well.

413
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,160
Thank you very much.

414
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,400
Before that,

415
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,839
you are responsible for Director Xiao's safety.

416
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,720
If anything happens,

417
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,480
you'll be dealt with by military law.

418
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,599
Do you understand?

419
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:51,799
Yes.

420
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,640
Let's go back.

421
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,200
Dismissed.

422
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,200
Go on, go on, everyone leave.

423
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:13,799
Director.

424
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,319
Not bad.

425
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,319
You've climbed up high.

426
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
I wouldn't dare.

427
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,720
Is there anything you wouldn't dare?

428
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,680
Good thing you're a man.

429
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,759
If you were a woman,

430
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,359
you could even get close to the Japanese Emperor.

431
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:32,759
Director.

432
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,599
You really know how to joke.

433
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,039
Come, come, please, please.

434
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:36,799
Come on.

435
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:46,960
Director.

436
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:48,799
Please.

437
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,799
Xiao Wuzi.

438
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,519
This Zhao Qingtian

439
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,519
is no good.

440
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,559
Tell me,

441
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:29,279
did he go stir up trouble?

442
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,200
Deyuan.

443
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,359
Come over here.

444
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,880
Deyuan.

445
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:02,720
Brother.

446
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,000
You called me, what's up?

447
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,920
Zhao Qingtian is up to no good.

448
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,279
He went to the gendarmerie

449
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,079
and reported me.

450
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,079
See, I told you.

451
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,640
He's no good.

452
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,920
The problem is,

453
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,599
he's not clean himself.

454
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,160
Yeah.

455
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,759
He just thinks there's not enough profit.

456
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,759
He found a chance to go against me.

457
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,200
So what do we do?

458
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,720
He wants to take you down,

459
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,920
but he's still too green.

460
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,720
But now Morita is dead.

461
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,200
The military police came knocking.

462
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,759
And with Zhao Qingtian stirring things up,

463
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,880
always jumping around,

464
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,680
those Japanese keep a close eye on you.

465
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,119
Wouldn't they watch you even more closely?

466
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,400
Just look.

467
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,519
It's not like this just started.

468
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,000
I just don't get it, brother.

469
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,640
You're the director.

470
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,279
Why do they keep watching you?

471
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,759
My dear brother,

472
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,680
as for me being director,

473
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,200
don't you get it yet?

474
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,200
It's just a title.

475
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,920
We have to listen to the deputy director.

476
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,920
And the deputy director is Japanese.

477
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,880
Isn't it always like this around here?

478
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,799
But on the other hand,

479
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,599
if I wanted to leave,

480
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,039
no one could stop me.

481
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,480
I just don't want to go out.

482
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,880
If I stay here,

483
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,759
the Japanese feel secure,

484
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,400
and so do I.

485
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:54,079
So you just don't want to leave?

486
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,559
Why?

487
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:01,039
Your brother's done too many bad things.

488
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,960
If I step outside,

489
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,640
it's easy to dodge open attacks, but hidden ones are deadly.

490
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,519
Not to mention anything else,

491
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,240
just look at my hands,

492
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,640
covered in blood.

493
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,000
It's enough to drown you.

494
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:14,240
That's right.

495
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,480
If I end up dead in the street,

496
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,519
what would you do?

497
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,079
This is my smokescreen.

498
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,839
Honestly, it's my way to stay alive.

499
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,599
Brother, to be honest,

500
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,519
this trick of yours

501
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
might save you for now, but not forever.

502
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,359
If the Japanese really leave,

503
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,359
what will you do?

504
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,279
You think

505
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,799
this is my only way to survive?

506
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,559
I've got several tricks up my sleeve.

507
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,200
Oh my!

508
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,039
I didn't expect that, brother.

509
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,319
You've got so many tricks.

510
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,880
That's Director Xiao for you.

511
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,240
Enough talk, let's drop it.

512
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,319
Let me tell you,

513
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,279
don't say I don't look out for you.

514
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,559
Times are really tough now.

515
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,160
If we can sell the restaurant, do it quickly.

516
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,400
If you have any ideas,

517
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,720
just tell me directly.

518
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,559
I have no ideas.

519
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,519
The restaurant is yours anyway.

520
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,920
If you want to sell, let's sell.

521
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,079
Alright.

522
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,839
Good, then.

523
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,519
Let me tell you,

524
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
as long as the money's in your pocket,

525
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,000
even if the sky falls,

526
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,319
it won't matter to us.

527
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,359
That's right.

528
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,119
I'll head to Baoju now.

529
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,119
Talk to Boss Shao

530
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,279
and settle the restaurant business.

531
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,559
Are you stupid?

532
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,599
That restaurant isn't worth much.

533
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,200
They'll be here soon to play cards.

534
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,839
Right in front of them,

535
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,160
I'll put my local shop, opium shop,

536
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,039
official and private deals, everything,

537
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,200
all together in one pot.

538
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,160
Director Xiao,

539
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,920
my offer isn't low.

540
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:31,640
Is it high?

541
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,079
Isn't it high?

542
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,400
Your Baoju business

543
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,119
can't compare to mine.

544
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,640
It's way behind.

545
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,799
Isn't there a saying?

546
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,359
When the opium lamp is lit,

547
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,720
gold flows in.

548
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,119
Just do the math.

549
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,240
Let's close the deal as soon as possible.

550
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,079
That's more like it.

551
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,359
I see.

552
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,119
Later, I'll give you the leftover stock from the warehouse.

553
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,000
I'll hand it all over to you.

554
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,200
Thanks for everything.

555
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,640
But about the price, we need to—

556
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,559
Didn't we already agree on it?

557
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,960
It's all included in

558
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,599
the price of one hundred gold bars.

559
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:28,960
That's the transfer price.

560
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,799
You know,

561
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,480
you look pretty tough,

562
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,359
but why do you act so timid?

563
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,960
While you're hesitating,

564
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,319
from what I know,

565
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,559
they're about to raise the opium tax.

566
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,720
What?

567
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,880
Raise the opium tax?

568
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,200
Boss Shao,

569
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,079
this is from the Anti-Opium Bureau.

570
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,480
That's right.

571
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,519
Let me tell you,

572
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,400
it's an extra 1,500 yuan per tael.

573
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,240
Do the math.

574
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:01,759
You know how much stock I have.

575
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,079
You know that, right?

576
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,799
With this change,

577
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,759
wow, compared to before,

578
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,200
it's a huge difference.

579
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,200
When it comes to calculations,

580
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:21,400
no one beats you, Director Xiao.

581
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,000
Alright.

582
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,000
We'll go with your price.

583
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,640
That's right.

584
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,519
Deyuan,

585
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,319
handle this later.

586
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,880
Okay.

587
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,799
Also, the goods in the Xia Ye River warehouse—

588
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,839
count them up.

589
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,359
Hand them all over to Boss Shao.

590
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,680
What's wrong?

591
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,759
Got it.

592
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,319
Also,

593
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,640
I'll give you that restaurant too.

594
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,039
But you should show some appreciation.

595
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,599
That restaurant is managed by

596
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,519
Deyuan.

597
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,319
He runs it really well.

598
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:04,799
Right?

599
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,920
Director Xiao,

600
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,279
the restaurant means little to me,

601
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,559
it's just a pastime,

602
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,440
but

603
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,160
for your sake,

604
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,960
I'll definitely honor you and Brother Deyuan.

605
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,599
Let's make it a nice round number.

606
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,400
One hundred and twenty-eight bars.

607
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,039
Great, we're truly like family.

608
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,000
Commander Guo,

609
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,039
why are you just getting here?

610
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,480
Brother,

611
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,039
what do you mean "just getting here"?

612
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,119
Didn't you tell me

613
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,200
to come at this time?

614
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
I'm so busy over there,

615
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,599
I barely have time to breathe.

616
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So, what's up?

617
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,599
Why did you call us all here?

618
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,839
To bring some good luck.

619
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,319
Morita is dead.

620
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,559
Morita is really dead.

621
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,240
Looks like his time was up.

622
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,920
Even those above can't save themselves now.

623
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,760
It's that scoundrel again, isn't it?

624
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,119
A villain has really gotten his way.

625
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,679
One day, I'll strangle him myself.

626
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,480
But back to the point,

627
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,559
with Morita gone,

628
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:32,960
Director Xiao is much more relaxed.

629
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,360
If you have time,

630
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,039
come play a few rounds at my place.

631
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,079
At a time like this,

632
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,880
who would go out?

633
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,880
Only a fool would.

634
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,440
The deputy director is dead.

635
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Will they spare me, the director?

636
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,480
Makes sense.

637
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,000
Let's play.

638
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,960
You grown-ups are talking business.

639
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,599
I'm just—

640
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,760
out.

641
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,519
Nice setup, come on.

642
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:41,480
Section Chief

643
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,119
Mudanjiang area

644
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,199
These few from the 88th Brigade

645
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,679
are suspected

646
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,199
of having contacted people from Yan'an

647
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,039
and established a connection

648
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,559
This means

649
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,159
their major counterattack plan

650
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,840
now has a better chance of success

651
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:11,719
Section Chief

652
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,639
According to the latest intelligence

653
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,079
in recent years, the Communists from Yan'an

654
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,440
have been sending people to the Northeast

655
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,239
trying to establish the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

656
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,360
Their connection with Yan'an

657
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,280
The identity of Liu Banhu

658
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,440
has been further confirmed

659
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,400
Liu Banhu

660
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,719
came from Yan'an to Mudanjiang

661
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,840
to find the Communist members of the Anti-Japanese Army

662
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,599
Over two years ago, Liu Banhu

663
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,360
joined the Errenzhuan troupe

664
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,599
and has been with the troupe since

665
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,599
based around Songlin Town

666
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,039
performing in nearby towns

667
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,119
Songlin Town

668
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:40,599
Yes

669
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,440
the star of the Errenzhuan troupe

670
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,719
Xiao Hongzao

671
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,920
who is Liu Banhu's fiancée

672
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,280
is from Songlin Town

673
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:55,239
Why is it Songlin Town again?

674
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,800
All along

675
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,840
it's been the favorite gathering place

676
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,199
for the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army

677
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,639
Have the military police send a team

678
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,800
to wait outside Songlin Town

679
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:04,480
Yes

680
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,920
Those who escaped this time

681
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,159
their whereabouts

682
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:09,679
are there any leads?

683
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,800
The police and military police

684
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,880
have all been mobilized

685
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,599
across Mudanjiang

686
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,920
searching for their whereabouts

687
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,440
Loosen the net a bit

688
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,639
make them think Liu Banhu is dead

689
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,559
so they believe we've lost the trail

690
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,199
I want to know

691
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,000
what their specific mission

692
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,679
in Mudanjiang is

693
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,119
and who their commander is

694
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,239
I especially want those

695
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,559
who think our empire is

696
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,079
already exhausted to know

697
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,960
that although we've suffered setbacks

698
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,679
in some places

699
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,159
the warriors of the empire

700
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,119
will surely have the last laugh

701
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,679
Sir, where are you coming from?

702
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,000
Why are you asking so many details?

703
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,039
That's our boss's

704
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,079
long-standing rule

705
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:18,000
No

706
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,719
It's not just our boss's rule

707
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:20,719
It's from above

708
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,280
All guests coming and going

709
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,480
must be registered

710
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,599
Too much talk, I'm not staying

711
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,079
Let's go

712
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,000
Sir, staying at the inn?

713
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,960
Why are you getting upset?

714
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,880
Is your boss here?

715
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,440
Our boss is out today

716
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,360
won't be back until tonight

717
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,639
Do you need something?

718
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:43,679
No

719
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Does this inn

720
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,760
have a place to eat in the back?

721
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,440
We don't serve food here

722
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,280
Here's what you can do, sir

723
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Go ahead up front

724
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,599
There's a restaurant called Yelaihao

725
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,480
When it comes to local business

726
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,280
you're the best, Boss Shao

727
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,679
Second Master, you're flattering me

728
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,519
You're young and capable

729
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,360
and don't care for

730
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,159
these tiring and troublesome jobs

731
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,480
Not at all

732
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,719
The goods have been counted

733
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,239
Here's the key to the Xiaye River warehouse

734
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:35,800
I'll take it

735
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,119
As per Director Xiao's numbers

736
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
Second Master, please check

737
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,320
No need to check

738
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,480
Thank you

739
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,719
Second Master, what are your plans next?

740
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,119
I won't ask anymore.

741
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,079
Boss Xiao is very farsighted.

742
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,280
If it's inconvenient, you don't have to say.

743
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,079
It's written.

744
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:47,639
Then let me wish

745
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,719
Second Master Tang endless wealth

746
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,239
and a rapid rise to success.

747
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,039
Thank you, Boss Shao.

748
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,199
I also wish Boss Shao

749
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,400
business flourishes far and wide.

750
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:18,480
At the first watch, the moon passes over the flowered wall.

751
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
This little maid feels so sad.

752
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:27,440
Standing under the eaves,

753
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,519
she glances around with careful eyes.

754
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,719
The neighbor next door paces back and forth.

755
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:42,679
Embarrassed, her face turns pale.

756
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,639
At the second watch,

757
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:48,679
she taps on the window frame.

758
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,360
Chasing her beloved, she whispers softly.

759
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,920
She steps down and opens the door.

760
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:00,559
With a smile, she welcomes you in.

761
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,239
She grabs her beloved's hand.

762
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,119
At the third watch,

763
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:12,360
the two of us enter the embroidery room.

764
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:16,800
Hand in hand, we climb onto the bed.

765
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,159
Who are you thinking about?

766
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,239
In these times, only you

767
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,880
could still sing like this, Boss Jin.

768
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:23,920
Listen to you talk.

769
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,840
We still have to get by, no matter the times.

770
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:26,719
Enjoy your meal.

771
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,280
Alright.

772
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,360
Here.

773
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,360
Little Bronze Leg.

774
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,400
Boss.

775
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:50,480
Take down the sign.

776
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,559
Close the shop.

777
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:57,079
Got it.
