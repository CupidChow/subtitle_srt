1
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,919
Yunhu

2
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,039
What are you thinking now?

3
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,120
Do you think Xiaogui is telling the truth?

4
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,199
I can't tell.

5
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,479
But

6
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,439
I have to follow the Squad Leader.

7
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,639
Before leaving, the Squad Leader said

8
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,599
we should win Xiaogui over.

9
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,719
I know what you mean.

10
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,919
So in my heart,

11
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm also hesitating.

12
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,479
Qing,

13
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,639
at this critical moment,

14
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,919
we can't let emotions get in the way.

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,319
We need to be clear-headed.

16
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,919
About Xiaogui,

17
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,159
feelings are one thing,

18
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,840
but we must be cautious.

19
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,759
It's Old Tang.

20
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,439
He must have seen

21
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,199
the message I left for him.

22
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,520
Old Tang, Old Tang!

23
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,240
Are you alright?

24
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,919
How did you get away?

25
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,439
Old Tang, let me tell you something first.

26
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,960
Your situation

27
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,240
I've already told the instructor.

28
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,080
The higher-ups

29
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,199
agreed to let you join the operation.

30
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,639
Instructor Wang

31
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,719
wants us to act quickly.

32
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,319
There's one more thing.

33
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,759
It's about Xiaogui.

34
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,599
We can't make up our minds.

35
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,599
Yeah.

36
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,680
What do you think?

37
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,159
Say something!

38
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,879
What's wrong?

39
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,560
I saw Kawano.

40
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,279
And then?

41
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,519
He told me to return to Mudanjiang.

42
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,160
Are you safe now?

43
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,240
I'm safe.

44
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,600
He told you to go back to Mudanjiang?

45
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,879
So he trusts you?

46
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,240
Hard to say.

47
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,680
Alright, let's talk about Xiao Tielin first.

48
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,360
He’s probably planning to run.

49
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,759
Is the info reliable?

50
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,600
Yes.

51
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,319
Isn't he in the police station,

52
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:27,920
locked up?

53
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,720
How can he escape?

54
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,360
Yeah.

55
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
That's all a smokescreen.

56
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,079
Here's the situation.

57
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
The Japanese said

58
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,120
as long as he can come up with

59
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,680
1,500 taels of gold

60
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,279
and donate a fighter plane,

61
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,839
they'll arrange for him to go to Japan.

62
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,079
I'm helping him raise the money.

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,839
If he gets out of the police station,

64
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,279
we'll have a chance

65
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,000
to catch him.

66
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,839
Don't rush.

67
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,319
There's another thing.

68
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,800
I remember he once told me

69
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,279
he has something on him,

70
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,319
a life-saving token.

71
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,879
It's very valuable.

72
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,000
A life-saving token?

73
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,120
The life-saving token he has—

74
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,480
could it be

75
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,040
about the Datuziling fortifications?

76
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,759
I need to check it out first.

77
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,600
One more thing.

78
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,120
We're short-handed for this operation.

79
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,839
Xiaogui can come back.

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,000
Xiaogui.

81
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,839
What's wrong?

82
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,759
What's wrong?

83
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:42,879
Let's go.

84
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,720
Come with me.

85
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,199
Let's go.

86
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:09,800
Second Master.

87
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,160
Sorry about this.

88
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,040
Come on.

89
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,160
Second Master, this bag—

90
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,199
it must still be

91
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,600
Chief Xiao's stuff.

92
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,040
I know, I know.

93
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Here, Second Master, please.

94
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:22,680
Second Master.

95
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,480
Two thousand taels of gold

96
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,480
Of course

97
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,839
I'm the big brother here

98
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,319
I'll pay the largest share

99
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,639
Eleven hundred taels

100
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,240
So, the remaining nine hundred taels

101
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,920
You three split it evenly

102
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,879
Three hundred taels each

103
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,079
That's not much, right?

104
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,199
Not much

105
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,879
I can't leave

106
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm not like you guys

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,199
I have to lead troops in battle

108
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,920
I can't leave

109
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
What do you mean?

110
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,480
You'd rather be cannon fodder?

111
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,720
But then again

112
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,160
Out of the four of us

113
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,000
You're the one who should leave most

114
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,159
Old Xiao

115
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,840
I'm really grateful

116
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,600
After all these years

117
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,440
Whenever there's something good

118
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,759
You never leave me out, Old Guo

119
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
But this matter today

120
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,639
It's really huge

121
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,879
You have to let me think for a few days

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Can't you give me some time?

123
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,679
I can give you time

124
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,519
But can the situation give you time?

125
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,799
Besides

126
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,960
You need to raise money

127
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,440
That takes time too, doesn't it?

128
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:04,639
Commander Guo

129
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,840
How about this instead?

130
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,759
Let's go at it from two angles

131
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,200
You start raising the money

132
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,720
Think about it while you do

133
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,679
Then

134
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,440
If you really don't want to leave in the end

135
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,679
You just don't go, that's all

136
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,919
The money's with you anyway

137
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,039
You won't lose anything

138
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,080
What do you think?

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,759
That's right.

140
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,440
Second Master Tang makes sense.

141
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,080
Let's plan as we go.

142
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,080
I'll go raise the money now.

143
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,879
You keep talking, I'll head out.

144
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,720
Alright, alright.

145
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:37,799
Yes.

146
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,799
Take care, Commander Guo.

147
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,399
Okay.

148
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm leaving too.

149
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,960
Boss Shao.

150
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,360
What are you doing?

151
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,480
Old Guo already left.

152
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,240
Can't play cards anymore.

153
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,000
Why am I still here?

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,519
Wait, wait.

155
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,600
We haven't discussed business yet.

156
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,919
Come, come, have a seat.

157
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,360
Here in Mudanjiang,

158
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,679
You have a big family and business.

159
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,600
You're the most solid one.

160
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,639
So what do you think?

161
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
What about Commander Guo?

162
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,279
He makes sense.

163
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm not like you guys.

164
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,639
I'm a businessman.

165
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,679
No matter how things change,

166
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,480
No matter who takes over,

167
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,120
No one can make things hard for me.

168
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,679
In Mudanjiang city,

169
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,120
I have so many shops and land.

170
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,679
I can't sell them.

171
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,320
No.

172
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,279
No, no.

173
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,720
Do you not want to sell,

174
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,480
or can't bear to sell?

175
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,000
I noticed

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,240
you care more about money than your life.

177
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,039
In this life,

178
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,039
ups and downs are fate.

179
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,000
What's yours won't escape you.

180
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,039
If it's not yours,

181
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,480
you can't keep it.

182
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,200
Getting philosophical now.

183
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,799
Pretty insightful.

184
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,639
But as far as I know,

185
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,200
your son is in Japan, right?

186
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,879
You don't care anymore?

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,559
He's back.

188
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,840
He's back.

189
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,559
When did he come back?

190
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,159
A while ago.

191
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,120
Not so insightful now.

192
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,799
Why did you let him come back?

193
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,039
He was better off staying there.

194
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,840
He insisted on coming back.

195
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,840
I couldn't stop him.

196
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,159
Besides,

197
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,519
I think it's good he's back.

198
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,759
I don't want to leave anyway.

199
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,159
Someday I have to

200
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,720
be buried in the family grave.

201
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,440
No, wait, wait.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,799
You can be buried in your family grave,

203
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
but why drag your son into it?

204
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,799
He's young, you're old.

205
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,720
You can't ruin

206
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,200
your child's future.

207
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,240
Look at you.

208
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,000
Let me tell you, Old Shao.

209
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,360
I'm just being kind.

210
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,240
This is a one-time opportunity.

211
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,840
Chief Xiao.

212
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,840
Your kindness,

213
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,399
I appreciate it.

214
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,159
As for this opportunity,

215
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,600
let it pass.

216
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,480
I don't think

217
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
it's worth it.

218
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,159
I'm leaving.

219
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,080
Boss Shao, won't you reconsider?

220
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,960
No, I won't.

221
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,879
Old Shao.

222
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,639
How about this?

223
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,360
I'll move your family grave

224
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,200
to Japan.

225
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,320
Are you even making sense?

226
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,679
Shao.

227
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Doesn't appreciate it.

228
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,759
What should we do?

229
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,440
Bro,

230
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,039
Looks like we can't scrape the money together.

231
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,000
If we can't get the money,

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
none of us can leave.

233
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,960
Yeah.

234
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,919
It's really hard to get money from them.

235
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,399
In times like these,

236
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,799
money's hard to earn,

237
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,559
and life's tough.

238
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,200
I'll try to think of another way.

239
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
Hurry up and think.

240
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,600
We're running out of time.

241
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,919
We're not like Commander Guo.

242
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,840
He has a backup plan, he can hide in the mountains.

243
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,840
We have no backup at all.

244
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,279
Don't panic, stay calm.

245
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,320
Hold your breath, keep steady.

246
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,080
If your pants are tight, you won't panic.

247
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,919
There's always a way out.

248
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,480
We've got a backup now.

249
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,399
Is it what you mentioned last time,

250
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,600
that life-saving token?

251
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
That's what I meant.

252
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,080
Where did you put that thing?

253
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,639
You need to hide it well.

254
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,679
It's our lifeline.

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,120
It's not just about hiding it.

256
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,559
That life-saving token is with me.

257
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
What do you mean?

258
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,399
What's up, bro?

259
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,720
Do you know

260
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,960
some Communist secret?

261
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,960
It's not a Communist secret.

262
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,399
It's something the Communists

263
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,840
want to know.

264
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,200
What is it?

265
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,799
Why are you asking so much?

266
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,320
Just tell me,

267
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,559
I'll help you analyze it.

268
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,039
That secret of yours,

269
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,600
can it really save your life?

270
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,639
Yeah, that's right.

271
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,200
Help me analyze it.

272
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,440
But right now,

273
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,639
the priority isn't the life-saving token.

274
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,799
The priority is money.

275
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,399
We need to raise the money fast.

276
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,039
Money is the real insurance.

277
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,799
Exactly.

278
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,360
You're right, that makes sense.

279
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,000
Alright then.

280
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,559
I'll hurry up

281
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,519
and get my share together.

282
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,600
Bro,

283
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,720
Last time it was fifteen hundred,

284
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,039
now it's two thousand.

285
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,080
You're in for a share too.

286
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,440
Got it.

287
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,919
Xiao Wu,

288
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,200
do you think in this world

289
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,799
everyone has a weakness?

290
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,559
Look,

291
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,960
the two of us

292
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,440
have lived together for so many years.

293
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,759
So tell me,

294
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,240
what's my weakness?

295
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,919
Work hard, make money.

296
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,440
Work hard, make money.

297
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,320
Seems like you don't have one.

298
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,519
I really don't.

299
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,320
Then tell me,

300
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,200
what's Boss Shao's weakness?

301
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,759
Xiao Gui, you're awake.

302
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,200
Fu Qing,

303
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:19,919
Come here.

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,600
Take it slow.

305
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,200
No fever.

306
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,039
You're still strong.

307
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm not dreaming, am I?

308
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,360
What dream?

309
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,679
Right now,

310
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,679
you're officially

311
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,919
back with the team.

312
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,559
We'll carry out the mission together.

313
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,480
What mission?

314
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,440
Come on.

315
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,840
Your most important mission now

316
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,879
is to drink water

317
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:01,600
and eat.

318
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,960
The platoon leader left so suddenly.

319
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,839
I know it's hard for you to accept.

320
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,079
You haven't eaten or drunk anything on the way.

321
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,119
That's not good.

322
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,200
You're the youngest in our group.

323
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,359
You're the youngest.

324
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,039
Yunhu and I have to look after you.

325
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,440
If you get sick or lose weight from hunger,

326
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,920
we can't answer to the platoon leader.

327
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,119
Eat.

328
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,799
Okay.

329
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,519
Alright.

330
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,480
Xiaogui.

331
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,279
Look, what's this?

332
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,519
The platoon leader prepared this for you long ago.

333
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,480
Don't worry.

334
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,160
I promise,

335
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,400
I'll definitely get you

336
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:49,799
a real

337
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,599
sniper rifle.

338
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
Tonight, you'll team up with Fuqing.

339
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,319
There's a place not far from the police station.

340
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,319
It's a warehouse.

341
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,839
It stores

342
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,920
important Japanese military supplies.

343
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,400
Your mission with Fuqing

344
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,559
is to burn all those supplies.

345
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,799
But you're not fully recovered yet.

346
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,839
Just assist Fuqing.

347
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:24,839
Got it?

348
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,319
Okay.

349
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,599
Alright.

350
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,839
What about you, Yunhu?

351
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll be with another comrade.

352
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,440
Eat something.

353
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:36,839
Alright, let's rest for a bit.

354
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:37,680
Give it to me.

355
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,359
Come in.

356
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,039
Chief.

357
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Guangtian.

358
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,039
Look at my memory.

359
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,720
I always call you Guangtian instead of Qingtian.

360
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,680
I always miss the "big" character.

361
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,519
Then Qingtian still needs to work harder.

362
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,240
Sit, sit.

363
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,200
This young man

364
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,960
is getting more energetic.

365
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,240
Chief, you're joking.

366
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,039
Qingtian,

367
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,400
in my hands,

368
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,599
there are two people I like most.

369
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,160
One is you,

370
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,680
the other is Deyuan.

371
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,839
Did Second Master say something about me?

372
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,079
Chief.

373
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,559
You must see clearly.

374
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,519
Why are you so sensitive?

375
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,759
We

376
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,920
all work for the Japanese.

377
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,960
Right?

378
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,640
Honestly, we're just earning a living.

379
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,319
So we need to understand each other.

380
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,079
And be tolerant.

381
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,359
Chief.

382
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,240
As for me,

383
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,480
nicely put, I'm a chief.

384
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,039
But frankly, I'm just a prisoner.

385
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,440
Chief.

386
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,400
What are you saying?

387
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
See, see?

388
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,559
One day, I might get arrested.

389
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,119
That can't happen.

390
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,119
Who would dare?

391
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,039
Anything is possible.

392
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,599
So, Qingtian,

393
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,440
at my age,

394
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,559
I can't keep sitting

395
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,799
in the chief's seat forever.

396
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,559
Isn't there an old saying?

397
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,839
We can't hog the toilet and not use it.

398
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
Are you leaving?

399
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,559
The Tokko and the Military Police

400
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,519
I was just assigned

401
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,359
to be responsible for your safety.

402
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,359
If someone asks, how should I explain?

403
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,400
Well, well...

404
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,359
What's so hard to explain?

405
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,839
Besides, if they don't let me go,

406
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,000
can I even leave?

407
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,440
Fine, even if I do leave,

408
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,920
where could I go?

409
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,960
Northeast China is big,

410
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,160
but it can feel small too.

411
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,440
Qingtian,

412
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
everything I just said

413
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,079
came straight from the heart.

414
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:04,799
How about this,

415
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,240
from now on,

416
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,960
matters of your Economic Section

417
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,599
don't come to me anymore.

418
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,880
For other departments,

419
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
quickly get up to speed,

420
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,079
and move up fast.

421
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,720
I see your relationship with the Tokko

422
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,720
and the Military Police is pretty good.

423
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,000
That's a good thing.

424
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,160
Remember, once you have a position,

425
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,799
anything is possible.

426
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,440
I'll hand this ledger over to you.

427
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,240
And remember,

428
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,759
never turn your back on money.

429
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,640
As long as you're here, Chief,

430
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,079
none of us would dare overstep.

431
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
See? See?

432
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,599
You're still being polite.

433
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,799
No need for that.

434
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,160
Isn't there an old saying?

435
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,519
Don't covet your friend's spouse.

436
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,920
At critical moments, don't be polite.

437
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,039
That metaphor isn't quite right.

438
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,839
But you get the idea.

439
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,319
What?

440
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,640
Don't you want to?

441
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,519
I do.

442
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,359
See, you said it without thinking.

443
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:23,759
Chief,

444
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,400
if you need anything,

445
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,839
just let me know.

446
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,480
Almost all our deductions

447
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,880
have been confirmed.

448
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,720
But as for Xiao Tielin,

449
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,240
delivering supplies and laborers

450
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,519
can he really provide them

451
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,119
with any concrete intelligence

452
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,079
about the military fortifications at Datuziling?

453
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,400
Since their operation

454
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,680
is still in the planning stage,

455
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,559
it seems

456
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,839
they probably haven't

457
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,079
gotten what they want

458
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,640
from Tang Deyuan yet.

459
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,839
So should we

460
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,799
arrest Xiao Tielin now?

461
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,759
No.

462
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,559
Since the net is already set,

463
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,200
and

464
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,319
judging from their previous

465
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,920
series of actions,

466
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,920
they have support in the city.

467
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:30,799
Not catching fish with one net

468
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,759
is to let the fish communicate

469
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,319
and pass on safe information.

470
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,200
So more fish will swim in.

471
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,160
Second Master

472
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,640
Check it.

473
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,599
The bag.

474
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,839
This still belongs to Chief Xiao.

475
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,400
I know, I know.

476
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Why check the Chief's stuff?

477
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,000
Second Master, please.

478
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:09,559
Section Chief Zhao.

479
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,200
The Chief sent me to pick you up.

480
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:12,680
Come.

481
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,000
I'll do it myself.

482
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:18,799
Alright.

483
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,839
I'll lead the way.

484
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,680
Please.

485
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,160
Please.

486
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,759
Commander Guo and Boss Shao arrived early.

487
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,440
They also brought a big bag.

488
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,119
What are you guys up to?

489
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,440
Risking our lives.

490
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,119
What?

491
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,519
Risking our lives.

492
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,000
That's right.

493
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,960
Section Chief Zhao, don't you want in?

494
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,119
I can't afford it.

495
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,480
You guys go ahead.

496
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,839
I'll just watch the place for you.

497
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,240
I'll guard the yard for you.

498
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:46,960
Please.

499
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:47,920
Please.

500
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,359
Everyone's here.

501
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,640
Yunhu, you're with Li Zhenghao.

502
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,599
You two will stake out outside the police station.

503
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,240
If Xiao Tielin slips out early,

504
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,720
or if I manage

505
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,759
to bring him out,

506
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,039
then we'll act tonight.

507
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,640
Fuqing, you're with Xiaogui.

508
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,160
Wait outside the supply warehouse.

509
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,599
Xiao Tielin is the Chief.

510
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,599
If he's kidnapped,

511
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,599
the Japanese will definitely send reinforcements.

512
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,119
Once you get Yunhu's

513
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,119
success signal,

514
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,920
set fire to the supply warehouse.

515
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:19,880
Do your best

516
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,559
to buy us time to retreat.

517
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,079
Remember.

518
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,720
By 2 a.m.,

519
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,319
signal or not,

520
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,400
the operation ends.

521
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,240
Chief.

522
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:40,799
Second Master Tang is here.

523
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,400
Go ahead with your work.

524
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,880
Boss Shao is here too.

525
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,480
Not many rounds left.

526
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,799
I brought him over.

527
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,119
Here to play mahjong.

528
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:03,240
This is...

529
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,160
Commander Guo's.

530
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,759
It's all here.

531
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,359
Impressive.

532
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,279
Respect.

533
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,079
You, you, you.

534
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,480
Mine's here.

535
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,640
Brother.

536
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
I haven't got it all together.

537
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,720
As for me,

538
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,440
I'm preparing

539
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,720
to pawn my house.

540
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,559
And the rice I've stored,

541
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,200
and the flour,

542
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,480
I've found buyers for those too.

543
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,960
I'll try my best to get it all together.

544
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,920
Good brother.

545
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,559
That's real generous.

546
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,440
You really are generous.

547
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,960
But

548
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,799
the sizes aren't quite the same.

549
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,119
It's fine.

550
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
Big fish or small, they're all fish.

551
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,440
Right, right.

552
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,240
Brothers,

553
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,680
from now on,

554
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,640
our lives

555
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,799
are tied together.

556
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,799
Let's play a couple rounds.

557
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,599
Come on.

558
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,000
Here we go.

559
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:28,440
Yeah.

560
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,559
Just keep an eye on that crack in the door.

561
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,960
I'll watch the other spots for you.

562
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,039
Go in.

563
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,039
Section Chief, you wanted to see me?

564
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,279
Tell Zao Ji

565
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,000
to inform Xiao Tielin

566
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,319
that in three days

567
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,119
there's a flight to Dong Jing from Hailang Airport.

568
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,400
In three days.

569
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,359
As far as I know,

570
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,559
due to the tense war situation lately,

571
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,400
flight schedules have changed.

572
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,319
There are no flights to Dong Jing.

573
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,880
If I say there is, then there is.

574
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:01,359
Understood.

575
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,319
Wait.

576
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,640
Last time,

577
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,079
I told Xiao Tielin

578
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,039
one thousand taels of gold

579
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,519
was the amount to donate for a fighter plane.

580
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,160
Let's lower it for him.

581
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,839
Whether it's

582
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,440
eight hundred or six hundred taels,

583
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,279
you decide what to say.

584
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,839
Say it's because funds are tight.

585
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,559
Find a way to make him drop his guard.

586
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,599
Get him to come out willingly.

587
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:24,839
Understood.

588
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,680
Section Chief,

589
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,519
that's a clever tactic.

590
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,319
Old Shao,

591
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,240
I've told you before,

592
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,240
don't let your son come back.

593
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,160
But you insisted on burying him in the family grave.

594
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,119
Now, looking at it,

595
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,920
who knows which of you will end up in the grave first.

596
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,759
It's hard to say.

597
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,440
Seven tiles.

598
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,039
Pung.

599
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,839
What do you mean by that?

600
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,720
Taikun.

601
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,079
Yes.

602
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:27,920
Taikun.

603
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,440
Thank you very much.

604
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,640
Where was I just now?

605
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:46,759
The family grave.

606
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
The family grave.

607
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,200
As the old saying goes,

608
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,799
if a son goes astray, it's the father's fault.

609
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,839
Young people drink, womanize, and gamble.

610
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,039
Let's set drinking aside for now.

611
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,839
Womanizing and gambling,

612
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,559
they ruin people.

613
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,039
Are you talking about my son?

614
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,559
He never gets involved in those things.

615
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:23,079
You

616
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,000
really know him?

617
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,039
Look at you,

618
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:34,400
staring at me with those big eyes.

619
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,079
Why are you looking at me?

620
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,200
Come on,

621
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,160
take a look at this.

622
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,359
Lao Shao,

623
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,440
You run a casino,

624
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,039
you know the rules better than any of us.

625
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,200
When something like this happens,

626
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
how to handle it

627
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,079
do we really need to explain?

628
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,880
Lao Shao, it's all in black and white, can't be faked.

629
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,680
Lao Shao,

630
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,799
my heart aches.

631
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,359
I truly understand you.

632
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,440
This child,

633
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,319
he's like my own.

634
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,119
I watched

635
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,480
him grow up with my own eyes.

636
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,920
After all these years apart,

637
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,599
how did he end up like this?

638
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,440
Lao Shao, you...

639
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,119
I'll bring the money over tomorrow.

640
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,440
Brother,

641
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,680
I really didn't expect

642
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,839
you had a trick like that up your sleeve.

643
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,480
That's why

644
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,039
I'm your brother.

645
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:39,759
Old Shao,

646
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,039
don't say anything.

647
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,240
I just can't figure it out.

648
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,680
You're really willing

649
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,519
to let that old guy

650
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,599
play you for a fool.

651
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,440
What's worse,

652
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,400
you actually teamed up with them

653
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,440
to set me up.

654
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,440
What were you thinking?

655
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,599
Old Shao, you know

656
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,279
all this money I have

657
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,160
was made thanks to Xiao Tielin.

658
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,880
That's how I earned it.

659
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,239
I'm just giving back

660
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,000
a part of it.

661
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,840
I also understand

662
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,159
he can't take me with him.

663
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,079
And I don't want to go with him.

664
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,000
I just see it as being brothers for a while.

665
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,599
Just wrapping things up, that's all.

666
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,280
Well, congratulations on letting it go.

667
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,239
Old Shao,

668
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,880
instead of wasting energy being mad,

669
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,280
why not light a few more lamps?

670
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,000
The money will come pouring in.

671
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,400
Old Shao,

672
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,519
he's out.

673
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,239
Follow him.

674
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,079
The Imperial Army just called.

675
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,039
The night after tomorrow,

676
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,039
there's a flight to Japan.

677
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,320
Before leaving, gather the rest of the money.

678
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:21,840
Make sure it's all ready.

679
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,719
Once we're in Japan,

680
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,639
we'll live the good life.

681
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,679
You can marry again,

682
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
have a kid,

683
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,679
and enjoy family happiness.

684
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,239
Sounds good.

685
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,400
Has the time passed?

686
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,400
Time's up.

687
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,639
Mission canceled.

688
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,440
Let's go.

689
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,199
Come on.

690
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,760
Let's move.

691
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,199
Why was the mission canceled?

692
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,400
Time's up and we didn't get the signal.

693
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,639
No signal means we have to cancel.

694
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,599
That's how the higher-ups arranged it.

695
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,559
I don't know the details either.

696
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,039
Then why don't we

697
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,480
carry out the mission together?

698
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,639
They told me

699
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,559
we're one team,

700
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,360
they're another.

701
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,440
This mission is different from before.

702
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,440
We have to split up.

703
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,519
What's the mission anyway?

704
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,559
They didn't tell me.

705
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:04,559
How about this:

706
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,920
let's ask Second Squad Leader later.

707
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,519
He must know.

708
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,000
Second Squad Leader,

709
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,800
he's here too.

710
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,360
He's desperate now.

711
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:20,880
He's robbing openly.

712
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,280
So the money's all gathered.

713
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,079
Just missing my share.

714
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,440
Then we can act now.

715
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:30,960
I think we're good.

716
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,400
You guys find

717
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,159
a safe place first.

718
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,039
I'll arrange to meet him later.

719
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,119
You're going to meet Xiao Tielin?

720
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:41,960
How will you do that?

721
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,800
I've been thinking about something.

722
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,599
If you were Japanese,

723
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,119
would you let

724
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:55,280
a worthless person go to Japan?

725
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,880
No.

726
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,880
Exactly.

727
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,880
Since we can figure that out,

728
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,000
do you think Xiao Tielin

729
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,679
could figure it out too?

730
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,599
Could Xiao Tielin have known all along?

731
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,000
That he can't go to Japan?

732
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:19,840
It's possible.

733
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,199
If that's the case,

734
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,159
then it's even less likely

735
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,280
he'll leave the police station.

736
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,760
Not necessarily.

737
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,199
If the Japanese leave,

738
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,039
he'll only have his insurance policy left.

739
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,719
That insurance policy of his

740
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,239
whether he goes to Japan or not,

741
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
to the Japanese,

742
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,639
it's a death sentence.

743
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,719
Only with us

744
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
is it a life-saving token.

745
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,679
Exactly.

746
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,880
That's why he has to come out.

747
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,360
Are you sure?

748
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,480
Not sure.

749
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,400
Anyway, I think

750
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,880
Xiao Tielin isn't stupid.

751
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,599
He has no way out.

752
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,280
Before we act,

753
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,679
take care of what I mentioned.

754
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,280
Also,

755
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
report to the organization.

756
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,599
Get the props ready.

757
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,719
I'm not giving him real money.

758
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,840
Got it.

759
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,039
I'll go report.

760
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,079
We'll pull a bait-and-switch.

761
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,039
Trap him like a turtle in a jar.

762
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:04,400
You're finally back.

763
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:07,960
Here you are.

764
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,599
Squad Leader.

765
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:13,840
Tian Xiaogui.

766
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:16,719
Reporting in.

767
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,920
You finally made it back.

768
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,320
Old Tang.

769
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,440
You're now

770
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,599
our superior for this operation.

771
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,440
Brief Xiaogui on the mission.

772
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,159
Let's sit and talk.

773
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,039
Xiaogui.

774
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,000
The goal of this operation

775
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,119
our ultimate objective

776
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,079
is to capture

777
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,119
Chief Xiao Tielin of the police bureau.

778
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:04,639
Xiao Tielin.

779
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,360
He's a traitor.

780
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,519
I remember him now.

781
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,519
I've heard Fuqing mention him.

782
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,800
Isn't he one of your

783
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,880
relatives, Squad Leader?

784
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,320
That's right.

785
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,519
And our superiors

786
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,559
ordered us

787
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,800
to capture him alive.

788
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,719
Now I'll go over

789
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,199
the details of the operation.

790
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,119
Squad Leader.

791
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,159
Let me use the latrine first.

792
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,039
Are you alright?

793
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,159
I'm fine, just a stomachache.

794
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,840
Alright.

795
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,039
Xiao Gui

796
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,480
Xiao Gui

797
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,639
Xiao Gui

798
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:40,199
Did you fall into the latrine?

799
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,480
Xiao Gui

800
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,960
Xiao Gui

801
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,000
Xiao Gui
