1
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,439
Don't move. Put down your guns.

2
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,599
Put down your guns.

3
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,560
Put them down.

4
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,719
Put down your guns.

5
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,319
Don't move.

6
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,520
Tang Deyuan.

7
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,439
I remember you.

8
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
Chuan Ye Cangjie.

9
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
I remember you too.

10
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,680
Xiao Gui.

11
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,560
Number 490.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,120
My carefully trained masterpiece.

13
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,439
Though no longer

14
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,000
a top sharpshooter,

15
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
he's still one of Imperial Japan's

16
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
finest weapons.

17
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,599
This is my gift to you.

18
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,280
Well?

19
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,120
Do you like it?

20
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,199
Kill them.

21
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,039
Wait.

22
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,800
Are you sure the one who died

23
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
was Xiao Tielin?

24
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,000
Take off his mask.

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,479
Xiao Gui.

26
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,319
We knew you betrayed us long ago.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All of this was

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,879
part of our plan.

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,719
Xiao Gui can come back now.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,639
Your suspicion was probably right.

31
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,960
Xiao Gui.

32
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,120
Most likely,

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,199
he's already working for the Japanese.

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,520
The ultimate goal of this operation

35
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,479
is

36
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,039
to capture the police chief.

37
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,680
Xiao Tielin.

38
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,199
Xiao Tielin.

39
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,400
Now I'll explain

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,719
the details of this operation.

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,639
Squad Leader Er.

42
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,840
I need to use the latrine first.

43
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,360
He'll definitely try

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,439
to contact his handler.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,639
Keep an eye on him.

46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,400
I heard Squad Leader Er say

47
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,280
the one who treated your leg is a miracle doctor.

48
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,599
Why don't you take me to see him?

49
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,680
You rest here for now.

50
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,159
Let Xiao Gui

51
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,919
come with me inside to get the medicine.

52
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,080
Got it.

53
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,919
Let's go.

54
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,680
We'll pull a bait-and-switch.

55
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,639
Set a trap for him.

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,959
Understood.

57
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,959
I'll hand Xiao Tielin and the gold

58
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,680
over to the organization first.

59
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,040
You must be careful.

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,160
The one who died was the old doctor,

61
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,360
not Xiao Tielin.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,639
Chuan Ye.

63
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,399
This is our gift to you as well.

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,800
How about it?

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,920
Do you like it?

66
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,120
I really underestimated you.

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,759
Chief Chuan Ye, I'm sorry.

68
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,079
It was my mistake.

69
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,800
Give me another chance.

70
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,040
I was careless.

71
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,040
Tang Deyuan.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,759
Looks like you came prepared.

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
But it doesn't matter.

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,079
Speak.

75
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,920
Where is the real Xiao Tielin?

76
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,879
Tell me.

77
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,199
I'll let you die with your bodies intact.

78
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
I'll count to three.

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,639
One.

80
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,480
Two.

81
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,000
Three.

82
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,040
Kill them all.

83
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,000
Xiao Gui.

84
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,040
Xiao Gui.

85
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,319
They're just remnants, not many of them left.

86
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't be afraid, everyone.

87
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,800
Charge forward!

88
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,559
Hit them hard!

89
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,399
Retreat!

90
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,200
Don't let them escape! After them!

91
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,279
Xiao Gui!

92
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,080
Xiao Gui!

93
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,600
Xiao Gui!

94
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,320
Xiao Gui!

95
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,159
Our plan worked!

96
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,159
Brother Fuqing.

97
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,879
Your foot...

98
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,240
Soak it a few more times and it'll heal.

99
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,320
Brother Fuqing.

100
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,759
I'm going out for some air.

101
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,519
Don't go too far.

102
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,679
Dying is easy.

103
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,720
But dying well

104
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,759
is not so easy.

105
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:32,879
Xiao Gui

106
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,320
Why?

107
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,759
Squad Leader Er

108
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,960
I should've died long ago.

109
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,879
A lot of things

110
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,360
can't be solved

111
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,279
with just a bullet.

112
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,759
And that bullet

113
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
shouldn't be aimed at our own people.

114
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,399
Countless times

115
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,720
I've thought about killing them.

116
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,440
I couldn't do it.

117
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,759
I just couldn't.

118
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,080
The first time I saw

119
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,120
your hands,

120
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,080
I knew

121
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,159
you've suffered a lot.

122
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,480
You've endured a lot of hardship.

123
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,559
Then why did you keep me alive?

124
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,519
I hesitated.

125
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,159
I struggled with it.

126
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,279
But I was waiting for you.

127
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,159
Actually, that day at the bureau entrance,

128
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,639
I already knew.

129
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,639
My judgment about you was right.

130
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,879
You actually wanted to protect us.

131
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,480
Didn't you?

132
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,320
But the platoon leader

133
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,639
still died.

134
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,240
Squad Leader Er

135
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,840
Was it my fault the platoon leader died?

136
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,720
Xiao Gui, trust me.

137
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,879
No.

138
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,960
So,

139
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,879
we have to avenge him.

140
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,000
We must.

141
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,440
We must.

142
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:57,759
Xiao Gui

143
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,799
Welcome

144
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,960
back to the team.

145
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,919
For the next operation,

146
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,240
we'll do it together.

147
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,440
We need you

148
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,559
to keep sending messages to Chuan Ye.

149
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,600
Lure him to Heisong Ridge.

150
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,480
Is it just us?

151
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,759
Don't worry.

152
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,080
Instructor Wang will bring reinforcements.

153
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,240
They'll support us.

154
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,840
Squad Leader Er

155
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,159
I know how much you want

156
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,840
to kill Chuan Ye yourself.

157
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,440
But you have to listen to me on this.

158
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,480
Only I can get close to him.

159
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,840
But Xiao Gui,

160
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,600
Squad Leader Er

161
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,639
You don't need to say anything.

162
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,799
Thank you.

163
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Comrade Xiao Gui,

164
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
from now on, you will lead

165
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,680
thousands of troops.

166
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:42,480
Do you know why

167
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,799
I gave you those glasses?

168
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,359
The wind is strong.

169
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,680
I was worried you couldn't see clearly.

170
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,160
Now you can take a look.

171
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,920
Look at all this.

172
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,319
Our beautiful land,

173
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,039
has been ravaged by the Japanese for so many years.

174
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,119
Our people, our families,

175
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,160
have suffered for so many years.

176
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,440
Can you really bear

177
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,240
to keep serving as the enemy’s accomplice?

178
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,039
You seem quite aware.

179
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,119
What I care about most now

180
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,839
is whether I can survive.

181
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,960
Take a look.

182
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,240
In these mountains,

183
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,559
everywhere are

184
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,680
the souls killed by the Japanese.

185
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,559
Xiao Tielin,

186
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,519
on behalf of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

187
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:38,079
Teaching Brigade Party Committee, I announce to you

188
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,559
this is your last

189
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,519
chance to atone.

190
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,359
If you can provide

191
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,200
valuable intelligence about

192
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,759
the Datuzi Ridge fortifications,

193
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,960
your life will be spared.

194
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,680
You’ll be allowed to live out your days

195
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:50,960
in prison.

196
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,720
Based on Xiao Tielin’s

197
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,240
information about Datuzi Ridge’s

198
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,839
defensive arrangements,

199
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,559
after verification, it’s mostly accurate.

200
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,240
Now, under Party Committee leadership,

201
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,279
multiple teams are being sent into enemy territory

202
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,400
to destroy their fortifications.

203
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,759
Tang Deyuan,

204
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,160
Gao Yunhu,

205
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,480
Wan Fuqing,

206
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,559
Xiao Lyuzi,

207
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,759
you are the first team.

208
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
You must complete the mission by midnight, August 9th,

209
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,680
before the Soviet Army attacks the Japanese.

210
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,720
Finish the task.

211
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,200
Old Tang,

212
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,480
we’re almost there.

213
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,480
Over there.

214
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,319
That was too close.

215
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,440
Luckily, we were

216
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,079
one step ahead of the enemy.

217
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,640
So many planes here.

218
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,440
If they had taken off,

219
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,200
they would have attacked us from behind.

220
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
We would have lost so many people.

221
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,079
Do you think it's just us

222
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:40,960
taking action?

223
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,759
We'll track them down

224
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,519
one by one.

225
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,640
That would make a real difference.

226
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,839
You know very well

227
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,599
if we don't act before the enemy,

228
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,640
just one step ahead,

229
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,440
thousands of our soldiers

230
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,599
will lose their lives here.

231
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,759
Report to headquarters:

232
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,680
We've located Datuziling

233
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,200
military airfield's exact position.

234
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
Please take action immediately.

235
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,079
Please take action immediately.

236
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,480
Since 1942,

237
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,640
the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

238
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,759
Teaching Brigade was established.

239
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,960
Until August 1945,

240
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,839
on the eve of the Soviet declaration of war against Japan,

241
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,160
the brigade sent teams back to Northeast China

242
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,599
to carry out missions.

243
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,920
They did this hundreds of times.

244
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,920
They used every possible method

245
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,279
to infiltrate the Japanese army.

246
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,920
They reported on seventeen Japanese strategic fortresses

247
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,799
and hundreds of camps along the China-Soviet border,

248
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:07,759
fortifications,

249
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,759
ammunition depots, and intelligence command posts,

250
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,880
providing crucial information

251
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,400
accurately

252
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,359
to the Soviet command center.

253
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,559
When the Soviet army advanced into Northeast China

254
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,039
and fought to destroy the Japanese Kwantung Army,

255
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,599
they played a vital role.

256
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,480
Someday,

257
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,680
we will fight our way back.

258
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,880
When that day comes,

259
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,599
planes will fly overhead,

260
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,799
red flags will wave on the ground,

261
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,799
and we’ll hold torches high.

262
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,680
All our fighters

263
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
will appear where the Japanese

264
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,119
least expect it,

265
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:54,839
coming out everywhere,

266
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,599
across the mountains and fields.

267
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,799
Will that day really come?

268
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,839
As long as we believe,

269
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,960
it will come.

270
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,200
In August 1945,

271
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,279
after the Soviet Union declared war on Japan,

272
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,799
advance teams from the Teaching Brigade

273
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,559
joined Soviet airborne operations

274
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,240
and served as guides.

275
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,440
Domestic Anti-Japanese United Army members

276
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,640
actively cooperated with the Soviet army,

277
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:20,480
speeding up the Far East campaign.

278
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,720
They made important contributions

279
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,319
to the victory on the Eastern Front

280
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,160
of the global anti-fascist war.

281
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,440
Brother Fuqing.

282
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,920
Fuqing.

283
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,400
Fuqing.

284
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,640
Moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky.

285
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,279
Moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky.

286
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,279
River maples and fishing lights, sleepless with sorrow.

287
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,799
River maples and fishing lights, sleepless with sorrow.

288
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,519
At Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou,

289
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,920
At Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou,

290
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,079
the midnight bell reaches the traveler’s boat.

291
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,559
the midnight bell reaches the traveler’s boat.

292
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,160
Come, children.

293
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,480
Stand up, all of you.

294
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,960
Remember this:

295
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,319
No matter what happens,

296
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,880
as long as we speak

297
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,920
the Chinese language,

298
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,640
we are Chinese.

299
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,440
Do you remember?

300
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,160
We remember.

301
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,119
Do you remember?

302
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,880
We remember.

303
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,960
As long as on this land

304
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,240
there is still one standing Chinese,

305
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,119
this will never be Manchukuo.

306
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,039
Our culture endures.

307
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,400
Our nation survives.

308
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,720
The flame never dies.

309
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,160
China will not fall.

310
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,880
China will not fall.

311
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,880
Moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky.

312
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,720
River maples and fishing lights, sleepless with sorrow.

313
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,440
At Hanshan Temple outside Suzhou,

314
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,319
the midnight bell reaches the traveler’s boat.

315
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,960
I didn't expect we'd catch up with the main force.

316
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,000
But it's still exciting.

317
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,960
Who knew we'd only catch the tail end.

318
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,759
Alright.

319
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,599
Catching the tail end is good enough.

320
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,160
Look,

321
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,039
so many never saw victory.

322
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,720
Just missed it by a little.

323
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,440
Such a pity.

324
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,279
Here it comes.

325
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,720
Water's here.

326
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:48,480
Good.

327
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,319
Here, take it slow.

328
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Thank you for your hard work, comrade.

329
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,720
It's not hard.

330
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,920
Ever since I was little,

331
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,119
I've wanted to fight the Japanese.

332
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,240
Too bad.

333
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,759
I couldn't make it to the battlefield.

334
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,079
But it's alright.

335
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,960
I help however I can.

336
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,440
Right?

337
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,039
No matter what you do,

338
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,119
as long as you contribute,

339
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,519
you're helping the resistance.

340
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,400
That's right.

341
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,759
Far East Army units

342
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,759
by noon on August 15th

343
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:18,440
have completed

344
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,079
Old Tang,

345
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,279
the encirclement of Mudanjiang.

346
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,079
In the northern part of the city,

347
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:21,680
Old Tang,

348
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,720
is fighting street battles.

349
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,240
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

350
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,000
Don't move around.

351
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:32,960
Tell me,

352
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,079
do you want some water?

353
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,079
Speak louder.

354
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,599
Louder.

355
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,279
I'm speaking as loud as I can.

356
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,480
Others nearby are still resting.

357
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,359
Just try to listen.

358
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,160
Here.

359
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:49,880
It's fine.

360
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,079
You can speak louder.

361
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,440
You're listening, right?

362
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,680
I thought you were asleep.

363
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,279
Come on.

364
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,240
Let's all listen together.

365
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,279
Here.

366
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,359
I'll turn up the volume for you.

367
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,759
Here's a breaking news update.

368
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,079
On August 15, 1945,

369
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,960
the Showa Emperor issued a decree

370
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,400
announcing Japan's unconditional surrender.

371
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,400
The Showa Emperor issued a decree

372
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,960
announcing Japan's unconditional surrender.

373
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,799
The following is the Japanese Emperor's

374
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,440
recorded surrender announcement.

375
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,640
We've won the war!

376
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,640
The Japanese have surrendered!

377
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,440
The Japanese have surrendered!

378
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,440
Really?

379
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,000
That's great!

380
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,200
The Japanese have surrendered!

381
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,119
Brother Yuntiger,

382
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:34,440
my back...

383
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,720
my back...

384
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,480
My back, my back...

385
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,319
Let me take a look.

386
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:41,720
Canteen.

387
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:42,960
Canteen, canteen.

388
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,279
This comrade is quite amusing.

389
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,039
Comrade, let me do it.

390
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,640
No need, no need.

391
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,359
I can do it myself.

392
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,119
My job.

393
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,880
Comrade, where are you from?

394
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,720
My home.

395
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,119
I'm from Yanchong Mountain.

396
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,960
You're from Yanchong Mountain?

397
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,799
So, is everything good at home?

398
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:04,720
It's good.

399
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,160
As for my family,

400
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,359
Only my mother is left.

401
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,880
My father was also in the army.

402
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,640
He came back once a few years ago.

403
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,200
But then he left again.

404
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,640
Before he left,

405
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,480
he told me to stay home.

406
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
And take care of my mother.

407
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,960
But I didn't listen to him.

408
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,720
Later on,

409
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,519
I snuck out.

410
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,240
And joined the army.

411
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,920
What's your father's name?

412
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:25,680
My father?

413
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,160
His name is Lu Changshan.

414
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:29,279
Here.

415
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,519
Comrade, your water.

416
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:34,920
You're Tie Liang.

417
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,000
How did you know?

418
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,359
Old Tang.

419
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:42,920
Old Tang.

420
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,160
Surrendered.

421
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,599
I know, I know.

422
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,160
Outside, outside.

423
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,079
Surrendered.

424
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:47,880
Are you trying to strangle me?

425
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:48,759
I know, I know.

426
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:49,839
It's lively outside now.

427
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:50,640
Uh, I...

428
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:52,880
What was I about to do?

429
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:54,880
Come on, come on.

430
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:55,880
Come in, come in.

431
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:56,920
Slow down, slow down.

432
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,160
This is...

433
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,720
Do you know who this is?

434
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,279
Who?

435
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,720
The platoon leader's son, Tie Liang.

436
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,680
Platoon.

437
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,119
Your Uncle Deyuan.

438
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:10,480
Uncle.

439
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,359
And your Uncle Fuqing.

440
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:13,839
Uncle Qing.

441
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,480
Uh...

442
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,960
Your father is Lu Changshan?

443
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:27,680
Alright.

444
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,640
Report.

445
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:11,599
Speak.

446
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,319
The leader of the 88th Brigade is here.

447
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,079
Please invite them in quickly.

448
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:15,799
Yes.

449
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,559
Take it.

450
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,240
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China,

451
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,039
the brave Anti-Japanese United Army,

452
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,799
using the Soviet Red Army

453
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,160
88th Independent Infantry Brigade

454
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,799
as its designation,

455
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,440
joined the battle to liberate Northeast China.

456
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:36,519
We

457
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,119
held out until the very end.

458
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,519
Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Teaching Brigade

459
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,400
reports to the Party organization.

460
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:44,920
We

461
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,240
have returned to the ranks.

462
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,039
Since August 1942,

463
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,680
when the Teaching Brigade was established,

464
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,039
we have always maintained

465
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,559
organizational independence.

466
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,079
We have upheld the leadership of the Communist Party of China

467
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,960
and the autonomy of anti-Japanese armed forces.

468
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,880
Up to now,

469
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,920
the Party organization of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

470
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,039
has established direct contact

471
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,720
with the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.

472
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,759
In September 1945,

473
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,840
the Teaching Brigade was expanded into

474
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,480
the Northeast People's Self-Defense Army.

475
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,960
The force grew to over forty thousand members.

476
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,079
By the end of October,

477
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,360
together with the Eighth Route Army advancing into the Northeast

478
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,559
and the New Fourth Army units,

479
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,599
they were unified into the Northeast People's Autonomous Army.

480
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,960
From then on,

481
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,000
the history of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

482
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,480
entered a new chapter.

483
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,239
Dad

484
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:24,679
Dad

485
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,800
Platoon Leader

486
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:36,840
Tang Deyuan

487
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:37,800
Wan Fuqing

488
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,119
Gao Yunhu

489
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:40,840
We have returned to the unit.

490
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:58,599
Salute

491
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,119
Charge!

492
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,519
Let's charge!
