1
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,040
This is some powder I just bought. It's for you.

2
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,599
Forget it, Master Pang gave it to you, right?

3
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,239
No.

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,000
Does it smell nice?

5
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,319
It does.

6
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:44,879
Wait here.

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,959
Who are you looking for?

8
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,599
I'm looking for Dongmei.

9
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,319
That's me.

10
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,159
You are?

11
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,640
Dakuozhi sent me.

12
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,079
She said she saved you once.

13
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,120
If she sent you, that's fine.

14
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
She owes me her life.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,919
My night business is good.

16
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,960
I've run it for over ten years.

17
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,439
Whenever the girls in town have trouble,

18
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,840
they come to me.

19
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,719
I'm the only one who can protect them.

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
Come in and talk.

21
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,120
Go inside.

22
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:38,960
Be careful.

23
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,319
Watch your head.

24
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,319
Hello, Master Pang. Hello, Master Pang.

25
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,479
That room.

26
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,240
Search it.

27
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:05,840
Alright.

28
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,120
Master Pang, have a pancake.

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,560
Master Pang.

30
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,439
Move aside, move aside.

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,319
Search that room.

32
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,280
Alright, Master Pang. I'm on it.

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,000
Search that room too.

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,599
Search.

35
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,639
Yes.

36
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,199
What are you doing?

37
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:26,800
A search.

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,439
Go, go.

39
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,840
Master Pang, what's going on now?

40
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,879
Get everyone out.

41
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,360
Search.

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,680
Search for what?

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,759
In broad daylight?

44
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,240
Searching for Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

45
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,199
Communists.

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,039
Hurry up.

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,439
Master Pang.

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,639
Listen to your joke.

49
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,520
The Anti-Japanese Allied Forces don't go after the Japanese.

50
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,759
In broad daylight,

51
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,639
they come here

52
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,919
What are they hiding for?

53
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Stop talking nonsense.

54
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,639
Search.

55
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,080
Yes.

56
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,759
Where are you going?

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,120
What are you doing?

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
Did you bring money?

59
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,400
Don't try to use force.

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Master Pang.

61
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,240
In our line of work,

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
we're in it for the money.

63
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,800
So hiding people

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
is definitely impossible.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
But,

66
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,800
we rely on you to make a living.

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
We depend on you.

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,199
Of course we respect you.

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,160
You can search.

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,199
But let me say this,

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,759
these girls

72
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,480
have worked hard to save up

73
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,920
their hard-earned belongings.

74
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,519
If anything gets damaged or taken,

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
then

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,879
I'll go to your house

77
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,600
and talk to your fierce wife.

78
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,319
I'll tell her all about you.

79
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,879
I'll spill everything.

80
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:43,879
Search.

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,600
Yes.

82
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,920
You're really going in?

83
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,879
You little brat.

84
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,360
Don't break my stuff.

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,920
Master Pang.

86
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,319
Seeing you work so hard every day

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,639
really makes me feel for you.

88
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,040
Master Pang.

89
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,160
Maybe you could tell them to search more gently.

90
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,279
Come to my room.

91
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,680
I'll show you something different.

92
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,439
Go away.

93
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,680
Master Pang, come on.

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,639
Come on, come on.

95
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,680
Don't use force.

96
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm on duty.

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,959
Come out, I'm watching you.

98
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,040
Come out.

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,279
I'm watching you.

100
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,000
Master Pang, pick one.

101
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,879
Don't use force.

102
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,560
Come on.

103
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,959
That's enough, let's go.

104
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,240
Hurry up and leave.

105
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,000
Master Pang.

106
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,199
Go, go, go.

107
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,360
Master Pang.

108
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,480
Master Pang.

109
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,560
Don't use force.

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,879
Let's go quickly.

111
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,480
Go, go.

112
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,600
Step aside.

113
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,399
Come on.

114
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,319
Touch again and I'll arrest you.

115
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,600
Don't leave.

116
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,399
What are you doing, Master Pang?

117
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,279
You're leaving?

118
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,800
Such delicate hands.

119
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,720
I'll come find you later.

120
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,879
Bring money.

121
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,839
Master Pang.

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
What are you doing?

123
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,759
Serves you right.

124
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,600
What are you doing?

125
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,279
Come again, Master Pang.

126
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,399
Sister Dongmei.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
Thank you so much this time.

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,839
As long as I'm here,

129
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,519
if there's food to eat,

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,360
our sisters won't go hungry.

131
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,680
Saying this,

132
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,160
they say we're heartless,

133
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,920
but we've shown some loyalty today.

134
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:47,959
Uncle

135
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,279
Where is this place?

136
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:50,959
Come on.

137
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,399
The owner here

138
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,199
is an old acquaintance of mine.

139
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,279
I've already told him

140
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
that you're my nephew.

141
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,279
You can stay here for a couple of days.

142
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,319
Settle down here for now.

143
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,600
Fu Qing and Brother Yun Hu

144
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,879
are here too.

145
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,720
They have their own things to take care of.

146
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,720
What about you?

147
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,240
Is there anything you're worried about?

148
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,240
I'm just afraid I won't find you again.

149
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,000
Gui'er,

150
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,639
now that we've found you,

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,320
we won't be separated again.

152
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,399
Even if you want to leave,

153
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,600
I'll still bring you back.

154
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,679
Stay here and rest easy.

155
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,879
If anything comes up, I'll let you know.

156
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,840
Boss

157
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,559
Boss

158
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,120
Should we get a few people

159
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:58,679
to keep watch?

160
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,519
No need for anyone.

161
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,279
People would just draw attention.

162
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,320
This village is deserted.

163
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,360
No one would suspect.

164
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,960
Starting tomorrow,

165
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
get people, little by little,

166
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,720
to move the goods out.

167
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,240
Alright, boss.

168
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,200
Platoon Leader, you're finally back.

169
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,320
How did it go?

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,639
There's something up.

171
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,519
What is it?

172
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,679
What?

173
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,759
Walnut crisps.

174
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,679
Such a rare treat.

175
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,320
Where did you get it?

176
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,559
I was carrying my gear

177
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,000
and just wandered around.

178
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,759
It's nice when Yunhu isn't here.

179
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,279
Get lost.

180
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,120
Even food can't shut you up.

181
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,120
Hey, don't eat it all.

182
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,960
Save a piece or two for Yunhu.

183
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,320
There aren't many pieces anyway.

184
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
Alright, I'll save some.

185
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,080
Platoon Leader.

186
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,399
Where's Xiaogui?

187
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,480
Why didn't he come back with you?

188
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,240
Xiaogui's a sharpshooter.

189
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,639
In a fight, he's worth two men.

190
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,200
You...

191
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,519
Did you say something to him?

192
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,519
He didn't want to come back with you?

193
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,720
He wanted to.

194
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,399
Then why didn't you bring him?

195
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,799
These past years, I don't know what's happened.

196
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,440
Something scared him.

197
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,200
He's not all there.

198
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,120
If I made him come now

199
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,399
and join our mission,

200
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,600
it wouldn't be right.

201
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,200
It might spook him even more.

202
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,519
Better let him recover first.

203
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,320
Then I'll go find him.

204
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,320
I'll warm up wherever he's cold.

205
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,960
I'll bring his spirit back.

206
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:28,799
Qing,

207
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
you're a good kid.

208
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Kind-hearted.

209
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,320
Well-liked, too.

210
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,000
Just a bit slow sometimes.

211
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,679
You can just say

212
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm not the sharpest tool.

213
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,279
I won't get mad.

214
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,519
I already ate your walnut crisps.

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,399
Well...

216
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,879
Ever since I joined the team,

217
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
we've been family.

218
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,399
You all

219
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,080
are like my own children.

220
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,679
Yunhu is the eldest.

221
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,960
He can make decisions on his own.

222
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,879
But sometimes he's stubborn.

223
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,519
If he gets stuck on the wrong thing,

224
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,120
he gets confused.

225
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,240
When it comes to ability,

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,799
no one beats my daughter.

227
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:28,600
Lanhua.

228
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,879
She was kidnapped by bandits,

229
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,799
but still held up the backbone of the group.

230
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,000
She managed to pull together a team.

231
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,120
She has the power to change fate.

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,639
It's a shame.

233
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:54,759
Platoon Leader.

234
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,600
Why are you talking about this today?

235
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,519
Just chatting,

236
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,720
and the topic came up.

237
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,279
Just rambling.

238
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,679
Then keep rambling.

239
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,960
Old Tang and Xiaogui,

240
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,000
to be honest,

241
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,519
we didn't take good care of them.

242
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,720
Deyuan has always been

243
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,240
a loner.

244
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,879
Look at him now,

245
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,559
living under the enemy's nose,

246
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,039
trying to make a living,

247
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,399
working for others.

248
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,159
He must've suffered

249
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,840
so much injustice.

250
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,320
It was tough, but we made it through.

251
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,440
And now they're talking to us about conscience.

252
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,240
It's not easy.

253
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,519
Xiaogui is the family's old troublemaker.

254
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Small in size, but clever.

255
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,039
But he needs someone to guide him.

256
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,080
Otherwise, he won't walk a steady path.

257
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,600
If he hits any bumps along the way,

258
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,039
someone needs to help him out.

259
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,919
Instructor.

260
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,639
Instructor.

261
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,080
Old Lu.

262
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,200
Good news.

263
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,120
The Soviet Union has captured Berlin.

264
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,879
Germany has surrendered.

265
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,120
When did this happen?

266
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,080
Just now.

267
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,440
We received word from above immediately.

268
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,200
They sent a telegram.

269
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,559
Comrades,

270
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,399
the end of Japanese fascism

271
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,200
is near.

272
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,200
Soviet Supreme Commander Stalin

273
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,759
has announced to the Red Army and Red Navy

274
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
that on May 8, 1945,

275
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,639
the representative of the German High Command in Berlin

276
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,799
signed Germany’s unconditional surrender.

277
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,159
The Soviet people

278
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,120
against the German fascist invaders

279
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,039
have fought a great Patriotic War

280
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,279
and achieved victory.

281
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,080
The end of fascism

282
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,240
has arrived.

283
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,200
The civil and military judges have taken the bench.

284
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Ox-Head and Horse-Face are taking souls.

285
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:09,440
Seventh Lord descends to claim the living soul.

286
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,039
The civil and military judges have taken the bench.

287
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,400
They've taken the bench.

288
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,480
Ox-Head and Horse-Face are taking souls.

289
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,000
Seventh Lord descends to claim the living soul.

290
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,640
The civil and military judges have taken the bench.

291
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,039
Old Huang

292
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,559
Civil and military judges

293
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,680
Why are you making a fuss again today?

294
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,759
What on earth happened?

295
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,160
Something big happened.

296
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,799
So what is it?

297
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,119
The Japanese soldiers are back.

298
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,240
Explain clearly.

299
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,880
By the river...

300
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,319
Something happened.

301
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,119
What happened by the river?

302
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:32,799
Be more specific.

303
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,720
Someone's in trouble.

304
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,160
Something happened by the river.

305
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,880
Let's go and check it out.

306
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,319
The riverbank.

307
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:36,880
Hurry, let's go.

308
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,640
Something happened by the river.

309
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Something happened by the river.

310
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
Something happened by the river.

311
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,240
The riverbank.

312
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,400
Someone... someone...

313
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,039
Someone's there.

314
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,000
I see it, I see it.

315
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,519
Just a couple days ago,

316
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,640
he was lively and energetic.

317
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,759
Laughing and talking.

318
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,400
Look at this...

319
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,720
What kind of sin is this?

320
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,200
Such a waste of this child.

321
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,079
Gayazi

322
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,039
Gayazi

323
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,279
Look at your mother.

324
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,240
Please?

325
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:52,519
Look at your mother.

326
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,119
Look at me.

327
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,119
Wake up.

328
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,160
Wake up.

329
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,559
Wake up and look at your mother.

330
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,279
Look at your mother.

331
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,400
Look.

332
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,319
Gayazi

333
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,759
Wake up.

334
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,160
What happened?

335
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,160
Gayazi

336
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,599
What happened here?

337
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,880
What's going on?

338
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,279
Wake up.

339
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,440
Gayazi

340
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,119
Move aside, move aside.

341
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,079
Wake up.

342
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,400
Wake up.

343
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,160
Look at your mother, wake up.

344
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,599
Quick, get a spiritual medium.

345
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,519
Let him perform the rites.

346
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,319
May he be reborn somewhere good.

347
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:12,759
Master Pang

348
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,680
You have to stand up for Gayazi.

349
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,680
What really happened here?

350
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,480
How can I help you?

351
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,119
The child fell into the water while playing.

352
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,960
No.

353
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,640
This child was murdered.

354
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,680
He was killed and then thrown into the water.

355
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,440
Master Pang, look.

356
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,000
Is this a bruise?

357
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,559
Was he strangled?

358
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,319
This isn't what you said.

359
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,640
He didn't just drown.

360
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,799
Someone killed this child.

361
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,720
Master Pang

362
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,240
Who would hurt my child?

363
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,119
Why would they do this?

364
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,640
Why did they hurt him?

365
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,160
Why?

366
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,359
Tell us, Master Pang.

367
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,480
Master Pang

368
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,359
Master Pang

369
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,799
This is a matter for Songlin Town.

370
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,359
You can't ignore this.

371
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Yes, you have to take charge.

372
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,200
Things in Songlin Town

373
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,319
I can't decide everything here.

374
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,920
Who knows if this child

375
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,920
saw something he shouldn't have.

376
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,200
Or heard something he shouldn't have.

377
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,039
What do you mean?

378
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,079
What do you mean, saw something he shouldn't?

379
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,400
Or heard something he shouldn't?

380
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,279
What are you implying?

381
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,079
Do you know something?

382
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,680
I don't know anything.

383
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:47,880
Zhi,

384
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,000
Coming to me so late,

385
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,480
what's going on?

386
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
How did Gayazi die?

387
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,240
Just don't ask.

388
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,279
What do you mean, don't ask?

389
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,359
As an official,

390
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,200
you do nothing.

391
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,640
But you never miss a chance to take money.

392
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,799
That you never delay.

393
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,559
How did he really die?

394
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,160
Zhi,

395
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,279
I'm just

396
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,599
a minor official.

397
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm not the local god.

398
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,799
I can't handle everything.

399
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,839
The wound on Gayazi's neck

400
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,400
shows what happened at a glance.

401
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,640
You're lying through your teeth.

402
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,359
Aren't you afraid you won't sleep at night?

403
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,839
Then I can't afford to offend them.

404
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,880
Who can't you offend?

405
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,000
You can't.

406
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,240
But I can.

407
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,440
What are you going to do?

408
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,079
Let me ask you,

409
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,640
What does "saw what shouldn't be seen" mean?

410
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,640
Or "heard what shouldn't be heard"?

411
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,839
What did you see?

412
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:50,839
What did you hear?

413
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,720
What do you really know?

414
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,000
Stop pushing me.

415
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:54,799
Master Pang,

416
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,319
Everyone respects you.

417
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,000
We just hope

418
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,359
you can protect us.

419
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:02,920
A life was lost.

420
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,119
You need to give us an explanation.

421
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,680
You can't just shirk responsibility.

422
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,160
Every family in Songlin Town has children.

423
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,599
Whether it's wolves, boars, or monkeys,

424
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,240
if another child is taken,

425
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,160
everyone will come to you.

426
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,319
Can you handle that?

427
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,359
Keep your voice down.

428
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,880
Pang Sihai,

429
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,519
I'm saying this now.

430
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,880
If you don't explain clearly,

431
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,279
you won't get the money.

432
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,240
And you won't leave either.

433
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:32,880
Then...

434
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,160
That Boss Zhu isn't really Boss Zhu.

435
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,319
Boss Zhu is actually

436
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,480
a Japanese.

437
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,759
His real name is

438
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,000
Kawano Sōsuke.

439
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,240
He's the head of the Special Higher Police.

440
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,920
Can you afford to offend him?

441
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,799
Can I afford to offend him?

442
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,480
We can't fight him.

443
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,480
Mr. Kawano,

444
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,640
There's news about the Communist Party.

445
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,279
I found the ball.

446
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:11,920
Gayazi,

447
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,720
what did this uncle

448
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
call the old man just now?

449
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,400
Mr. Kawano.

450
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:18,160
That's right.

451
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,119
Gayazi is really smart.

452
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,039
Take your men and work with the Kempeitai.

453
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,960
Search all around Songlin Town.

454
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,599
Yes.

455
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,000
Gayazi,

456
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,160
go home and find your mother.

457
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,799
I'm going to find my mom.

458
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,640
Gayazi,

459
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:39,759
come here.

460
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,759
Stay with me a little longer.

461
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,880
What do you want me to do?

462
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,400
Seriously, what do you want me to do?

463
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,480
Mr. Kawano,

464
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,480
Has the news been spread?

465
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:23,920
It's out.

466
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,279
But it's not clear.

467
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
What does that mean?

468
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,440
Do you even know what it means?

469
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,559
Anger can cloud judgment.

470
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,160
This trip to Songlin Town wasn't for nothing.

471
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,599
Shopkeeper Tong slipped away.

472
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,720
We'll use bigger bait.

473
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,839
Keep a close eye on Caifeng.

474
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
I need to go back.

475
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,440
To catch a bigger fish.

476
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,359
Yes.

477
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,079
I'm watching closely.

478
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,119
Want to play a game with me?

479
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,400
Then close your eyes first.

480
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,799
Let me be honest too.

481
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,680
The warehouse for these goods,

482
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,359
you'd better not let me know

483
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,119
where it is.

484
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,200
Also, the goods in the Xiaye River warehouse,

485
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,279
count them up

486
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,759
and hand them all over to Boss Shao.

487
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,079
What's wrong?

488
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,359
Understood.

489
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,480
Ninety thousand.

490
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,680
Boss!

491
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:21,519
Something's wrong!

492
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,160
The Xiaye River warehouse is on fire!

493
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,559
The Japanese inside the pass

494
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,400
got a real beating from us.

495
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,160
We've been bullied for so long.

496
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,680
Finally, we see the light.

497
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
The Japanese used to be strong, and we were weak.

498
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,440
Now it's our turn to stand tall.

499
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:56,720
It's time to fight them.

500
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,160
I'm done with guns.

501
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,160
Hey.

502
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:14,640
Caifeng.

503
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,440
I was just about to talk to you.

504
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,359
I'm planning to go to Songlin Town.

505
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,319
to visit you all.

506
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,079
Sir, the baby is born.

507
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,559
It's a healthy baby boy.

508
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,599
Come and take a look.

509
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,440
My son.

510
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,039
What should we name him?

511
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:15,960
I'll let you decide.

512
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,400
Let's call him Gayazi.

513
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,440
Is that okay?

514
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Gayazi.

515
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,559
Agreed.

516
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,119
Dad.

517
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
Where are you going?

518
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,119
Where am I going?

519
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,240
I'm going to the restaurant.

520
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,279
Can you not go?

521
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,839
Come play with me.

522
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,680
I'll play with you.

523
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,720
No more earning money.

524
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:45,839
Gayazi.

525
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,079
Dad.

526
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,119
Remember to buy me hawthorn cake.

527
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,319
I'll get you hawthorn cake.

528
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,599
Yes, give me a kiss, quick.

529
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,559
Dad, I'll wait for you.

530
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:58,640
Alright, alright.

531
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,160
Dear,

532
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,319
I'm lucky from my past life.

533
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,519
To have met you.

534
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,400
Living with you,

535
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,799
I've had a few good years.

536
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,240
I'm truly content.

537
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,240
Don't worry.

538
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,359
It's not that I can't endure hardship.

539
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,559
I'm not someone who can't handle things.

540
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,920
But I have just one request.

541
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,799
Our son's death

542
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,359
must be avenged.

543
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,279
Go do what you need to do.

544
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,599
Make it clear for me.

545
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,640
Handle it cleanly.

546
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,200
Remember,

547
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,319
my son and I

548
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,759
are watching you from here.

549
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,920
Chief Xiao.

550
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,079
Chief Xiao.

551
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,519
You're here.

552
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,920
You're in your own office,

553
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,039
but still hiding?

554
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,840
No, I'm not.

555
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,480
Look.

556
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,119
It answered for me.

557
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,639
I'm just teasing it.

558
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:47,440
Just letting you know,

559
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,960
the big restaurant is reopening.

560
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,480
I had the new chef make two dishes.

561
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,840
Come, have a taste.

562
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,320
From what you're saying,

563
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,039
there's more to it.

564
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,400
That fire by the river yesterday,

565
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,800
you must know about it.

566
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,559
Chief Xiao's big restaurant

567
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,000
charged me a sky-high price.

568
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,519
I gave you face.

569
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,800
Now the inside is burned.

570
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,400
The goods are gone too.

571
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,599
I got nothing out of it.

572
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,719
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

573
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:21,880
No.

574
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,559
Wait a moment.

575
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,320
Let me think, let me sort this out.

576
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,840
The restaurant,

577
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,760
and the goods,

578
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,079
did we sign a contract?

579
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,000
The items,

580
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:38,159
were they handed over to you?

581
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,519
Everything was given to you.

582
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,360
If something goes wrong,

583
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,039
then you come to me.

584
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,039
I'm really being wronged.

585
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
You're wronged?

586
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,519
I'm more wronged than Dou E.

587
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,000
If you talk like that,

588
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,280
then I have to wonder,

589
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:55,599
are you

590
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,599
using the Japanese influence

591
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,400
to ambush me?

592
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,840
Ambush?

593
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,559
If I wanted to ambush you,

594
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,079
I wouldn't use

595
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,599
such a lowly method.

596
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:08,840
Besides,

597
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,679
if I really wanted to ambush you,

598
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,599
what's inside here

599
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,519
wouldn't be food,

600
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,280
it wouldn't be dishes.

601
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,280
It'd probably be your head.

602
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,599
So who set the fire?

603
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,960
How would I know?

604
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,840
I'm the police chief,

605
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,320
not the fire chief.

606
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,159
The food is pretty expensive.

607
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,360
You don't need to try it.

608
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,719
Here's two bottles of liquor, take care.

609
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,320
Come back when you've enjoyed it.

610
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:19,360
Platoon Leader.

611
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,159
Come on.

612
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,320
Why are you all so good to me?

613
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,559
Isn't that obvious?

614
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:29,480
What's up?

615
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,719
There's no liquor.

616
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,760
Not going to do anything, huh?

617
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,000
Should I go up front

618
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,000
and get you a little more?

619
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,360
Hurry up and eat.

620
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:39,719
Come on, quick.

621
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,599
Come, come.

622
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,760
You look better now.

623
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,719
Compared to when I first saw you,

624
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,239
you've really improved.

625
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,239
On this trip to Mudanjiang,

626
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,800
I didn't expect we'd find Lao Tang.

627
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,039
Even more surprising,

628
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,960
was running into you.

629
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,480
It's like heaven smiled on us.

630
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,159
All these years weren't wasted.

631
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,360
You've been looking for me all this time?

632
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:32,480
Of course.

633
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Even when we were there,

634
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,239
we kept asking people

635
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,000
to look for you everywhere.

636
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,039
Then why haven't you let me rejoin?

637
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,559
You still have injuries.

638
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:47,679
Once you're healed, you can come back.

639
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:48,760
I'm already healed.

640
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,480
What's the rush?

641
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,239
We've made it through all these years.

642
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,800
A day or two doesn't matter.

643
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,400
Eat up, eat up.

644
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:02,679
Platoon Leader.

645
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,840
Will the team really still accept me?

646
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,519
What are you saying?

647
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,760
As long as we're together,

648
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,880
and have fought side by side,

649
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,480
we'll always be comrades.

650
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,360
Don't forget,

651
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,320
we crawled out

652
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,079
from piles of corpses in the deep forest.

653
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,119
We survived together.

654
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:34,960
You eat first.

655
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,000
I'm heading out.

656
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Uncle, where are you going?

657
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,280
Don't ask so much.

658
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,000
Just eat.

659
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:26,760
It's Yunhu.

660
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:39,079
He's back.

661
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,480
How is it?

662
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:42,679
Don't worry.

663
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,679
I handed over the codebook as soon as I got back to the city.

664
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,079
Gave it straight to the instructor.

665
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,519
That's great.

666
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,559
But there's one more thing.

667
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,199
Lao Tang's son was killed.

668
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,360
What?

669
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:54,719
What happened?

670
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,599
Kawano.

671
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,639
It was Dakuozhi who forced Pang Sihai

672
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,559
to tell the truth.

673
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,119
Where is Deyuan now?

674
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,119
Probably already back in Mudanjiang.

675
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,480
Knowing Lao Tang,

676
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,920
he won't let Kawano get away.

677
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,559
He's probably searching everywhere

678
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,679
for Kawano right now.

679
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,199
Where is Kawano?

680
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,440
With the Special Higher Police?

681
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,559
Besides the Special Higher Police,

682
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:51,280
where else could he be?

683
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm asking you.

684
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:53,960
How would I know?

685
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,159
Why are you looking for him?

686
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,400
Gayazi is dead.

687
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,880
Gayazi is dead.

688
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:00,599
What happened?

689
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,760
Kawano killed him.

690
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,960
No.

691
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,519
Gayazi is dead.

692
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,280
Kawano killed him.

693
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,519
That doesn't add up.

694
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,679
Don't worry about that for now.

695
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,039
Just tell me where he could go.

696
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,960
What's with your attitude?

697
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,840
You want revenge?

698
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,400
So what?

699
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:17,960
My son is dead.

700
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,960
Can't I take revenge?

701
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,119
You're going alone

702
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,199
to kill a Special Higher Police chief?

703
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:25,239
That's suicide.

704
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,119
It's none of your business if I die.

705
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,039
He has to die.

706
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,000
Just tell me,

707
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,840
do you know or not?

708
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,280
Let me tell you,

709
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,800
even if I knew where he was,

710
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,159
I couldn't tell you.

711
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,119
Well, well.

712
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,039
Besides,

713
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:38,119
staying alive is most important now.

714
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,800
You need to live to make money.

715
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,320
With money, you can buy your life.

716
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,199
With life, you can keep having kids.

717
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:43,719
Once you have that—
