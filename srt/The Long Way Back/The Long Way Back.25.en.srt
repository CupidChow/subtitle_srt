1
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,359
A person

2
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,560
Has to stand tall, right?

3
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,319
Why are you telling me this?

4
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,680
What's the point?

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
Because we all swore an oath

6
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,959
This blood in our veins

7
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,640
is meant to be shed on this land

8
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,439
What blood?

9
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,280
My blood dried up long ago

10
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,599
Give me a straight answer

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,879
What we said before

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,840
Does it still count?

13
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,560
What did we say back then?

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,480
We said too much

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,039
Just treat it as nonsense

16
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,719
Tang Deyuan

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,159
Is that something a person should say?

18
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,479
Back in the labor camp

19
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,360
We made a promise

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,120
You'd drive to pick us up

21
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,199
But where were you?

22
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,479
I still haven't settled that score with you

23
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,800
All these years

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,439
Me, Yunhu, and the Squad Leader

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,479
We thought about you every day

26
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,680
Didn't know if you were alive or dead

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,960
Today, the Squad Leader

28
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,520
took a huge risk

29
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,120
to come see you

30
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,919
And now that we meet

31
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,360
this is what you say

32
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,120
Times have changed

33
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,800
You're right

34
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,800
Times are different now

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,000
The situation now

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
is really not like before

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,479
What's different?

38
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,319
What do you mean?

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,599
This place

40
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,000
isn't ruled by the Japanese anymore

41
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,080
Old Tang

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,000
The Japanese

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,319
won't last much longer

44
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,360
Come on, give me a break

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,159
We've said that for years

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,319
So many have died

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
What did we get in return?

48
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,680
At least we're still alive

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,159
Around us

50
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,719
so many comrades' blood debts

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,360
We have to settle them

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,599
I want to, but how?

53
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,599
Can we ever settle them all?

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,400
This time

55
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,879
We'll settle them all together

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
If you trust me

57
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,120
I trust you

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,719
But how can I trust you?

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,400
Even now, you guys

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,639
won't tell me the truth

61
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,319
Fine

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,520
I'll give you the truth

63
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,639
Our unit is still together

64
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,759
In Songlin Town, those two didn't wait for you

65
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,759
They waited for me

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,439
Except for you

67
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,080
Xiao Gui and Xiao Hua

68
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,159
The three of us

69
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,599
crossed the river to the Soviet Union together

70
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,199
We

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,520
are what you called

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,360
the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Teaching Brigade

73
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,040
You're really not afraid.

74
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,160
That I might betray you?

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,720
If we dared to come, we're not afraid.

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,920
Besides,

77
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,800
just now you even

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
called me Squad Leader.

79
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,800
Deyuan,

80
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,120
I can tell

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,279
your conscience is still intact.

82
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,000
You're still a Chinese.

83
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,519
A Chinese.

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,000
In this place,

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,319
how many Chinese are left?

86
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,560
How can you say there aren't any?

87
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,759
Open your eyes and look.

88
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,959
All those walking in the streets,

89
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,600
aren't they Chinese?

90
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,319
Those hiding in the woods,

91
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,399
fighting the Japanese,

92
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,120
aren't they Chinese?

93
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,680
Datouzi Ridge, the labor camp,

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,279
on the northern slope, hanging from the cliff branches,

95
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,600
those hanging there, aren't they Chinese?

96
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,879
And those buried in the mass grave,

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,879
When you say these things,

98
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,560
can you face

99
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,639
those who have passed, above and below?

100
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,480
They were Chinese.

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
But they're all dead.

103
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,399
So many Chinese have died.

104
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,680
How many are still alive?

105
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,839
My life may not be worth much,

106
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,480
but surviving till now wasn't easy.

107
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,279
What I need to do now

108
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,720
is to be true to myself,

109
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,240
and to my family.

110
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,600
Deyuan,

111
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,519
the Soviets have already reached

112
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,000
the Germans' homeland.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,399
The Japanese in the Pacific

114
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
are being beaten

115
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
so hard by the Americans they can't breathe.

116
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,920
The fascists are finished.

117
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Northeast China will soon be liberated.

118
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,040
I'm not interested in all that.

119
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,079
It's too far from me.

120
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,120
Fine.

121
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,480
Let's talk about something closer.

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,920
The situation in the country now

123
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,720
is very different from before.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,079
The Japanese in the pass

125
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,879
are being beaten badly by us.

126
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,639
We've been bullied for so long,

127
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,240
finally we see the dawn.

128
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,480
Before, the Japanese were strong and we were weak.

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,000
Now it's our turn to stand up.

130
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,279
It's time to fight them.

131
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,240
That's right.

132
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,319
The time and place are right,

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,720
we just need the people.

134
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,839
We're here to find you.

135
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,920
Don't blame me for not

136
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
telling you the truth these days.

137
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,560
You should know

138
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,439
we have discipline.

139
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:30,800
That's good.

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,439
Discipline is a good thing.

141
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,279
Don't tell me anything.

142
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,480
I don't want to hear it.

143
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,639
Sit down.

144
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,439
What are you doing?

145
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,959
You won't listen to anything now, huh?

146
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,800
Nothing gets through to you.

147
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,399
Old Tang,

148
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,680
how did you end up like this?

149
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,199
Let me tell you,

150
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,360
if you trust us,

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
this time we can really make it.

152
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,360
Let me make myself clear.

153
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,439
Even if you manage to break in,

154
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,480
it'll be over a million bodies paving the way.

155
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,959
That's exactly why,

156
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
we need you most right now.

157
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,399
Me?

158
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,079
Hurry up and eat.

159
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,240
This meal is on me.

160
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,360
Leave as soon as you're done.

161
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,600
Don't come back.

162
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,480
I'll pretend I never saw you.

163
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,759
Alright.

164
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,199
While my heart hasn't turned cold yet.

165
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,519
Stop right there.

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,720
What are you doing?

167
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,800
What do you think I'm doing?

168
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,079
Boss.

169
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,800
What's wrong?

170
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,240
There's a fight at the door.

171
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
You'd better go check it out.

172
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,120
Who is it?

173
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,319
A beggar.

174
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,160
He stole a roast chicken from our shop.

175
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,759
They're about to beat him to death.

176
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,560
You filthy beggar!

177
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,480
How dare you steal a roast chicken!

178
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,399
That's what you get for stealing!

179
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,240
Do you know how much chicken

180
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,319
costs per half a kilogram now?

181
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,120
You dare steal from here?

182
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,680
Do you know whose shop this is?

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,720
That's what you get for stealing!

184
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,319
Hit him harder!

185
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,199
That's what you get for stealing!

186
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:55,839
That's what you get!

187
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,199
What are you doing?

188
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,519
Er Ye.

189
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,000
Sorry to trouble you, sir.

190
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,480
You've really outdone yourselves.

191
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,680
Beating up a beggar?

192
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,680
Er Ye.

193
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,279
We're just trying to help you out.

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
This beggar is way too bold.

195
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,800
He dared to steal from us.

196
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,439
Isn't this asking for trouble?

197
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,160
What did he steal?

198
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
He stole a phoenix.

199
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,879
You beat him like this?

200
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,639
You guys,

201
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,720
Go settle the bill.

202
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,040
Get lost.

203
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,040
Er Ye.

204
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,160
Er Ye.

205
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,360
Alright, stop staring.

206
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,080
Go on, disperse.

207
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,879
Who is it? What's going on?

208
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,519
None of your business.

209
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,799
What's wrong? You didn't touch the food.

210
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,279
Doesn't suit my taste.

211
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,159
It's fine.

212
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,039
If you're not eating, then leave.

213
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Go quickly, I won't see you off.

214
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,159
What do you mean?

215
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,639
He's clinging on.

216
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,360
Boss.

217
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,519
He insists on bowing to you in person.

218
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,919
Why bow?

219
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,679
Just give him some food.

220
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,519
Let him leave quickly.

221
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,759
I told him, but he won't listen.

222
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,600
He insists on coming up.

223
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,320
I can't hold him back.

224
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,720
Boss.

225
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,200
If it weren't for you today,

226
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,919
I'd have lost my life here.

227
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,679
Thank you, you really are...

228
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,399
People weren't wrong about you.

229
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,639
A living Bodhisattva.

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
Your great kindness,

231
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,720
I won't forget it.

232
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,360
May your fortune fill Mada Mountain.

233
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,440
May your business reach Vladivostok.

234
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,840
Go mind your own business.

235
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,320
Squad Leader.

236
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,200
Come in and talk.

237
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,480
Xiao Gui! Xiao Gui!

238
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,159
Xiao Gui, it's really you!

239
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,240
Gui'er, you're still alive!

240
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,320
We all thought you were dead.

241
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,039
Gui'er.

242
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,120
It's really you.

243
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:30,799
Gui'er.

244
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,840
Gui'er.

245
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,240
What's with you guys?

246
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,440
Everyone's here.

247
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,840
I'm not dreaming, am I?

248
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,840
Don't just stand there.

249
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:42,480
Sit down.

250
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,200
Hurry, hurry.

251
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,080
Quick, sit down, sit down.

252
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,000
Hurry up.

253
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,240
Sit down quickly.

254
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,000
Come on.

255
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,799
Gui'er.

256
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,120
What happened to your leg?

257
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,559
Uncle.

258
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,519
I finally found you all.

259
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,360
Don't cry, don't cry.

260
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,120
It's good to see you.

261
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,799
Get up, get up.

262
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,879
Get up.

263
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,960
You must be hungry.

264
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,399
Eat something, go ahead.

265
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,320
Where's Sister Hua?

266
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,879
Where's Little White Horse?

267
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,440
Everyone who could come is here.

268
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,120
Those who didn't come...

269
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,759
...aren't with us anymore.

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Xiao Gui.

271
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,600
What happened to your hand?

272
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,360
Yeah.

273
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,279
How did it end up like this?

274
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,759
Frozen, it's frozen.

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,639
It's frostbitten.

276
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,879
Gui'er.

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
You, you...

278
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
How did you find this place?

279
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,840
I...

280
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,120
I begged my way here.

281
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,120
I...

282
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,279
I thought Mudanjiang

283
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,159
was a big city.

284
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,360
Who would've thought...

285
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,000
Three days on the street,

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,080
I couldn't get a single bite.

287
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,639
People said

288
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,320
the boss of Tianhao Grand Restaurant

289
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,159
is a kind person.

290
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,240
So I came here.

291
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,759
Didn't expect I'd almost get beaten to death.

292
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,799
Gui'er, why...

293
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,120
Why didn't you go home?

294
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,159
I did go back.

295
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,000
At home...

296
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,240
I couldn't stay.

297
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:17,679
People in town

298
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,120
all know I'm with the Anti-Japanese Army.

299
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,320
They sent people to catch me.

300
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,399
My dad told me to run.

301
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,080
I went to work for others.

302
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,799
But they recognized me as Anti-Japanese again.

303
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,519
Uncle.

304
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,840
All these years,

305
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,600
wherever I hide, they find me.

306
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,480
I've been running nonstop.

307
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,600
I don't want to live anymore.

308
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
But I didn't dare to die either.

309
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,320
Uncle.

310
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,919
I dream about you all every day.

311
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,639
I dream of chasing after you.

312
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,840
But I can't catch up.

313
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,080
Gui'er.

314
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,600
Gui'er

315
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,440
Alright.

316
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,840
Stop asking.

317
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,279
Let him eat quickly.

318
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,960
Yes, yes, yes.

319
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:19,879
Eat quickly.

320
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,720
Hurry up.

321
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,200
Gui'er

322
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,159
Xiao Gui

323
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,120
Take your time eating.

324
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,399
Platoon Leader

325
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,600
We're not done with him yet.

326
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,279
What do you mean?

327
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,519
What are you talking about?

328
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,559
Why are you three still here?

329
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,159
Why aren't you leaving?

330
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,919
Go, hurry up.

331
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,000
What, are you really staying here?

332
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,279
No, no.

333
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,039
Leave? Leave for what?

334
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,200
Who wants to leave?

335
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,440
Uncle

336
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,799
If you

337
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,279
If you leave, take me with you.

338
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,159
Gui'er, Gui'er

339
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,279
Gui'er

340
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,000
You're injured right now.

341
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,399
I... I...

342
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,639
How about this?

343
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:04,879
Deyuan

344
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:05,879
You

345
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,279
Can you let Xiao Gui stay here

346
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,240
to recover?

347
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,519
Once he's healed,

348
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,679
we'll talk about the rest later.

349
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,639
Alright.

350
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,120
Then Xiao Gui stays.

351
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,240
You three leave.

352
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,000
Platoon Leader

353
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,440
Why are you begging him?

354
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,120
Xiao Gui

355
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:27,720
Er Ban Zhang isn't

356
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,960
the same as before.

357
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,679
He's now Tang Er Ye.

358
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,039
Let's go, let's go.

359
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,679
Fuqing

360
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,679
Stop talking.

361
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,679
Gui'er

362
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,440
Get well soon.

363
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,799
We'll definitely come get you.

364
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,519
Alright?

365
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:42,960
No.

366
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,120
Uncle

367
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,519
Do you mean it?

368
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,480
When have I ever lied to you?

369
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,960
Gui'er

370
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,080
Fuqing, Yunhu

371
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,159
Let's go.

372
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,000
This...

373
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,639
Why leave Xiao Gui here?

374
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,159
What's the point of leaving him here?

375
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,600
He really left Xiao Gui here.

376
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,600
I get it now.

377
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,440
Are you trying to leave an excuse

378
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
to come back for Old Tang?

379
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,600
No, that's part of it.

380
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,559
Mainly, we need to

381
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,320
stay alert.

382
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Old Tang used to be

383
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,279
a brother who fought with us.

384
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,799
But after years apart, look at him now.

385
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,720
He gets cold and wants us gone.

386
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
What can you do?

387
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,559
Old Tang,

388
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,720
he turns on people so fast.

389
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,519
What nonsense is that?

390
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,519
I really want to slap him.

391
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,080
From today on,

392
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,080
everyone stay sharp.

393
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,279
Stop staring.

394
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,679
What, aren't you hungry?

395
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,279
Eat.

396
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,519
What a coincidence.

397
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,759
I never thought I'd see you here.

398
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,799
To meet you all.

399
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Eat quickly.

400
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,079
Xiao Gui

401
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:11,759
Squad Leader

402
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,079
Alright.

403
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,319
All done washing.

404
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,960
Your face is nice and clean.

405
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:20,680
Come here.

406
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,880
Let me trim your hair.

407
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,480
Here you go.

408
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
Thank you, Squad Leader.

409
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,400
No need to thank me.

410
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,279
But, but...

411
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,160
Why did you just now...

412
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,319
send the old Platoon Leader and the others

413
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,119
all away?

414
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
Why are you asking so much?

415
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,839
Come on, Squad Leader, that's not fair.

416
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,720
If you don't tell me the truth,

417
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,960
I can't stay here with you.

418
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,480
What, so

419
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,319
I'm the one begging you

420
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,240
to stay here?

421
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,319
No, that's not it.

422
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,559
That's not what I meant.

423
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,799
Still,

424
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm just curious, all these years,

425
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,200
have you all been together?

426
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,000
Who's been with them?

427
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,720
But just now, you all...

428
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,599
Let's not talk about this, okay?

429
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,319
Let me put it this way.

430
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,440
Now I'm

431
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,039
the owner of Tian Tian Hao Da Restaurant.

432
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,519
Those guys,

433
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,240
to me, they're all debt collectors.

434
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,160
You too.

435
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,599
If I didn't feel sorry for you,

436
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,680
I wouldn't have taken you in.

437
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
Just think of it as me doing a good deed for the day.

438
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,319
Squad Leader...

439
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,920
You've changed.

440
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,759
In this land of mountains and rivers,

441
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,759
the water runs deep and the turtles are big.

442
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
How could I not change?

443
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:51,680
Sit down.

444
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,759
Then tell me later

445
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,839
where the Platoon Leader and the others are.

446
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,599
Once my leg heals,

447
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,400
I'll go find them.

448
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,640
How would I know where they are?

449
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,079
When your leg's better,

450
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,799
you can look for whoever you want.

451
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,160
Oh, right.

452
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,880
Stop always calling me Squad Leader.

453
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,680
That title.

454
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:24,759
Call me something else.

455
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,039
Then what should I call you?

456
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,119
Anything's fine.

457
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:29,400
Er Ye

458
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,720
Brother

459
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:31,799
You pick.

460
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,039
I'll just call you Brother then.

461
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,039
That's fine.

462
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,359
Brother Deyuan

463
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,000
You head back.

464
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,880
I'll walk back.

465
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:08,759
Okay, Boss.

466
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,599
The three of us

467
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,799
crossed the river together to the Soviet Union.

468
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,359
People like us

469
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,680
are what you called

470
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:25,039
the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Teaching Brigade.

471
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,319
Whether the Americans won or not,

472
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,119
we don't know.

473
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,359
But the Soviets win a lot.

474
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,440
Life's getting tough.

475
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,599
From now on,

476
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,480
the fascists' days are numbered.

477
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,160
Northeast China will be liberated soon.

478
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:03,839
Feng'er

479
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,160
I've been thinking,

480
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,519
look at things now,

481
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,319
even the wheels

482
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,759
can turn on their own.

483
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,759
They can move forward by themselves.

484
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,559
Right?

485
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,039
Shouldn't we also

486
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,480
take it easy for a while?

487
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,319
Gaya

488
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,880
has never been out all his life.

489
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,480
Isn't that right?

490
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,240
Shouldn't you take him

491
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,640
to visit your family?

492
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,519
I don't have a family to go back to.

493
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,680
Wherever you left from,

494
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,359
that's your home.

495
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,000
All these years,

496
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,279
you haven't gone back, have you?

497
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,599
You're in Songlin Town,

498
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,559
don't you have a god-sister here?

499
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,720
Shouldn't you

500
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,799
go visit her?

501
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,400
Are you going?

502
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,279
Everyone's leaving.

503
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,599
If everyone leaves, what about the restaurant?

504
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,519
You and our son go first.

505
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,359
Is that okay?

506
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,960
I understand.

507
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,359
Whatever you ask me to do,

508
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,559
I'll listen to you.

509
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,559
I won't ask questions.

510
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,039
And I won't cause you trouble.

511
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,440
I know

512
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,039
every decision you make

513
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,759
is for the good of me and our child.

514
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,920
Just remember,

515
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,079
wherever you are,

516
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,400
that's our home.

517
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,200
Having you and our child,

518
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,200
is truly a blessing from my past life.

519
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm lucky to have you.

520
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,319
Kiddo.

521
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:29,960
Dad.

522
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,880
The pinwheel you made for me is so pretty.

523
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,359
Isn't it?

524
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,440
Listen, kiddo,

525
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,680
when you get there, listen to your mom.

526
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,359
Don't run around.

527
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,400
Understand?

528
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,160
When I come back,

529
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,119
I'll buy you hawthorn cake.

530
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,200
Okay?

531
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,640
Okay.

532
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,519
Give dad a kiss.

533
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,160
Yes, give me a kiss, quick.

534
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,119
Dad, I'll wait for you.

535
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,160
Alright, alright.

536
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:56,559
Let's go.

537
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,400
Don't worry, don't worry.

538
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:19,920
Take care.

539
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,279
Alright.

540
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:23,799
Come again next time.

541
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,400
Sure.

542
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,759
Take care.

543
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,119
Please come inside.

544
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,440
This way.

545
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,279
Let me help out.

546
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,640
Go back, no need.

547
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,119
It's just my leg that's bad.

548
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,960
My hands are fine.

549
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,000
The boss said

550
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,079
you shouldn't come out.

551
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,039
Go back quickly.

552
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,240
Go back, go back.

553
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,279
You go back.

554
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,160
What are you doing?

555
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,279
With your condition,

556
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,640
what work can you do?

557
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:58,680
Go back inside.

558
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,359
Go inside.

559
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,720
Young man,

560
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,160
your leg,

561
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,079
let me take a look.

562
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,680
My leg is fine.

563
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,480
You can't delay treatment.

564
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
If you don't treat it soon,

565
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,759
you might end up disabled.

566
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
No, I don't need treatment.

567
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,759
It'll heal on its own.

568
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,799
Wait a minute.

569
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:24,759
They say it's serious.

570
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,599
Why don't you get it treated?

571
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:30,839
Don't worry.

572
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,920
I won't charge you.

573
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,799
I can tell

574
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,720
you're also a poor soul.

575
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,720
Let me ask,

576
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,559
his leg,

577
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,200
can it be cured?

578
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,799
With my years of experience,

579
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,599
it shouldn't be a problem.

580
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,160
See?

581
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,839
Great.

582
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,599
If you can really cure it,

583
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,880
money's not a problem.

584
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:54,960
I'll even give you a reward.

585
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,240
The road is long.

586
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,599
Do good every day.

587
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,039
I said I won't take his money.

588
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,240
No matter what, I won't accept it.

589
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,039
Do good every day.

590
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,119
Why are you still standing there?

591
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,039
Go back inside and take care of your leg.

592
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,039
Hurry up.

593
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,319
Thanks.

594
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,960
We're here.

595
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:11,640
Boss lady.

596
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:12,960
Sorry, boss lady.

597
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,559
Didn't expect this road to be so tough.

598
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,920
Guards everywhere, checkpoints every few steps.

599
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:16,960
It held us up.

600
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:17,839
Don't rush.

601
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,799
Stay the night before heading back.

602
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:19,640
No need to rest.

603
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,200
The boss needs the car tomorrow.

604
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,079
Let the boss know.

605
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,960
Tell him not to worry.

606
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,000
Don't worry, boss lady.

607
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,880
Mom, what's that sound?

608
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,359
It's the sound of a gong.

609
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,359
Yama the King of Hell is holding court.

610
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,480
The black and white spirits are coming.

611
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,480
Birds and beasts, make way.

612
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:37,839
It's nothing.

613
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,680
Move aside.

614
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,440
Yama is holding court.

615
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,279
Move aside.

616
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,240
Move aside.

617
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,079
Yama is holding court.

618
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,519
Birds and beasts.

619
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,519
Move aside.

620
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:47,680
Move aside.

621
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,839
Move aside.

622
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,400
Move aside.

623
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,079
Yama is holding court.

624
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,880
Xiao Wuzi.

625
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:58,480
Boss Tong.

626
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,839
No longer in the fur business.

627
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,720
Now running an inn.

628
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,200
Xiao Wuzi.

629
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,319
Since you left,

630
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,640
it's been years since you came back.

631
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,839
No matter how long,

632
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,319
Songlin Town is always my home.

633
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,000
That's right.

634
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,359
Call your uncle.

635
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,440
Uncle.

636
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,599
Good kid.

637
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,160
Uncle will buy you candy.

638
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Thank you, uncle.

639
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,640
Boss Tong.

640
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
What's going on outside?

641
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,599
All that shouting and banging the gong.

642
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,079
What?

643
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,880
Did Boss Huang scare you?

644
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,440
Which Boss Huang?

645
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,480
The one from the money house.

646
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,880
Huang Youquan.

647
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:26,960
It's fine.

648
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,200
He's not violent.

649
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
Just shouts, doesn't get physical.

650
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,319
Move aside.

651
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,359
How did he end up like this?

652
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,079
Hard to say.

653
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,799
Ever since two years ago,

654
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,880
when his son was taken by the Japanese,

655
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,599
after he was captured,

656
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,640
he's been like this ever since.

657
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,640
To ransom his son,

658
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,440
he lost the whole money house.

659
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,599
But even now,

660
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,599
he doesn't know where his son is held.

661
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,160
What's he always muttering about?

662
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,240
Yama is holding court.

663
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:48,759
Yama.

664
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,279
Yama is holding court.

665
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,519
Yama is holding court.

666
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,720
Don't be scared, don't be scared.

667
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,240
Yama is holding court.

668
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,480
Crazy old man.

669
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,319
Stop talking nonsense.

670
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,480
Black and white spirits, move aside.

671
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,559
Boss Huang.

672
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,319
Boss Huang.

673
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,279
Go home quickly.

674
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
I have guests here.

675
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,079
Yama is holding court.

676
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:01,640
Alright, hold court.

677
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,240
Yama is holding court.

678
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,720
Hold court, hold court.

679
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,200
Yama is holding court.

680
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,720
Don't scare the kids.

681
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,079
Move aside.

682
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:04,920
Move aside.

683
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,079
Yama is holding court.

684
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,319
Yama is holding court.

685
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:13,880
You're here.

686
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,319
You're here alone.

687
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,400
What are you standing around for?

688
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,039
You, you, you...

689
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,799
You didn't bring my pipe down?

690
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:23,759
You didn't ask me to.

691
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:24,759
To bring your pipe.

692
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,799
Aren't you smoking it now?

693
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:26,880
This lousy thing...

694
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,119
I'm still not used to it.

695
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,160
It's all bits in my mouth.

696
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,079
Should I go get it for you?

697
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,160
No, no.

698
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:33,880
You...

699
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,480
What's wrong?

700
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,279
In your heart...

701
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,279
Are you still worried about Lao Tang?

702
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,920
Not just him.

703
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,680
Also Xiao Gui.

704
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,839
I've been thinking.

705
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,200
Gui'er is the youngest in our squad.

706
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,519
He's the youngest.

707
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,920
And the only child in his family.

708
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,559
He could've lived a good life.

709
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,319
But he ran out to fight with us.

710
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,119
Suffering like this.

711
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:03,880
Back then, he...

712
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,079
Gave money and people.

713
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
To support our team.

714
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,559
He made a big contribution.

715
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,799
All the hardships we avoided,

716
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,839
He suffered them alone.

717
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,759
Look at the state he's in now.

718
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Don't worry about Xiao Gui.

719
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,279
Lao Tang would never hurt him.

720
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,160
Right?

721
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,240
But we don't know

722
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,319
After all these days,

723
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,599
What's really on Lao Tang's mind.

724
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,759
What is he really thinking?

725
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,240
If you ask me,

726
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,359
We should go see Lao Tang again.

727
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,200
Lao Tang is a smart guy.

728
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:38,759
If he figures it out,

729
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,240
It'll happen in an instant.

730
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,119
But...

731
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,960
I don't think it's that simple.

732
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,880
He spoke so harshly.

733
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,319
I feel like he did it on purpose.

734
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,839
He told me before,

735
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,000
That his restaurant

736
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,559
Is watched by many eyes.

737
00:31:59,119 --> 00:31:59,799
Back then,

738
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,119
I thought he was just scaring me.

739
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,279
But now that I think about it,

740
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,519
When I was there,

741
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,279
It was true.

742
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,319
He kept hiring and firing workers.

743
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,400
Maybe he was being cautious.

744
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,519
You thought the same as me.

745
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,880
I was thinking,

746
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,480
If we fail our mission,

747
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,839
We might get Deyuan in trouble.

748
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,000
Now Lao Tang

749
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
Is with Xiao Tielin.

750
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:23,480
And Xiao Tielin

751
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,359
Works for the Japanese.

752
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,519
The Japanese will definitely investigate

753
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,720
Everyone around Xiao Tielin.

754
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,200
If they find out

755
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,440
Lao Tang was with the Anti-Japanese Army,

756
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,279
They won't

757
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,279
Fully trust Lao Tang.

758
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,480
Otherwise there wouldn't be

759
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,599
Fake Anti-Japanese agents showing up.

760
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,200
Right?

761
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,440
So basically,

762
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,480
Lao Tang always has

763
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,960
A gun pointed at his head.

764
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,759
Right?

765
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,200
Whether it's the Tokko

766
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Or the police station,

767
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:52,920
If we want Deyuan

768
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,160
To safely rejoin us,

769
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,000
We need to remove that threat.

770
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,119
So...

771
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,400
I'll summarize the situation here

772
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,720
And put it all together.

773
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,480
Then report to the instructor.

774
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:09,960
No.

775
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,319
We still need to see Lao Tang.

776
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,119
Get to the bottom of things.

777
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,839
And check on Xiao Gui.

778
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,799
Make sure everything's solid.

779
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,920
Then report.

780
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:19,880
Alright.

781
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,079
I'll go this time.

782
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,559
He won't get anything out of them.

783
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,759
Okay, you go.

784
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:25,759
You're much quicker.

785
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,920
Hello, Tian Tian Hao Restaurant.

786
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
I want to speak to Tang Er Ye.

787
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:44,799
Please hold on.

788
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,839
Boss.

789
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,960
Someone's asking for you.

790
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:52,799
Hello, who is this?

791
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:55,640
Hello?

792
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,480
Why isn't anyone speaking?

793
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,359
Hello?

794
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:04,279
Hello?

795
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,680
That's strange.

796
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,639
Master Tang

797
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:41,039
Hiding here, huh?

798
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,639
Why are you here?

799
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,920
I have just one question for you today.

800
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,079
Did you change your mind or not?

801
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,599
Do your own job.

802
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,920
Don't touch me.

803
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,239
Take your hand off me.

804
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,880
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

805
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,559
I told you not to come again.

806
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,320
Stop wasting my time.

807
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:11,880
It's useless.

808
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,039
Give me a straight answer today.

809
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,719
Boss Tian

810
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,719
Please come inside.

811
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,039
Alright.

812
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,280
Do you know that Boss Tian who just came in?

813
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,960
Do you know who he is?

814
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,840
I don't care who he is.

815
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,119
You have to answer me today.

816
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,079
Let me finish.

817
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,440
He's from the Mudanjiang Police Department.

818
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,679
Deputy Director Morita.

819
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,199
Do you know how many eyes

820
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,119
are watching me outside right now?

821
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,199
You're not afraid to die,

822
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,679
but I am.

823
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,800
Then...

824
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,519
Call two people over.

825
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,280
You're really going to hit me?

826
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,400
Alright, Tang Deyuan.

827
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:56,960
Let's go.

828
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,519
You promised to do business with me.

829
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,800
Now you just quit like that?

830
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,159
Get out.

831
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,760
Aren't you just screwing me over?

832
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,920
Get out.

833
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:04,920
Get lost!

834
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,199
Let me in!

835
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:08,679
Get out.

836
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,320
Fine.

837
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,440
Just you wait.

838
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,079
Get out!

839
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,800
Hey, buddy.

840
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,400
Your wife and kid—

841
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,920
I know where they are.

842
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,639
Add one sweet and sour pork.

843
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,280
Alright.

844
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:29,800
Let go of me!

845
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,000
Let go of me!

846
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,880
Let go of me!

847
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,159
Let go of me!

848
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,079
Let go of me!

849
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,159
Go! Get lost!

850
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:43,800
I'll kill you!

851
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,599
Come here!

852
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,639
Just you wait!

853
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,360
De Yuan

854
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,800
Why are you limping around

855
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,840
What are you doing out here again

856
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,679
Did Fu Qing come by

857
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,239
I heard his voice

858
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,440
Yeah, he came

859
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,920
Where are you going

860
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,519
I'm going to find him

861
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,280
Don't bother, he's gone

862
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,679
Why did he leave

863
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:57,519
Why do you ask

864
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,079
He left, that's all

865
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,280
I made him leave

866
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,239
Why

867
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,559
No reason

868
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,679
I just sent him away

869
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,119
What, your leg's healed

870
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,239
No, it's not

871
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,960
If not, go lie down

872
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,199
Wait till you're better

873
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,079
Then you leave too

874
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,920
Where are you going

875
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,119
I'm going to pee

876
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,440
Is that okay

877
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,239
Watch it

878
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,920
Sorry

879
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,039
Sorry

880
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:54,679
Sorry

881
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,280
Follow him

882
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:33,639
Stop, stop

883
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,000
We can't go any further

884
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,599
This little tail

885
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
Why is he at Tokko

886
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,880
Isn't that Xiao Wuzi

887
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,159
Why didn't you say you were back

888
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,159
What

889
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,679
Are you afraid Fourth Aunt will find out

890
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,000
Fourth Aunt, listen to yourself

891
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,079
I was just about to head out

892
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:05,960
Go visit you at home

893
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:06,960
Call her Fourth Great Aunt

894
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,280
Fourth Great Aunt

895
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,880
Good kid

896
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,320
Take it

897
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,679
It's really sweet, here, eat

898
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,360
Thank you, Fourth Great Aunt

899
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,079
Tonight

900
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,119
Eat at home tonight

901
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:19,880
Alright

902
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,000
Come early, don't forget

903
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,960
Okay, okay, got it

904
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,079
Let's go

905
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,920
Xiao Wuzi, you're back

906
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:25,760
Yeah, I'm back

907
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,800
Come by the house when you have time

908
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:27,719
Sure

909
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,360
Come over and hang out

910
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,519
Isn't this the one from the riverside kiln

911
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,719
The Xiao Wuzi who left

912
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:33,920
Heard about it

913
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,840
She married someone in Mudanjiang

914
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,679
A big boss

915
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,599
No wonder her family is so proud

916
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,360
Watch what you say

917
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:42,000
She found a good man

918
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,880
Yeah, a decent person

919
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
He just hangs around here

920
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,639
What is he doing

921
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,880
Let's go back

922
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,719
Report to the Squad Leader

923
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,119
Wait, wait

924
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:08,800
Boss Tian

925
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Why is he here too

926
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,760
Who's Boss Tian

927
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,039
Boss Tian is Morita

928
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,800
He's the deputy chief of police

929
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,000
Jerk

930
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,000
How do you know

931
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,400
Old Tang told me

932
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,119
Old Tang told you himself

933
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,320
Unlike you

934
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,280
Can't get anything out of him

935
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:31,960
That's not right

936
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,880
Didn't he kick you out

937
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,480
Hurry, drive back

938
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
Still need to report to the Squad Leader

939
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:47,760
Go on

940
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,639
I'll wait for your good news

941
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,079
Yes

942
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,639
Teacher,

943
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,639
You seem to be in a good mood today.

944
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,679
Our Blood Extraction Plan

945
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,440
is starting to show its effectiveness.

946
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,760
The owners of the three parachutes

947
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,840
have been identified.

948
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,239
They are indeed from the 88th Brigade.

949
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,880
They have entered Mudanjiang.

950
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,519
They showed up at Tang Deyuan's restaurant.

951
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:15,960
I also made similar progress today.

952
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,000
Someone caused trouble at the restaurant today.

953
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:21,519
His accomplice

954
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,440
blocked our tail.

955
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,400
The information matches.

956
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,920
It should be the same group.

957
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,440
Finding their hideout

958
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:32,559
will take some more time.

959
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,280
First, increase surveillance on Tang Deyuan's restaurant.

960
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,760
Try to get photos of these people when you can.

961
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,159
I believe

962
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:40,880
they won't be able to stay hidden for long.

963
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,159
They will show up again soon.

964
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:43,280
Teacher,

965
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:45,800
his wife and son

966
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,639
haven't appeared these past two days.

967
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,280
It seems they've left Mudanjiang for Songlin Town.

968
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,119
Does this mean

969
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,880
Tang Deyuan has decided to work for them?

970
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,800
Send people to Songlin Town immediately.

971
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,920
Put Tang Deyuan's wife and son under surveillance.

972
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:01,599
Then,

973
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,199
keep a close watch on Tang Deyuan.
