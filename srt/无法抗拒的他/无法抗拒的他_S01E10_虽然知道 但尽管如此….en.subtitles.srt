1
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,379
Do you regret it?

2
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,634
Do you regret what we did?

3
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,390
Yes.

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,351
I regret it.

5
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,400
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we did.

6
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,070
But I won't blame you.

7
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,405
I brought it on myself.

8
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,577
I knew there was no happy ending for us,

9
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:22,123
but I was an idiot for getting my hopes up
and thinking you could be sincere.

10
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,713
You told me that I had
the right to decide our relationship.

11
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,219
I don't want to see you ever again.

12
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,265
To be honest,

13
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,059
I already knew

14
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,396
that this wasn't love.

15
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,617
I think I know now.

16
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,079
That I'm the one

17
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,625
who ruined everything.

18
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,976
I couldn't sleep at all.

19
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,937
I regret it.

20
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,066
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we did.

21
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,152
Na-bi's pained expression

22
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,281
and her tearful voice

23
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,325
lingered in my head all night.

24
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,447
Funnily enough, what kept me up all night

25
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,199
weren't the harsh words he said to me,

26
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,036
but his warm eyes,

27
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,080
his gentle voice when he called me,

28
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,708
and his soft touch.

29
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,878
I'm so pathetic.

30
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,564
-Hey, Na-bi.
-Hey.

31
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,107
No hangover?

32
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,984
No.

33
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,280
We drank so much after you left.

34
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,491
I never saw Jae-eon drink that much.

35
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,535
I almost died trying to keep up with him.

36
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,626
Jin-su…

37
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,881
You don't have to help me
with my piece anymore.

38
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,718
I can do the rest myself.

39
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,178
Why? This is so sudden.

40
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,473
Well, it's our exam period now.

41
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,518
And I got most of the work done.

42
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,853
Can you tell Jae-eon too?

43
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,898
Okay, then.

44
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,442
Thanks.

45
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,639
Do you have a lot to do?

46
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,558
What?

47
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,809
Hey.

48
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,314
Hey!

49
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,065
What? What is it?

50
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,109
Did you see Gyu-hyun and Bit-na?

51
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,528
No, I don't think so.

52
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,822
Jeez. What's going on with them?

53
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,576
They were fighting all the time,
and now they're leaving me out.

54
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,039
No way. How did she know
I was talking about her?

55
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,709
-What?
-Hey!

56
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,212
I heard you're in our department office.
Is that true?

57
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,797
-Yes. How did you know?
-That's such a relief.

58
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,010
Do you see a laptop near the shelves?

59
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,303
A laptop?

60
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,680
Yes, it's here.

61
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,099
There's a file dated today on the desktop.

62
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,726
Can you send that to me?

63
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,603
What will you do for me, then?

64
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,356
My gosh. Fine, I'll buy you fried chicken.

65
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,900
Okay! Hang on a second.

66
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,365
All right.

67
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,911
Hello?

68
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,080
What's the file…

69
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,582
Hey, it's locked. What's the password?

70
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,792
What?

71
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,295
Oh, right. The password…

72
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,091
Well…

73
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,927
What is it?
Is it the same as your bank account?

74
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,053
I won't steal your money.

75
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,680
Just tell me.

76
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,519
"Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun."

77
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,396
Hang on.

78
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,898
What did you say? I can't hear you.

79
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,112
"Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun."

80
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,156
Jeez. What are you saying?
I can't hear you!

81
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,285
Darn it! "Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun"!

82
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,079
What?

83
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,039
What did you just say?

84
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,711
"Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun"?

85
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,004
What?

86
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,590
You don't mean the Nam Gyu-hyun
I know, do you?

87
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,968
If you don't send it in five minutes,
you're dead.

88
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,595
Thank you so much, buddy.

89
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,185
I understand.

90
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,939
-Your cake is ready.
-I want to die.

91
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,567
The totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun
will go get it.

92
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,694
Hey, don't tease me!

93
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,112
-I'll be back.
-Jeez!

94
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,489
Don't make that cheesy voice!
Or I'll kill you!

95
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,535
Jeez! I just want to die.

96
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,470
YU NA-BI

97
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,018
And you say you really like me?

98
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,937
That's nonsense.

99
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,150
Hey, Na-bi.

100
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,110
Hi.

101
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,407
You seemed to have lost more weight.
Are you okay?

102
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,534
I didn't get much sleep.

103
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,953
You must be overworking.

104
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,209
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Jae-eon at all these days.

105
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,795
He was acting like
he was working so hard to help you.

106
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,717
I said I'd finish my piece by myself.

107
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,261
It's almost over, anyway.

108
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,305
Oh, really?

109
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,849
I thought he was…

110
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,143
We'll head inside first.

111
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,352
Okay.

112
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,820
What's Na-bi going to do?

113
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,489
This is terrible.

114
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,783
She won't be able to hand it in
before the exhibition.

115
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,704
I can't believe it.
Why did it have to fall right here?

116
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,290
What's going on?

117
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,335
How did this fan fall from the ceiling?

118
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,216
Hey, Na-bi!

119
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,697
-Why did it…
-Let's go. Stop looking.

120
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,076
Go back to your work. Stop staring and go.

121
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,869
Hey…

122
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,271
Na-bi…

123
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,151
What happened? Why is it…

124
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,827
Na-bi!

125
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,871
Na-bi, are you okay?

126
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,421
All right.

127
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,756
How can such a thing happen?

128
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,009
Someone could have been hurt!

129
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,261
I can't believe it.

130
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,808
Let's get everything repaired properly
so this will never happen again.

131
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,018
-Okay.
-Okay.

132
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,479
How is Na-bi? She must be in shock.

133
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,232
Yes, she is…

134
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,569
She won't have enough time to fix it.

135
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,030
And it's their exam period now.

136
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,282
I can't tell her to work on it right now…

137
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,451
It's not even her fault.

138
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,830
Right. Don't push her
to do anything right now.

139
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,500
If she says she'll give up,
then we have no choice.

140
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,396
It feels like I'm having terrible,
recurring nightmares.

141
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,873
HUMAN ART ANATOMY FOR SCULPTORS

142
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,336
This is the transverse arch?

143
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,838
Yes.

144
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,258
And this is the medial longitudinal arch.

145
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,137
-Yes.
-This is the lateral longitudinal arch.

146
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,972
Correct.

147
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,185
-What about this?
-Stop. It tickles.

148
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,603
Stop.

149
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,424
Hello?

150
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,302
Oh, Yun Sol.

151
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,722
What?

152
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,549
Let's fix this.

153
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,200
And when we're done,

154
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
I'll stay away from you.

155
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,126
I promise.

156
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,235
We can't even blame anyone.

157
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,654
Jin-su, give me the gloves.

158
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,747
Let's clean this up.

159
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know how I should feel
about Jae-eon,

160
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,261
but focusing on work together

161
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,847
feels natural and comfortable.

162
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,436
It's as if nothing had happened
between us.

163
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,321
Sorry I'm late. But I got these for you.

164
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:10,912
Try this.

165
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,582
Eat up.

166
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,546
-Do you want some too?
-Yes.

167
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,049
-Thank you.
-Want a sausage?

168
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,717
-Yes!
-Here.

169
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,302
Hey…

170
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,463
Jae-eon is still kind, but…

171
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,531
You have a lot of stuff.

172
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,951
Yes. I called a cab.

173
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,245
Right.

174
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,290
He doesn't offer to take me home anymore.

175
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,593
The conflicts we had whenever we met

176
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,137
are gone, too.

177
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,767
How about having some beer?

178
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,104
We have to come early tomorrow.
Maybe next time.

179
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,272
Come on.

180
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,945
I'll get going.

181
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,407
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

182
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,493
Get home safe.

183
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,291
Jae-eon. I'll leave
after I finish up some work.

184
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,959
Okay.

185
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,492
-I…
-Is it okay?

186
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,245
Yes. I think it's all done.

187
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,499
I'll move this.

188
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,422
No, I'll do it. It's heavy.

189
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,076
Well…

190
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,543
Thank you.

191
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,727
You look the happiest
when you're working on your pieces.

192
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,440
And the prettiest.

193
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,903
Good luck with the exhibition.

194
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,864
And…

195
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,045
I'll get going.

196
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,506
Jae-eon, what are you doing?

197
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,719
What is all this?

198
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,638
My tools.

199
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,308
I know, but why are you taking everything?

200
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,813
Do you want them?

201
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,607
What about you?

202
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,151
Oh, are you getting new ones?

203
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,575
Never mind, then.

204
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,995
I want them! Thanks.

205
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,782
You look the happiest
when you're working on your pieces.

206
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,494
But why…

207
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,539
do I not feel happy?

208
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,265
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

209
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,017
Here.

210
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,147
Hey, this is mine. Where did you get it?

211
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,066
Jae-eon asked me to give it to you.

212
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,737
Really? Thanks.

213
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,865
-I'll clean up a bit.
-Okay.

214
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,746
I don't think I can stay by her side any
longer in a vague relationship like this.

215
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,828
The semester's finally over!

216
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,832
Shall we celebrate?

217
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,668
-Yes!
-Nice!

218
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,419
Are you that happy, guys?

219
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,589
-What?
-I just feel anxious now.

220
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,925
We have to start preparing
to get jobs now.

221
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,678
I'm so scared about my exam results.

222
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,933
Oh, right. This is Jae-eon's.
Is anyone keeping in touch with him?

223
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,476
-Bye!
-Oh…

224
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,270
Jin-su, you can't reach him either?

225
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,233
No. I guess we weren't close friends.
I thought we grew quite close.

226
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,569
Jae-eon even took all his tools and stuff.

227
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,780
He took
all his former projects and everything.

228
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:15,076
After that day,
Jae-eon disappeared without a trace.

229
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,662
Is it a young artist's spirit
or something?

230
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,747
Maybe he sold them.

231
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,250
I think he took everything apart
and threw them away.

232
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,669
He did seem strange that day.

233
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,379
Classes weren't even over yet,

234
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,464
but he packed up
like he was going somewhere.

235
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,465
Right, Na-bi?

236
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,301
Maybe he really went somewhere.

237
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,345
He did talk about going to the States.

238
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,347
Good luck with the exhibition.

239
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,308
And…

240
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:50,028
What did he want to tell me?

241
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,612
How can he just leave like that?

242
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,198
With his personality,
it's totally possible.

243
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,577
I guess nobody knows
that much about Jae-eon.

244
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,873
Jae-eon doesn't talk much about himself.

245
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,541
But you know something, right?

246
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,917
What would I know?

247
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,669
You really don't know?

248
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,962
-No.
-Didn't you know?

249
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,214
She retired from her gossip columnist job.

250
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,382
She's busy dating!

251
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,468
Bit-na is dating!

252
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,636
Let's go.

253
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,514
Hey, we're going to drink near school,

254
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,849
so come and join us.

255
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,517
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

256
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,686
-You should come!
-All right.

257
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:47,877
SHARK

258
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,840
SHARK

259
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,509
This one.

260
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,642
Why did you laugh?

261
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,146
Because you're cute.

262
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,473
Didn't you want to see me again?

263
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,855
I was glad…

264
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,524
to see you again.

265
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,289
You jerk.

266
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,680
Excuse me.

267
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,058
Aren't you
"Grandson of a Noodle Shop Owner"?

268
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,018
Oh, yes. I am.

269
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,021
I can't believe it. Hi.

270
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,940
I'm a huge fan.

271
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,568
I've been watching your videos
since the beginning.

272
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,569
Thank you.

273
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,530
Could we get an autograph?

274
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,201
-An autograph?
-Yes, please.

275
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,002
YANG

276
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,347
YANG DO-HYEOK

277
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,559
Thank you. Could we take a photo as well?

278
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,728
A photo?

279
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,563
Do it.

280
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,192
My friend's here.

281
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,777
Sorry.

282
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,367
Hey! Aren't you
"Grandson of a Noodle Shop Owner"?

283
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,995
Can I have an autograph too?

284
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,499
Your semester's finally over.

285
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,752
Yes. This semester felt like one year.

286
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,047
Are you going to stay in Seoul?

287
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,926
No, I'm going to my mom's
after the exhibition is over.

288
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,470
She's nagging at me to come.

289
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,598
What about your aunt?

290
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,519
Do-yeon seems to miss you a lot too.

291
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,484
That was obvious, wasn't it?

292
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,487
Yes, that was an excuse.

293
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,033
I did tell my aunt that I'd visit soon.

294
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,454
I don't think I can stay
with my mom during my whole vacation.

295
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,957
The exhibition's until seven, right?

296
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,335
Yes. But can you come?

297
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,254
Didn't you say you were filming something?
An interview?

298
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,341
It might be a little tight, but…

299
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,093
Then it's fine.
Don't strain yourself. Just focus on work.

300
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,013
No, I have to make it.

301
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,681
It's your exhibition.

302
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,684
I'm excited to see it.

303
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,064
It's amazing how you fixed your piece.

304
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,275
I wouldn't have been able to do it.

305
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,572
My assistants helped out a lot.

306
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,625
Anyway, it was pretty tough,

307
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,420
but I did gain some things too.

308
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,214
Like what?

309
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,178
I like working now.

310
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,724
To be honest,
I wasn't enjoying it for a while,

311
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,479
but someone told me that I look
the happiest when I'm working.

312
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,775
I was happy…

313
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,987
to hear that.

314
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,452
Maybe you actually did
enjoy it the whole time.

315
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,621
And you just realized it

316
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,332
when you heard those words.

317
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,295
Maybe.

318
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,971
You must be grateful to them.

319
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,391
Right.

320
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,154
Let's eat.

321
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,490
-Try it. It's really tasty.
-Okay.

322
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,336
Gosh. Everything will be over tomorrow.

323
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,172
Finally.

324
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,632
I thought I'd be happy for it to all end.

325
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,722
But I guess I was wrong.

326
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,019
Is Jae-eon coming tomorrow?

327
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:21,979
I don't know.

328
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,264
How can I define

329
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,559
the feelings I have left for Jae-eon?

330
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,480
Lingering affection?

331
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,024
Regret?

332
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,485
Hate?

333
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,905
Or…

334
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,571
Honestly, I didn't want to come.

335
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,156
Why?

336
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,116
It wasn't because of the exhibition.

337
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,537
I just have bad memories about this place.

338
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,664
Really?

339
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,294
I saw someone so beautiful here

340
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,047
that I fell in love at first sight.

341
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:55,966
I'm sure.

342
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,761
It was snowing that day.

343
00:43:58,844 --> 00:43:59,928
I didn't ask.

344
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,014
It was an opening exhibition
for an artist.

345
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,766
What was the artist's name?

346
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,643
But why is it called "Nabi"?

347
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,061
I don't know.

348
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,814
It was boring, so I was about to leave.

349
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,317
But then…

350
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,820
I saw a girl standing
in front of a piece for a long time.

351
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,906
Just like you back there.

352
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,712
Na-bi.

353
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:55,401
And one day, I ran into her again.

354
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,527
I was startled.

355
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,238
If I believed in fate,

356
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,573
I would have felt that this was it.

357
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,512
PARK JAE-EON

358
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:30,144
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a message…

359
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,217
Oh, my gosh.
"Hello. Hi. It's nice to meet you."

360
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,017
-Jo Min-yeong!
-What?

361
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,560
Your phone!

362
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,897
Oh, my gosh! I almost got in huge trouble.

363
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,525
Stay calm during the interview.
And here, take this.

364
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,818
What is it?

365
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,946
Sugar. You get low on sugar
when you're anxious.

366
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,993
YOU CAN DO IT, MIN-YEONG!

367
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,330
Sorry I can't help with the exhibition.

368
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,916
It'll go fine without you, so don't worry.

369
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,042
Focus on the interview.

370
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,835
Okay? Come on, you should go.

371
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,087
Right. See you later!

372
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,218
You can do it!

373
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,886
I can do it!

374
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,285
Don't think of going home tonight.

375
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,787
-Hey, Bit-na!
-Hey!

376
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,748
-Hi!
-Oh, no. I didn't buy flowers.

377
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,126
-Ji-wan bought them for me.
-I sure did.

378
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,170
Are you excited?

379
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,797
Hey, Yun Sol's piece is the best!

380
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,842
We haven't even entered the gallery yet.

381
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,427
I can just tell.

382
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,138
-She's praising you all the time.
-Hey, be quiet.

383
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,809
Here, ten each. Hand these out.

384
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,727
Here.

385
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,688
Hey, can you hand these out?

386
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,774
-Mr. An, can you take a photo of us?
-What?

387
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,568
-Come on. Hurry.
-Hold onto this for me.

388
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,944
-Hurry.
-All right.

389
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,155
-Make me look tall.
-Okay.

390
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,908
Make a pose. All right. One, two, three.

391
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,034
-Mr. An!
-Mr. An!

392
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,994
-One more.
-Hang on.

393
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,372
-Gosh, look at you!
-That's enough for you guys.

394
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,748
-All right.
-You look good.

395
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,875
Can you take one for us too?

396
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,002
You look like a different person today.

397
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,337
You look really nice today.

398
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,549
One, two, three.

399
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,218
Once more.

400
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,261
-I'll do a close-up.
-Focus on Sol.

401
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,180
Sol? One, two, three.

402
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,765
YU NA-BI, YUN SOL,
KIM NA-YEON, YUN GEON-UNG

403
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,850
-Hey!
-Hey, guys!

404
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,728
Why did no one bring flowers?

405
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,438
Hey, you look so pretty!

406
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,607
-I should've brought some.
-I'm a flower.

407
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,944
-I'm a flower.
-Why would we need flowers? I'm a flower.

408
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,696
-Jin-su, it's your debut!
-You're so late.

409
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,865
Right,
I worked on Na-bi's piece with Jae-eon.

410
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,617
-Be quiet, you guys.
-They're pretty.

411
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,160
-Mr. An!
-Gosh, you're handsome.

412
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,287
Be quiet, guys. Go inside.

413
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,164
Come on. Get inside.

414
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,043
This place is cool.

415
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,255
Hey, look over there.

416
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,965
This is…

417
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,633
Hey, Sol.

418
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,183
Congratulations.

419
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,060
Good work.

420
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,316
It feels different looking at them
exhibited like this.

421
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,860
It's so cool.

422
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,112
Sol really is talented. You're awesome.

423
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,239
Sol, what was the name of this?

424
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,908
-"Union."
-"Onion"?

425
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,285
-"Union."
-Stop making jokes.

426
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,996
Sol, you really are the best.

427
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,665
Sol, you're awesome.

428
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,471
What's that?

429
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,641
Na-bi's piece is really amazing.

430
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,768
Right?

431
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,686
Maybe the accident actually helped her.

432
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,855
No, Na-bi wouldn't be happy to hear that.

433
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,943
Na-bi could really go to Paris
at this rate.

434
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,613
-No way.
-This is incredible.

435
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,615
Where's Na-bi?

436
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,700
Right. Where is she?

437
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,452
There she is. Hang on.

438
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,717
What are you doing?

439
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,722
I was a bit tired,
so I was getting some rest.

440
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,391
Na-bi. The professor's calling for you.

441
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,518
Okay.

442
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,232
It must be exhausting.

443
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,568
Professor.

444
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,534
It must've been tough
fixing your piece in such a short time.

445
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,786
But it was worth it, wasn't it?

446
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,914
Yes. I enjoyed it.

447
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,796
I could feel that emotion in your piece.

448
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:13,839
Good work.

449
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,884
Thank you.

450
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,304
Na-bi. You should go to Paris.

451
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,851
Yes. I want to go there.

452
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,437
Great. That's the spirit.

453
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,398
It seems like you've spread your wings.

454
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,526
There's no need to overthink it.

455
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,195
Eat what you want,
and do what you want to do.

456
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,530
Like the people you like.

457
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,907
That's all you have to do.

458
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,119
All right.

459
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,955
SCULPTURE: YU NA-BI, YUN SOL,
KIM NA-YEON, YUN GEON-UNG

460
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,542
You're taking everything down today?

461
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,043
No, tomorrow.

462
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:53,962
It's too bad.

463
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,966
Why do you look so down, Na-bi?

464
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,342
You even got praised.

465
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,054
No, I'm fine.

466
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,808
Come to think of it,
did Jae-eon come today?

467
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,395
Jae-eon? Did he not come today?

468
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,605
Did he come?

469
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,107
-Hello.
-Hello.

470
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,651
Sorry I'm late.
It took longer than I thought.

471
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,070
It's fine. You're not late.
Thanks for coming.

472
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,655
Thanks for inviting me.

473
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,290
-I'll show you my piece.
-Okay.

474
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,751
-I'll be back.
-Bye.

475
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,266
What do you think?

476
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,895
Gosh. It's just as I expected.

477
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:52,979
It's great.

478
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,023
I'm glad you think so.

479
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,150
You're so cool, Na-bi.

480
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,110
Stop it.

481
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,321
Na-bi, let's go eat.

482
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,990
Oh, it's been a long time!

483
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,617
-Awesome.
-You're famous, you know.

484
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,661
You're a superstar now.

485
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,747
How much do you earn each month
with your channel?

486
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,124
-I'm just curious.
-Can I be in one of your videos?

487
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,335
-Me too.
-Why would you?

488
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,670
That's ridiculous.

489
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,338
Did you see that piece?

490
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,467
-Hang on. Excuse me.
-Why?

491
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,469
Can I join you next time?

492
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,920
You like Jae-eon,

493
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,173
right?

494
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,885
I think so.

495
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,392
But you were right.

496
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,731
I know that he's not someone
who will make me happy.

497
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,366
I know it's ridiculous
saying this right now,

498
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,871
but I was really happy
spending time with you, Do-hyeok.

499
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,540
Thank you.

500
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,502
And I'm sorry.

501
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:41,880
Na-bi.

502
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:51,139
I'm glad I was able to feel these emotions
thanks to you.

503
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,060
I'm grateful, so don't feel sorry.

504
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,324
And please accept this.

505
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:21,836
I'll get going.

506
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:38,144
Min-yeong. Sorry I'm late.

507
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,566
Your feet are all swollen.

508
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,318
Here. Wear these.

509
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,657
What?

510
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,409
It's nothing.

511
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,954
I'll do it.

512
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:01,084
What? What is it?

513
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,963
Did the interview go badly?

514
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,132
I'm just…

515
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,511
glad that you're here with me right now.

516
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,525
Can I keep staying at your house?

517
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,196
Sure.

518
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,205
I feel so much better.

519
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,791
My feet were aching all day.

520
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,042
I bet.

521
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,546
I'm hungry. Do you want to eat tteokbokki?

522
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,672
Sure.

523
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,591
Should we have some beer too?

524
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,717
Why not?

525
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,845
How was the interview?

526
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,222
I don't know…

527
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,558
I was so nervous that
I just blabbered nonsense.

528
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,934
I can't even remember much.

529
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,938
That's how people always feel
when they do interviews.

530
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,106
Just forget about it.

531
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:06,608
Hey.

532
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:10,153
Which one of you liked the other first?

533
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,113
Hey, Gyu-hyun! Was it you?

534
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,033
Hey. The one who had feelings first

535
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:18,077
and the one who confessed first,
none of that is important.

536
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,039
If they like each other
and they're dating, then it's all fine.

537
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,624
-That's right.
-Hey, listen.

538
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:27,045
It's all about who likes the other more,
especially at the beginning.

539
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:30,006
Se-hun, this is exactly why
you're not dating anyone.

540
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,883
-Hey!
-Se-hun! You're so clueless.

541
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,260
If you say that, then they can't answer.

542
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,804
They'd be saying they like the other more.

543
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,223
What's the problem?

544
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,142
Shouldn't you like the other person more?

545
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,520
Why would you date them
if you're not certain?

546
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,022
That's a waste of time.

547
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,610
Sol…

548
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,112
Hey!

549
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,699
So which one of you liked the other first?

550
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,078
Well…

551
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,247
I liked her first.

552
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,331
What?

553
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,710
Really? I thought it'd be Bit-na for sure.

554
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:08,628
What?

555
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,046
Since when?

556
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,425
Since our workshop in our first year.

557
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,512
No way.

558
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,638
I can't believe it.

559
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,932
Then it's been a really long time.

560
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:25,186
Hang on.
You've been fooling us the whole time?

561
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,272
You were just so clueless.

562
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,524
Right, he's a bit clueless.

563
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:33,278
If that's when you started liking me,

564
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,113
then I liked you first.

565
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,534
At our freshman orientation,

566
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,869
I saw this hot guy from far away.

567
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,788
As soon as I saw him,

568
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,249
I knew I had to make him my boyfriend.

569
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,585
Bit-na, stop lying.

570
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,253
-Was it obvious?
-Yes.

571
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,547
I was just kidding!

572
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,383
Hey, Gyu-hyun.
Sorry, but can I have some of that?

573
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,926
-I love you.
-I love you.

574
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:57,844
Go ahead.

575
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,723
I'd bring you the moon if you asked.

576
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,168
I miss him.

577
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,056
I said I don't believe

578
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,227
in fate or love anymore,

579
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:32,814
but this…

580
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,318
is too unrealistic.

581
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,010
What are you doing here?

582
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,474
-Sorry.
-"Sorry"?

583
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,854
-You're the worst. You know that?
-Na-bi.

584
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,355
If you decided to be a jerk,

585
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,858
you should've stayed that way.
Why are you here like this?

586
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,443
What do you want from me?

587
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,797
Do I still…

588
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,759
have a chance with you?

589
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,636
Were you going to cut ties with me then?

590
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:32,183
I couldn't bear the fact
that you hated me so much.

591
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:34,602
That's right. I hate you.

592
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,565
I really hate you,

593
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,985
and I know that you're a jerk
who toys with people's feelings.

594
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,621
But I feel better now that I see you.

595
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,680
So don't go anywhere and stay by my side.

596
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,273
Why are you smiling?

597
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:22,859
It's just that

598
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,655
thinking about what to say to you
makes me smile.

599
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,657
Do you like me that much?

600
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,578
Yes. I like you a lot.

601
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,957
Park Jae-eon.

602
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,917
Let's go out.

603
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:43,963
You won't regret it?

604
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,383
Of course I will. It's obvious.

605
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,388
But I'll still do it.

606
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,244
Love.

607
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,957
Why are you so hot, though? Are you sick?

608
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,459
I'm fine.

609
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,129
I don't feel sick at all
since you're here with me.

610
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:28,090
I know that it will cause me pain again.

611
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,426
Nevertheless, I still…

612
01:05:57,161 --> 01:06:02,249
EPISODE 10: NEVERTHELESS, I STILL…

613
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,672
Do you have a girlfriend?

614
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,674
-Can I have your number?
-Me too!

615
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:10,883
My number?

616
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,806
I have plans.

617
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,939
-Did you get them?
-Yes.

618
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,528
Should we eat something nice?

619
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:31,654
Okay.

620
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,447
What do you want?

621
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,701
Well… What should we have?

622
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:38,619
I'm not sure…

623
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,214
-What is it?
-What?

624
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,218
It's nothing. Let's go.

625
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:05,980
Then…

626
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,899
should we go to the pasta place
you mentioned?

627
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,276
Okay.

628
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,029
Bit-na said it's good.

629
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,155
All right.

630
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,365
It's a cat.

631
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,077
It's cute.

632
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:23,330
I want a cat. Should we raise one?

633
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,875
No. No more pets for you.

634
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,294
Not even butterflies?

635
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,211
No.

636
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:09,562
