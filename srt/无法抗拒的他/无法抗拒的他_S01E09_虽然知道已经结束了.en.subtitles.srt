1
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,973
You're drinking a lot.

2
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,936
Is something going on?

3
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,489
No.

4
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,493
Nothing.

5
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,246
Is work going well?

6
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,959
No, I came outside
because I couldn't focus.

7
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,965
Na-bi keeps looking somewhere else
instead of looking at me.

8
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,177
I saw you with him

9
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,805
at school.

10
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,310
-What?
-Yang Do-hyeok.

11
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,732
I see.

12
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,739
Do you like him?

13
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,577
Why do you ask?

14
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,375
I'm just curious.

15
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,965
I do.

16
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,718
He's a good guy.

17
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,734
What makes you say that?

18
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,949
He's a good cook,

19
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,452
and he's considerate.

20
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,832
He's cute sometimes too.

21
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,964
And most of all,
I feel comfortable when I'm with him.

22
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,768
Then why aren't you dating him?

23
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,028
That's not something you should be asking.

24
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,073
Maybe not.

25
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,461
If I date him,
he'd get disappointed in me.

26
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,176
I'm not the kind of person he thinks I am.

27
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,141
At least to him,

28
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,939
I want to seem like a good person.

29
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,036
Then what about me?

30
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:24,555
EPISODE 9: I KNOW IT'S OVER.
NEVERTHELESS,

31
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,981
-Do you like her that much?
-Yes, I do.

32
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,566
And I miss her all the time.

33
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,278
Then what are you waiting for?
Be more bold.

34
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,448
Well, I can't really do that right now.

35
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,952
I feel like I might mess things up.

36
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,621
My goodness. So frustrating.

37
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,250
Are you having fun?

38
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,714
DID YOU GO HOME?
ARE YOU HAVING FUN?

39
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,842
Is she home?

40
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,011
Don't look.

41
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:07,181
-Look at what?
-Not you. Just keep sleeping.

42
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,599
Sorry.

43
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,560
Do-hyeok.

44
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,397
Just take my advice,
and ask her to meet up right now.

45
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,482
You said you forgot to give her that.

46
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,443
That's a bit…

47
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,528
It's not even urgent.

48
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,866
Plus, I'm a bit tipsy.

49
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,035
So frustrating.

50
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,079
You're a decent guy,
but you're not making any bold moves.

51
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,504
Love is all about timing, you know.

52
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,549
If you keep hesitating like that,
you'll never get her.

53
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,679
It's because
I really don't want to lose her.

54
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,099
If you don't want to lose her,
then ask her to meet right now.

55
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,812
If you're not going to,
then just bring another bottle.

56
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,272
We're out.

57
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,150
All right.

58
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,625
I'll get going now.

59
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,293
Are you walking home?

60
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,672
Yes. I should sober up a bit.
See you tomorrow, then.

61
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,187
Why are you following me?

62
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,147
I'm not following you.

63
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,782
Then where are you going?

64
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,991
Your house.

65
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,910
-What?
-To get my stuff.

66
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,371
I see.

67
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,892
She won't be asleep already, will she?

68
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,955
-Wait out here.
-Out here?

69
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,876
I didn't pack everything yet.
I didn't think you'd suddenly come for it.

70
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,171
I'll pack them with you.

71
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,518
I can go inside, right?

72
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,770
Sure.

73
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,246
-Cheers.
-You have to clink glasses.

74
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,584
Look over there. Isn't that guy handsome?

75
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,628
What's with you?

76
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,674
Hey, slow down.
We didn't come here to drink, you know.

77
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,551
I came here to drink.

78
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,930
-You're unbelievable.
-Why did we come here then?

79
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,599
Look at that guy.

80
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,186
-I think the cute guys are over there.
-There are so many decent guys.

81
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,604
-Are you lonely?
-Yes.

82
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,363
That guy over there looks pretty cute too.

83
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,241
SHARE WITH
NAM GYU-HYUN

84
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,997
Hey. My friends
say they want to come here too.

85
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,541
Three guys. What do you think?

86
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,543
That's perfect. Tell them to come.

87
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,421
Are they good-looking?

88
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,422
I'm leaving.

89
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,091
-What?
-Hey.

90
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,511
-Have fun.
-Hey!

91
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,099
Jeez. Call just two guys, then.

92
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,080
Do you like it?

93
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,249
Yes.

94
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,502
It's pretty.

95
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,464
You look even more pretty today.

96
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,339
HUMAN ART ANATOMY FOR SCULPTORS

97
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,051
I think that's all your stuff.

98
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,177
Right.

99
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,721
But I feel a bit disappointed.

100
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,642
-What do you mean?
-I thought you'd have

101
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,270
a late birthday present for me.

102
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,774
There's nothing like that.

103
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,485
If that's everything,
you should get going.

104
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,236
I'm a bit tired.

105
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,758
You're all better now.

106
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,219
Yes.

107
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,055
I did a good job of treating you.

108
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,951
Let's not make another mistake.

109
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,079
You should go.

110
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,816
Do you really think this is a mistake?

111
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,155
Of course. I'm sure you feel the same.

112
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,740
That's a lie.

113
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,163
I don't.

114
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,044
I enjoy being with you.

115
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,213
Are you kidding me?

116
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,885
I like your angry face too.

117
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,887
Is this fun to you?

118
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,390
I'm not teasing you.

119
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,062
Let's go out.

120
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,567
What?

121
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,120
Think about it and tell me.

122
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,123
Bye.

123
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,464
Go sleep in the bedroom.
You'll catch a cold.

124
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,466
No, I can't sleep right now.

125
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,759
I still have lots to do.

126
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,553
What?

127
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,390
What? She got in, but Na-bi got rejected?

128
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,309
The school Na-bi applied to
is pretty tough to get into.

129
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,435
Right.

130
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,146
I have to make all the calls
and prepare the documents.

131
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,650
I'm totally screwed.

132
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,610
I can help you make the calls tomorrow.

133
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,195
So go to bed.

134
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,364
It's fine. You have a lot to do too.

135
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,449
I have some time tomorrow.

136
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,744
What?

137
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,496
Well…

138
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,665
I feel kind of embarrassed.

139
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,000
Why?

140
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,628
I always told you to stop poking
your nose in other people's businesses.

141
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,631
But it feels like
I'm getting the most benefit out of that.

142
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,302
That means you're thankful, right?

143
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,847
Well, I guess.

144
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,643
You're likeable.

145
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,271
What?

146
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,190
It stays near you all the time.

147
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,114
Oh, I guess you're right.

148
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,056
Let's go out.

149
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,426
I'm not used to how I am

150
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,556
when I'm with Na-bi.

151
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,825
Let's go out.

152
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,707
What was that, all of a sudden?

153
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,383
Did he really mean it?

154
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,359
Can we meet right now?

155
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,798
I just read your message. Sorry.

156
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,635
If it's not urgent, let's meet next time.

157
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,638
I'm a bit tired,
so I'm going to bed early.

158
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,855
YU NA-BI

159
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,335
Block him!

160
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,635
I guess you're not
in a good condition today.

161
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,013
-You seem way too tense.
-I'm not improving.

162
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,432
I want to be better.

163
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,520
Things won't work out well
if you start to get greedy.

164
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,856
Did I get greedy?

165
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,359
It's nothing bad.
You can try harder if you get greedy.

166
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,238
So do your best.

167
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,450
Come on, let's play another game.

168
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,578
Okay.

169
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,793
-Hi, Na-bi. Hi, Sol.
-Hey.

170
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,342
Sol.

171
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,846
-Sol.
-Yes?

172
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,017
What if someone says "Let's go out"
without even saying they like you?

173
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,810
It's one or the other.

174
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,980
That person's a jerk

175
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,734
or they thought it was unnecessary
because it's so obvious.

176
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,325
What time is your progress report?

177
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,036
Progress report?

178
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,788
For the exhibition.

179
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:09,917
Oh, right.

180
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,669
-When was it?
-Tomorrow.

181
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,713
You didn't prepare for it?

182
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,716
No.

183
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,718
What? Is something going on?

184
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,803
No.

185
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,475
-Hey, Ji-wan.
-What?

186
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,189
Na-bi, I'll be in the lecture room.

187
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,232
We can go together.

188
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,692
No, it's fine. See you later.

189
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,614
What's up with her?

190
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,034
I don't know.

191
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,422
Nothing has changed here.

192
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,222
Hey, Do-hyeok.

193
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,934
Do you remember that spot?

194
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,812
We were playing in there

195
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,607
and I broke a glass cup,
and you got scolded by your grandpa.

196
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,984
You remember that?

197
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,277
Of course.

198
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,407
Back then, it was so fun
to hide somewhere and play.

199
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:10,329
Right. It was so exciting
when we were in elementary school.

200
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,496
Yes.

201
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,593
You're pretty good.

202
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,099
Make it tasty for me.

203
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,810
All right.

204
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,648
Do-hyeok!

205
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,612
The reactions are great.

206
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,075
Listening to Na-bi's advice
was a great idea.

207
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,342
Try tasting this.

208
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,727
-Why does it taste like this?
-Why? Is it bad?

209
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,571
Hey. Grandson of a noodle shop owner.

210
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,407
What happened in Seoul?
Why are you acting like this?

211
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,034
Nothing happened.

212
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,831
You were so excited to see Na-bi.

213
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,667
But you look like a zombie now.
Stop lying.

214
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,003
Did you eventually lose to Jae-eon?

215
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,676
My gosh.
Just give up and find someone else.

216
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,387
You're popular, you know.

217
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,055
Can you make some noodles for me?

218
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,057
I'm hungry.

219
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,060
Make it yourself.

220
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,495
Should I just give up on everything?

221
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,307
Jae-eon.

222
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,893
What are you making?

223
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,644
A pendant.

224
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,481
Then what's this?

225
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,785
Thanks.

226
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,651
Was it that good?

227
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,320
What do you mean?

228
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,488
The meat.

229
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,992
The barbecue was amazing that day,
wasn't it?

230
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,540
What's he going around doing these days?

231
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,709
He works part-time at an internet cafe.

232
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,380
-A part-time job?
-Yes. You didn't know?

233
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,340
I thought you two shared everything.

234
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:54,302
The internet cafe he works at
has a really romantic name.

235
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,220
What is it?

236
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,811
Gyu-hyun,
do you want to have drinks today?

237
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,189
Not me.
I have gastritis, so I can't drink.

238
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,649
What? Gastritis?

239
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,526
You're totally healthy.

240
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,028
Whatever!

241
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,115
-It must be because of stress.
-Hey, Bit-na.

242
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,785
What?

243
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,996
Let's go somewhere and talk.

244
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,332
-Just talk here.
-It won't take long.

245
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,754
What the…

246
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,312
What? What is it?

247
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,609
-Oh, this…
-Why did you order this to my house?

248
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,619
I've made a grave mistake.

249
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,080
Is this what you wanted to say?

250
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,999
Yes.

251
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,586
All right, then.

252
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,756
Isn't that mine?

253
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,760
You gave this to me to wear last time.

254
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,011
Do you want it back?

255
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,430
No, it's fine.

256
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,436
You're actually really petty, aren't you?

257
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,979
Just take it.

258
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,820
What are you doing this weekend?

259
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,238
Well…

260
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,994
This exhibition's opening this week.

261
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,996
PARK DAE-SEONG EXHIBITION

262
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,581
Let's go together.

263
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,166
Together?

264
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,461
Yes. I'm asking you out on a date.

265
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,256
I like you, Sol.

266
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,635
I've liked you since I first met you
at the cafe.

267
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,596
Oh…

268
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,599
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

269
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,060
I'm not, but…

270
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,064
I actually have someone I like.

271
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,236
I see. Do you have a crush on someone?

272
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,451
Then did you…

273
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,288
I guess it's too personal. I'm sorry.

274
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,500
I did tell them how I feel.

275
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,837
Because my desires kept growing.

276
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,714
I see.

277
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,052
So you're saying

278
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,555
that your friend said they like you

279
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,014
and you like them back.

280
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,977
But you're afraid
of ruining your friendship?

281
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:53,314
Yes. If we start dating
but break up later…

282
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,985
My friend is capable and has everything,

283
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,738
so losing me won't be a big deal.

284
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,531
But without my friend,

285
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,826
it'd be the same as losing half my life.

286
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,162
I'd be screwed.

287
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,458
I envy you.

288
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,920
What? I'm so confused right now.
Why would you envy me?

289
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,964
Your friend's your other half.

290
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:21,801
That means you're both
so sure about your feelings.

291
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,096
That's a great thing.

292
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,556
Still…

293
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,185
Plus, from my experience…

294
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,103
I mean,

295
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,399
what I think is that you two
can't go back to the way things were.

296
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,527
Unless you both lose your memories,

297
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,738
you'll never be able
to just be friends again.

298
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,701
Please stop stating cold hard facts.

299
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,498
So don't suffer like this all by yourself
and talk to your friend.

300
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,874
Who knows?

301
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,376
That friend
might be thinking the same thing.

302
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,674
I'm scared to tell them though.

303
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,220
I know how that feels.

304
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,198

YU NA-BI
REJECTED

306
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,384
It doesn't seem that bad,

307
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,595
but it's not as good as I expected.

308
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,811
Don't you have two assistants?
Where's the other one?

309
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,523
Jin-su is at his part-time job right now.

310
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,692
Are you getting a lot of help from them?

311
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,865
Yes, they're helping out a lot.

312
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,741
We have meetings often too.

313
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,829
Is that so?

314
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,670
I thought you two
would make a great piece together.

315
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,591
I guess you two haven't
figured out each other's strong points.

316
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,180
Na-bi. I've told you this
many times before.

317
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,433
You really have talent,

318
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,729
but I can't feel your emotion
in your works.

319
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,607
It's not just about finishing your piece.

320
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,567
You have to inspire other people.

321
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,821
Pieces that receive compliments and
ones that attract attention are different.

322
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,782
Right.

323
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,870
Are you passionate about this piece?
Do you really care about it?

324
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,873
Of course.

325
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,961
I'm sure you'd feel upset
about me saying this when you tried hard.

326
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,173
You may think it's nonsense,
but it's because I know you can do better.

327
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,593
I really think you can make
an amazing piece with just a bit more.

328
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,101
I wanted you to learn that from Jae-eon.

329
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,693
I'll do my best.

330
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,115
Let me see yours, Geon-ung.

00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,483
Here you go.

333
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,952
This tastes amazing.

334
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,040
How was the critique?

335
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,335
Awful.

336
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,755
Come on. Everybody gets criticized
by that professor.

337
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,051
Except for Jae-eon, I guess.

338
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,554
Aren't you busy?

339
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,472
I am,

340
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,560
but I should take good care of you guys.

341
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,687
This and this…

342
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,568
Isn't it good?

343
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,445
It is.

344
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,492
I'm sorry for not being able to make it.
I'll get you a lot of freebies.

345
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,287
It's fine. Thanks.

346
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,873
Enjoy your food.

347
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,709
This is pretty good.

348
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,837
I promise I won't miss anything
or be late next time.

349
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,761
This must be about Gyu-hyun.

350
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,387
What? Let me see.

351
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,724
"I heard he's a Sculpture major.

352
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,185
He's totally my style.

353
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,228
I'm going to the internet cafe every day.

354
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,190
Please give me 22 extra minutes
as a sign, if you like me too."

355
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,692
This is Gyu-hyun for sure!

356
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,154
"Handsome"?
Are you kidding me? Is that it?

357
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,280
Yes.

358
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,078
What is this?

359
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,332
What? There are more female customers now?

360
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,543
YOU'VE PASSED THE FIRST SCREENING TEST

361
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:52,256
I passed! I can't believe it!

362
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,300
Oh, my gosh.

363
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,555
I acted like I got the job already.

364
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,557
I just passed the first test.

365
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,186
Come on. That's a huge achievement.

366
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,313
Then you should prepare
for the interview now.

367
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,233
Good luck!

368
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,858
The ocean is so pretty, Do-hyeok.

369
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,192
I miss you.

370
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,957
I saw the new video.

371
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,500
It's great.

372
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,840
Emotions…

373
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,975
Emotions…

374
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:35,568
How do I portray my emotions?

375
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,506
Hey, Do-hyeok.

376
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,678
Can you talk right now?
I don't want to bother you.

377
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,390
No, it's fine. I was spacing out
because the critique went badly.

378
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,726
-Critique?
-Our professor

379
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,395
evaluates and critiques our works.

380
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,900
I got scolded.

381
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,986
This semester really is the worst.

382
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,574
I didn't get accepted
to the exchange program either.

383
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,493
Oh…

384
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:47,890
Is something going on?

385
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,892
No.

386
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,895
Nothing.

387
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,231
Let's not make another mistake.

388
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,110
Maybe Na-bi was already

389
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,405
drifting away from me.

390
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,211
That's too bad.

391
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,256
That school has a bad eye for talent.

392
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,885
I'm going to Seoul soon. Can we meet up?

393
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,347
Of course. When are you coming?

394
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,682
It's not decided yet.

395
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,771
I guess you're feeling bothered
by what I said.

396
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,275
Are you trying to cheer me up?

397
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:43,654
Na-bi. You're already doing so well.

398
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,116
So don't let that discourage you.

399
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,953
Thanks.

400
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,788
You know I'm your greatest fan, right?

401
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,457
Make use of me all you want.

402
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,794
You can call me whenever
you need something to cheer you up.

403
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,089
I'll rush right over.

404
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,300
Thanks for saying that.

405
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,135
I feel a bit better.

406
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,848
Anyway, I'll call you again later.

407
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,516
Bye.

408
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,026
Did I go overboard?

409
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,278
I'm getting married.

410
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,572
What? You're getting married?

411
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,532
Why are you so startled?

412
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,284
When will you get married?

413
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,952
The beginning of next year?

414
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,038
I feel like we'd break up if we don't.

415
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,457
It's already been over five years.

416
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,085
And we've been working
for three years now.

417
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,295
I wanted some change in my life.

418
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,506
It's like a turning point
in our relationship.

419
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,345
A turning point in a relationship…

420
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,063
Sol.

421
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,442
-Yes?
-If I say

422
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,028
that I don't like you

423
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,365
in that way…

424
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,744
Then what will happen to us?

425
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,584
Then I'll keep liking you

426
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,962
like I do now,

427
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,216
and you won't return my feelings.

428
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,096
And if I say I do like you?

429
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,515
What?

430
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,812
Then we'll break up someday.

431
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,943
But I don't want us
to stay like this, either.

432
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,790
Is that what was troubling you?

433
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,710
What do we do?

434
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,594
Seo Ji-wan.

435
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,805
My feelings will never change.

436
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,146
So…

437
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,107
don't worry.

438
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,302
Are you done?

439
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,472
Yes. I'm going to head home now.

440
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,600
Let's go. I'll take you home.

441
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,685
It's fine. It's not far.

442
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,064
I was waiting all this time
to go with you.

443
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,401
I heard you stayed up all night.
You must be tired.

444
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,294
Thanks for the ride. I'll get going.

445
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,381
Wait.

446
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,183
A present.

447
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,616
Did you make this?

448
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,119
Yes, while I was working on my pieces.

449
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,204
It's pretty.

450
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,124
You could actually sell this.

451
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,753
Why are things so funny when you say them?

452
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,259
Go inside. And get some sleep.

453
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,471
I will. Thanks.

454
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,225
INTERNET CAFE PART-TIMER
THE PART-TIMER AT PERHAPS LOVE IS HOT

455
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,479
Hey, Bit-na!

456
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,774
Hey, my trainer! Long time no see.

457
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,692
Why aren't you coming to our gym?

458
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,362
I've been feeling lazy these days.

459
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,530
But I still have my muscles.
Check them out.

460
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,240
Your biceps!

461
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,160
Are you meeting someone?

462
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,245
No, I'm going home. I live nearby.

463
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,372
Oh, I see.

464
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:32,670
Since we haven't met in a while,
how about we go play some games?

465
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,254
Games? That sounds nice.

466
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,341
Right? I know a place around here.

467
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,353
Welcome.

468
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,526
-This place looks nice.
-Right?

469
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,031
Sit anywhere you'd like.

470
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,826
Pardon?

471
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,912
I'm Choi Jin-woo.

472
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,289
Right. I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

473
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,707
It's nice to meet you.

474
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,294
GKC Entertainment was very impressed
by your social media.

475
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,588
Thank you.

476
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,216
And…

477
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,969
this is an exclusive contract.

478
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,554
Read through it.

479
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,222
All right.

480
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,395
Sorry, but I have to take this call.

481
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,647
-Sure.
-Take your time.

482
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,414
Okay. I'll see you there later.

483
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,710
I'll see you later…

484
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:26,241
When's your flight? I'll drive you there.

485
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,411
No, I want to go alone.
I just came to say goodbye.

486
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,079
Let me take you.

487
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,043
It's fine. I don't want
that kind of vague generosity from you.

488
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,295
I don't want to get swayed.

489
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,008
I've decided not to pretend anymore.

490
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:47,221
They say that you can't act indifferent
if you really like someone.

491
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,515
I've realized that it's true.

492
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,518
Sorry.

493
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,146
It pays off to be honest.

494
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,148
You're actually apologizing.

495
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,445
I'll contact you if I go to the States.

496
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,988
We can meet up.

497
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,534
No.

498
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,205
I'm not going to see you anymore.

499
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,876
Having no relationship with you at all

500
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,420
is better than being
by your side like this.

501
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,556
Give me a last goodbye hug.

502
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,110
Bye.

503
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,728
Nice.

504
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,026
Is it not going well?

505
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,823
I should keep working on it,

506
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,909
but my head feels blocked.

507
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,498
But you know,
some things just work out suddenly

508
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,793
even when you think there's no hope.

509
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,172
I guess something good is going on.

510
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,299
What?

511
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,761
No, nothing's going on.

512
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,349
I'm happy for you, Sol.

513
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,394
Jeez, Seo Ji-wan.

514
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,483
Ji-wan didn't tell me directly.

515
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,693
I just realized it myself.

516
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,113
I'm sure she was being really obvious.

517
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,823
You were more obvious, you know.

518
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,787
I didn't think I'd be like this.

519
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,834
Ji-wan said you're an excellent counselor.

520
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,879
It's easy to give advice to others,

521
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,007
but I can't do anything myself.

522
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,553
-Is it really over with you and Jae-eon?
-What?

523
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,683
I thought you two made a good couple.

524
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,268
Why?

525
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,605
Well, it's just…

526
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:47,901
Getting attracted to each other like that
already makes it special.

527
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,906
It's a miracle.

528
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,661
A miracle? That's what I'd say
about you and Ji-wan.

529
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,579
It's nothing different.

530
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,082
It's totally different for us.

531
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:10,132
Maybe it was all wrong from the beginning.

532
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,759
It just feels that way.

533
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,437
I can't find a solution.

534
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,234
Maybe the problem
is that you're trying to find one.

535
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,956
Excuse me. Why isn't my food coming?

536
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,333
Who's going to eat it?

537
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,793
What's he on about?

538
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,796
It's all for me.

539
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,632
My friend's on a strict diet,
so he only eats chicken breast.

540
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,429
Well, that's a relief.
I didn't place your order yet.

541
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,930
What?

542
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,891
You asshole.

543
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,521
You're not picking up?

544
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,984
What? Where did he go?

545
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,909
OH MY SUNSHINE

546
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,916
What is it?

547
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,417
Why wasn't my order placed?

548
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,294
I've been waiting so long for my food.

549
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,005
You shouldn't eat stuff like that.
You have gastritis.

550
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,465
It'll ruin your stomach.

551
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,091
You and your nagging.

552
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,302
You'll get fired
if you keep working like this.

553
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,387
What's it to you
whether I get fired or not?

554
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,057
Then what's it to you
whether my stomach hurts or not?

555
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,266
Who are you to nag me?

556
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,063
I'm your friend.

557
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,484
Friends can worry
about each other's health.

558
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,493
What's gotten into you?
Why are you smiling like that?

559
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,165
"Oh My Sunshine"? That's so childish.

560
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,876
What are you on about? Where's my phone?

561
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,336
I already saw it.

562
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,172
Hey, you shouldn't snoop.

563
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:19,094
It didn't mean anything. I only wrote that
because your name means "shine."

564
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:22,097
I just wrote your name in English.
Oh Sunshine.

565
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,141
Never mind that.
When do you get off work today?

566
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,226
What?

567
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,061
Let's go on a date.

568
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,690
This looks delicious.

569
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,525
Why isn't Jae-eon coming?

570
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,905
Hang on. Let's eat these
before he comes. Ta-da!

571
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,951
I'm only giving that to you.

572
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,870
Thanks.

573
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,705
You know how much I like you, right?

574
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,965
You were always late to our meetings,
but you came early today.

575
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,175
Come on. Don't be so harsh.

576
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,554
I'm already anxious
because Jae-eon's working so hard.

577
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:06,683
You know, he's doing glass projects
because of your piece.

578
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,978
I'm getting suspicious.

579
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,898
There's something going on
between you two, right?

580
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,859
Stop that nonsense. Just eat up.

581
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:20,113
If it's not Jae-eon,
then is it that noodle shop guy?

582
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,699
Ever since our workshop,

583
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:26,202
we've been saying there's a higher chance
of you dating him. Is that right?

584
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:30,332
-What?
-Come on. Tell me.

585
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,460
I swear I won't tell anyone else.

586
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,088
Why should I tell you?

587
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,802
Jeez. Why are you suddenly
getting so upset?

588
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,846
Hey, Jae-eon.

589
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,475
-What took you so long?
-Sorry.

590
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,979
Since you're here now, let's drink.

591
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,814
Here you go.

592
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,984
You too. Here.

593
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,077
Cheers!

594
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,883
The weather is pretty nice.

595
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,430
Oh, right!

596
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,774
This is what I ordered
to your house last time.

597
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,110
They're matching keyrings.

598
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,196
It's like a heart lock and key.

599
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,824
I got these
because they're a limited edition.

600
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,410
I had no idea we would break up
before I gave it to you.

601
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,705
Aren't they pretty?

602
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,166
Yes. They're pretty.

603
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,840
So what's going to happen between us now?

604
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,383
-Us?
-Yes.

605
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,470
Well…

606
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,556
I…

607
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,476
Do I have to say this out loud?

608
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,520
You need to talk for me to understand.

609
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,068
Give me your hand.

610
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,241
Let's start dating again.

611
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,579
Be my boyfriend again.
I'll really be good to you.

612
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,541
It was all my fault.
I promise I won't do that again.

613
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,044
I'll do my best. I'll change.

614
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,338
Can't you be serious for a single second?

615
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:46,134
Hey. You're always serious.
If I become serious too,

616
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,595
then there won't be
any chemistry between us.

617
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,806
-You're right.
-Right?

618
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,102
What…

619
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,277
-Thank you.
-Thank you too.

620
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,575
I missed this smell.

621
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,038
Are you a pervert?

622
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,624
How can you say that to your sunshine?

623
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,878
I missed you too.

624
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,964
Let's go on a lot of dates from now on.

625
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,342
We can go to theaters, amusement parks,

626
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,885
beaches, and mountains.

627
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:29,928
All right.

628
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,599
I'll try being abstinent just for you.

629
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,935
What? Abstinent?

630
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,062
I'll do my best. I mean it.

631
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,815
You don't need to go that far. I mean…

632
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,194
I'm a man, you know, and…

633
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,155
I like it too.

634
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,117
You like what? Be more specific.

635
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,455
Do I really have to say that out loud?

636
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,165
You just said I needed to!

637
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,668
You're not sticking to your word.

638
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,253
-No…
-What do you mean?

639
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,379
You know what I mean.

640
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,132
How would I know?
Hey, don't talk like that.

641
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,177
What?

642
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,305
Are you calling me small? I'm pretty tall!

643
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,571
Don't worry, Mom.

644
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,409
All right. Tell Dad I'll call him later.

645
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,827
I should really get going.

646
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,246
I'll call you when I arrive.

647
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,696
Hey, Do-hyeok.

648
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,449
Yes, I'm heading out now.

649
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:17,118
No, you don't need to come.
I can just take a cab.

650
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,497
Okay. I'll be there soon.

651
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,720
Do-hyeok!

652
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,097
-Hey.
-I brought coffee…

653
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:50,944
Oh, right.

654
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,867
-What's this?
-I got them printed.

655
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,619
-The photos?
-Yes.

656
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,038
Gosh!

657
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,458
I can't believe
you got them printed like this.

658
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,339
You're really good at taking photos.

659
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:12,757
How about cooking?

660
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,051
Your cooking is a bit…

661
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,517
The weather was amazing.

662
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,394
And here.

663
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,730
-What's this?
-It's going to rain later.

664
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,191
-Today?
-Yes.

665
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,487
It doesn't look like it'll rain at all.

666
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,198
Use that if it rains. I have another one.

667
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,868
All right. Thanks.

668
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,666
So did the meeting go well?

669
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,376
Yes. It was okay.

670
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,588
We're meeting again
after revising the contract a little.

671
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,506
A contract?

672
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,259
Then you're going to have an agency?

673
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,678
I don't know much about it yet, though.

674
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:03,266
Your new video got a lot of views too.

675
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,059
It's all thanks to you.

676
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,811
Thanks.

677
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,856
I told you, it's not me. It's all you.

678
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:13,067
I only thought of doing it
since you gave me all that advice.

679
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,235
That's why.

680
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,909
Thanks for saying that.

681
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,333
The day we met at your school,

682
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:32,837
I went to your house at night
to give you the photos.

683
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,883
Oh, really? Why didn't you say anything?

684
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,968
I saw you and Jae-eon

685
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,513
going into your house together.

686
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,730
I know I said I could wait for you
as long as it takes.

687
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,402
But I felt so jealous.

688
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,201
Do-hyeok.

689
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:08,414
Na-bi. I really wish you were happy.

690
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,584
But Park Jae-eon…

691
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:23,346
Have you felt, even once,
that he sincerely likes you?

692
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,763
Jae-eon?

693
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,306
Why are you here?

694
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:51,559
Hey.

695
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,479
Why are you home so late?

696
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,481
Were you with Do-hyeok this whole time?

697
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,566
Are you drunk?

698
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,610
And it's none of your business.

699
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,945
How cold.

700
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:08,201
Am I boring to you
since you have someone else now?

701
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,454
Let's talk again when you're sober.

702
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:22,215
Does he still like you
even after seeing us

703
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,382
entering your house?

704
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,010
What?

705
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,304
Incredible.

706
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,849
Is that why you choose him instead of me?

707
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:38,064
You knew that Do-hyeok was here that day?

708
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,774
Did you know too?

709
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,946
So you're saying
you saw Do-hyeok here that day?

710
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,572
Yes.

711
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,201
You should have seen his face.

712
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,328
It seemed like he'd burst into tears.

713
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,205
Why didn't you tell me?

714
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:55,957
Why would I do that?

715
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,586
Oh, right. You said
you didn't want to disappoint him.

716
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,049
Then should I have told you
to explain things to him?

717
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:08,761
But it's true
that we had a relationship like that.

718
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,601
Have you lost your mind?

719
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,228
You shouldn't get angry at me.

720
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,814
I'm just telling the truth like you did.

721
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:34,745
Is that why you asked me out?

722
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,789
Isn't that what you wanted?

723
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:43,713
Oh, I guess
that's not what you wanted from me.

724
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,591
And you say you really like me?

725
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,050
That's nonsense.

726
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,219
What about you?
Why did you say that to Seol-a?

727
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,055
Was that just to screw me over?
It wasn't, right?

728
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:56,517
It was. I just did that to screw you over.

729
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,978
You were leading me on
but saying I was a friend,

730
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,523
then I found out you had a girlfriend.
I did it because you were a jerk.

731
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,150
Hey.

732
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,569
So am I the only jerk here?

733
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:08,821
Do you regret it?

734
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,116
Do you regret

735
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,619
what we did?

736
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,166
Yes.

737
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,044
I regret it.

738
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,634
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we did.

739
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,596
But I won't blame you.

740
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,598
I brought it on myself.

741
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,519
I knew there was no happy ending for us,

742
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:44,482
but I was an idiot for getting my hopes up
and thinking you could be sincere.

743
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:51,072
You told me that I had
the right to decide our relationship.

744
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,160
I don't want to see you ever again.

745
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,249
I lost

746
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,502
Na-bi…

747
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:30,963
for good.

748
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,469
Hey, Na-bi!

749
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:21,472
It feels like I'm having terrible,
recurring nightmares.

750
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:23,057
Let's fix this.

751
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,392
You look the happiest
when you're working on your pieces.

752
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,393
And the prettiest.

753
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:29,313
-I'm excited to see it.
-But can you come?

754
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:30,856
Don't strain yourself.

755
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,734
No, I have to make it.
It's your exhibition.

756
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:38,906
How can I define the feelings
I have left for Jae-eon?

757
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,699
-Na-bi.
-If you decided to be a jerk,

758
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,451
you should've stayed that way.
Why are you here like this?

759
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,036
What do you want from me?

760
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,247
I'll stay away from you. I promise.

761
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:50,501
Lingering affection? Regret? Hate? Or…

762
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,503
Do I still have a chance with you?

763
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,296
Please accept this.

764
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,429
