1
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,062
You smell of cigarettes.

2
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,860
Should we continue after I brush my teeth?

3
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,278
What?

4
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,781
The others must be waiting. Let's go back.

5
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,452
I did it.

6
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,801
EPISODE 3: IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.
NEVERTHELESS,

7
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,077
What is this emotion?

8
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,463
I hope it's just love.

9
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,134
Not childish jealousy.

10
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,069
Something seems to be going on
between Na-bi and Jae-eon, right?

11
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,488
-Why do you say so?
-Those two

12
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,823
disappeared for a while last night.

13
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,660
And it seemed like something happened
between them.

14
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,787
I could tell from her expression.

15
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,582
And I saw them whispering something
by the door early in the morning.

16
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,252
I couldn't hear what they said though.

17
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,670
Are you the only one who saw?

18
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,714
Yes, and I didn't tell Bit-na.
Good thing I didn't, right?

19
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,800
-Good thinking.
-I'm starving.

20
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,344
The noodles are here.

21
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,973
It looks so good!

22
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,309
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

23
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,186
And don't say anything to Na-bi.

24
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,813
Don't worry.

25
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,606
I'm going to steal this from you!

26
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,991
Would it be okay though?

27
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,993
What? Your belly fat?

28
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,079
No! I mean Na-bi.

29
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,791
She's probably having a hard time
after breaking up with her ex.

30
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,086
She could get involved in gossip
by hanging out with him.

31
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,798
I don't think
she should be seeing Jae-eon.

32
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,966
Really?

33
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,220
I think Jae-eon is better than her ex.

34
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,056
What? Really? Why?

35
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,812
I don't know. I can just feel it.

36
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,939
They look good together.

37
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,696
Got drunk and kissed…

38
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,865
RECENT SEARCHES
KISSING SOMEONE BEFORE DATING

39
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,576
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHO I HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR

40
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,912
I MADE A MISTAKE WHILE DRUNK
EVERYONE THINKS WEIRDLY OF ME

41
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,290
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

42
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,209
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT AFTER
WAS IT JUST A DRUNKEN MISTAKE?

43
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,712
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
ONCE YOU'VE TOUCHED FIRST BASE

44
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,881
YOU'LL END UP BECOMING SP
OR DRIFTING APART

45
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,091
"SP"?

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,387
"SP"? As in…

47
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,891
"Sex partners"?

48
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,226
Na-bi.

49
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,480
You startled me.

50
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,856
What were you looking at?

51
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,776
Just looking for some references.

52
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,573
Sol.

53
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,036
If you want to kiss someone,

54
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,916
does that mean you want
to sleep with them as well?

55
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,211
Are you asking about me?

56
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,089
Or is it about you?

57
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,800
What? Me?

58
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,178
No, it's not about me.

59
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:32,058
I mean, generally. I just want to know
how people usually feel.

60
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,853
I'm just trying to come up
with an idea for my assignment.

61
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,106
I'm not sure.

62
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,442
I guess it'll depend on
who the other person is.

63
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,529
The other person…

64
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,483
SEOL-A

65
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,945
I just got on the plane!

66
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,411
One-night…

67
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,206
I'm not sure.

68
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,918
I guess it'll depend on
who the other person is.

69
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,919
"The other person"?

70
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,506
You may want to kiss and have sex
with someone,

71
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,552
or you might kiss someone
and not want to go further.

72
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,806
So in the end, it depends
on who the other person is.

73
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,892
Then what kind of person

74
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,644
am I to him?

75
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,106
ONE-NIGHT STAND?

76
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,126
PARK JAE-EON

77
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,505
SHOULDN'T WE TALK ABOUT YESTERDAY?

78
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,216
Would I seem too clingy?

79
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,271
-Hey!
-Hi!

80
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,191
Hey, Na-bi.

81
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,609
Hi.

82
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,320
My battery's dead again.
Maybe I should get a new phone.

83
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,490
-Where's Ji-wan?
-She's meeting someone.

84
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,325
-What are you doing?
-I need a charger.

85
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,702
She's watching a movie
with her blind date.

86
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,496
She doesn't care much about school.

87
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,332
Let's see…

88
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,460
I want to ask

89
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:10,800
what I should say to get Jae-eon
to tell me how he really feels about me.

90
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,843
Do you really like that guy?

91
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,637
-Yes.
-You don't look that way.

92
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,597
Do you dance excitedly

93
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,849
whenever you like someone's post?

94
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,434
That's different though.

95
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,566
Why would you sleep with someone

96
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,820
you're not even dating?

97
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,030
Isn't that meaningless?

98
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,240
Gosh.

99
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,077
Why do you always associate sex
with dating? Are you that old-fashioned?

100
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,037
-Watch your mouth.
-Lower your voice!

101
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,665
-Someone might hear you.
-I'm not saying anything wrong.

102
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,334
I can say it even louder! Should I?

103
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,461
Let's begin class!

104
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,631
All right, let's begin class.

105
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,926
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello.

106
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,595
-Hello.
-Hello.

107
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,352
Try this.

108
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,690
-You're not with your cute friend today.
-She's hanging out with someone else.

109
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,359
She must be having fun.
I'll get you your food right away.

110
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,445
Thank you. Give us a large serving.

111
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,696
All right.

112
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,198
You must be a regular here.

113
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,493
Yes. My friend loves this place.

114
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,413
But this place is quite famous
in this neighborhood.

115
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,249
Danpunggol was the most popular
when I was in school.

116
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,752
You went to school here?

117
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,462
Yes. I was an Economics major.

118
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,214
-I graduated two years ago.
-I see.

119
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,514
I'm really sorry about last time.

120
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,892
I put in an estimated amount.

121
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,269
Tell me if it's not enough.

122
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,937
It's really fine.

123
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,191
It's okay. Keep it.

124
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,533
This isn't why I asked to see you.

125
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,994
Sorry? Then why…

126
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,000
Here's your food.

127
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,920
It's hot, so be careful. Enjoy.

128
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,962
Thank you.

129
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,175
-What's wrong?
-You're really strong.

130
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,843
Do you work out?

131
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,179
Oh, I major in sculpture.

132
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,100
I always work with clay,
so I have a lot of strength in my hands.

133
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,609
Just buy me this meal. That's enough.

134
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,613
I wouldn't feel comfortable with that.

135
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,827
-Then buy me coffee, too.
-I'll buy dessert as well.

136
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,204
Okay.

137
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,082
-Like this?
-Yes.

138
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,334
-Do it like that.
-Thank you.

139
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,885
That's it for today.

140
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,596
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

141
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,433
The weather is so nice today.

142
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,351
You should all go on a date.

143
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,353
-Okay.
-Come on.

144
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,481
Why aren't you answering?

145
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,358
Don't tell me you guys are all single.

146
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:19,780
You should at least
have one proper relationship at your age.

147
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,492
What they say about art
coming from loneliness is nonsense.

148
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:28,038
Dating is the best way
to get inspiration for art.

149
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,332
She's at it again.

150
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,209
Didn't she say class was over?

151
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,296
Love is what can make
even the roughest person become

152
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,008
as soft as sand on a beach.

153
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,428
I can't believe you guys.

154
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,305
You guys are art majors, you know.

155
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,474
They have no inspiration.

156
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,395
One student told me a while ago

157
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,731
that he doesn't want a relationship.

158
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,691
He just wants to flirt and date around.

159
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,529
Basically, he wants to have fun
with no strings attached.

160
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,199
He should have one-night stands instead.

161
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,701
It's so sad, isn't it?

162
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,661
Goodness.

163
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,540
Find your inspirations, all right?

164
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,250
-Yes, ma'am.
-That's what art is.

165
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,919
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

166
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,922
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for today.

167
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,852
PARK YE-SOM, KANG SEO-YEON, LEE YE-HWA

168
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,978
YU NA-BI

169
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,986
I'M BUYING ART SUPPLIES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

170
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,828
Jae-eon.

171
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,875
Welcome back.

172
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,086
You've gotten more handsome.

173
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,177
You must've enjoyed it, Ji-wan.

174
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,514
Yes, it was so fun.
It was much better than I expected.

175
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,517
-I want to watch it again with my friend.
-Your friend?

176
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,937
-It's not a guy, right?
-It's a girl, of course.

177
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,648
Her name's Sol. She's been my bestie
since middle school.

178
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,025
I think she'll enjoy it, too.

179
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,151
I'll watch it with her.

180
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,114
Then Ji-wan,

181
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,616
watch it again with me next time, too.

182
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,869
Well, okay.

183
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,538
But you didn't seem to enjoy it
as much as I did.

184
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,540
I really enjoyed it too.

185
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,627
It wasn't what I expected though.

186
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,630
-What do you mean?
-I thought it would be about romance,

187
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,966
but it was about friendship.

188
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,719
Oh. Friendship?

189
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,222
I felt that it was clearly about love,

190
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,266
but I guess you could've seen it that way.

191
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,226
Still, it was good.

192
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,981
If you're hungry, should we go eat?

193
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,983
Yes. I'm really hungry.

194
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,112
I said I'd buy. Why did you pay?

195
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,950
Well, I didn't think it'd be enough
to repay me.

196
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,912
I knew it.

197
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,754
Can you pay next time?

198
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,340
I'd like to see you again.

199
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:26,800
Why?

200
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,472
It was fun hearing about your projects.

201
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,059
-You ate…
-I eat quite a lot.

202
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,269
Hey, it's Sol.

203
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,229
She's the friend I just told you about.

204
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,441
That's strange.
I'm not really a smooth talker.

205
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,652
No, I really enjoyed listening to you.

206
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,530
Who's that next to her?

207
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,366
Where are you headed now?

208
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,534
I'm taking the bus here.

209
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,621
-I'll come with you.
-No, I can go by myself.

210
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,250
Why don't you try calling her?

211
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,002
No, it's fine.

212
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,839
You two must be really close.

213
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,175
Yes.

214
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,344
Let's go.

215
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,641
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3

216
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,674
I'm so hungry.

217
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,182
Jae-eon still isn't contacting me.

218
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,691
I don't know if he just doesn't care
about me or if he's teasing me.

219
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,610
But whichever it is,

220
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,071
it sucks.

221
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,791
I hate to admit it,

222
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:09,046
but I can't take my eyes off him
once he comes into my sight.

223
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,648
Hey, Seol-a.

224
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,442
I knew it was you.

225
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,862
Hang on. I'll be there soon.

226
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,639
Who is Seol-a?

227
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:04,977
Seol-a.

228
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,237
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-It's okay.

229
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,948
-Who is she…
-Should we get something to drink?

230
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,366
-to make him smile…
-Okay.

231
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,826
-like that?
-Let's go.

232
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,924
You're so pathetic, Na-bi.

233
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,093
You're acting like a stalker.

234
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,727
I could tell right away.

235
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,939
She's the one Jae-eon's heart belongs to.

236
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,445
Welcome.

237
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,405
Oh, Na-bi!

238
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,118
I sat next to you yesterday.

239
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,579
You stole my water, remember?

240
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,539
Oh, that's my water.

241
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,379
Oh, right. The freshman.
Your name is Kang Eun-han, right?

242
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,006
It's Kim Eun-han.

243
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,217
You're bad at remembering people.

244
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,928
Sorry, there were
so many people yesterday.

245
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,054
Do you work here?

246
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,181
Yes. Just in the evenings. I just started.

247
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,516
Was it fun last night?

248
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,771
I wanted to hang out longer,
but I had to come and work.

249
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,815
You haven't had dinner?

250
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,817
No. I was working on my assignment.

251
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,529
In that case. I was saving this,

252
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,573
but you can have it.

253
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,867
No, it's fine. You should have it.

254
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,244
It's okay.

255
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,371
I want you to have it.

256
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,373
Thanks.

257
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,792
I'll enjoy this.
Good luck with work, then.

258
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,126
Na-bi.

259
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,045
Can you give me your phone?

260
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,215
-My phone?
-Yes.

261
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,893
Do you know them?

262
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,021
You keep looking at them.

263
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,441
A freshman in our department.
He must work there.

264
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,693
Not him.

265
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,156
Is that girl a freshman, too?

266
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,658
Here's my number.

267
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,160
-I'll contact you later.
-Okay.

268
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,871
No. She's my senior.

269
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,250
Or maybe a friend.

270
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,340
-Take care, then.
-Bye.

271
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,883
-See you later.
-See you.

272
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,684
You're still using that?

273
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,147
-What about you?
-Me?

274
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,109
I lost it a long time ago.

275
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,155
That's disappointing.

276
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,909
How are your butterflies doing?

277
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,952
They're fine.

278
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,664
But I'm going to set them free soon.

279
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,291
Why?

280
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,169
I feel guilty.

281
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,256
They're supposed to be free,
but they're locked up

282
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,008
because of me.

283
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,970
You've grown up.

284
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,558
That girl…

285
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,895
Her name's Na-bi.

286
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,942
So you haven't grown up.
You just found another butterfly.

287
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,070
It's not like that.

288
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,614
She's just a friend.

289
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,909
You're lying.

290
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,037
Even her name is Na-bi.

291
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,456
Is it fate?

292
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,958
Don't be ridiculous.

293
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,211
You're my fate.

294
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,509
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
SLICE THE GREEN ONIONS

295
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,357
NEW MESSAGE FROM KIM EUN-HAN

296
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,192
Hello, Na-bi!

297
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,402
It's Kim Eun-han from a moment ago.

298
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,946
He messaged me right away.

299
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,657
Right. Hi.

300
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,951
Are you coming to the flea market?

301
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,494
I'm serving at our booth!

302
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,455
Or you can come to the after-party.

303
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,917
I hope you'll come.

304
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,752
Okay, then.

305
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,297
Really? Then I'll see you there!

306
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,388
To be honest, it doesn't feel bad.

307
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,484
By the way, are there days
when you don't have class?

308
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,320
Oh, was that too personal?

309
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,697
My apologies.

310
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,949
Good night. See you at the festival!

311
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,910
Sadly, I have class every day.

312
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,037
Good night.

313
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,628
PARK JAE-EON

314
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,884
Jae-eon!

315
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,889
No way! You can do glass art, too?

316
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,474
What are you making?

317
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,476
What?

318
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,270
Oh, I'm making a suncatcher.

319
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,731
It's so pretty.
You're making a butterfly again.

320
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,816
You really love butterflies, don't you?

321
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,949
What? Do you have a cold?

322
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,867
Stay away from me.

323
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,703
I don't know. I have a headache.

324
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,332
Are you sick from quitting Jae-eon?

325
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,959
Withdrawal symptoms?

326
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,502
What are you on about?

327
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,420
You haven't been hanging out with him.

328
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,297
Is it over now?

329
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,051
I don't think we really click.

330
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,014
I'm disappointed.

331
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,517
The quiet kids usually end up causing
huge trouble.

332
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,060
That disappoints you?

333
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,438
Of course. I was looking forward to
some drama. This is so boring.

334
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,236
You seem to want to push me into
Hell's pit just for your entertainment.

335
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,364
Come on, don't say it like that.

336
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,283
Like when you all came to my house.

337
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,035
Why did you have to talk about
testing him and stuff?

338
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,120
What about it?

339
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,957
Why? Did something happen
between you two that day?

340
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,805
I mean, it was useless
because nothing happened.

341
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,557
You saw what it was like.

342
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,978
Do you know what you need
to catch a big fish, Na-bi?

343
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,813
You're going to say "patience," right?

344
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,233
And he's not even a catch.

345
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:51,776
He isn't?

346
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,821
Well, it depends.

347
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,866
Anyhow, are you sure he doesn't date?

348
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,201
I'm sure. I told you.

349
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,830
Why? Did he ask you out?

350
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:08,501
No, it seemed like he was dating someone.
But maybe I'm mistaken.

351
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,754
Na-bi! Hi!

352
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,213
-Hi.
-Hi.

353
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,508
Hi, Eun-han. Are you going to eat lunch?

354
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,136
-Yes.
-Enjoy your lunch.

355
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,597
-You too.
-Okay.

356
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,686
What was that with Eun-han?

357
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,688
We got close recently.

358
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,025
Is there something about him, too?

359
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,111
No. Not that I know of.

360
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:40,450
I knew it. You're receiving attention
as soon as you come out of your bubble.

361
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,286
Gosh, but Eun-han's a bit boring.

362
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,456
Leave me out of your fun, okay?

363
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,627
So you're thinking of seeing him?

364
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,712
It's not like that.

365
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,800
This is a bit disappointing.

366
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,227
Hi.

367
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,896
You should get some vitamins.

368
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,858
Thanks.

369
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:14,984
How is that going?

370
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,614
It's bad. I'm screwed this semester.

371
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,617
No way. You're so good.

372
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,369
What do you know?

373
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,162
I know quite a lot.

374
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:31,209
I actually saw your piece when I was here
for the entrance exam last year.

375
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,919
Last year?

376
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,756
Then it would have been…

377
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,225
LOVE
YU NA-BI

378
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,476
"Love"?

379
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,062
"Yu Na-bi."

380
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,276
-The one about love?
-Yes.

381
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,738
I got scolded for making the same thing
over and over.

382
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,948
I loved it. I even took a photo.

383
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,491
Let me see.

384
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,871
There aren't many pieces
that depict love just as it is.

385
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,249
Everyone thinks they have to
make it look cool.

386
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,419
Where is it?

387
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,338
Oh, right. I got a new phone.

388
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,799
Na-bi. Could I see it again?

389
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,509
I promise to back up my photos.

390
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,721
-Well…
-Yes?

391
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,556
I threw it away.

392
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,392
-Really?
-Because my ex was the inspiration.

393
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,977
Is it really not here?

394
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,939
Thanks.

395
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,566
For what?

396
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,196
To be honest, I gave up on the piece
I was working on,

397
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,614
and I didn't know what to do.

398
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,074
But you cheered me up.

399
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:53,166
He does seem pretty cute.

400
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,961
But it's a bit awkward
since you're talking so formally to me.

401
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:57,962
Just talk casually.

402
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,174
It's hard for me to do that
to people older than me.

403
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,467
Oh, really?

404
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,720
All right, then. Whatever you prefer.

405
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,764
No. I'll talk casually

406
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,766
from now on.

407
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,601
Okay.

408
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:15,772
Na-bi, everyone said this movie was good.
Did you watch it?

409
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,028
No, I didn't. I haven't been
to a movie theater in a while.

410
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,738
Do you want to watch it with me?

411
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,493
-Is it a romantic movie?
-Yes.

412
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,123
Hi.

413
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,834
Hello.

414
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,921
Oh, hi.

415
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,132
What are you two talking about?

416
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,553
We're going to watch a movie together.

417
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,265
Should we watch something else, then?

418
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,601
-Well…
-Hey.

419
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,603
You're talking casually to her?

420
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,066
Were you two close?

421
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,241
Yes. We're close.
Closer than you and me, anyway.

422
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,663
Let's watch this, Eun-han.
I like romantic movies.

423
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,082
Okay, then.

424
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,834
Hey.

425
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,879
Isn't this erotic?

426
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,714
That's better, then.

427
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,008
Let's watch it.

428
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,052
Right. You'll need a reference.

429
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,095
What do you mean?

430
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,680
The male lead.

431
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,724
He's a good kisser.

432
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,185
Na-bi's fussy about kisses.

433
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,690
Be careful because she'll push you away
if she doesn't like it.

434
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,900
See me outside.

435
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,079
-What was that about?
-What?

436
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,415
Why would you
suddenly mention kissing? Hey.

437
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,168
Stop playing games with me.

438
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,713
Playing games? You're the one
who pushed my hand away.

439
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,423
I never let you touch my shoulder.

440
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,550
There's nothing between us, you know.

441
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,428
-Why are you so upset?
-I'm not upset!

442
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,476
I'm not upset.

443
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,481
You never contacted me since that day.
You know that?

444
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,107
You didn't, either.

445
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,235
And what's so wrong about that?

446
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,243
I'm sorry,
but I'm not that kind of person.

447
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,956
What do you mean by that?

448
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,626
I thought you were enjoying it.

449
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,587
Don't worry.

450
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,090
I won't try anything with you.

451
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,052
Good luck with Eun-han.

452
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,726
Fine.

453
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,944
Well, you left your phone…

454
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,280
Right. Thanks.

455
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,366
Na-bi.

456
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,327
Should we go watch the movie?

457
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:21,749
All right.

458
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,601
Na-bi.

459
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,022
I like butterflies
way more than dragonflies.

460
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,440
You didn't eat, right?

461
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,860
This place is really amazing. Try it.

462
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,530
And you don't seem to be
in a good mood. So eat up.

463
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,699
You should eat to cheer up.

464
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,075
You should eat too.

465
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,789
-Here, have some water.
-Thank you.

466
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,875
Na-bi. That's my water.

467
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,294
Stop that!

468
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,755
-You seemed to like water.
-Stop it.

469
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,340
This is it.
Going on a date in the daytime.

470
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,676
-Right.
-Sweet and innocent attraction.

471
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,811
I saw it!

472
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,193
-"Miracle"?
-"Past"?

473
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,196
That's great.

474
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,906
-It's open.
-Yes! It's open!

475
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,245
Could you take a photo of us?

476
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,705
Thank you.

477
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,208
All right, then. One, two.

478
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,253
Can I have a combo set, please?

479
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,172
Which flavor would you like?

480
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:55,176
Well…

481
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,351
Eating and watching a movie together,
like a normal date.

482
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,561
Something that suits me perfectly.

483
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,700
Come on, just once.

484
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,286
One, two, three.

485
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,292
It's a good photo. Let me take one of you.

486
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,170
One, two, three.

487
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,882
Let's eat.

488
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,385
Here.

489
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,306
Enjoy your meal.

490
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,604
This is really good.

491
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,022
-Is it?
-Yes.

492
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,524
Why do I…

493
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,277
still have this on my phone?

494
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,696
Na-bi.

495
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,533
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I got everything.

496
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,660
Oh, okay.

497
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,371
-Should I buy more?
-No, it's fine. Thanks.

498
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,126
This is really tasty.

499
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,380
Will things keep piling up like this?

500
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,383
I was a loser who was always running away.

501
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,389
But I can't run away from you.

502
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,686
I like everything about you,

503
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,148
and I can't stop thinking about you.

504
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,360
I…

505
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,532
I love you.

506
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,542
What are you thinking, Na-bi?

507
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,005
I wasn't thinking of anything. Why?

508
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,884
You didn't seem to be in a good mood
since we were in the theater.

509
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,471
-So I thought you didn't like the movie.
-Well…

510
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,765
I'm just not feeling too good.

511
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,185
It was a bit too cheesy, right?

512
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,895
Really?

513
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,731
I enjoyed it a lot.

514
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,611
It made me want to have
a relationship like that too.

515
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,072
I suddenly got that feeling…

516
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,121
Actually, I heard you and Jae-eon earlier.

517
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,125
Oh, I see.

518
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,089
-But he's…
-I know. It's over now, right?

519
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,465
"Over"?

520
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,516
You know that he only hurts other people.

521
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,520
Don't let someone who was never sincere
toward you hurt you.

522
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,688
I know…

523
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:57,608
what it's like. But it's all meaningless.

524
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,236
And most of all,
you two don't suit each other.

525
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,449
All right.

526
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,829
Okay.

527
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,843
Sorry, Eun-han.

528
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,344
I…

529
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,097
I was about to sneeze.

530
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,348
Forget it.

531
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,853
I really did! Eun-han!

532
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,801
He is pretty cute, but…

533
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,476
Are you with someone?

534
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,810
Because you're cute.

535
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,366
I just don't feel a spark with him
like I did with Jae-eon.

536
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,839

538
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,805
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO

539
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,646

PAINKILLER

541
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,626
What do you mean?

542
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,461
You heard me.

543
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,923
The landlord said you can't get
an extension.

544
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,675
But why?

545
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,887
I should've been notified
at least three months in advance, then.

546
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:35,015
-Whatever. I relayed the message.
-Excuse me!

547
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,185
What the heck?

548
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,937
Darn it.

549
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,647
Oh, my gosh!

550
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,322
-Na-bi!
-Hello!

551
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,741
Hey, you look really good in that.

552
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,410
Thank you, my lady.

553
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,370
Are you not coming to our booth?

554
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,207
I'm okay. How are the preparations going?

555
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,334
I'm sure it's going great.
They have Jae-eon.

556
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,171
My friends said they're coming,
but there might not be seats.

557
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,298
-You have friends?
-Of course I do!

558
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,844
So what will you do?
Can you find a house within a month?

559
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,431
If I can't, I'll have to find
a small studio or something.

560
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,433
Or some housemates.

561
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,935
What about all your stuff?

562
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,523
I guess I'll have to use
a storage service.

563
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,069
Darn it! What do I do?

564
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,988
The rent is expensive around here now.

565
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,741
It'll be impossible to find
another place with cheap rent.

566
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,035
I'm screwed!

567
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,038
Hey, calm down.

568
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,998
How much was the rent?

569
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,668
-Hello!
-Hello!

570
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,629
-Hi.
-Can we have more butane?

571
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,797
And where can we get more folding chairs?

572
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,216
In the clubroom.

573
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,634
Oh, right.

574
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,844
Tell Sol not to come to the booth.

575
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,680
She'll run into Professor Lee
and get nagged to death.

576
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,557
Why would she get nagged?

577
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,934
Don't you know?

578
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,936
The exchange program.

579
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,438
It's really exhausting for me, too.

580
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,067
She'll get a full scholarship.
What's holding her back?

581
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,735
Some people are dying to go.

582
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,905
It's not an easy decision to make though.
Here you go.

583
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,532
Exchange program?

584
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,409
What? You didn't know?

585
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,411
-No.
-How did you not know?

586
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,872
All the professors are going.

587
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,249
-Let's take these.
-Okay.

588
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,583
Let's go.

589
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,127
-I'll go with them.
-Bye.

590
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,337
Let's go.

591
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,925
What's going on?

592
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,927
Goodness.

593
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,198
What are you doing here?

594
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:57,866
Nothing.

595
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,036
Aren't you going to the flea market?

596
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,122
-Are you going to see Eun-han?
-What?

597
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,417
I heard something's going on
between you and him.

598
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,128
-I heard everything.
-From Bit-na, right?

599
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,379
I'm glad.

600
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,883
I don't know him well,
but he's way better than Jae-eon.

601
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,891
Last time, when the professor
called you and Sol…

602
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,436
It was because
of the exchange program, right?

603
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,229
Well…

604
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:31,817
Yes.

605
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,571
I see.

606
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,948
But Bit-na didn't hear from Sol, either.

607
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,827
Sol was probably thinking
of telling you first.

608
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,622
And I only heard when I met
the professor with her.

609
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,498
I don't know.

610
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,169
I bet she didn't tell me
because I'd feel upset.

611
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,588
Did I tell you before?

612
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,798
I started art because of Sol.

613
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:55,966
Really?

614
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,593
I didn't know.

615
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,971
She wanted to major in art
since she was in middle school.

616
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,474
And I worked so hard to join her.

617
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,270
I thought I'd at least be able
to keep up with her if I did my best.

618
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,608
But I guess there are things
you can never do.

619
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,194
I can barely get my assignments done.

620
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,198
I don't even know if I can graduate.

621
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,079
I'm so jealous of her.

622
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,415
That kind of presence
only comes naturally.

623
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,833
Right.

624
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,253
Some people are gifted like that.

625
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,219
Let's go to the flea market.

626
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,347
-All right. Let's go.
-Let's go.

627
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,184
SCULPTURE DEPARTMENT FLEA MARKET

628
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,442
Is everything going okay?

629
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,365
All right, the next two people. Come in.

630
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,742
She's just not my type.

631
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,874
Why is he here?

632
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,670
I know, right? He's not even here to help.

633
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,630
-He's not even paying.
-Right.

634
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,674
He's just here to watch us.

635
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,634
-That looks nice.
-No.

636
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,845
-Here you go.
-Can I…

637
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,847
have your number?

638
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,932
Sorry.

639
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,767
What was that? Namaste?

640
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,687
-I should use this gesture too.
-Where would you use that?

641
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,232
Hey, let's go.

642
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,900
Why? You wanted to come.

643
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,570
It's too noisy and crowded in here.

644
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,947
-And there aren't any pretty girls.
-But there are.

645
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,575
Let's just go. Come on.

646
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,077
Hey, they're leaving.

647
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,745
-What a relief.
-Why's he leaving?

648
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,706
-You're leaving?
-Yes!

649
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,375
Hey, they're gone. Go and serve the food.

650
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,378
Gosh. It's a festival,
but they're not selling drinks, Professor.

651
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,755
This is unbelievable.

652
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,050
-He really is popular, isn't he?
-This place is so nice.

653
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,595
-You're so handsome.
-Thank you.

654
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,305
-You must be tired.
-Can I have your number?

655
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:09,266
-Sorry.
-They're all smiling from ear to ear.

656
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,478
-Are you two dating?
-What? No!

657
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,481
Why are you overreacting?
Kids like you always end up dating.

658
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,983
Professor, that's never going to happen.

659
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,319
Watch what you say.
It could really happen.

660
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,655
No way. Hey, Jin-su. Come over here.

661
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,282
Professor, this is…

662
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,575
By the way,

663
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,662
that student over there.
He's Park Jae-eon, right?

664
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,289
-Yes.
-Yes.

665
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:36,168
I remember him since he's very competent.

666
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,590
I should get going.

667
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,217
-Have fun.
-All right.

668
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,385
-Don't cause any trouble.
-Okay.

669
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,429
-Jin-su will show you out.
-I'll escort you.

670
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,641
Okay. I have some work
to finish up, so I'll get going.

671
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,476
-Bye, then.
-I'll see you later.

672
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,103
-Bye.
-Don't cause any trouble.

673
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,271
Bye, Professor.

674
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,607
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

675
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,735
I thought she'd leave
like three hours ago.

676
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,198
So she remembers him
because of his competency?

677
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:10,494
I bet she remembers him
because he's so handsome.

678
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,454
Hey, where did you steal this?

679
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,039
We can't sell alcohol here.

680
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,791
I bought it at a convenience store.

681
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,668
Can't I even do that?

682
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,630
You're going to drink at the after-party.
Can't you hold yourself back?

683
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,551
Seriously, you nag more than my mom.

684
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:29,221
If you get drunk today, I'm really
going to abandon you on the streets.

685
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,690
That looks delicious.

686
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,276
Hey, Ji-wan! Over here.

687
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,445
Hey! You got really good seats.

688
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,864
Why don't you join us?
I'll introduce you to them.

689
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,658
No, I'm fine. Have fun.

690
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,159
Then call me if you get bored.

691
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,661
Okay.

692
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,663
-Have fun.
-Okay.

693
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,126
When did you come?

694
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,335
You should've called me.

695
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,672
ARTISTS THAT SHINE
LOOKING FOR ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE

696
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,388
This is the usual serving.

697
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,474
But I added more
since you seemed like you'd eat a lot.

698
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,276
Eun-han.

699
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:30,991
Hey, Na-bi.

700
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,869
There are so many people.

701
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:37,122
-Our department's the most crowded.
-Right. Well…

702
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,000
-Are you here with anyone?
-What?

703
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,128
There are so many people.
I didn't think it'd get so crowded.

704
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,047
Maybe you should just go somewhere else.

705
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,799
No, I just came to see you for a moment.

706
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,009
As I promised.

707
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,805
Right.

708
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,182
Eun-han!

709
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:02,564
When do you get off?
We're thinking of getting drinks.

710
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,364
Who is she? Your friend?

711
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,200
She's a senior that I'm close with.

712
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,705
Oh, hello.

713
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,000
Right. Hi.

714
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,755
Well, why don't you go ahead first?
I'll join you after I finish.

715
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,049
Okay. Call me when you're done.

716
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,300
All right.

717
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,974
-I'll see you later, then.
-It's not like that.

718
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,853
I've liked her since I was in high school,
but she rejected me.

719
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,523
And she suddenly contacted me yesterday…

720
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,280
I'm really sorry.

721
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,824
All right.

722
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,584
Let's begin the game. Se-hun?

723
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,129
-All right. Let's spin the wheel!
-Spin the wheel!

724
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,256
-That looks fun.
-Let's try that later.

725
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,757
Speed quiz!

726
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,051
-Is it only for couples?
-I don't think so.

727
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,054
By the way, that guy has a crush
on Sol, right?

728
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,681
You got it right!

729
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,307
-Right or…
-Wrong.

730
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,560
How would I know?

731
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,896
I'm sure of it. I told him we were
Sol's friends,

732
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,565
and he gave us so much food.

733
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,401
Sol's not that close to him.

734
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,988
Well, since you two are so close.
Don't you get sick of each other?

735
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,743
We don't hang out as much as we did
these days.

736
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,620
Right. You've been dating a lot.

737
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,247
-Spin the wheel!
-Spin the wheel!

738
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,250
-Spin!
-But I kind of feel sorry for him.

739
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:49,045
If Sol goes to the States, she'll be
hanging out with hot American guys.

740
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,758
Wasn't she going to England?
It seemed like she was going to Europe.

741
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,551
Is she really going though? When?

742
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,344
How did you guys know?

743
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,847
What do you mean?
Can I have some of your juice?

744
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,724
-Here.
-Thanks.

745
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,935
Hey, there's Sol!

746
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,312
She's with someone though.

747
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,480
Hey, Sol!

748
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,315
Isn't he the guy from the café?

749
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,817
Hey, I think he is.

750
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,320
Hi, I'm Jung Ju-hyeok.

751
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,655
-Hi!
-Hi.

752
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,574
Is he your boyfriend, Sol?

753
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,284
No.

754
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,245
Have you been seeing each other
since then?

755
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:26,374
I had business nearby, and I asked her
to show me around school.

756
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,628
-Let's go!
-Let's go play a couple's game!

757
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,088
-A couple's game!
-Couple's game!

758
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,507
All right.

759
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,425
-Let's…
-Sol!

760
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,844
Sol! Come play…

761
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,096
Are you…

762
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,349
Are you two a couple?

763
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,894
-You're here to play the couple's game!
-Don't they look good together?

764
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,313
-Let me through.
-You have to throw a dart

765
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,732
and play the game it lands on.

766
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,692
That's all you have to do.

767
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,985
You try it.

768
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,320
-Me?
-Yes.

769
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,823
You should give up.
You're no match to him.

770
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,159
Okay, let's go.

771
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,161
Se-hun, spin the wheel.

772
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,789
All right, I'll spin the wheel.

773
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,834
Spin the wheel!

774
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:13,380
Oh, it's "Pop the Balloon"!
The most exciting game.

775
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,215
-What is it?
-You two, come over here.

776
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,844
I can't believe Sol's hanging out with
a guy. He's really handsome, isn't he?

777
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,512
I'll put a balloon right here.

778
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,515
-What?
-Stick together like this.

779
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,058
And pop it with your bodies.

780
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,102
You succeed if you pop it in five seconds.

781
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,937
All right, let's begin.

782
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,690
Ready, go.

783
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:36,319
You did it! Congratulations!

784
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,988
Take your prize.

785
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,823
-There's a prize?
-Take your pick.

786
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,199
Did Sol tell you anything?

787
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,619
No, she didn't.
She said they're not dating.

788
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,329
It doesn't seem like that.

789
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,749
I can totally tell from the guy's face.

790
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,460
Why else would he have come here?
There's nothing to see.

791
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,754
He just came to take a look around.

792
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,049
Sol's so lucky.

793
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,886
You know how they say
you'll get really lucky with men

794
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,888
after you have no one for a while.

795
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,891
It's an undeniable truth, you know.

796
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,976
She said they're not dating.

797
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,899
-Why are you giving me this?
-You like that character.

798
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,443
I don't like it anymore.

799
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,112
Is there something going on?

800
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,991
We were supposed to hang out together.
Why did you bring a guy along?

801
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:23,909
Oh…

802
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,369
I…

803
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,164
Well…

804
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:33,919
Sorry. I didn't think
it would make you uncomfortable.

805
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,630
If I knew, I would've brought a guy too.

806
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,840
Did you enjoy playing the couple's game?

807
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,428
I need to smoke.

808
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,555
-Hey.
-What's with you?

809
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,568
Lime?

810
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,862
I think you'll like it.

811
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,199
-Me?
-You said so at the club.

812
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,536
You remember that?

813
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,218
You must be exhausted.

814
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,511
Good work.

815
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,889
But the after-party begins now,
so let's go have fun!

816
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,353
You're all going to get wasted today!

817
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,108
-Guys, take this.
-Thanks!

818
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,069
-Move!
-Move over!

819
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,674
Gosh, my head.

820
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,191
I should go buy medicine.

821
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:30,410
I've liked her since I was in high school,
but she rejected me.

822
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,496
And she suddenly contacted me yesterday.

823
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,040
I'm really sorry.

824
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,959
So I was just a replacement?

825
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,295
Whatever. I don't care now.

826
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,422
But…

827
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,008
She suddenly contacted me yesterday.
I'm really sorry.

828
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,556
So embarrassing…

829
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,074
Who is this?

830
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,208
Hello?

831
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,375
What are you doing?

832
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,253
Park Jae-eon?

833
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:23,922
Wait.

834
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:25,840
Did you delete my number?

835
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,926
Well…

836
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,062
Why did you call?

837
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,606
What's wrong with your voice?

838
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,900
Are you sick?

839
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,611
I'm not feeling well.

840
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,865
I'm near your house right now.

841
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,495
So?

842
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,751
Why would you come here?

843
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,379
My friend lives nearby.

844
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,298
Okay. Have fun.

845
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,508
Na-bi.

846
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,345
Yes?

847
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,889
Do you want to meet right now?

848
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,519
Right now?

849
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,005
So cold.

850
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,428
Why don't they have any medicine?

851
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,401
There must've been an accident.

852
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,403
-There's even a police car.
-Is someone hurt?

853
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,280
-What's going on?
-Why is there a police car?

854
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,365
Was there an accident?

855
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,408
Is it a student?

856
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,912
-A student lives there.
-Excuse me.

857
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,246
EMERGENCY RESPONSE

858
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,915
-The third floor?
-Isn't that her?

859
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,502
Hey! Can you hear me?

860
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,504
I think something happened to her! Hurry!

861
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,422
Calm down and stay back.

862
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,174
We should open it.

863
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,927
-Hurry.
-Wait!

864
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,803
Wait, sir. Wait!

865
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,806
What are you doing? Who called you?

866
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,148
I'm sorry.

867
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,067
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. We'll get going.

868
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,540
You know you totally overreacted, right?

869
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,084
I was just worried.

870
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,712
You said you were sick.
Plus, you live alone.

871
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:19,138
All right.
Well, you know that I'm alive now.

872
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,848
Bye.

873
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,684
Are you really okay?

874
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,520
I'm fine.

875
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,482
You have a fever.
Let's go to the hospital.

876
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,608
It's fine.

877
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,445
I'll be fine if I get some sleep.

878
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,825
Bye.

879
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,848
Hey.

880
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,310
Let's go. Come on.

881
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,978
Everyone left.

882
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,318
I'm really leaving.

883
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,571
Get a grip.

884
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,948
Don't you know how late it is?

885
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,748
What are you doing?

886
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,668
Come on, let's--

887
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,171
Shut up.

888
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,593
You kind of…

889
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,178
look…

890
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,930
handsome up close.

891
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,515
Was I too cold?

892
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,518
No.

893
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,645
I did the right thing.

894
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,940
I should just get some sleep.

895
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,823
Who is it?

896
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,121
Can I come in?

897
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,082
Oh, sure.

898
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,799
There weren't any pharmacies open,
so I went to a convenience store.

899
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,304
Take some medicine after you eat.

900
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,724
Okay. Thanks.

901
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,727
Get some sleep, then. Bye.

902
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,646
You really came back because of this?

903
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,273
Hey, Jae-eon.

904
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,318
I don't like this.

905
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,279
Take it back.

906
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,245
I'm hungry.

907
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,167
You didn't even eat until this hour?

908
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,754
I didn't have an appetite
since I smelled food all day.

909
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,007
But I'm hungry now.

910
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:52,769
Then you can eat this here.

911
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,695
This is really tasty.

912
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,993
-I haven't had homemade food in a while.
-My aunt made all this.

913
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,828
The aunt who named you?

914
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,790
Yes.

915
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,420
You must be sleepy.

916
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,507
Yes. Probably because of the medicine.

917
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,425
I'm so sleepy now.

918
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,845
-Go lie down.
-It's fine.

919
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,181
I'll sleep after you leave.

920
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,476
I ate your food,

921
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,396
so let me help you.

922
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:39,649
What?

923
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:42,318
Hey! What are you doing?

924
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,613
Hey, let me down.

925
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,157
Wait!

926
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,937
"There was a boy in the small store.

927
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,107
He waited for the girl every day."

928
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,277
What are you doing?

929
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,028
Go home now.

930
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,282
I'll go home when you fall asleep.
Don't worry.

931
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,702
It's worse to see you gone
when I wake up later.

932
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,539
Should I stay, then?

933
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,168
I didn't mean that…

934
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,506
Right. I don't want you to leave.

935
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,511
You're really weird.

936
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,472
The way you talk, and the things you do…

937
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,474
You even called 911.

938
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,731
You mean you want to think of me
as a jerk,

939
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,025
but I actually seem okay, right?

940
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,819
You're so annoying.

941
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,033
To tell you the truth,

942
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,369
I was shocked when I saw you with Eun-han.

943
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,373
-Why?
-I don't know.

944
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,294
Maybe I got jealous.

945
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,171
You deleted my number,

946
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,715
but you seemed happy with him.

947
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,512
Then you would've felt good

948
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,307
when you saw me get rejected.

949
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,690
Save my number again.

950
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:48,235
I'm not such a bad guy, am I?

951
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:54,241
I don't know if it's because of
the fever or because of him,

952
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,743
but I feel so dizzy.

953
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:01,248
Why are you doing this to me?
Because my name means "butterfly"?

954
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,835
I've been attracted to you
from the beginning.

955
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:09,340
Oh, I see.

956
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,136
You're so funny, you know that?

957
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,138
What's so funny?

958
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,474
Why do you ask
if you won't even believe me?

959
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,810
You're not really trustworthy, you know.

960
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:24,063
Then will you see me in a different light
if I try to earn your trust?

961
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,162
Maybe he really…

962
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,679
Your fever's down.

963
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,893
You really nursed me
the old-fashioned way?

964
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,270
Classic methods are the best.

965
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,648
You're right.

966
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:55,529
I should get ready for school.

967
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,803
Why don't you leave your hair down?

968
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:23,015
-It's uncomfortable.
-Still.

969
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,392
Just for me.

970
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,169
Then…

971
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,383
I want to see your hair tied up.

972
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,138
It's pretty.

973
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:21,165
His touch and his scent.
I already got used to them.

974
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:24,001
I want to keep seeing you. What about you?

975
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:26,336
Jae-eon is too smooth with everything.

976
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,297
-Be my girlfriend.
-You're overreacting.

977
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,340
-Do you like me?
-Na-bi?

978
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:34,678
-The channel name reminded me of you.
-So you've thought about me?

979
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:36,263
I got you!

980
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:37,890
I have a gift for you.

981
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,809
We're much more compatible than I thought,

982
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,770
and I enjoy spending nights with him.

983
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,106
Is there someone else you're seeing?

984
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,192
Aren't you going overboard?
We're not even going out.

985
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,568
We should end it.

986
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,195
I don't want to let go.

987
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,154
Not yet.

988
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,449
I'm still attracted to him,
even at this moment.

989
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,367
Like crazy.

990
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,622
