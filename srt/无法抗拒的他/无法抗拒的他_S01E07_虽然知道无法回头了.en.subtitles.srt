1
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,596
When is
your silent treatment going to end?

2
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,560
Never mind.

3
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,228
Keep going, then.

4
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,897
Did we break up?

5
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,275
What? No!

6
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,902
Do you want to break up?

7
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,528
You didn't contact me since then.

8
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,655
-You didn't, either.
-I did.

9
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,076
What are you on about?
You didn't talk to me sincerely.

10
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,204
Hey, we're here.

11
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,874
-Gosh, my shoulders.
-Fine.

12
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,711
Why were you together?

13
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,297
Oh, we just ran into each other.

14
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,299
Only Ji-wan's left, then.

15
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,843
Ji-wan's always late!

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,721
She's arriving soon. Sorry.

17
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,266
-Why is she apologizing?
-Yun Sol!

18
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,145
She…

19
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,525
I guess she can only see Yun Sol.

20
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,151
Can't you see us?

21
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,904
I'm so sorry, guys.

22
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,615
I came out early, but I missed the bus.

23
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,617
She always makes this excuse.

24
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,412
But what about Jae-eon?

25
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,499
-He's not coming.
-What? Why? Oh, no…

26
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,918
Why not? Do you have a crush on him too?

27
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,295
It's not that…

28
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,672
I don't!

29
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,049
It seems weirder if you react like that.

30
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,760
Forget it. Let's go.
Everyone else already left.

31
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,721
-Let's go.
-Na-bi will come, though.

32
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,355
Who's driving?

33
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,482
I'll do it.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,402
Hurry up, then.

35
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,529
What?

36
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,615
Why do I feel lonely?

37
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,118
Wait for me!

38
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,782
They look delicious.

39
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,869
Can we have two of those, please?

40
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,370
-Two?
-Yes.

41
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,581
What about these?

42
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,666
-Let's eat them later.
-Okay.

43
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,376
Thank you.

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,712
-Here. Thank you.
-This looks great.

45
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,672
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,761
-Bye.
-Thank you.

47
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,935
Isn't it heavy?

48
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,020
-It's fine.
-I'll carry one.

49
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,438
It's fine.

50
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,611
Aren't you tired?

51
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,156
I'm okay.

52
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,537
Let's go.

53
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,082
Right…

54
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,714
EPISODE 7: I KNOW THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.
NEVERTHELESS,

55
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,814
Excuse me. Where's the Mansari Temple?

56
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,190
-The temple?
-Yes.

57
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,151
-Go that way.
-Keep going that way.

58
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,236
Oh, all right.

59
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,054
Are you sleeping here with your friends?

60
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,181
No, I'm going to sleep at my aunt's.

61
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,769
Really? Then I'll take you home.
I need to tell you something.

62
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,145
Tell me what?

63
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,521
I'll tell you later.

64
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,580
Do-hyeok, where should I put this?

65
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,291
Over there. No, I'll put that away.

66
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,914
Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.

67
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,001
Hello. I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

68
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,426
The weather is so nice today!

69
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,762
What? You said you weren't coming.

70
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,013
Na-bi!

71
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,143
Hello. I'm Na-bi's friend, Oh Bit-na.

72
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,770
-It's nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

73
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,231
I'm enjoying your videos too.

74
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,233
I see. Thank you.

75
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,609
It's really cool.

76
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,653
-Hello.
-Hello.

77
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,613
-Welcome, everyone.
-I'm Se-yeong.

78
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,074
You said you weren't close.

79
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,159
When did you get here?

80
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,953
It's not like that.
My aunt lives nearby, that's all.

81
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,831
So there was a reason
why she was out of touch.

82
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,041
-It's nothing like that.
-Come on.

83
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,544
Excuse me, Do-hyeok.

84
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,880
-Where should I sleep?
-Where do we put our stuff?

85
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,089
My shoulders hurt.

86
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,426
She's going around so casually
as if it's her own home.

87
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,178
-Jeez.
-Let's go.

88
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,807
-Hey, I want the big room!
-That's mine!

89
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,894
-It takes forever to take off my shoes.
-Let's get some rest here.

90
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,230
Where are the keys?

91
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,149
Did you bring them?

92
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,526
Jeez.

93
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,614
Are you okay?

94
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,493
-What do you mean?
-Sorry I lied to you.

95
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:17,455
I thought you'd say you wouldn't come
if I told you he was coming.

96
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,999
It's fine.

97
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,922
But…

98
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,009
What happened with you and Jae-eon?

99
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,845
You two seemed to be getting along well.

100
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,266
-Well--
-He did something wrong

101
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,101
like last time at the station, right?

102
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,521
I can totally imagine it.

103
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,855
No.

104
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,777
I'm the one who made a mistake.

105
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,241
He's probably pretty upset.

106
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:54,951
Oh.

107
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,037
I'll help you.

108
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,630
I got two rooms prepared.

109
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,340
First, this one.

110
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,053
And this way.

111
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,347
-It's so nice.
-Should we sleep here?

112
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,974
Give me my bag.

113
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,226
What about the guys' room?

114
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,564
This place is so pretty.

115
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,857
-Hey, let's sleep here!
-Is this the guys' room?

116
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,695
Come this way.

117
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,072
Can you wait just a minute?

118
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,742
-Ji-wan.
-Yes?

119
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,584
If you tell me an hour before
starting the barbecue,

120
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,419
-I'll get everything prepared.
-Okay.

121
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,546
-What are you doing later?
-What?

122
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,465
We're all Na-bi's friends.
Come hang out with us.

123
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,092
We're going to the amusement park.

124
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,303
I have to prepare the food.

125
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,347
Come on. We can all prepare it
together when we come back.

126
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,558
You can take some photos
and hang out with us.

127
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,435
Oh, right. You have a YouTube channel.

128
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,270
I bet you'll be a good photographer.

129
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,775
-Then hang on.
-Okay.

130
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,652
Is he going to talk to Na-bi?

131
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,616
What are you doing here?
I can take care of this.

132
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,201
I have nothing to do, anyway.
Did you talk to everyone?

133
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,661
Yes.

134
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,331
They asked me to come
to the amusement park too.

135
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,500
If you don't want to,
I'll tell them for you.

136
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128
No. I want to hang out with you.

137
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,839
All right, then.

138
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,966
Okay.

139
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,263
Wasn't that kind of rude?
You put him in a tight spot.

140
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,474
I was only asking him to hang out.

141
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,310
Let's ask him to eat barbecue with us too!

142
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,148
I already feel exhausted.

143
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,442
What are you on about?
It's just the beginning!

144
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,985
You can't get exhausted!

145
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,073
-But why isn't Na-bi coming?
-I know.

146
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,408
Let's just go first.
We don't have seats anyway.

147
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,785
You can go by yourself.

148
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,286
Se-hun!

149
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,747
-Should we go?
-Let's go.

150
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,209
Jae-eon. Bring Na-bi later then.

151
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,423
-Be careful.
-Okay. Go first.

152
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,925
Se-hun, hurry up.

153
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,259
Let's go.

154
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,470
Wait for me.

155
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,278
Get in. Everyone left first.

156
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,134
Why are you sitting at the back?

157
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,681
Hang on. Do-hyeok's coming soon.

158
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,676
Unbelievable.

159
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,015
THE ALARM WILL RING IN 5 MINUTES

160
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,143
How many alarms did you set?

161
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,524
Gyeong-jun. Get up.
Your alarms are ringing.

162
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,277
Why do you set your alarms on the weekend?

163
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,367
It's so strange.

164
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,413
Whenever he takes his glasses off…

165
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,473
I…

166
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,685
Why do you set so many alarms?
I always wake up because of them.

167
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,773
I'm worried I'll keep sleeping
without hearing them.

168
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,609
I'll wake you up,
so just set two alarms, okay?

169
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,654
Really? Okay, then.

170
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,077
Yes?

171
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,037
You're still looking for a place, right?

172
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,039
There's one out. Come and check it.

173
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,165
I see…

174
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,127
There's a place?
All right, I'll head over.

175
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,966
Who was that? What place?

176
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,761
It was the real estate agent.
There's a decent place.

177
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,477
I was going to stay only until
I found a place, anyway.

178
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,648
-Should I come with you?
-Aren't you busy?

179
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,985
I'd appreciate it, but it's the weekend.

180
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,362
It's fine.
I like looking around for a house.

181
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,907
Then dinner's on me tonight.
What do you want?

182
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,785
Well… Tteokbokki?

183
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
Again?

184
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,790
I thought you liked tteokbokki.

185
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,086
What?

186
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,214
Wear your glasses.

187
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,217
I have to wash my face.

188
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,910
I heard you met Seol-a at school.

189
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,913
Yes.

190
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,956
She said you were attractive.

191
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,792
She wanted to talk to you more,
but you left.

192
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,672
I thought she was pretty too.

193
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,573
The door lock was too old.

194
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,118
And did you see the mold? It's terrible.

195
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,871
Stop that. The house was pretty decent.

196
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,456
What do you mean?

197
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,000
Just say it
if there's something not to your liking.

198
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,336
-Stop it.
-Is it really urgent?

199
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,713
I worked so hard to find a place for you.

200
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,299
Your husband's complaining so much.

201
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,884
My husband?

202
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,096
-He's not my husband.
-He's not?

203
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,223
He was so picky,
I thought you were a couple.

204
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,308
What will you do, then?

205
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,435
I'm sure you know,
but this is a rare chance.

206
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,690
Think about it properly.
There are lots of problems.

207
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,608
It seemed fine.

208
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,986
You don't like it either, right?

209
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,237
What?

210
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,364
Sorry, but we'll think about it some more.

211
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,574
My goodness. All right, then.

212
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,410
You might lose your chance, though.

213
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,494
Goodness.

214
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,708
Hey. It was totally fine.

215
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,043
You saw the mold. There was too much.

216
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,712
Let's go. Come on.

217
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,838
Let's go.

218
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,719
-Can you get me a doll?
-That one?

219
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,221
Yes, that one! The huge one over there.

220
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,099
SHOOTING RANGE
BASEBALL THROW, BALLOON DARTS

221
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,852
I'm leaving.

222
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,854
-This is easy.
-You guys try it too!

223
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,731
-Watch me.
-I'll show you my skills.

224
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,441
-Let's make a bet.
-Okay, then.

225
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,775
What are you doing here?

226
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,319
This is so fun!

227
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,779
Gosh.

228
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,198
Na-bi, you try it too.
I'll take a photo of you.

229
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,576
I'm not sure I can do it.

230
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,704
Let me show you something cool.

231
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,497
Look at your posture. It's so bad.

232
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,628
Hang on.

233
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,007
That's a strike.

234
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,018
-Isn't this fun? Did you win that?
-Yes!

235
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,233
Are you going to do this?

236
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,247
-You got it!
-I got it.

237
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,792
You got it! He got it!

238
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,709
He hit it!

239
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,963
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

240
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,592
He won that.

241
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,636
That's my favorite character…

242
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,889
Na-bi, that's my favorite character…

243
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,767
Of course. It's okay.

244
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,105
Thank you so much! Oh, my gosh! Sol, look!

245
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,169
Stop!

246
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,381
Hey, stop there. Hey!

247
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,883
-Go!
-Hey!

248
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,012
Why did you have to come with me?

249
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,350
Security is the most important,
but it didn't look that safe.

250
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,310
The neighborhood too.

251
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,812
It seemed pretty dangerous.

252
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,647
It'll cost more money for that.

253
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,109
What if someone takes that house?

254
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,528
Should I just say I'll take it?

255
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,281
I'm just going to take it.

256
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,783
Hey.

257
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,201
You didn't like it, either.

258
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,579
Of course, it's not as good as your house.

259
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,998
Then you can keep staying at my house.

260
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,671
Enjoy.

261
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,090
Oh. Thank you.

262
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,137
Wait, my phone.

263
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,891
It's my first time actually riding this.

264
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,642
Me too.

265
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,437
It'll be so nice since the sun's setting.

266
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,607
Na-bi. Isn't this a great photo?

267
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,860
Yes. That's a great shot.

268
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,655
I'll print this photo,
and the ones from the beach last time.

269
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,911
It's all right.

270
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,623
Let's take a nice selfie up there.

271
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,459
-Okay?
-It's going to be so pretty.

272
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,425
Four people can ride one, so ride with us.

273
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,136
Can you take photos for us?

274
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,387
-Come on.
-Join us.

275
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,973
-Okay?
-It's going to be so fun.

276
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,490
Next four, please.

277
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,784
We'll take the next one with our friends.

278
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,452
Then you two, come up.

279
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,643
I don't want to ride this.

280
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,478
-What?
-I'll wait here.

281
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,646
Why?

282
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,232
I'm afraid of heights.

283
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,818
Oh, really?

284
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,697
Then let's wait here together.
I'm afraid of heights too.

285
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,908
-All right.
-You're such cowards.

286
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,704
Will you be okay?
You're afraid of heights too.

287
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,415
I'm fine. We came all the way here,
so I should ride it.

288
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,625
Plus, it's not a scary ride.

289
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,921
Really? Okay, I'll ride it with you.

290
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,091
Really? Nice. Let's go.

291
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,260
Hey, there's Jin-su.

292
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,469
Hi, Jin-su!

293
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,354
We can see the ocean!

294
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,817
-Can you take a photo of me?
-Me too!

295
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,528
-Count to three.
-One, two, three.

296
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,905
One, two, three.

297
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,907
Don't lean back!

298
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,994
-I want one just by myself.
-Move!

299
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,412
One, two, three.

300
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,080
Move out of the way.

301
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,957
Can you take one of me?

302
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,876
One, two, three.

303
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,798
-Hey, let's take one together.
-It's dangerous. Just stay still.

304
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,428
Why do you have to talk like that?

305
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,131
It's so pretty.

306
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,351
Right. So pretty.

307
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,455
You should see the view.

308
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,167
Right. I am.

309
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,921
Are you scared?

310
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,634
It's slower than I thought.
It's kind of scary.

311
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,344
Jeez.

312
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,140
Oh, my gosh!

313
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:57,018
Look at the view! I bet
we can see the guesthouse from here.

314
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,478
Really? Where?

315
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,440
Over there. This is amazing.

316
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,444
Hey, stop that.

317
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,030
Right. Sorry. Let's sit.

318
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,659
But you know,

319
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,996
the thrill of riding Ferris wheels
is in the shaking.

320
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,748
Sorry.

321
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,753
But Sol. You're jealous of us, aren't you?

322
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,089
-Stop it.
-I'm really sorry.

323
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,183
We can get off soon, so hang in there.

324
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:40,437
What? Right. But I'm okay now.

325
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:42,814
Really?

326
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,816
Yes. I'm fine.

327
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,224
I heard other Ferris wheels have music.

328
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,935
I guess there's no music here.

329
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,942
Why are you looking at me?

330
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,403
-Look outside.
-How have you been?

331
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,113
Fine.

332
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,574
So-so.

333
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,284
I haven't been well.

334
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,335
-Sorry, I--
-Why didn't you contact me?

335
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,711
What?

336
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,508
-I…
-It was my birthday.

337
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,512
You have lots of people to wish you
a happy birthday.

338
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,185
I can't waver again.

339
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,020
Anyway, I wanted to say…

340
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,441
that I'm sorry for being harsh to Seol-a.

341
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,131
I wanted

342
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,301
to hear you say happy birthday to me.

343
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,531
His familiar smells

344
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,784
are haunting me.

345
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,219
You could have just told me instead.

346
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,767
You're making me feel upset.

347
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,228
Do you hate me that much?

348
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,254
He should be back by now.

349
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,882
Why is he taking so long
to just buy some beer?

350
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,551
What took you so long?

351
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,012
Did you go all the way
to a beer brewery or what?

352
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,891
-Who are you?
-And who are you?

353
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,185
Well, I'm…

354
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,481
Mom!

355
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,566
Mom?

356
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,363
Hey.

357
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,865
Do-yeon. Why are you here?

358
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,034
To start the fire.

359
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,079
Good job. But is that it?

360
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,789
No. I was bored.

361
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,290
I want to join you.

362
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,419
Do-yeon, don't bother the guests.

363
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,630
Hey, why are you so mean to her?
Did you fix the bike?

364
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,756
-Yes.
-Is there meat?

365
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,092
-The Ferris wheel…
-There's meat, but…

366
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,593
-Who's the prettiest?
-The meat…

367
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,263
Na-bi, who's that guy?

368
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,473
Do I look like someone
who grew up cooking?

369
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,600
-You're good at cooking meat.
-Yes, I am.

370
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,894
He's my junior.

371
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,730
He's not a theater major?

372
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,691
I should transfer to your university.

373
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,987
Hello.

374
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,947
Hi. I'm Yang Do-yeon.

375
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,162
Hi, I'm Park Jae-eon.

376
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,625
-Hello.
-Hello.

377
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,960
Hello.

378
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,296
Na-bi, can you help me?

379
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,048
All right.

380
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,010
Did you have dinner?

381
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,262
I already unbuckled my belt.

382
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,597
You have to cook the meat.

383
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,183
I'm going to unbuckle my belt.

384
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,642
No, I haven't eaten yet.

385
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,519
Then we can eat together.

386
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,612
-Alcohol? Yes, I like drinking.
-Have a shot.

387
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,281
-Do you like drinking?
-Yes. What kind do you like?

388
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,117
I like soju.

389
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,369
Oh, would you like some?

390
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,746
Shall we?

391
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,461
-Let me pour you a shot.
-Thank you.

392
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,463
Just a little.

393
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,844
Cheers.

394
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,397
How are you so good at taking photos?

395
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,524
Seriously.

396
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,860
Do-hyeok,
can I see the photos you took earlier?

397
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,280
You're such a good photographer.
But I look awful in this one.

398
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,074
Oh, Jin-su!

399
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,159
This one's nice, right?

400
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,661
-Gosh.
-Awesome.

401
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,913
I'll send the photos to your emails later.

402
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,791
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

403
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,376
Can we look?

404
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,919
Sure. Go ahead.

405
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,963
Look at this.

406
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,131
-Hey.
-This photo's nice.

407
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,926
I just got two of these.

408
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,928
-This doesn't look like you at all.
-Here.

409
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,682
You'll feel really refreshed
the next morning after you eat this.

410
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,141
I see.

411
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,606
-What do you think?
-You look pretty.

412
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,109
-He's an amazing photographer.
-Right.

413
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,112
-Is that a compliment?
-You look really nice.

414
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,198
Do-hyeok took this photo
at the Ferris wheel.

415
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,450
Don't forget that I gave this to you.

416
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,787
Let's clink glasses.

417
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,000
-You're drinking without eating anything?
-Come on.

418
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,252
-Cheers. Come on.
-Jeez.

419
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,634
Unbelievable.

420
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,723
This is so nice.

421
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,643
Sol. Meat!

422
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,853
It's almost done.

423
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,814
You're not even helping them.

424
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,357
I'm so hungry.

425
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,859
Sol. Need any help?

426
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,987
-No, it's fine.
-Is everything okay?

427
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,322
You need any help?

428
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,240
Just stay back. You're bothering us.

429
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,826
"Just stay back. You're bothering us."

430
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,705
Hey, just sit quietly
and don't bother Sol.

431
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,123
What about the meat?

432
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,585
Sit down comfortably.

433
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,337
You're so kind.

434
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,880
-What…
-Chopsticks.

435
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,053
Anyone want to drink with Ji-wan?

436
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,472
Nobody?

437
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,266
I'm so lonely.

438
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,529
There's no alcohol…

439
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,662
What about me?

440
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,330
His photos are amazing.

441
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,634
-Here.
-You can keep looking.

442
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,678
-All right.
-It's so…

443
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,894
Do you like the moon?

444
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,271
Yes.

445
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,858
Do you like the crescent moon
or the full moon?

446
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:06,818
-I just…
-Sol!

447
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,152
Put it there.

448
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,904
…like it if it's pretty.

449
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,670
He really has nothing to do with me now,
but why…

450
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,088
Are you jealous?

451
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,090
Show them to me next time.

452
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,425
I will. Come and visit.

453
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,260
What are you on about?

454
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,556
Jae-eon has a new target now.

455
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,058
I don't care.

456
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,774
What is it this time?

457
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,235
Why do you keep avoiding him?

458
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,282
-When did I avoid him?
-Don't lie.

459
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,952
I should know what's going on
to keep things in order.

460
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,873
Okay? Everyone's here to have a fun time.

461
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,458
You two keep ruining the vibe.

462
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,754
I'll be careful.

463
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,798
So tell me. Did something happen
with him at the Ferris wheel?

464
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,843
No. We were just looking at the view.

465
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,094
You're such a bad liar.

466
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,014
Nothing happened, okay?
Stop jumping to conclusions.

467
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,143
Is it because of Do-hyeok?

468
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,229
He's charming.

469
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,607
I wouldn't mind if you went after him.

470
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,656
Jae-eon has a girlfriend.

471
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,575
-What?
-Be quiet.

472
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,160
Really?

473
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,370
Who?

474
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,583
I don't know. But he does,
so stop talking about us like that.

475
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,753
What? That's impossible.

476
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,963
Are you sure about that?

477
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,216
He could he… There's no way.

478
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,717
That's enough. Just take this.

479
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,472
A girlfriend? For real?

480
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,476
Come over here.

481
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,644
Excuse me.

482
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,396
Hey, Na-bi.

483
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,233
There's some left.
We can put this back in the kitchen.

484
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,945
They look like newlyweds.

485
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,240
I hope you have a happy marriage!

486
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,911
Hey, Yu Se-hun. You're so ridiculous.

487
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,746
-What?
-Are you that clueless?

488
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,456
What about me?

489
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,916
Are you drunk?

490
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,379
Do-hyeok. How did you come to know Na-bi?

491
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,884
We were childhood neighborhood friends.

492
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,888
I love stories like that!

493
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,892
Childhood friends, first love,
stuff like that.

494
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,561
It's like a romance drama!

495
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,229
-Just like a drama.
-It's not like that.

496
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,147
I know.

497
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,071
It's true that Na-bi is my first love.

498
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,532
What?

499
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,909
-You should get married!
-I'm jealous.

500
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:06,205
-You should get married!
-You should get married!

501
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,208
-You should get married!
-You should get married!

502
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,585
What? Are you drunk?

503
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,003
It's true, though.

504
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,005
Will you accept my proposal?

505
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,674
-My dear.
-You only know him, right?

506
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,384
I'll do it.

507
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,075
Your girlfriend?

508
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,286
Yes.

509
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,122
We haven't dated for long.

510
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,167
About two, three… Three months.

511
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,545
It's only been three months,
and you're living together?

512
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,341
I begged her to move in.

513
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,969
I really like her a lot.

514
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,368
Thanks for this.

515
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,621
All right. Enjoy the food. I'm leaving.

516
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,331
I'm moving out soon.

517
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,041
Already?

518
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,753
Well…

519
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,382
I know it's not easy to live
with someone else.

520
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,550
Especially him.

521
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,554
He's so nosy, but he doesn't know
how to take care of himself.

522
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,515
-He even snores.
-Mom.

523
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,477
No, Gyeong-jun is really good to me.

524
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,481
I felt that he received a lot of love
since he is bright and kind.

525
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,816
I guess I was right.

526
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,736
My goodness. You're so sweet.

527
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,959
-Bit-na's favorite random game!
-Bit-na's favorite random game!

528
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,377
-What game?
-What game?

529
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,754
-Game, start.
-Game, start.

530
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,715
The Whisper Game. I'll start.

531
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,050
-What is it?
-I don't know.

532
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,766
-Seo Ji-wan.
-Really?

533
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,852
-Me?
-You're not fooling us.

534
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,395
No, it's really unexpected.

535
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,105
What is it?

536
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,315
What? What is it?

537
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,942
This is really shocking.

538
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,110
I'm so curious.

539
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,445
This is tough.

540
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,451
The question was, "Who's the ugliest one?"

541
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,119
Come here, you jerk.

542
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,289
Hey! You want to die?

543
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,334
They'll fall in love
after squabbling like that.

544
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,045
-What was the question?
-It's obvious.

545
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,089
-You're not uncomfortable?
-It's fine.

546
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,759
-I'm not ugly!
-I'm sorry!

547
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,887
I'll just reveal the question.
"Who's the ugliest one here?"

548
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,098
-I knew it!
-I knew it!

549
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,102
-That's so childish.
-This game's supposed to be childish.

550
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,937
I'm going to beat you up!

551
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,026
All right. It's my turn.

552
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,402
She's so drunk.

553
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,994
The noodle shop grandson.

554
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:36,624
Really? I can't believe it!

555
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,251
What? What was the question?

556
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,796
Honey. It's so obvious.

557
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,007
Guys, it's so obvious.
There's no point in drinking.

558
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,095
That's what I mean. It's too obvious.

559
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,098
Gyu-hyun,
why would you want to know the question?

560
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,518
Right. It's nothing. Why would you drink?

561
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,353
I'm just curious.

562
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:01,732
All right, the question
I asked Bit-na was,

563
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,530
"Who's your ideal type
among the people here?"

564
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,078
Okay. Anything you want to know, Do-hyeok?

565
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,799
Who makes you smile the most
among the people here?

566
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,428
You.

567
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,224
I knew it!

568
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,728
What is it? What's the question?

569
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,690
-What is it?
-I knew it!

570
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,692
Let me hear the question!

571
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,944
What is it?

572
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,070
Let's let this slide.

573
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,239
-No!
-Okay, let's let it slide.

574
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,615
You can ask instead of me.

575
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,785
Me? Okay, I'll do it.

576
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,705
My question is,

577
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,708
"Who is the prettiest here?"

578
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,877
Se-yeong, of course.

579
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,128
Then it's my turn again.

580
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,630
-Who's the loveliest one?
-I'm leaving for a minute.

581
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,341
-Bring the others to the beach later.
-You, Se-yeong.

582
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,051
-Jeez.
-Excuse me.

583
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,179
-Stop it.
-Where are you going?

584
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,431
What about you, Do-yeon?

585
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,308
Well…

586
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,294
Yu Na-bi.

587
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,564
What is it?

588
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:06,941
What?

589
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,902
-What's that reaction?
-Right.

590
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,321
Is she drinking out of jealousy?

591
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,240
I should drink for this one.

592
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,824
-Me too!
-Me too.

593
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,117
Me too.

594
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,623
What's the question?

595
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,253
Me!

596
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,800
-Oh, my gosh!
-Let's stop. This is boring.

597
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:37,763
Hey, guys. Let's stop playing games
and just chat.

598
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,474
Why? This is fun. Let's continue.

599
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,393
Come on!

600
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:46,230
Sol. Why does Ji-wan always act
like she's tough? She always gets drunk.

601
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,274
She gets drunk faster
when drinking outside.

602
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,650
Give me that.

603
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,443
Stop drinking.

604
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:55,114
You're such close friends.
You know everything about each other.

605
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,909
Well, we've been close friends
since middle school.

606
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,830
Was Ji-wan popular in middle school?

607
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,916
She says boys were lining up to date her.

608
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,043
Yes. She was popular.

609
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,754
She's pretty.

610
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,341
Hey! You must be drunk.

611
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,512
She's just a bit charming,

612
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,806
to be generous.

613
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:24,685
It's true. Guys always hit on her
even when she had a boyfriend.

614
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,188
I told you, Bit-na! I wasn't lying!

615
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,984
I was really pretty, I'm telling you!

616
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,486
I was one
of the prettiest girls in school!

617
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,654
Hey.

618
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,198
She's the prettiest.

619
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,700
What's with you? Stop it.

620
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,493
-What?
-Jeez.

621
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,996
You guys are all looking down on me.

622
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,582
Sol. Have you ever dated anyone?

623
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:50,753
Yu Se-hun, stop it.

624
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:54,173
Sol doesn't like you!

625
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,216
Shut up. Why are you so clueless?

626
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,926
-I should take her to bed.
-Me?

627
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,262
Gosh, she's so noisy.

628
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,389
I want to hang out with you!

629
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,642
She's so noisy!

630
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,811
I want to keep playing games.

631
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,106
Guys! I want to go shoot fireworks too!

632
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,567
Why did you drink so much?

633
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,612
Do you want a hangover like last time?

634
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,615
That was my mistake.

635
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,326
Just get some sleep, okay?

636
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,789
-Sol! My friend Sol!
-Hey.

637
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,957
-Let go of me.
-My old friend.

638
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,417
Let me go.

639
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,516
What's with you?
Stop drinking from now on.

640
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,142
Sol.

641
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,565
Can you hold my hand again?

642
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,669
I like you the most.

643
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,172
I like you more than my mom and dad.

644
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,716
You're my favorite person in the world.

645
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,553
What about you?

646
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,305
Who's your favorite person?

647
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,268
Stop the nonsense. Go to sleep.

648
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,020
Do you have feelings for that guy?
Ju-hyeok?

649
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,650
Or Yu Se-hun? I don't want you to.

650
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,944
Because…

651
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,614
I just don't like it.

652
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,744
Don't hang out with anyone else.

653
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,165
Just like me, okay?

654
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,836
Just me. Please.

655
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:01,133
Please, Sol. Only like me.

656
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,679
Seo Ji-wan.

657
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,895
Stop making me get my hopes up.

658
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,236
-So exciting! So fun!
-So exciting! So fun!

659
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,659
-Come on. Join us.
-No thanks.

660
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,078
What's gotten into you?
Is something going on?

661
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,540
He's right! You've changed!

662
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,209
It seems like he's become
a bit sentimental.

663
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,670
Are you going for a new image?

664
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,797
Why? What was he like before?

665
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,633
Jae-eon was incredible. As you can see.

666
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,093
You know, he's so handsome.

667
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,470
What's going on?

668
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:34,560
Or has he finally found his soulmate?

669
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,988
He's suddenly drinking!

670
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,073
-Who's the target?
-Who's the target?

671
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,950
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

672
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,661
Let's stop. Let's just go to the beach.

673
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:56,164
-You wanted to watch fireworks.
-Come on. Everyone was curious.

674
00:47:56,873 --> 00:48:01,003
Everyone was gossiping about whether
Jae-eon met his soulmate or something.

675
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,506
Jae-eon,
why don't you just tell us honestly?

676
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,883
Is there a girl who's captured your heart?

677
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,428
-Is there?
-Is there?

678
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:14,766
Yes.

679
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:20,731
Then would you like to kiss her?

680
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,483
-Would you?
-Would you?

681
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,821
Are you guys drunk?

682
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,537
Bit-na, stop it.

683
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,082
Let's just keep playing games.

684
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,085
Come on. This is all a game too.

685
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,046
All right, Jae-eon.

686
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,799
Is that girl here with us right now?

687
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:51,094
-Is she?
-Is she?

688
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,061
-Don't move.
-You'll get hurt.

689
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,064
Are you okay?

690
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,317
-She's hurt.
-What do we do?

691
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,110
-Don't touch it.
-Don't touch it!

692
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,321
-She's hurt.
-Hey, she's hurt.

693
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,115
The cut is deep. Let's get this treated.

694
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,117
She's hurt.

695
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,702
Are you…

696
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,579
What do we do about this?

697
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,375
-Be careful.
-You spilled that.

698
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,960
It must hurt.

699
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,588
Is it bad?

700
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,924
I'm fine.

701
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:35,806
The cut isn't too deep,
but we should still disinfect it.

702
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,645
Gyu-hyun, take the others
to the beach first.

703
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,188
We'll catch up later.

704
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:44,815
Why? We can wait.

705
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,442
Do-yeon's going to feel embarrassed.

706
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,777
Right. Go on without us.

707
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,114
Do-hyeok's already
setting up the fireworks at the beach.

708
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,658
That's why he left.

709
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,537
Don't tell Do-hyeok about this.

710
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,746
We'll head over soon.

711
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,708
All right, then. Be careful on the way.

712
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,543
Okay.

713
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:08,255
I totally ruined all the fun.

714
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,590
You didn't. It's fine.

715
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,677
Take antibiotics, just in case.

716
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:17,222
By the way,

717
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,226
what's your relationship to Jae-eon?

718
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,146
There's nothing between us.

719
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,440
It seemed like there was something.

720
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,609
I mean it.
My friends just like teasing us.

721
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,445
Really?

722
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,489
He seemed
to have feelings for you, though.

723
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,244
Why do you think that?

724
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,621
During the Whisper Game,

725
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,791
I asked Jae-eon

726
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:50,046
who he wanted to kiss tonight.

727
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,436
He's always like that.

728
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,938
He's never sincere.

729
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,899
You don't need to pay attention to that.

730
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,779
All done.

731
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,074
Let's go to the beach now.

732
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,494
Well…

733
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,205
I'm going to my aunt's house.

734
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:27,125
Why? You should come.
Do-hyeok's probably waiting for you.

735
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:31,129
I really want to, but I'm so tired.

736
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,840
Go on and have fun.

737
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,259
Okay. Then get some rest,
and see you tomorrow.

738
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,677
Okay.

739
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,347
Make sure to take antibiotics.

740
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,325
-Come on.
-Hurry.

741
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,787
Hey. Do this dance.

742
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,331
Starting from that end. Go.

743
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,958
Why are we doing this?

744
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,418
I hate this!

745
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,381
Why are we doing this?

746
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,591
Am I doing this right?

747
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,886
-Hey!
-Come on!

748
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,763
This is so stupid!

749
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,682
NA-BI

750
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,141
Can you take a photo of me?

751
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,936
-Sure.
-Hey, let's do this.

752
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,355
Let's write "love" with these.

753
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,481
Come on.

754
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,907
-Thank you.
-I'll write "love."

755
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,742
Can you take a photo of us too?

756
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,286
You draw the heart.

757
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,996
You have to get the heart.

758
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,582
With the word "love" too.

759
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,418
All right. One, two, three.

760
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,054
Why are you sitting here all alone?

761
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,933
I brought these to hang out with you.

762
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:15,108
What is it? Why have you been
looking so upset the whole day?

763
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,277
-Is it fun?
-What?

764
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,447
Is it fun to tease people
and make them feel uncomfortable?

765
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,990
What are you talking about?

766
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,909
Like just now.

767
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,411
You talk about others
just for your enjoyment.

768
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,289
You're making other people
feel uncomfortable.

769
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,416
So stop doing things like that.

770
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,084
It's not like that.

771
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,337
Everyone was whispering behind his back.

772
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,172
So I just asked for them.

773
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,966
Plus, it's obvious
that Na-bi and Jae-eon like each other.

774
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,509
It's sad to see them like that.

775
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,473
All right. Fine, I'll stop.

776
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,974
I promise.

777
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,769
Come on, try this.
I brought it so we could make up.

778
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:52,771
Hold it,

779
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,649
and if we light the end…

780
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,526
Isn't it pretty?

781
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,115
Look.

782
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,748
Stop trying to justify yourself.

783
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,750
You know it too.

784
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,257
Stop playing games with me.

785
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,553
What are you talking about?

786
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:29,015
I started this knowing that
you thought of me as a joke.

787
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,684
But I can't stand it anymore.

788
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,394
What do you mean?

789
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,357
Let's end this.

790
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,030
Hey!

791
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,914
Yang Do-hyeok!

792
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,917
Do it like this.

793
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,460
You're here.

794
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,671
What happened?

795
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,632
-I just got hurt a little.
-How?

796
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,967
Is it bad?

797
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,761
It's fine. Na-bi took good care of it.

798
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,390
Gosh, it must hurt.
You should have been careful.

799
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,267
Where's Na-bi?

800
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,770
She said she's too tired to come.

801
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,856
-She's not coming?
-Are you that upset?

802
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,027
She went to her aunt's?

803
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,237
Probably. Why?

804
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,115
It's nothing.

805
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,785
But where is Jae-eon?

806
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,086
This is the worst.

807
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,422
What is?

808
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,888
Didn't you go to the beach
with the others?

809
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,183
I came to see if you treated it.

810
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,980
Don't worry. I treated her properly.

811
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,608
Do-yeon just left. Didn't you see her?

812
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,363
Why are you smiling?

813
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,414
What are you doing?

814
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,792
I meant you.

815
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,960
You got hurt too.

816
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,588
It's none of your business.

817
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,840
It hurts, right?

818
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,596
Stop drinking. You had enough already.

819
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,771
Why would you care whether I drink or not?

820
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,858
It's fine. I'll do it.

821
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,070
-Let me do it.
-I said I'll do it.

822
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,243
You get angry at me so often

823
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,120
when you don't with others.

824
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,797
Why can't I ever refuse him?

825
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,722
I feel like I'm going
to crumble down again.

826
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,810
You saw me get hurt?

827
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:20,979
Of course I saw it.

828
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:26,151
But you would have gotten angry
if I did something about it.

829
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,946
You're ridiculous.

830
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,743
I can't say
I didn't have other intentions.

831
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,420
-Stop it.
-What?

832
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,049
What you're doing right now.

833
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,554
What am I doing?

834
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,183
-Stop smiling.
-I can't even smile?

835
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,393
Do you enjoy playing with me?

836
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,563
Why did you say that in front
of the others? They'll misunderstand.

837
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,401
Are you really asking

838
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,737
because you don't know?

839
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,407
I kept thinking about you.

840
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,660
I missed you.

841
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,830
Didn't you miss me?

842
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,634
Do you hate me that much?

843
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,094
You have a girlfriend.

844
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,846
Is that the issue?

845
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,933
No. It has nothing to do with me.

846
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,518
Then be honest.

847
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,312
Let go of me.

848
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,570
Running away again?

849
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,449
I never ran away.

850
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,576
Do you really want me to let go?

851
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,331
Just tell me

852
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,625
if you don't want this.

853
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,213
Then I'll stop.

854
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:10,607
YANG DO-HYEOK

855
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,786
Is this really okay?

856
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,293
If we continue,

857
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,880
I don't think I can stop.

858
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:43,157
Right now, I like you so much
that I don't know what to do.

859
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,410
I know exactly what my tears mean.

860
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,327
Did you sleep well?

861
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,079
We didn't get to finish.

862
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,831
You must like her a lot.

863
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,332
Yes. Unlike someone.

864
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,210
Are you and Do-hyeok dating?

865
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,461
He's such a coward.

866
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,255
Did you get an assistant?

867
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,173
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

868
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,634
Why does it feel like I'm cheating?

869
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,970
I heard you got scouted.

870
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:04,971
Are you going to America?

871
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,681
I'm going to give it some thought.

872
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:10,476
I saw someone so beautiful here
that I fell in love at first sight.

873
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,228
I like you. Sincerely.

874
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,690
I don't ever want to disappoint Do-hyeok.

875
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,359
Is Na-bi easily swayed by me?

876
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:23,573
