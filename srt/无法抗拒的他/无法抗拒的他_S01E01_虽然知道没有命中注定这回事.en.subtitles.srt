1
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,346
Sometimes, the reality you're facing
seems unrealistic.

2
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,560
Like right now,

3
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,605
as I'm walking the streets
covered in white

4
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,815
after an unexpected snow.

5
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:15,909
METAPHORS OF DAWN
YU HYEON-U EXHIBITION

6
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,674
It's the same when you're in love.

7
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,723
It feels like you've become
the most special person in the world.

8
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,017
It feels unrealistic.

9
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,239
Your heart…

10
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,366
flutters.

11
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,555
It's so erotic.

12
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,973
I know.

13
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,161
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF A LOVER
VIEW FROM BEHIND

14
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,079
NABI
YU HYEON-U

15
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,539
But why is it called "Nabi"?

16
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,332
I don't know.

17
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,876
Let's go.

18
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,461
-What should we see next?
-Let's check this out.

19
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,796
This one?

20
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,715
-Have you heard of him?
-Of course.

21
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,883
Na-bi.

22
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,902
Isn't it pretty?

23
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,716
Na-bi.

24
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,384
Yu Na-bi!

25
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,887
What is love?

26
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,353
He was a serious person.

27
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,437
What is love?

28
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,899
Constantly giving meaning…

29
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,861
to something abstract and unfamiliar.

30
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,613
Wouldn't that be true love?

31
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,751
-I knew it.
-What?

32
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,378
I asked to have pizza today

33
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,631
because I wanted to get a glimpse
of your feelings

34
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,466
through the act of sharing food.

35
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,177
-My feelings?
-Yes.

36
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,429
Your feelings for me.

37
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,310
Whether or not this one layer comes
between us tonight

38
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,938
will confirm
the sincerity of our relationship.

39
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,483
Almost always…

40
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,443
No.

41
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,821
He was always…

42
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,449
Honestly, this is ridiculous.

43
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,826
What do you mean?

44
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,622
I wish you wouldn't make
such arbitrary decisions.

45
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,542
Do my nails look that strange?

46
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,085
Everyone said they were pretty.

47
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,924
"Everyone"? If I were you,
I would've asked for my opinion first.

48
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,634
I guess I'm nothing

49
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,886
but a mere stranger to you.

50
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,681
Am I the only one who's serious?

51
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:10,268
He obsessively put meaning into everything
and made endless metaphors.

52
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,522
Was my work embarrassing to you?

53
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,983
Is that why you're crying?

54
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,153
Na-bi. Don't just look at the exterior.

55
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,488
You have to look at the meaning
hidden inside it.

56
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:29,203
You could've asked me about it first.

57
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,165
Darn it!

58
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,792
You're making me really upset.

59
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,211
I thought you would understand me
the best.

60
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,843
I once believed that it was special.

61
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,971
I'm not sure if I'd like that!

62
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:47,930
It's a bit strange.

63
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,932
He said it's because he loves you.

64
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,560
Artists don't use just any model,
you know.

65
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,854
I think

66
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,190
he must really care about you.

67
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,816
You're like his muse.

68
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,527
-No, this is really weird.
-His muse?

69
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,695
This is art.

70
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,821
You call this art?

71
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,198
It looks fine.

72
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,415
I was confused…

73
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,959
about boundaries.

74
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,840
Excuse me.

75
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:30,348
Your boyfriend's name
is Yu Hyeon-u, right?

76
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,267
Yes. Why?

77
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,270
I'm not sure if I should tell you, but…

78
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,732
My friend attends that academy.

79
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,492
It's already been a while.

80
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,505
I realized the truth…

81
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,217
at an unexpected moment.

82
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,571
And to be honest,
I felt like I already knew it.

83
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,666
But…

84
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,837
Na-bi.

85
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,887
I'm swamped with the academy
and the exhibition.

86
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,681
If the exhibition's successful,
I'll quit being a teacher

87
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,391
and focus on my art career.

88
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,561
But I'm not sure what theme I should do.

89
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,857
Mr. Baek wants to express people
in their 20s as lively and free…

90
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,776
But this jerk talked too much
for me to just blame myself.

91
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:14,911
Na-bi.

92
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,623
Why are you sitting like that?
I'm talking about something serious.

93
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,003
You asshole.

94
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,466
What?

95
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,137
Love.

96
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,474
It gets trampled on

97
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,976
and helplessly melts away.

98
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,187
It's nothing.

99
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,525
My relationship ended like that too.

100
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,452
-Na-bi, where are you going?
-The studio.

101
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,537
Okay, see you later.

102
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,871
See you.

103
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,791
-What are you doing?
-Just chilling.

104
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,833
Hurry back.

105
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,012
Aren't you going to the studio?

106
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,556
-Go ahead first.
-Go ahead first.

107
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,707
-Hi.
-Hey.

108
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,466
Hi.

109
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,759
Hi.

110
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,387
Hi, Na-bi.

111
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,312
Where were you, Na-bi?

112
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,771
Just outside.

113
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,481
Na-bi, help me.

114
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,941
You should do it yourself.

115
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,152
Na-bi, can't you concentrate
for a few hours?

116
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,165
Jeez, what a jerk.

117
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,667
What is it this time?

118
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,837
He's the one who suggested
going to a hotel instead of a motel.

119
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,464
And now he wants me to chip in.

120
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,633
Who? The guy you met
through the app yesterday?

121
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,592
Yes!

122
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,636
I wouldn't feel this upset if he was good.

123
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,347
It wasn't even worth spending
a night with him!

124
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,141
-Why'd you sleep with him, then?
-He must've been handsome.

125
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,601
She loves handsome guys.

126
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,520
This is so annoying. Let's go for a smoke.

127
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,733
No, I'm quitting for a while.
I'm not going to smoke for three days.

128
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,568
What's in three days?

129
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,986
A blind date.

130
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,031
I'll quit until then,
and if it's bearable, I'll keep it up.

131
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,617
-Another blind date?
-You're unbelievable.

132
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,327
Do you like men that much?

133
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,912
You're one to ask.

134
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,121
Point taken.

135
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,373
It's too noisy here.

136
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,000
-You're going to work, right?
-Yes.

137
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,380
-You're really not going?
-Bye.

138
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,216
Then who can I smoke with?

139
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,635
What if I get kidnapped
while smoking alone?

140
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,137
-I wonder if my mother would cry for--
-I'll come with you.

141
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,223
You're the best.

142
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,558
I just got here.

143
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,772
-All right, I'm coming.
-Just a little more.

144
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,108
Do you climb up all these stairs
every time you smoke?

145
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,402
-I don't mind if it's for a drag.
-Gosh.

146
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,947
If he's okay, swipe right.
If not, swipe left.

147
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,242
And if you both swipe right
for each other, it's a match.

148
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,285
And then?

149
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,496
Then you message back and forth here.

150
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,374
If it goes well, you exchange numbers
and maybe meet up later.

151
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,835
I guess today is not the day.

152
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,379
But nobody uses
their real names here, right?

153
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,756
Right. I don't show my face
on my profile, either.

154
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,427
But some people just reveal
their names and faces.

155
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,178
Oh, I hate tattoos like this!

156
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,346
Tattoos?

157
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,101
The guy I met yesterday
had a huge tattoo, too.

158
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,352
You know what it said?

159
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,942
His thing kept dying,
and he says "never die"?

160
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,694
-How--
-Keep it down.

161
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,112
It was so ridiculous.

162
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,947
Some tattoos are pretty, though.

163
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,701
Like whose?

164
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,035
What?

165
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,205
Are you seeing someone?

166
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,293
What are you on about?

167
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,295
As if I would.

168
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,428
Do you want to join us for drinks later?

169
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,014
No, I'm fine.
I'm going to work late today.

170
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,140
Again?

171
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,685
-Life must be so boring for you.
-Whatever.

172
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,941
Look. He's one of our juniors.

173
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,486
He said he wants to drink with you.

174
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,862
When will I finish?

175
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,199
I stayed up all night.
I'm going to have to stay up again.

176
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,494
I just got out of a relationship,
remember?

177
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,912
Hey, I didn't mean that.

178
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,830
We all know each other except for you.

179
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,874
So I just wanted to introduce you two.

180
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,294
Well, anyway…

181
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,837
God, you're so boring.

182
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,591
Oh, no! I accidentally swiped left

183
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,177
-on a total hottie!
-Let me see.

184
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,262
I can never see him again.

185
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,352
You're acting unlike yourself today.

186
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,188
What? What is it this time?

187
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,733
Oh, well. You got rid of that jerk,
so you should move on.

188
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,278
-But this app isn't for you.
-Why not?

189
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,739
You're pretty
but you have no taste in men.

190
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,658
-You'll only attract losers.
-Hey!

191
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,784
What?

192
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,870
Well…

193
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,499
Maybe.

194
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,254
-You're really not coming?
-No.

195
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,505
Have fun.

196
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,258
You're so boring.

197
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,218
Call me later!

198
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,261
Okay.

199
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:30,995
EPISODE 1: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FATE.
NEVERTHELESS,

200
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,881
THE DAY SHE BROKE UP WITH X

201
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:08,991
You got here first.

202
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,339
Who are you?

203
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,300
Aren't you So-ri?

204
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:32,014
No, my name is Yu Na-bi.

205
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,974
Na-bi?

206
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,566
I guess I mistook you for someone else.
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,318
It's fine.

208
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,863
It's silly, but the moment our eyes met…

209
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,886
The pain of the breakup

210
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,056
that had been weighing down on me
just a minute ago…

211
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,103
Can I sit here?

212
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,065
You're already sitting there.

213
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,321
Are you with someone?

214
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,325
No, I'm not.

215
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,494
…melted away like snow.

216
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,499
But aren't you here to meet someone?

217
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,669
You said you mistook me for someone else.

218
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,629
I canceled on her.

219
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,631
Why?

220
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,259
I just thought…

221
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,390
I didn't need to meet her.

222
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,111
The loser grants the winner a wish.

223
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,237
Remember?

224
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,406
I've been conned.

225
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,491
Keep going.

226
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,619
So you broke up today?

227
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,579
Oh.

228
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:20,998
Yes.

229
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,125
I flat out dumped him.

230
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,128
I guess he was a bad guy.

231
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,713
Well…

232
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,090
he was a total joke.

233
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,342
I was an idiot for dating him.

234
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,554
Good riddance. Now nothing holds me back
from leaving the country.

235
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,598
-For travel?
-Exchange student.

236
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,851
I want to go to Paris.

237
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,811
That's cool.

238
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,356
But it won't happen anytime soon.
Do you like traveling?

239
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,150
I've never traveled properly before.

240
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,527
-I want to go at the end of the year.
-With who?

241
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,408
Alone?

242
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,745
With a friend? Or…

243
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,580
your girlfriend?

244
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,750
I'm not sure.

245
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,835
With anyone.

246
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,677
Here you go.

247
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,596
It's my turn now, right?

248
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,440
Why is it so hard?

249
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,984
Because you haven't done it often.

250
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,780
If you keep practicing,
you'll get the hang of it.

251
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,909
It doesn't matter where it hits.

252
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,706
Just try to get it near the red dot.

253
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,668
Easy.

254
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,512
That's unexpected.

255
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,266
What do you mean?

256
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,562
You look a bit different when you smile.

257
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,985
What are you talking about?

258
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,696
Move over.

259
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,037
I won.

260
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,373
Of course you did.

261
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,877
You seem happy for a loser.

262
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,336
Well…

263
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,172
it was fun.

264
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,048
Right.

265
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,259
It's fun to be with you, Na-bi.

266
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,346
This guy…

267
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,892
is bad for my heart.

268
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,435
Okay.

269
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,688
Easy.

270
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,814
Easy.

271
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,656
YU JEONG-RAN

272
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,786
Yes, Mom.

273
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,248
Na-bi.
Your aunt made your favorite side dish.

274
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,542
-Should I ask her to send it to you?
-No…

275
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,920
I still have a lot left over
from last time.

276
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,548
Just throw away the leftovers
and eat the new ones she sends.

277
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,009
You always tell me to throw away stuff.

278
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,010
I'm hanging up now.

279
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,012
Why are you in such a mood?

280
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,765
I want my precious daughter
to have new and good stuff.

281
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,099
Anyway, it's fine.

282
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,186
When are you coming home?

283
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:34,024
It's only an hour away by subway
but you never come home.

284
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,777
Because he's there…

285
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,991
I just have a lot of assignments
these days.

286
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,701
How is Ttoli?

287
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,830
Ttoli is always whimpering
because she misses you.

288
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,125
Bring your boyfriend.
I'll treat you to delicious food.

289
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,293
There's no boyfriend.

290
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,630
What? Did you break up?

291
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,259
Na-bi.

292
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,473
Mom, I need to hang up.

293
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,701
What?

294
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,815
Why were you named after a butterfly?

295
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:02,446
So my life could be sweet like honey.
My mom and aunt named me.

296
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,576
I'm just kidding.

297
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,247
Do you know Nathaniel Hawthorne?

298
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,625
He's my aunt's favorite author,

299
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,128
and he said this.

300
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,630
It's a bit cringey to quote it.

301
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,552
"Happiness is like a butterfly which,

302
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,015
when pursued, is always beyond our grasp,

303
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:34,311
but, if you will sit down quietly,
may alight upon you."

304
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,901
That's the back story.

305
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,821
It's nothing special.

306
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,739
No…

307
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,991
I love it.

308
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,179
Is that a butterfly…

309
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,264
on your neck?

310
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,349
Yes.

311
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,686
I like…

312
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,482
butterflies.

313
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,578
All done.

314
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,837
It's cute.

315
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,674
Is this really your wish?

316
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,718
That was pretty simple.

317
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,681
Then should I…

318
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,226
make another wish?

319
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,494
This is silly.

320
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,413
What do you mean?

321
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,957
It's nothing.

322
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,391
The moon is pretty today.

323
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,443
Do you want one?

324
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,697
It's my last one.

325
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,532
Well…

326
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,409
I don't smoke.

327
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,663
Excuse me.

328
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,290
Can I borrow a cigarette?

329
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,044
Gosh.

330
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,171
I'm sobering up.

331
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,383
Hey, can I borrow a cigarette?

332
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:15,931
If we run into each other next time,
I promise to return the favor.

333
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,726
I do have one, but…

334
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,619
What the hell?

335
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,684
What?

336
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,478
Why are you smiling?

337
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,872
Are you okay?

338
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,210
Yes.

339
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,045
I'm fine.

340
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,235
Do you want to go see butterflies?

341
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,322
Where would we see them?

342
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,575
At my place.

343
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,127
Let me go to the bathroom for a minute.

344
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,639
What are you doing?

345
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,768
I miss you too.

346
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,479
Are you going to sleep?

347
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,151
Yes.

348
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,448
What? So you just left?

349
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,784
Did you contact him after that?

350
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,118
Of course not.

351
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,914
I told him about where my name came from,
but I don't even know his name.

352
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,333
You mustered up your courage, though.
Too bad.

353
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,545
What's that?

354
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,548
Oh, this?

355
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,716
Well…

356
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,593
It's nothing.

357
00:27:58,676 --> 00:27:59,803
It's love.

358
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,348
It's nothing like that.

359
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,016
-Then what is it?
-Lust?

360
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,893
I don't know. It's just…

361
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,479
It was fun.

362
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:14,192
It's hard to find someone
you feel an instant connection with.

363
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,444
Never mind that.
You said he has a girlfriend.

364
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,739
You should never hang out with cheaters.

365
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,577
Oh, right.
I have to post the part-time job ad.

366
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,371
Or should I ask some of the kids?

367
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,664
All right.

368
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,999
How about Jae-eon?

369
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,335
I'm not sure. Would he do it?

370
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,588
I'll try to convince him.

371
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,260
Hello.

372
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,387
Oh, do, re, mi, fa, sol. Sol is here.

373
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,057
I have a meeting with the professor.

374
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,184
Right. Go inside with Na-bi.

375
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,566
-Together?
-Together?

376
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,610
It's okay. Sol can have the meeting first.

377
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,362
It'll be a waste of time.

378
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,197
It's about
the exchange student program, right?

379
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,368
The professor's nagging will get longer
if it's one-on-one.

380
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,494
Right.

381
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,496
Right.

382
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,331
Bye, then.

383
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,374
Bye.

384
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,045
You're really clueless, aren't you?

385
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,756
What do you mean?

386
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,718
Na-bi was feeling uncomfortable since
she didn't want to be compared to Sol.

387
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,136
Is that so?

388
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,306
You only picked hard places to get in.

389
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,685
Na-bi, it'll be difficult to get
accepted to any of these schools.

390
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,895
You know that, right?

391
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,648
Yes.

392
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,983
I'm not saying you're bad.

393
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,651
You're doing well,

394
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,404
but there are only
a limited number of spots.

395
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,282
You have to raise your GPA.

396
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,825
Work harder, okay?

397
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,077
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,539
And going abroad isn't always
the best answer.

399
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,833
Staying in Korea could be a better option.

400
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,920
Domestic graduate schools
are pretty good too.

401
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,839
There's no place like Korea for Koreans,

402
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:00,965
don't you think?

403
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,177
Right.

404
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,596
Let's talk again next time, then.

405
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,057
What about you, Sol?

406
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,059
You didn't submit your list?

407
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,269
No, not yet.

408
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,897
You could start next semester.
What are you waiting for?

409
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,941
Is there something going on?

410
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,444
No.

411
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,405
I'll make my decision soon, ma'am.

412
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,243
All right.
I'd prefer it if you made it quick.

413
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,119
It's a waste of time.

414
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,872
You might think it won't be any different.

415
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,125
But there are things you can learn
from the world out there.

416
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,545
This is a great list.

417
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,298
Take a look at this,
and make your decision.

418
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,927
LIST OF PROSPECTIVE UNIVERSITIES

419
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,970
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,975
Why do you two look so gloomy?

421
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,185
You should be shining at that age.

422
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,895
Don't stay holed up in the studio.

423
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,356
You should make your life eventful

424
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,609
to get inspiration for your work.
Got that?

425
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,653
Yes.

426
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,864
Yes.

427
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,037
I think she said the word "inspiration"
over 100 times.

428
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,333
Just take it.

429
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,961
I was about to give you the file
if you needed it anyway.

430
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,380
Thanks. It'll be helpful.

431
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,508
It was so embarrassing, though.

432
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,135
What was?

433
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,055
I listed up all the great universities
without thinking about my grades.

434
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,434
I'm jealous, Sol.
You can go pretty much anywhere.

435
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,606
It might not be the best idea
to go abroad.

436
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,235
Honestly, it kind of feels like
I'm just trying to run away.

437
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,279
Were you thinking that too?

438
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,114
Yun Sol!

439
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,660
Oh, you were with Na-bi.

440
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,330
What did the professor say?
Why did she call you two?

441
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,623
It was for the exchange--

442
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,083
Just talking about assignment ideas.

443
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,293
Assignment ideas?

444
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,880
Why did she leave me out?
This is favoritism.

445
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,757
She just gave us a bit of advice.

446
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,717
We'll be off.

447
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,219
Oh, okay. Bye.

448
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,262
Bye, Na-bi.

449
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,892
I'm the one who's out of ideas.

450
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,736
Why are you dressed so nicely?

451
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,072
Do I look nice? That's a relief.

452
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,866
Is it because we're gathering today?

453
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,159
Well…

454
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,703
my blind date was supposed to be tomorrow,

455
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,414
but he said something urgent came up

456
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,208
and asked if we could meet today.

457
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,168
Otherwise, it'll be a while later.

458
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,129
You know how you shouldn't
put off a blind date for too long.

459
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,131
So I just agreed to meet him today.

460
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,884
What? Then what about our gathering today?

461
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,386
Tell the others for me.

462
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,430
Hey, I didn't want to go.
You're the one who made a fuss.

463
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,683
I know. I'm really sorry.

464
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,768
But if you don't go either,

465
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,188
everyone will curse me to death. Please?

466
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,856
-Sol, please.
-Gosh.

467
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,149
All right.

468
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,067
I love you!

469
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,237
If things go well with my date,
I'll set you up with someone too.

470
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,279
There's no need.

471
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,698
Oh, come on.

472
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,484
-Hi. What brings you here?
-Hello.

473
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,319
-Hello.
-Hello.

474
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,031
-Keep working.
-Okay.

475
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,660
I already chiseled it off.

476
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,830
You have to raise your GPA.

477
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,137
So you're really going to stay up working?

478
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,555
Yes.

479
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,517
Or I might not be able to finish on time.

480
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,976
My progress is slow.

481
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,437
Alcohol is the best when you're stuck.

482
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,648
I'm going to go drink with the kids.

483
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,818
You don't know any of our juniors.

484
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,112
Don't you need an assistant
for the exhibit?

485
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:19,367
At this rate, you'll be the first one
in our department to do everything alone.

486
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,124
Gosh. Never mind.

487
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,376
There's no way
you'll get a new boyfriend like that.

488
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,627
Bye.

489
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,132
Call me if you change your mind.

490
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,259
Okay.

491
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,845
Have fun!

492
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,012
I will!

493
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,685
That will be 14,000 won.

494
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,769
Here.

495
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,820
It's him.

496
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,281
Hang on.

497
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,503
The library, and now this.

498
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,882
I must be losing my mind.

499
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,764
You're really not coming?

500
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,648
Bit-na, where's the location?

501
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,669
We meet again.

502
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,550
What are you doing here?

503
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,639
Hey, you're here.

504
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,267
-Hi. I'm heading in first.
-Okay.

505
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,107
He's the junior…

506
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,734
who was hoping to drink with you.

507
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,823
I see.

508
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,367
Look! You're screwed.

509
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,580
Gosh, this place is flooded with seniors.

510
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,040
Seniors!

511
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,584
Are you sick of your seniors?

512
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,627
Not at all!

513
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,923
But we have a newbie now.

514
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,802
She made a rare appearance,
so be nice to her.

515
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,099
This is Yu Na-bi,
and this is Park Jae-eon.

516
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,893
Park Jae-eon…

517
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,312
Oh, okay.

518
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,398
His name was Park Jae-eon.

519
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,568
What's with the face?

520
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,946
Do you know each other?

521
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,158
No.

522
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,494
-It's our first time seeing each other.
-It's your first time?

523
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,996
They took turns taking a leave.

524
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,458
And Na-bi barely attends school events.

525
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,128
-That's right. She never shows up.
-But you come to all of them.

526
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,629
Hi.

527
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,470
Oh. Hi.

528
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,056
I just got butterflies in my stomach!

529
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,599
"Oh. Hi."

530
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,808
I'm getting butterflies!

531
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,728
I'm Park Jae-eon.
I'll just talk to you casually.

532
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,271
He's the same age as us.

533
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,273
He was a business major at K University

534
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,692
but he took the entrance exam again
to major in sculpture.

535
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,818
I see.

536
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,029
I saw you before, though.

537
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,490
What?

538
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,288
Where?

539
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,916
At school.

540
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,922
I said I wanted to drink with you.

541
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:43,881
Right.

542
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,801
So you two have finally met.

543
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,470
It's nice to meet you.

544
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,848
It's nice to meet you too.

545
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,727
I don't believe…

546
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,230
in fate or love anymore.

547
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,110
But this situation…

548
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,363
It's pretty unrealistic.

549
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,368
That professor gives us
so many assignments. It's awful.

550
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,370
You selected a bad course.

551
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,247
You took that class.
Why didn't you tell me?

552
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,666
-Ji-wan's still not answering?
-No.

553
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,503
She's not reading my messages.
I guess she's still with him.

554
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,381
She said she'd make it quick.
Things must be going well.

555
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,425
Hey, that's a given.

556
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,885
Ji-wan's popular with guys.

557
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,637
I'm so jealous.

558
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,807
So many guys asked for her number
at our high school festival.

559
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,018
But it seems like Ji-wan
likes the guy this time, too.

560
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,188
There's no point.
Bet she'll get sick of him within a month.

561
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,440
Right.

562
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,485
It's her biggest wish to go on a
couple's trip for a one-year anniversary.

563
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,654
-That's so cute.
-It's cute.

564
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,119
-I'll get it.
-It'll be hard to carry it all yourself.

565
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,413
No, it's fine.

566
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,497
Keep talking.

567
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,583
Right, so what happened?

568
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,876
He has a girlfriend.

569
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,683
Oh, my gosh.

570
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,021
I'm so sorry.

571
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:22,980
I'm okay.

572
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,565
Are you all right?

573
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,566
Yes.

574
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,985
I was looking at my phone.

575
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,778
I'm okay.

576
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,366
-Exciting! So much fun! The Game of Death!
-Exciting! So much fun! The Game of Death!

577
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,284
Three! One!

578
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,368
-Two!
-Three!

579
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,747
Take off your hat.

580
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,333
-Hey. Here's a hair tie.
-Take it off.

581
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,001
Make a palm tree.

582
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,254
Go easy on me, please.

583
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,924
Jae-eon is fun.

584
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,800
You look pretty.

585
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,760
Jae-eon!

586
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,844
I'm sorry.

587
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,846
Off you go.

588
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,473
That look really suits you!

589
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,983
I'm really sorry, but…

590
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,568
Oh, you want a glass?

591
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,903
No…

592
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,113
If it's okay with you…

593
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,243
Could you watch me dance?

594
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,495
Don't cover your face!

595
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,622
-Five, six, seven, eight!
-Jae-eon has a way of

596
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,291
making naughty pranks seem rather fun.

597
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,046
Twist your body!

598
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,965
What is that?

599
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,597
Come on!

600
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,600
This is so stupid.

601
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,269
Are you upset?

602
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,562
I guess he smiles a lot.

603
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,188
-Let's play another game.
-What?

604
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,439
-Let's drink.
-What?

605
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,942
-It's nothing.
-Come on. Drink up.

606
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,444
It's mine.

607
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,863
Come on. Cheers!

608
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,283
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

609
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,285
Can you hand me that?

610
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,831
Thanks.

611
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,298
-Hey, guys. Gather round.
-What is it?

612
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,968
Who are the scumbags who did it
in the student council room last semester?

613
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,681
Then is it true that a condom was found
in the trash can?

614
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,391
That's disgusting!

615
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,851
The sofa…

616
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,187
On the sofa?

617
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,858
You better fess up. Could it have been…

618
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,156
Quit playing detective.
You're barking up the wrong tree.

619
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,073
What?

620
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,366
Do you know who it is?

621
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,035
-Who is it?
-Get off me.

622
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,369
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

623
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,746
Goodness.

624
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,456
Do you still not know?

625
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,833
It's Choi Min-u.

626
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:48,792
No way!

627
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,337
-His girlfriend is Jeong-a.
-Then it was her and Min-u?

628
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,006
Of course not. He was sleeping
with someone else.

629
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,551
He was cheating on her?

630
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,219
That asshole!

631
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,971
How could he do that to her?

632
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,389
I feel sorry for her.

633
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,727
There are quite some pretty girls
who have poor judgment.

634
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,147
No wonder you're called Bit-na News.
Go, Bit-na News!

635
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,231
Stop overreacting.

636
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,358
Let me pour you a shot.

637
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,652
-Oh, thank you.
-This is boring, isn't it?

638
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,861
-Is your source reliable?
-Should we leave?

639
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,155
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Stay out of it.

640
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,032
-More drinks!
-Whose glass is empty?

641
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,076
-Me!
-You should take a break.

642
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,452
-Here you go.
-Thank you, my dear.

643
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,412
-You're the best.
-So how did you find out?

644
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,290
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

645
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:29,958
You dropped this.

646
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,211
Oh. Thank you.

647
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,049
Look at him.

648
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,223
You look a bit different when you smile.

649
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,065
I'm going to the bathroom for a bit.

650
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,066
Okay.

651
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,455
Why do I feel so annoyed?

652
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,338
I should just get back to work.

653
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,477
I'm going to go buy ice cream.

654
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,563
Do you want to come with me?

655
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,613
What do you want?

656
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,491
That one?

657
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,617
No.

658
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:47,870
Then…

659
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,538
what about that one?

660
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,083
No.

661
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,711
This one.

662
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,635
Why did you laugh?

663
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,474
Because you're cute.

664
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,352
Shut up.

665
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,942
Your style looks different.

666
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,613
Hey, what are you doing?

667
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,531
Let's skip study hall and go play games.

668
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,075
Sorry!

669
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,540
Why did you say you didn't know me?

670
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,627
Well…

671
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,172
I was caught off-guard.

672
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,761
It would've been strange to say
that I knew you.

673
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,889
I didn't know your name or your age.

674
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,769
So why did you just leave that day?

675
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,526
I was drunk.

676
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,448
Anyway, the stuff I said that day…

677
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,284
Just forget everything.

678
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,078
What about that day?

679
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,163
You didn't say much.

680
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,124
Well…

681
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,210
Just forget about it.

682
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,505
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

683
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,051
Okay.

684
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,265
You didn't erase it.

685
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,686
Oh, this?

686
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,275
Right.

687
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,402
I washed it, but it wouldn't come off.

688
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,529
That's strange.

689
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,907
It was a water-based marker.

690
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,121
Oh, really?

691
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,416
That's strange.

692
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,423
Didn't you want to see me again?

693
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,219
Well…

694
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,598
Not much.

695
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,349
But I was pretty startled.

696
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,643
I thought I'd never see you again.

697
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,230
I was glad…

698
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,317
to see you again.

699
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,803
Why are you two coming in together?

700
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,972
We bought ice cream.

701
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,982
Love always begins with ice cream,
you know.

702
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,109
Come here!

703
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,780
Hey! Let's go for a smoke.

704
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,739
Okay.

705
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,449
Do you want to come?

706
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,533
She doesn't smoke.

707
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:16,370
Really?

708
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,996
Be careful on the way out.

709
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,803
Darn it…

710
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,770
Here. This is my number.

711
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,273
If you text me your bank account number
and the cost, I'll send the money.

712
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,234
All right. I'll keep in touch.

713
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,405
I'm really sorry.

714
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,406
It's fine.

715
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,118
Your head's a bit red. Are you okay?

716
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,580
It's okay. My head is rock-hard.

717
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,583
Are you not hurt?
I ran into you pretty hard.

718
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,210
I'm okay.

719
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,170
That's a relief, then.

720
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,839
Let's go.

721
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,344
Why don't we just go
for another round somewhere?

722
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,722
Hello? Everyone here?

723
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,267
Hey, let's go.

724
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,269
Let's do that. All right.

725
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,856
-I'm off.
-Let's go together.

726
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,607
-Let's go.
-We're leaving.

727
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,900
-Goodbye!
-Good night!

728
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,360
Be careful on the way home.

729
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,157
You seemed to have drunk a lot.
Are you all right?

730
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,534
Yes, I'm fine. I'm not even drunk.

731
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:39,911
What about you?

732
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,833
Is that your girlfriend?

733
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,376
What?

734
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,379
I don't have a girlfriend.

735
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,757
I'm taking the bus here.
Careful on the way home.

736
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,967
Right. Bye.

737
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,411
We meet again.

738
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,704
I like…

739
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,291
butterflies.

740
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,626
I was glad…

741
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,712
to see you again.

742
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,465
I don't have a girlfriend.

743
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,928
Is this fate?

744
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,319
OH BIT-NA

745
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,905
Guys, send 20,000 won each for the drinks.

746
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,785
PARK JAE-EON

747
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,289
Why are you awake?

748
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:50,750
Right now?

749
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,587
Is it okay for me to come over?

750
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,647
I SENT THE MONEY
I SENT THE MONEY TOO

751
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,275
Is he sleeping?

752
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,698
He's sleeping already?

753
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,664
What am I doing?

754
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,523
Are you sleeping?

755
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,526
Darn it. Not you.

756
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,085
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3

757
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,927
Hey, Sol.

758
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,679
Aren't you going for a smoke?

759
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,430
I already did.

760
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,390
I see.

761
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,436
Hey, guys.
Aren't you going out for a smoke?

762
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,522
Just go. I'm totally busy right now.

763
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,731
Go away.

764
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,234
What about you?

765
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,027
No. This isn't sticking.

766
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,157
-You're really not going?
-Just go.

767
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,085
Hi.

768
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,503
Hi, Na-bi.

769
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,256
Hey, Na-bi.

770
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,632
Oh, hi.

771
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,556
What is it, Na-bi?

772
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,057
What?

773
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,643
It's nothing.

774
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,396
-I thought it was due today.
-I have to work late.

775
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,234
-Na-bi.
-Hey.

776
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,944
-Are you looking for someone?
-No.

777
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,113
I'm just getting some fresh air.

778
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,328
Professor!

779
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,122
-Professor!
-Professor!

780
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,916
Hey, a five-year-old
would do a better job.

781
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,668
Professor!

782
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,087
Professor, can you help me?

783
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,716
Gyeong-jun! Please!

784
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,637
No matter how many colors I mix,
I can't get the right color.

785
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,598
I won't help you
unless you call me Mr. An.

786
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,600
But you're our senior.

787
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,478
I will be so grateful
if you could help me with this.

788
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,645
-No.
-Mr. An!

789
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,065
See? He calls me Mr. An.

790
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,900
-Gyeong-jun! Mr. An!
-I need your help.

791
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,865
-What should I do?
-Just apply the second layer

792
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,451
and coat it with primer in the end. Okay?

793
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,411
PARK JAE-EON

794
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,041
He's in the group chat room, though.

795
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,919
PARK JAE-EON

796
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,423
Mr. An!

797
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,800
What are you doing?

798
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,885
-Gyeong-jun! I mean, Mr. An!
-Hello, ma'am.

799
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,887
-Why were you startled?
-Mr. An, please.

800
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,722
I'm more startled at your piece.

801
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,057
Why is there no progress?

802
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,351
-I can't seem to get the color right.
-Well, I…

803
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,019
I'm almost done.

804
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,730
This shouldn't be "almost done." Okay?

805
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:43,983
I'll work late today.

806
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,527
Working late isn't going to…

807
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,908
-Let's talk later.
-Yes, ma'am.

808
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,629
-Hey, Bit-na.
-What?

809
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,673
Did everyone send the money last night?

810
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,383
What? Yes, everyone sent it.

811
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,467
Why?

812
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,927
I was just curious.

813
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,220
They all sent it.

814
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,810
Jae-eon gave it to me in cash right away.

815
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,230
Oh.

816
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,734
Keep going.

817
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,237
Focus, all right?

818
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,572
I am.

819
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,372
I'm so full.
My stomach's going to explode.

820
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,707
Mine first.

821
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,958
I can't breathe.

822
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,169
But I can still eat dessert.

823
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,795
I can totally eat cake.

824
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:46,880
I can eat cake too!

825
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,965
I can eat it with coffee!

826
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,801
We have some time left. Shall we?

827
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,762
-Sure, you little foodie.
-You guys are coming too, right?

828
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:55,680
Of course.

829
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:59,142
Your stomachs are really going to explode.

830
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:02,061
He always picks a fight
when he's going to join us anyway.

831
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:02,979
Tell me about it.

832
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:03,980
Oh, no.

833
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,648
Where are my Bluetooth earphones?

834
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,903
I left them at the outdoor studio.

835
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,197
Someone's going to steal them for sure.

836
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:16,534
There are security cameras everywhere.
Nobody will take them.

837
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,785
Right?

838
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,329
It's so far away.

839
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,456
-I'll just ask in our chat room.
-Wait. I'll get them.

840
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:22,957
Really?

841
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,292
Yes.

842
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,419
It's fine. You don't need to.

843
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,005
No, I was about to go back anyway.

844
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,299
I'll get them and put them in your locker.

845
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,592
Send me your passcode.

846
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,052
I'm so touched.

847
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,011
Thank you.

848
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,387
It's nothing.

849
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,932
She's so kind.

850
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,893
What should I do?

851
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,021
I'm so popular.

852
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,607
Dream on. She'd never fall for you.

853
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,194
I was just saying!
Why would she do that for me?

854
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,905
She was going to head back anyway.

855
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,657
Never mind. Let's go have some cake.

856
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,033
Yes!

857
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,961
What's this? Is it a bat?

858
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,047
A bat? It's a butterfly.

859
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:15,385
This piece sure feels different
from all the other ones.

860
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:16,719
Right.

861
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,265
I don't even see him often at the studio.
When did he do all this?

862
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,141
He must be a genius.

863
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,978
Jae-eon won almost
all the competitions last year.

864
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:28,064
And he's even handsome.
Life's so unfair, isn't it?

865
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,900
So that was Jae-eon's.

866
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,152
But where did Jae-eon…

867
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,696
Oh. Hi, Na-bi.

868
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,406
Hi.

869
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:37,740
What brings you here?

870
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,701
Well…

871
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,328
Jin-su said he left something behind.

872
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,414
Did you see Bluetooth earphones
lying around?

873
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,748
-No.
-No.

874
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,292
You should look around.

875
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,251
Okay, I will.

876
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,675
Oh, Jae-eon!

877
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:57,885
Hey, Jae-eon.

878
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:58,928
Hey.

879
00:59:59,012 --> 00:59:59,929
Hi, Jae-eon.

880
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,809
Hi.

881
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,644
Hi.

882
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,438
Looking for something?

883
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,481
No.

884
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,653
Jae-eon, that's a butterfly, right?

885
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,488
She said it looks like a bat.

886
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,950
You recognized it?
Everyone thinks it's a bat.

887
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,702
You must really like butterflies.

888
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,580
-Your last piece was one too.
-Do you want to see my butterflies?

889
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,581
Yes. Show us.

890
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:27,790
Yes, please.

891
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,837
They're so pretty.

892
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,508
Is that what your tattoo is about?
Like people get tattoos of their pets?

893
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,015
Do they have names?

894
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,684
No, I just call them butterflies.

895
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:50,605
"Butterfly."

896
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,734
It's a pretty name.

897
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:15,546
I like…

898
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,175
butterflies.

899
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,469
"Butterfly."

900
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,054
It's a pretty name.

901
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,682
Jae-eon keeps making me think

902
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,267
the way my annoying ex did.

903
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,938
It's so stupid to read too much into
meaningless stuff.

904
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,527
You idiot.

905
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,529
Who's an idiot?

906
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,200
Don't look.

907
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,995
Is this seaweed?

908
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:54,460
Why did you have to appear out of nowhere
and surprise me like that?

909
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,129
You're just insensitive.

910
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,716
You left without a word.
I thought you had something to say.

911
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,345
No, I didn't have anything…

912
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,765
I was just looking
for my friend's belongings.

913
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,521
You know how popular you are, right?

914
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,401
That's why you have that look
and talk that way.

915
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:23,865
What?

916
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,492
There's the seaweed.

917
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,661
-Come here.
-Sorry.

918
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,747
I'm sorry! Stop it.

919
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,915
-Wipe it off.
-Okay, I will.

920
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,292
I'll wipe it off for you.

921
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,758
-Sorry! Okay, I'll really wipe it off.
-Hang on.

922
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,342
-You'd better.
-What?

923
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,219
-Come on, wipe it off.
-When did they get so close?

924
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,638
They look pretty good together. Hey!

925
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:48,973
What?

926
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,141
Let's just go.

927
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,517
-Why?
-Come on. Let's go.

928
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,360
Why do my shoulders hurt so much?
I wish they had high bars at school.

929
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,702
Relax.

930
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,289
Your back was hunched
when you were working.

931
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,125
Hey, let go. Wait.

932
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,127
Wait. Stop.

933
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,308
I almost fell down.

934
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,280
Bit-na says
you practically live in the studio.

935
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,699
Not really.

936
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,368
I like working at night,

937
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,746
so I often stay late. What about you?

938
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,664
I might try it more often.

939
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,166
It was fun.

940
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,669
As we talk,

941
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,671
I can see different sides of Jae-eon.

942
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,300
I envy you.

943
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,845
It used to be fun for me a long time ago.

944
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,556
It's not fun anymore?

945
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:38,976
There's a lot to think about now.

946
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,605
And I'm not sure what to do.

947
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,357
You wanted to be an exchange student.

948
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,692
It seems like a good goal.

949
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,569
It's nothing.

950
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,574
It sounds special,
but lots of students do it.

951
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:58,579
And honestly…

952
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,210
I just want to go somewhere far away.

953
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,629
Why?

954
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,049
Because of my mom and…

955
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,302
Let's stop talking about this.

956
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:14,804
It's boring.

957
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:17,723
It's not boring to me.

958
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,977
You're talking about your true self.

959
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:25,272
He's different from
the first impression I had of him.

960
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:29,068
I wanted to believe
that only I knew this side of him.

961
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,370
There's the moon you like.

962
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:47,753
It's pretty.

963
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,049
It's pretty.

964
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:03,811
Your number.

965
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,693
Oh. My number?

966
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,657
It feels like something new
is about to begin.

967
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,035
I'm probably not mistaken.

968
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,418
Yu Na-bi. I saved your number.

969
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,380
You know that I'm Na-bi.

970
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,262
Do you want one?

971
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,306
No, thanks.

972
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,686
Did you get it customized?

973
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:47,688
Yes.

974
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:49,690
Isn't it pretty?

975
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,444
Another butterfly.

976
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,738
Oh, show me too.

977
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,824
-What?
-Your pet butterflies.

978
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,244
-Oh, my butterflies?
-Yes.

979
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,038
Want to go see them?

980
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:11,629
I mean, I want to see the video

981
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,131
that you showed your friends. Gosh.

982
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,564
They're pretty.

983
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,820
What do you like so much about them?

984
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:46,539
They sometimes crawl up
onto my face like this.

985
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,250
It feels really nice.

986
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:56,298
It's lovely.

987
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,847
That tickles.

988
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,228
I want to smoke, too.

989
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,360
I don't want to go back inside.

990
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,116
Me neither.

991
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,831
You don't smoke, though.

992
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,083
Do you want to go have drinks?

993
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,209
Drinks?

994
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,881
Are you going to work some more? Then…

995
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,008
No. Let's go.

996
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,010
Just the two of us?

997
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,056
Well…

998
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,933
we can call our friends.

999
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,186
Should I call them?

1000
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:51,729
Why are you laughing?

1001
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:53,022
I don't know.

1002
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:55,357
You make me laugh.

1003
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,029
Are you that happy to drink with me?

1004
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,113
I am.

1005
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,376
I'm sure…

1006
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,504
that we feel the same way.

1007
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,146
I'm using my wish.

1008
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,857
I'm sure he does this to everyone.
I know everything.

1009
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,485
Park Jae-eon?
He has no interest at all in dating.

1010
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:22,695
So forget him.

1011
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,363
-Hey!
-Are you hurt?

1012
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,907
Jae-eon keeps making me feel excited.

1013
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,493
Do people have to date?

1014
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:32,830
Why can't two people just be close?

1015
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:34,123
Can't they stand near each other?

1016
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:36,542
Do they have to pretend not to notice
if there's something in their hair?

1017
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,878
What do I want from Jae-eon?

1018
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,172
You sometimes suddenly act cold to me.

1019
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:46,260
Bit-na and I are going to drink
at my house. Do you want to come?

1020
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:48,554
The two people
the bottle points to have to kiss!

1021
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:54,018
Right. I should just check for myself
and forget about him.

1022
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,440
