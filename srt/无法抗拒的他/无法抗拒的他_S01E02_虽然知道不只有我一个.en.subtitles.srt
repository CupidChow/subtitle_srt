1
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,010
I'm sure…

2
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,888
that we feel the same way.

3
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,557
KWON YEO-JU

4
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,276
I don't think I can go today.

5
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,277
How about tomorrow?

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,529
Okay. That's fine.

7
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:13,990
Sorry.

8
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:36,137
PARK JAE-EON

9
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,187
Jae-eon isn't the dating type.

10
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,648
What do you mean?

11
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,441
He may flirt but never commits.

12
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,818
He just draws the line.

13
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,156
Did he say so himself?
That he never commits?

14
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,201
Na-bi, you know what?

15
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,079
Flowers don't bloom
just for one butterfly.

16
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,039
What are you saying?

17
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,542
Jae-eon is like that flower.

18
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,043
Full of vanity,

19
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,380
a symbol of seductive beauty
that withers once it's plucked.

20
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,923
That's what Jae-eon is.

21
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,842
What's with you?

22
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,718
I know we're an art major, but still.

23
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,262
You may not know it,

24
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,848
but his every move is calculated.

25
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,015
Well…

26
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,852
I sometimes felt that something was off,

27
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,354
but it's not like that.

28
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,524
That's how everyone
falls for his tricks or not.

29
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,235
Actually, everyone knows.

30
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,862
They say they won't get fooled,

31
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,364
but they do when he shows
an ounce of sincerity.

32
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,908
Because they want to believe it.

33
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,078
I'm telling you.

34
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,414
Park Jae-eon?
He has no interest at all in dating.

35
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,667
He just likes to play with girls
who are drawn to him.

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,419
So forget him.

37
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,629
You don't know how to keep things casual.

38
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,383
What are you on about? We're just friends.

39
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,801
Stop lying to yourself.

40
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,845
Men and women can't be just friends.

41
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,847
Says the one with tons of guy friends.

42
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,558
I keep them close
since there's a possibility.

43
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,519
Hanging out with guys
heightens sexual tension.

44
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,062
Even Jae-eon?

45
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,607
He's not bad to hang out with.

46
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,192
And he's totally handsome.

47
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,028
Is it good?

48
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,988
You're actually eating cafeteria food?

49
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,448
I suggested eating here.

50
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,365
Right.

51
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,783
I'll get some water.

52
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,951
Okay.

53
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,955
What is it? Are you sick?

54
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,168
Well, I…

55
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,503
I just bit my tongue.

56
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,881
Are you all right?

57
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,508
Yes. I'm okay.

58
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,387
I'll be off first. Enjoy your food.

59
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,847
Where are you going?

60
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,313
You didn't forget, right?

61
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,816
-What?
-I'm using my wish.

62
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,402
You already used your wish.

63
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,363
Aren't you granting me another one?

64
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,366
Fine, but nothing weird.

65
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,593
EPISODE 2: IT'S NOT ONLY ME.
NEVERTHELESS,

66
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,259
Dance.

67
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,719
No.

68
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,720
That's my wish.

69
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,431
Can't we just leave?

70
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,765
Let's hang out here.

71
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,436
I can't hear anything. It's too loud.

72
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,858
What are you doing?

73
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,328
Jae-eon keeps making me feel excited.

74
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,312
All I see is Jae-eon.

75
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,721
Are you feeling the same way?

76
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,621
Sorry.

77
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,875
Let's go.

78
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,635
What?

79
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,512
Why am I so red?

80
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,715
I'm smoking outside.

81
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,468
Can I see your ID?

82
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,510
Thank you.

83
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,181
Jae-eon.

84
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,024
You weren't reading my messages.
Were you hanging out here?

85
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,817
Are you alone?

86
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,653
Se-mi and Mi-so are inside.
Want to join us?

87
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,749
I'm with her.

88
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,502
You can hang out without me.

89
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,675
Come on, we can all hang out together.

90
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,844
We can call other guys, too.

91
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,762
Jae-eon…

92
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,890
makes me feel anxious.

93
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,767
Well…

94
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,768
I'm fine.

95
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,605
You can go hang out with her.
I'll head home first.

96
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,857
Why would you leave?

97
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,654
Why don't you just go?

98
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,613
All right, then.

99
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,782
Bye.

100
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,338
Why did you try to ditch me?

101
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,340
You made me feel awkward.

102
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,717
You two seemed close.

103
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,762
I thought you should hang out with her.

104
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,056
We're not close.

105
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,643
We went to the same academy, is all.

106
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,061
We can all hang out together.

107
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,688
We can call other guys, too.

108
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,359
Is that all?

109
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,446
She looked pissed when you told her to go.

110
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,699
Did she?

111
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,536
Right. Maybe it's not a big deal for you.

112
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,371
She had a butterfly

113
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,040
on her wrist, too.

114
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,378
I'm not sure
if it was a drawing or a tattoo.

115
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,841
She just got it by herself.

116
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,009
By herself?

117
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,553
Why?

118
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,431
Maybe she wanted to see my reaction.

119
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,226
You know how friends from academies
sometimes hang out together.

120
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,855
But she kind of obsessed over me.

121
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,149
She was delusional.

122
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,739
Why are you suddenly so serious?

123
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,824
It has nothing to do with you,

124
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,160
so don't worry about it.

125
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,416
I'm taking the bus over there.

126
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,335
You're really going?

127
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,252
Yes.

128
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,171
I'm a bit tired.

129
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,427
I'll take you home. It's late.

130
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,888
No, there's no need.

131
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,514
Bye.

132
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,753
Is he just keeping me on the hook?

133
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,553
What's with him?

134
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,614
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

135
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,825
Hey, you're…

136
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,909
Stay still, will you?

137
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,036
-Put your hands like this.
-How did you enter this department?

138
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,496
So I can see all your fingers.

139
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,664
Like this?

140
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,207
No, cross them like this.

141
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,333
Like this?

142
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,460
Yes. That's it.

143
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,754
Where should I look?

144
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,713
Just look at me.

145
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,132
-Seriously?
-Hey, what are you doing?

146
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,174
What?

147
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,676
Focus here.

148
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,136
You sure don't know
how to compliment others.

149
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,262
Put your arms down.

150
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,346
You should work out. Look at that.

151
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,431
Lose some weight.

152
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,682
But Sol.

153
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,310
Your eyes, nose, and mouth
are all so pretty.

154
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,229
Even the shape of your face.

155
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,064
And your eyebrows are pretty.

156
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,732
I'm so jealous.

157
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,568
What should we eat for lunch?

158
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,778
How did you hurt yourself again?

159
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,238
Did you tell me earlier?

160
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,616
Gosh, why are you always randomly
jumping from topic to topic?

161
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,076
No, I'm not.

162
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,495
To me, there's always a flow.

163
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,956
Make that posture again.

164
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,957
Oh, what was it?

165
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,501
Just like before. Hurry up.

166
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,212
How was the blind date yesterday?

167
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,714
It was fine.

168
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,466
I think I'll meet him again.

169
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,634
We have a similar taste in films.

170
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,804
So we decided to watch one together
next time.

171
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,847
That's great.

172
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,973
Hey, be careful.

173
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,933
-Just do it.
-So what happened to your forehead?

174
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,018
Oh, my forehead?

175
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,352
Yes, that's nice.

176
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,687
Like this?

177
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,938
Yes, just a little more.

178
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,148
-More?
-Yes.

179
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,232
Gosh.

180
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,319
-Like this?
-Yes, that's it.

181
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,778
Like this?

182
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,197
Yes.

183
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,531
Hurry up, then.

184
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,408
It's looking great.

185
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,204
Hey, Bit-na. This is my limit. Hurry up.

186
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,623
Just a few more shots.

187
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,750
What are you trying to make?

188
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,376
-Raise your legs more.
-I'm falling.

189
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,338
-Just a bit more.
-I'm falling, okay? I'm falling.

190
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,714
Just a bit… Hey!

191
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:19,798
Na-bi.

192
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,220
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

193
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,933
Right. I'm going to draw the line.

194
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,392
Yes, I'm fine.

195
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,521
What's up? I'm busy right now.

196
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,316
I just came to see you.

197
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,901
I don't want to be a fool again.

198
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,195
You didn't read my messages.

199
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,448
Did you send me messages?

200
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,658
I didn't see them.

201
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,077
Are you busy?

202
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,788
Don't you have time to eat?

203
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,502
I guess I should eat.

204
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,220
But…

205
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,471
Then let's eat together.

206
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,058
Sure, whatever.

207
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,060
Let's go.

208
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,692
WHERE ARE YOU?
DO YOU WANT TO EAT LUNCH?

209
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,694
What are you doing? Are you sleeping?

210
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,699
I'm sure he does this to everyone.

211
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,742
He's so frivolous.

212
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,828
Where are you?

213
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,590
Home.

214
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,552
PARK JAE-EON

215
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,277
Hello?

216
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,487
What are you doing?

217
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,822
Nothing much.

218
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,282
Why did you call?

219
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,118
I just wanted

220
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,411
to hear your voice.

221
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,079
You're ridiculous.

222
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,456
You always say that.

223
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,708
You always say I'm funny, too.

224
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,878
I really mean it, though.

225
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,255
Jeez.

226
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,134
Don't be ridiculous.

227
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,678
I know everything.

228
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,243
Jae-eon.

229
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,037
Thank you so much.

230
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,872
It's nothing.

231
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,792
Jae-eon.

232
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,086
Would you like to work with me?

233
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,171
Oh, thank you.

234
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,469
We need new part-timers
at our department office.

235
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,971
Just for this semester.

236
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:12,930
Well, I…

237
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,391
Come on. Just think about it.

238
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,894
We need two people.
Min-yeong's luring Na-bi in,

239
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,314
and I want to lure you.

240
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,441
I'll think about it.

241
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,862
Just a little more work. Thanks.

242
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,823
Right. I'll finish up here.

243
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,491
-I'll throw that away.
-Thanks.

244
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,492
Good luck.

245
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,743
Okay.

246
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,503
-I'm hungry.
-Me too.

247
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,006
Hey, Jae-eon! Did you have lunch?

248
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,883
We're going out to eat. Want to join us?

249
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,262
No, I have plans. Enjoy your lunch.

250
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,390
He always says he has plans.

251
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,433
Let's go.

252
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,330
Who is it?

253
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,920
Jae-eon?

254
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,424
What are you doing?

255
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,582
PARK JAE-EON

256
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,598
For the first time in my life,

257
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,892
I had a racy dream.

258
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,896
MISSED CALL
PARK JAE-EON

259
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,439
What?

260
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,609
Darn it. I'm late.

261
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,569
Darn it…

262
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,004
Darn it.

263
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,839
Why did it have to be Jae-eon?

264
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,382
And in my house?

265
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,675
Seriously…

266
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,566
-Hello, sir.
-Yes?

267
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,693
I'm Yu Na-bi from Sculpture.

268
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,445
-Oh, the morning class.
-Yes.

269
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,155
-You had a presentation to do.
-Yes.

270
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,865
Well, I…

271
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,284
I kind of overslept today.

272
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,579
Could I do the presentation
for this class instead?

273
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,334
Since you seemed to have rushed here.

274
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,503
You'll get some points off, though.

275
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,755
All right. Thank you.

276
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,673
Okay.

277
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,650
Darn it.

278
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,487
Where are you?

279
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,824
I'm sure Bit-na is taking this class.

280
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,170
He called me,
but he didn't read my messages?

281
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,047
Whatever.

282
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,306
Na-bi.

283
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,392
Do you take this class too?
Why have I never seen you?

284
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,477
Oh, well…

285
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,938
I usually take the morning class.

286
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,481
I'm only taking this today.

287
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,358
I overslept.

288
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,457
Are you with someone?

289
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,965
I asked Jae-eon to think about
taking the part-time job.

290
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,177
What about Na-bi? Is she in?

291
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,678
I don't know yet.

292
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,473
She said she probably can't do it, though.

293
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:31,933
Really?

294
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,353
Then I told Jae-eon something
I shouldn't have.

295
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,606
I'll just keep quiet for now.

296
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,902
Hello, it's Seong-yun.

297
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,028
Hey.

298
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,490
Mr. An.

299
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,910
I came for my package.

300
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:50,952
Oh, okay.

301
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,539
My goodness. Thank you.

302
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,460
Mr. An. I brought you a dessert.

303
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,212
Hey, you shouldn't have.

304
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,505
It's fine.

305
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,256
Take it.

306
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,051
-I appreciate it.
-Are you kidding me?

307
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,761
Is this the post office or what?

308
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:12,057
The pudding was expensive,
so I could only get one.

309
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,266
I'm really sorry.

310
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,643
Bye, then.

311
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,854
Gyeong-jun.

312
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,650
Receiving packages for the kids
is going too far, don't you think?

313
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,735
It's nothing difficult.

314
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,071
You know what it's like.

315
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,574
It's tough trying to receive packages
without your parents finding out.

316
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,828
It's a huge mess!

317
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,579
Should I tell our professor?

318
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,210
Hello.

319
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,670
Hey, Sol.

320
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:45,549
Have you still not decided on your school?
The professor always asks me that.

321
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,051
No, I haven't yet.

322
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,142
Our professor would obviously
want you to go to an elite university,

323
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,271
but you should choose the one
you really want to go to.

324
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,399
All right. I will. Thanks.

325
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,775
No problem.

326
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,485
-You can talk to me anytime.
-Okay.

327
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,321
Is this a counseling room now?

328
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,289
Did you order a package?

329
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,748
It could be the delivery guy.

330
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,834
-Take the call.
-For God's sake.

331
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,627
All right.

332
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,089
Hello?

333
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,259
Hello. This is Jung Ju-hyeok.

334
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,802
What? Who?

335
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,848
Oh, you asked me to call you.
We met at the cafe.

336
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,061
I'm so sorry.

337
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,647
I'm okay. Are you all right?

338
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,111
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

339
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,489
If you tell me your bank account
and price, I'll send you the money.

340
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,950
Well…

341
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,370
If you're free, could we meet up?

342
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,332
What? In person?

343
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,462
Hang on.

344
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,340
-Bye.
-Bye.

345
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,512
He's obviously trying to hit on her.

346
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,307
Stop being so nosy.

347
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,226
Gosh.

348
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,937
Romance is in the air now.

349
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,939
How adorable.

350
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,565
As you can see now,

351
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:31,446
sometimes a character looks directly
at the camera.

352
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,865
The audience watching the film

353
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,118
would feel like they've locked eyes
with the actor

354
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,787
-and be startled.
-Wake up.

355
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,749
We call this
the "Tension to Camera" method.

356
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,669
-The character points a gun
-What's wrong?

357
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,504
-at the camera
-Are you sick?

358
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,214
or throws a punch…

359
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,384
Why are bad hunches never wrong?

360
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,971
Then the camera shakes.
This is another example of that.

361
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,222
I'll get it.

362
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,600
-No, let me…
-No, I'm the one who dropped it.

363
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,768
I'll get it.

364
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,773
Director François Truffaut.

365
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,192
I'm sure you would've
heard his name before.

366
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:13,530
In the last scene
of the film The 400 Blows,

367
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,242
the boy escapes from the juvenile center
and runs toward the ocean.

368
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,286
I have rotten luck,

369
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,038
-and a zit pops up on my chin.
-And he looks directly…

370
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,542
-It's that day of the month.
-Back then, it was taboo for actors…

371
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,169
ARE YOU COMING?
CAN YOU GET ME A PAD ON YOUR WAY?

372
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,921
Come on, go easy on me.

373
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:30,880
All right.

374
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:31,965
Gosh, seriously!

375
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,009
Darn it.

376
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,435
My stomach still hurts.

377
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,646
Drink that.

378
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,197
I feel a little better now.

379
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,367
Hey!

380
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,537
Gosh, you're going backward.

381
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,873
Let's take a short break.

382
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,131
-Jae-eon! Aren't you going for a smoke?
-Go ahead first.

383
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,799
Do you want to come?

384
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,596
I have to prepare for my presentation.

385
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,181
Oh, you're presenting today?

386
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,891
I should really focus

387
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,185
and clap really loudly.

388
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,979
Go ahead.

389
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,397
What?

390
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,734
Well, your friends are leaving.

391
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,486
Go catch up with them.

392
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,488
Okay.

393
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,700
You sometimes suddenly act cold to me.

394
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,672
I didn't…

395
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,425
Let's go.

396
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,057
What a relief.

397
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,858
Gosh, what is this?

398
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,612
I got totally fooled by this.

399
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,450
You sometimes

400
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,702
suddenly act cold to me.

401
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,788
Gosh, it's really bothering me.

402
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,377
Hello, I'm Sculpture major, Yu Na-bi.

403
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,386
Well…

404
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,559
The film I'm presenting today

405
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,271
is known
as the first science fiction film…

406
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,151
Code red alert.

407
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,486
It's for real this time.

408
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,530
It's…

409
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,913
A Trip to the Moon.

410
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,083
Director Georges Méliès
was also a magician.

411
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,127
"Everyone, having your period

412
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,422
-is nothing to be ashamed of."
-He was praised for his filming methods.

413
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,592
-Yes. That's right.
-Most of all…

414
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,304
At the time, films were not much different
from theater stages.

415
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,681
The director made a unique mise-en-scène

416
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,058
that was different
from reality or theater stages

417
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,102
by applying perspective,
space, distortion--

418
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,479
Wait.

419
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,648
You're talking too fast.

420
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,817
Slow down and speak clearly.

421
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,571
Okay. Well…

422
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,364
But periods are…

423
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,658
disasters.

424
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,829
Hello, I'm Fashion Design major,
Kim Yeong-min.

425
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,084
Disaster victims must evacuate

426
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:58,004
-to a safe zone.
-It is about Nosferatu.

427
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,381
This film is actually an adaptation

428
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,134
of the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker.

429
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,137
He changed the character's names
and some details

430
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,974
to avoid copyright issues
when he made the film.

431
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,270
Yu Na-bi!

432
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,777
Did I do something…

433
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,757
What are you doing?
You said you have a night class.

434
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,217
You'll get cold later.

435
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,095
Should I take it back?

436
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,100
But still, it could get on your--

437
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,309
It's fine.

438
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,855
I feel like crying.

439
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,314
Why did it have to be Jae-eon?

440
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,649
Will you tell…

441
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,362
other people?

442
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,576
Is that what you think of me?

443
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,079
Then if you saw me

444
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,249
suddenly getting a boner during class,

445
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,626
would you tell the others?

446
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,004
That's different, though.

447
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,422
It's not the same,

448
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,966
but would you?

449
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,553
Of course not.

450
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,223
Really?

451
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,934
Of course.

452
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,271
Then I won't, either.

453
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,109
Would someone like him

454
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,362
really be considered frivolous?

455
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:14,307
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.
I WILL GET YOUR CLOTHES…

456
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,654
Did you get home okay?

457
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,951
Do people act like this
to keep someone on the hook?

458
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,912
You read my message right away.
What are you doing?

459
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,924
LAUNDROMAT

460
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,177
We're going to play basketball
and go out for drinks.

461
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,929
You should join us.

462
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,639
Next time. I have plans.

463
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,433
But weren't you wearing a shirt over that?

464
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,268
Where did you put it?

465
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,937
I lent it to my friend.

466
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,980
Friend?

467
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,982
Who was that pretty girl a while ago?

468
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,566
Are you two close?

469
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,276
Did we seem close?

470
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,202
I'm buying art supplies.

471
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,037
What are you doing now?

472
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,959
You said you're just friends.

473
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,505
Gosh. We are just friends.

474
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,842
We did get a bit close, though.

475
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,220
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

476
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,596
Don't change the subject.

477
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,307
Is there something going on?

478
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,144
It's not like that.

479
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,896
I'm just…

480
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,441
not pushing away someone

481
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,444
who's being nice to me.

482
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,114
You're really getting your hopes up.

483
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,744
So you're saying he's treating you
like someone special.

484
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,828
Well…

485
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,414
Maybe.

486
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,625
From what I've seen so far,

487
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,920
the things that made you feel special

488
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,714
might be meaningless to him.

489
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,925
I told you, he's nice to everyone

490
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,594
without any exception.

491
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,598
I don't know.

492
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,476
Maybe.

493
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,023
She has to realize it herself.

494
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,567
Don't blame me later for not warning you!

495
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,949
Are you free tomorrow?

496
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,702
-Don't you have a gathering?
-Jae-eon told you?

497
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,829
I guess you two did grow close.

498
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,457
Did you hear who's coming?

499
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,167
No.

500
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,545
You should come.
All persons of interest are coming.

501
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,049
"Persons of interest?"

502
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,218
It's going to be fun.

503
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,221
And shouldn't you check for yourself?

504
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,765
What?

505
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,559
Whether you're really special
to Jae-eon or not.

506
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,536
"Navi bobo"?

507
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,870
NAVI_BOBO: I LIKE YOUR NEW HAIR

508
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,419
2,432 FOLLOWERS

509
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,511
All of them are girls.

510
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,305
2,432 FOLLOWERS

511
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,648
I want my heart to keep fluttering,

512
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,026
but I keep feeling anxious.

513
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,248
What do I want from Jae-eon?

514
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,114
Right.

515
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,825
I should just check for myself
and forget about him.

516
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,750
Bit-na, I'll join you tomorrow.

517
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,797
Hey, isn't Sol coming today?

518
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,591
She's close to you.

519
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,092
Not really.

520
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,886
She's only close to Ji-wan.

521
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:05,723
And our department ace would never
eat at the same table as us.

522
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,850
You have lunch with her often.

523
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,393
You're so dramatic.

524
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,729
Don't you know what a metaphor is?

525
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,482
What are you, a kid?

526
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,524
Can't you stay still?

527
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,610
He's always been like that.

528
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,613
You're excited thinking
about Sol, aren't you?

529
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,365
Do you have a crush on her?

530
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,409
She's so quick-witted.

531
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,161
Help me out, then.

532
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,455
Take charge of your own love life.

533
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,957
Yun Sol?

534
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,960
She's pretty.

535
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,129
She's also sassy and extremely skilled.

536
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,215
She's totally my style.

537
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,885
-But does she even like guys?
-What are you on about?

538
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,345
I mean,

539
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,806
I've never seen her hang out with guys.

540
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,683
Have you?

541
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,727
I've never seen Gyu-hyun
hang out with girls, either.

542
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,853
Then is he…

543
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,856
Are you?

544
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,985
-What about me? Am I a guy, then?
-Yes.

545
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,778
-You jerk.
-Wait.

546
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,613
-Let me give you a punch.
-Hey, stop.

547
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,075
What are you guys up to?

548
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,451
You haven't quit yet?

549
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,620
I knew it.

550
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,415
It was just a temporary project, anyway.

551
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,709
It was just a temporary project, anyway.

552
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,461
Ji-wan.

553
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,672
What's he up to now?

554
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,217
Can I ask you a favor?

555
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,136
A favor? What is it?

556
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,597
We're going out for drinks today.

557
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,308
Come join us with Sol.

558
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,101
Sol? Why?

559
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,894
Please bring her over.

560
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,855
Let him get rejected so he can shut up.

561
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,940
You have a crush on her?

562
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,942
I think I do.

563
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,155
Help me out, okay?

564
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,074
Come on. Help me get close to her.

565
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,200
Okay?

566
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,202
He's serious.

567
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,038
Well, okay. I'll ask her.

568
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:52,955
Nice.

569
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,666
But she might refuse.
She doesn't enjoy drinking.

570
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,377
I know. I'm pretty sure she won't come.

571
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,046
Okay.

572
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,341
-Let's go.
-You're coming? Really?

573
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,467
Why?

574
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,262
What do you mean? Didn't you want to go?

575
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,722
What?

576
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,600
Oh, right. You're right.

577
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,018
Okay, let's go together.

578
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,020
What's that reaction?

579
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,943
By the way,
what do you think of Yu Se-hun?

580
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,404
What about him?

581
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,282
You're not that interested in him, right?

582
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,703
He seemed pretty funny.

583
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,830
He's funny?

584
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,624
Yes.

585
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,547
Why?

586
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,840
I don't want this.

587
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,387
Se-hun, you look really stylish today.

588
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,724
Hey. This jacket's worth 20 million won.

589
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,976
-Really?
-He's loaded!

590
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,897
-Then buy us a big bowl of stew!
-He could just buy us this place!

591
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,901
-Se-hun!
-Keep it coming!

592
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:04,985
Hey, Na-bi's here.

593
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,570
-Hi, Na-bi.
-Hi, Na-bi.

594
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,655
-Any empty…
-Let's see.

595
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,156
Go over there.

596
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,201
Na-bi. Come sit over here. Come here.

597
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,619
Go sit there.

598
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,496
Come on.

599
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,415
It's been a while.

600
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,209
You're attending gatherings
since you broke up?

601
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,545
You're finally free of that old dude?

602
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,672
She's free!

603
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,215
What's with you?

604
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,259
Did you break up?

605
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,260
You broke up?

606
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,762
Why are you asking that?

607
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,766
Everyone's here except Jae-eon, right?

608
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,185
He's not reading my message.

609
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,728
He always replies late.

610
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,731
Right. He's always
holding his phone, though.

611
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,735
He just reads the alerts and ignores them.

612
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,196
No, he's not that type.

613
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,533
-Where should he sit?
-We can get a chair here.

614
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,954
"Not the dating type"?
It's like he's dating all the girls.

615
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,456
Jae-eon's really popular.

616
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,962
We should add more chairs.

617
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,464
Sol and Ji-wan are coming, too.

618
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,756
Really?

619
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,301
No way. Sol is coming?

620
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,262
Didn't you hear
that Ji-wan's coming as well?

621
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,723
Hang on. Let me get a chair.

622
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,267
It's nice that you never change.

623
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,769
-Why are you putting that next to you?
-Because I want to.

624
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,981
Aren't you taking it off?

625
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,984
What?

626
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,822
Your jacket. Why are you so startled?

627
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,908
What were you thinking?

628
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,993
You take it off too.

629
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,496
I wasn't thinking of anything.

630
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,165
Take off your jackets, guys. It's hot.

631
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,042
-You take it off.
-Oh, that's my water.

632
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,920
Oh, sorry.

633
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,380
-Is there a new cup anywhere?
-It's fine.

634
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,176
You're my senior, right?

635
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:56,180
It's nice to meet you.
I'm a freshman. Kim Eun-han.

636
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,268
We ordered some food already.
Have you tried the seafood stew here?

637
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,020
No, I never tried it.

638
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,605
Do you like seafood?

639
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,732
Yes, I do.

640
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,359
That's a relief.

641
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:12,404
-Hey, go check the order.
-We're selling food at the flea market.

642
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,031
You should come visit our booth.

643
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,991
We killed time with useless conversations,

644
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,535
-but the food wasn't served.
-Please.

645
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,411
Yes, of course.

646
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,746
-When things started to get boring…
-Really?

647
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:21,664
Yes.

648
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,207
-Did he reply?
-No.

649
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,416
…the main character appeared.

650
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,709
It's Jae-eon!

651
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,336
-Hey!
-Why are you so late?

652
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,129
-Jae-eon!
-Hey! What took you so long?

653
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,048
-Look at the time!
-Don't you see what time it is?

654
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,926
-Your pretty face won't cut it.
-Sit over here.

655
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,096
The sexual tension
rises dramatically at his arrival.

656
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,931
-He should drink for being late!
-Why are you late?

657
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,558
Sorry, there was a bit of traffic.

658
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,603
Na-bi, you're here too.

659
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,230
Yes.

660
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,482
He's here, so let's all drink!

661
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,733
-Let's drink!
-Here we go!

662
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,362
-Let's clink and drink!
-Let's clink and drink!

663
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,489
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

664
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,699
Air clink.

665
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,411
This tastes so sweet.

666
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,913
I'm going to drink so much today.

667
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,498
This is spicier than I thought.

668
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,125
-Just eat.
-Here, have some water.

669
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,294
-Where are they going?
-Hey, stop it.

670
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,211
Drink some water.

671
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,338
Thanks.

672
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,424
He's so popular.

673
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,466
It's pretty spicy.

674
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,511
It's so surprising that she came here.

675
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,221
I asked her to join us.

676
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,473
It was that easy?

677
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,059
Gosh, stop it.

678
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,561
-Is it spicy?
-Is it?

679
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,733
Look at you, you're all red.

680
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,362
Aren't girls better at eating spicy food
than guys?

681
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,072
Is that so?

682
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,033
I read somewhere

683
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:43,078
that women naturally endure pain better
since they have to give birth.

684
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,290
And you know, when it's their first time--

685
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,499
What did you say?

686
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,919
Damn it, I'm losing my appetite.

687
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,672
I should report you.

688
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,673
Stop the nonsense.

689
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,175
Hey.

690
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,260
Why do you always cross the line?

691
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,054
What?

692
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,681
Tasting spiciness
is feeling a sense of pain.

693
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,600
Stop treating me like a pervert.

694
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,686
Just wipe your dirty mouth.

695
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,440
Wow. Sol, you're so cool.

696
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,900
Stop it.

697
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,494
Hey!

698
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,081
Here. Have a drink.

699
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,207
You ruined the vibe!

700
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,667
-What have you done?
-Stop talking!

701
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,876
You want to drink something?

702
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,419
-Exactly!
-Do something.

703
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,545
-Yes!
-Let's bring back the vibe.

704
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,963
-Let's go!
-Should we keep it going?

705
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,882
-Keep it going!
-Keep it going!

706
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,218
-This one.
-Zero, zero, seven!

707
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,013
Lime? Is this good?

708
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,349
I don't know. I think you'll like it.

709
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,768
Me?

710
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,395
You said so at the club.

711
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,438
Here.

712
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,817
Is this lime?

713
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,984
I like lime.

714
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,078
You remember that?

715
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,173
It's strange.

716
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,176
Don't people try smoking out of curiosity?

717
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,594
You tried mine before.

718
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,930
What? When?

719
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,350
You always refused when I offered.

720
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,060
I was just curious.

721
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,354
Forget it. I feel so hurt now.

722
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,565
Na-bi,

723
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,067
you look like you're in a good mood.

724
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,240
What do you mean?

725
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,118
You looked a bit upset
so I thought you weren't feeling well.

726
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,079
I was uncomfortable with too many people.

727
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,124
Right. You're shy with strangers.

728
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,542
Even with me?

729
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,088
You weren't like that before.
You smiled all the time.

730
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,673
I thought you were angry.

731
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:03,260
Gosh. Why are you showing
so much interest in her today?

732
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:05,888
What?

733
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,391
Is there something going on
between you two?

734
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,976
It seems like it.

735
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,770
I did think it was strange.

736
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:14,730
It's…

737
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,190
It's nothing like that.

738
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,109
Don't lie to me.

739
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,986
I can tell by your expressions.
Aren't I right?

740
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,864
What's with you? There's nothing going on.

741
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,200
Right?

742
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,872
Yes.

743
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,790
Right.

744
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,292
No?

745
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,919
That's strange.

746
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,296
Didn't you keep looking at him, Na-bi?

747
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,757
You kept looking at him.

748
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,634
I'm going to the bathroom.

749
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,595
I'll come with you. Damn it.

750
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,100
He doesn't know how you feel,

751
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,228
so he said that in case
it would get awkward.

752
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,063
Forget it.

753
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,065
If that was really the case,

754
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:02,236
he would've just changed the subject
or said something vague.

755
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,323
Right?

756
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,826
I'm sure he didn't say that just for me.

757
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,621
He just drew the line.

758
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,790
Hey, don't say it like that.

759
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,793
-You're overreacting.
-Didn't you know this would happen?

760
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,086
What's with the pep talk?

761
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,047
Well, I thought maybe
I was being too harsh.

762
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,550
It's not like I can read his mind.

763
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,094
Plus, he kept looking at you.

764
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,348
No way. He was busy chatting with Yun-ji.

765
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:35,143
No! He kept glancing at you
whenever you spoke.

766
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,312
And most importantly,

767
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,526
he doesn't do stuff like this.

768
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,158
Bit-na, this is just a 3,000 won drink.

769
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,536
Anyway, this is different.

770
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,039
Honestly, I wasn't sure
when I heard your side of the story,

771
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,834
but seeing it in person,
I can sense something.

772
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,924
Are you going to stay?

773
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,593
No. I want to go home.

774
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,345
Let's go to your place with Jae-eon.

775
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,806
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

776
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,308
I'll come with you!

777
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,310
We can't waste an opportunity like this.

778
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,146
But still…

779
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,358
Forget it. I'm going to go home.

780
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,610
I don't feel like it.

781
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,154
Let's at least ask him.

782
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,322
Goodness.

783
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,199
There's really nothing going on
between you two?

784
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,869
I know. You said you don't date.

785
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,289
It seems like she's hitting on you
without knowing that.

786
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,084
She was acting like she's all that
because she's a bit pretty.

787
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,794
Serves her right.

788
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:46,548
Min-sang, don't say stuff about people
you can't say to their faces.

789
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,091
-What?
-You're badmouthing her

790
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,676
just because you can't have her.

791
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,386
It's pathetic.

792
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,846
What did you just say?

793
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,598
I'm telling you to watch your mouth.

794
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:01,438
You asshole. You just said there was
nothing going on between you and Na-bi.

795
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,566
-Hey, where were you?
-Pajeon must be out.

796
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,485
Come on, or I'll eat everything.

797
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,986
Yes, I'm coming.

798
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,990
Let's go eat.

799
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,455
Jae-eon seems totally unbothered.

800
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,585
Don't worry about him.

801
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,631
-What?
-He goes around talking about me, too.

802
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,634
Like what?

803
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,928
That you don't date?

804
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,308
Do people have to date?

805
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,645
Not necessarily.

806
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,480
Right?

807
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,235
I have a friend who doesn't date either.

808
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,863
But unlike you, he's a bit cold.

809
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:52,864
Especially to girls.

810
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,909
Why can't two people

811
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,495
just be close?

812
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,540
Can't they look at each other

813
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,084
or stand near each other?

814
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,885
Do they have to pretend not to notice

815
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,555
if there's something in their hair?

816
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,394
That's not what I mean.

817
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,438
Right?

818
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,773
It's nice to get along well.

819
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,653
"Is that really all?"

820
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,364
But I didn't ask him that.

821
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,158
Who wants to go for another round?

822
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,702
Me!

823
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,203
-Just go home.
-You go!

824
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,496
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

825
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,582
Are you going?

826
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,459
-Well…
-Jae-eon, are you going?

827
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,170
Well, if everyone's going…

828
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,963
I have other plans.

829
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,132
What? Is it important?

830
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,425
It's just a friend.

831
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:58,263
Today seems like a perfect day
to get rid of my feelings.

832
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,271
What is it?

833
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:10,066
I'm wondering if I should
see my friend or join the others.

834
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,359
What about you?

835
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,572
But I…

836
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,992
Well…

837
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,120
Bit-na and I are going to drink
at my house.

838
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,205
Do you want to come?

839
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,044
I give up that chance

840
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,546
and decide to become a fun girl.

841
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,882
National!

842
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,967
-Singing Contest!
-Singing Contest!

843
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,932
All right. "Love."

844
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,308
-"Love"?
-"Love."

845
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,643
I've fallen in love

846
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,604
-I've fallen in love
-I've fallen in love

847
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,440
Love, love, love, my love

848
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,900
You don't know?

849
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,778
Come here, my love

850
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,280
-You don't know this?
-Keep going. What's wrong?

851
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,949
We won't accept that. Drink up.

852
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,867
-Drink.
-But I…

853
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,412
-Drink up.
-I'll drink it for you.

854
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,373
What was that?

855
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,332
All right.

856
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,251
Keep it going

857
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,710
-Keep it going!
-Keep it going!

858
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,420
Let's do the Alphabet Game.

859
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,631
-"L"!
-"L"?

860
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,967
Lion.

861
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,510
Leaf.

862
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,594
I got it. Lie!

863
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,012
Love.

864
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,349
Oh, me! Left!

865
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,851
Life.

866
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,269
Long.

867
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,395
Gosh, what do I do?

868
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,855
-Only the two of you left.
-Wait. Let me think.

869
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,022
What do I do?

870
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,401
I know! Lust!

871
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,238
-Oh, come on!
-What? It starts with "L"!

872
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,573
Yes, you're right. Fine.

873
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,532
Gosh.

874
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:44,536
All right. Then Na-bi is the loser!

875
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,705
You have to drink the whole glass

876
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,040
-in one go. Here.
-In one go.

877
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,042
Who's going to drink?

878
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,753
-Yu Na-bi is going to drink!
-Yu Na-bi is going to drink!

879
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,799
The two people
the bottle points to have to kiss!

880
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,385
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

881
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,972
-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!

882
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,600
-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!

883
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,647
-Oh, my gosh!
-What the hell?

884
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,066
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

885
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,776
All right. Be quiet.

886
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,987
-What? You're going to do it?
-Are you?

887
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,655
Okay, move over.

888
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,618
What? Really?

889
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,999
Let me do it properly.

890
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,254
Wait. I think I'm bleeding.

891
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,881
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm bleeding. But it's okay.

892
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,215
Your braces?

893
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,551
This is crazy!

894
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,552
No way!

895
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:46,848
-That's crazy!
-That's crazy!

896
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,975
Guys, be quiet.

897
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,519
The neighbors will complain.

898
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,356
Hey, keep it down.

899
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,817
What?

900
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,235
I told you to be quiet.

901
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,487
Sorry.

902
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,404
Yes?

903
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:05,742
Excuse me.

904
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,289
Don't you know how late it is?
Please be quiet.

905
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,291
You're being way too loud.

906
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,168
I'm sorry.

907
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,170
You have neighbors, you know.

908
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:21,800
I have some friends over, so…

909
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,261
We'll be careful.

910
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,224
We're taking an exam tomorrow.

911
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,600
Oh, really?

912
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,979
Then we'll silently pray for you
to get a good score.

913
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,563
Thank you.

914
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,733
We'll trust that you'll be quiet.
Bye, then.

915
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,444
-Bye.
-I'm sorry.

916
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,631
You were like a couple.

917
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,799
Be quiet.

918
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,385
-Stop playing drinking games.
-We can't stop!

919
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,512
-Come on.
-Come on!

920
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,848
Let's not stop!
Let's spin it one more time!

921
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,141
Spin it!

922
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,642
-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!

923
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,853
-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!

924
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,604
Just a little more.

925
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,732
-It's me!
-Yes!

926
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,984
-It's me!
-What are you talking about?

927
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,277
It's me.

928
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,279
-Sol. Come here.
-What?

929
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,072
-You're going to do it?
-She must be drunk.

930
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,949
You're really going to kiss her?

931
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,493
-Hey.
-Sit back down.

932
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,037
Sit down.

933
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,121
Come on!

934
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,622
Gosh.

935
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,624
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

936
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,917
I'm going out for a smoke.

937
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,004
-What about me?
-She left because of you.

938
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,589
Be quiet.

939
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,258
JUNG JU-HYEOK

940
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,342
This is Sol's.

941
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,303
Hey, Sol!

942
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,554
Hey.

943
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,599
Jung Ju-hyeok? Who is this guy?

944
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,600
Jung Ju-hyeok?

945
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,726
Yes.

946
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,811
That's not important right now. Spin!

947
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:57,979
Spin!

948
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,524
-Spin, spin, spin!
-Spin, spin, spin!

949
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,877
Did you plan this in advance?

950
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,589
What does this make us look like?

951
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,883
You kissed by choice, that's all.

952
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,010
Forget it. Let's go for a smoke.

953
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,053
Let's go.

954
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,429
I'm exhausted.

955
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,472
My legs hurt.

956
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,517
-My gosh.
-Gosh, my legs.

957
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,893
Hey, I'm wearing your shoes!

958
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,436
Oh, my back.

959
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,729
My shoes.

960
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,731
-I'll be back later, Na-bi.
-Okay.

961
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:43,858
Sol!

962
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,486
You're smoking too?

963
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,446
Yes. But who's Jung Ju-hyeok?

964
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,406
He just called you.

965
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,784
What? Oh.

966
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,119
Just someone I know.

967
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,453
Someone you know?

968
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,580
I thought I knew everyone you knew.

969
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,832
You don't.

970
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,796
It's cold outside.

971
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,596
What were you doing?

972
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,640
Just taking a walk.

973
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,433
Your place is so nice.

974
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,852
My aunt used to live here.

975
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,315
Why did you make things
so hard for yourself?

976
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,736
I know, right?

977
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,829
Hey…

978
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:41,708
Sol is so beautiful up close.

979
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,252
She's a goddess.

980
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,879
We get it, so just tell her!

981
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,006
Please stop torturing us!

982
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,967
Ji-wan.

983
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,636
What type of guy does Sol like?

984
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,472
He's driving me crazy.

985
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,183
I don't want to tell you.

986
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,434
You don't want to tell me?

987
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,102
What?

988
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,397
Why? You said you'd help me.

989
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,149
She doesn't seem to know, either.

990
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,234
There's no way.

991
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,069
Who else would know, then?

992
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,656
Sol…

993
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,117
Yes?

994
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,370
She hates boring guys like you.

995
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:22,790
Come on. I'm nothing but fun.

996
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,584
If you took the fun part out of me,

997
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,462
I'd be a zombie. Right?

998
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,005
Don't smoke so much.

999
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,507
But where's Jae-eon?

1000
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,091
I don't know. Is he inside?

1001
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,302
You're totally ignoring me.

1002
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,555
He must be on his phone.
He's always calling someone.

1003
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,016
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Yun-ji, either.

1004
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,687
Did those two leave together?

1005
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:48,399
Call them. Come on.

1006
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,860
Let's go find them.

1007
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,910
Where did he go?

1008
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,121
What?

1009
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,457
What? It's nothing.

1010
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,043
Can I borrow some sweatpants?

1011
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,087
Sure. I'll get them.

1012
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:10,838
Let me use the bathroom.

1013
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,266
That tickles!

1014
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,113
Stop it.

1015
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,118
It tickles!

1016
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,796
Gosh, that startled me.

1017
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,968
This is so embarrassing.

1018
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,431
Listen.

1019
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:06,060
I know this is shameless of me,
but can you keep this a secret?

1020
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,604
Please don't tell the others.

1021
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:14,235
All right. I won't.

1022
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,445
Thank you so much.

1023
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,404
Thank you.

1024
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,615
All right. I get it.

1025
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:22,535
-Now go on.
-I won't let go of this hand.

1026
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,162
Okay, don't. Just go.

1027
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,788
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

1028
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:26,748
I'm sorry.

1029
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,499
-When did you…
-I'll tell you later.

1030
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,168
Let's go.

1031
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,846
I must've been crazy.
How could I have thought he was Jae-eon?

1032
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,572
What? That's it?

1033
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,415
Just tell me if you're not up for it.

1034
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,793
It's not like that.

1035
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,587
Go inside first. I need to make a call.

1036
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,246
It was just a game.

1037
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,041
I guess she wanted to try it.

1038
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,755
You don't need to explain.

1039
01:01:58,881 --> 01:01:59,841
What about you?

1040
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,095
Didn't you want to try it?

1041
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:07,807
Why would I?

1042
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:10,768
Not at all.

1043
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,235
I wanted to do it with you.

1044
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,659
What?

1045
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,301
I thought…

1046
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,304
you felt the same way.

1047
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:20,630
I won't do it if you don't want to.

1048
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,744
Sorry.

1049
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,149
Just like that,

1050
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,238
the gates of hell have opened.

1051
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,290
Jae-eon still isn't contacting me.

1052
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,834
How are your butterflies doing?

1053
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,002
I'm going to set them free.

1054
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:26,881
They're supposed to be free,
but they're locked up because of me.

1055
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:31,719
I hope it's just love.
Not childish jealousy.

1056
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:34,347
You know that he only hurts other people.

1057
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,473
Were you two close?

1058
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,600
Yes. We're close.

1059
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:38,976
Closer than you and me, anyway.

1060
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,854
That kind of presence
only comes naturally.

1061
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,065
Some people are gifted like that.

1062
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,609
Then what kind of person am I to him?

1063
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,653
Do you want to meet right now?

1064
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:49,779
Why are you doing this to me?

1065
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,906
I've been attracted to you

1066
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,032
from the beginning.

1067
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,201
What is this emotion?

1068
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:56,786
Could it be…

1069
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,582
