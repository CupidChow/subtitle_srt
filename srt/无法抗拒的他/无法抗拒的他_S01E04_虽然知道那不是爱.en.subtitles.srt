1
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,519
This is crazy.

2
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,564
But it was so good.

3
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,069
I want to keep sleeping like this.

4
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,695
Me too.

5
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,074
Should we skip school?

6
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,538
At least if I was drunk,
I could have used that as an excuse.

7
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:11,339
EPISODE 4: I KNOW IT ISN'T LOVE.
NEVERTHELESS,

8
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,224
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

9
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,601
Where's the hair dryer?

10
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,479
-Darn it.
-Let's talk.

11
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,483
Hey, put your clothes on!

12
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,739
I must have alcohol-related dementia.

13
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,742
I don't remember what happened yesterday.

14
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,412
-So--
-It was a mistake?

15
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,621
What?

16
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,296
Yes. Honestly, we both
made a mistake while drunk, right?

17
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,216
So there's nothing to change between us.

18
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,135
Don't you think?

19
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm leaving.

20
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,515
Hey! Wait!

21
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,148
Darn it! I must have lost my mind!

22
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,192
Why did it have to be him?

23
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,454
Is that mine?

24
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,041
Yes. I washed it.

25
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,085
It's fine, you can have it.

26
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,838
Or just throw it away.

27
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,342
Right.
I'm going to have breakfast outside.

28
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,177
Outside?

29
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,470
By myself.

30
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,849
Oh, right. I get it.

31
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,560
I should get some more sleep.

32
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,479
Go ahead.

33
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,777
I want to keep seeing you.

34
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,696
What about you?

35
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,907
This is it.

36
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,283
What do you mean?

37
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,660
Should we meet up sometimes?

38
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,247
So he's asking if I want to meet up

39
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,917
and sleep with him sometimes

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,669
without dating?

41
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,963
I'm not sure.

42
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,507
Think about it and tell me.

43
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,178
I'll be off. Go to the hospital
if you're not feeling well. Okay?

44
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,264
Okay.

45
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,290
Park Jae-eon?

46
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,684
-It wasn't a mistake for me.
-What?

47
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,937
And things won't be the same
for me, either.

48
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,773
So I don't think I can pretend
it didn't happen.

49
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,072
What if you don't?

50
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:27,035
I don't think I can stay friends
with you now.

51
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,494
Then what?

52
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,915
-You don't mean…
-Be my girlfriend.

53
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,300
Hey! You…

54
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,681
You want to date because we slept
together once? You're overreacting.

55
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,974
Do you like me?

56
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,189
See? You can't answer that.

57
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,692
Plus, I really don't want to date
within such a small department.

58
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,235
Rumors will spread so quickly.

59
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,987
It's going to be really irritating.

60
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,701
All right.

61
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,164
I understand how you feel,
so I'll take care of my own feelings.

62
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,085
What do you mean? Hey!

63
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,383
The guy Sol brought over last night.
Was he her boyfriend?

64
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,552
I don't know.

65
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,514
Jeez!

66
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,225
You're the only one who'd know!

67
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,477
Who is he? Is it…

68
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,065
Is it serious?

69
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,984
Ask her yourself.

70
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,946
I don't care who she dates.

71
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,405
This is so annoying.

72
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,991
What? Did you two fight?

73
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,497
Right. You didn't know about
Sol leaving as an exchange student too.

74
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,084
We didn't fight. That's just
the extent of our relationship.

75
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,128
I'm going.

76
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,268
Seo Ji-wan.

77
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,813
Ji-wan. Ji-wan!

78
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,107
Let me talk to you.

79
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,487
Fine. Talk.
What do you want to talk about first?

80
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,365
Going abroad? Or your boyfriend?

81
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,659
Everyone knew except me.

82
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,369
I was going to tell you.

83
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,872
Right. When were you going to tell me?

84
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,624
The day before you left?
The day before you got married?

85
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,502
What's with you?
You said you don't care who I date.

86
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,087
Right. I don't.

87
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,756
I'm just angry because
you're leaving me out like this.

88
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,759
-When did I leave you out--
-You've always done this.

89
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,597
You never tell me important things
about yourself. You know that?

90
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,058
Like what?

91
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,159
I guess this really is the extent
of our relationship.

92
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,435
Thanks.

93
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,647
What's your next class?

94
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,234
Human Anatomy. It's so hard.

95
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,903
I got an A in that class.

96
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,321
-Really?
-Yes.

97
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,282
-Then help me study.
-What will you do for me, then?

98
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,455
What should I do for you?

99
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,959
Jeez…

100
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,924
By the way…

101
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,010
Well…

102
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:18,349
I don't want anyone to know about us.

103
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,520
All right.

104
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,189
-Okay.
-Okay.

105
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,317
And…

106
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,528
Well…

107
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,446
You don't…

108
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:38,494
have any diseases or anything, do you?

109
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,790
Do you?

110
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,212
Don't laugh! I'm serious.

111
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,507
I don't, so don't worry.

112
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,136
Okay.

113
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,264
Do you have time later?

114
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,893
Yes, I have some time.

115
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,396
No, should we meet on Saturday?

116
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,691
You need to rest the next day, right?

117
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,779
No. It's totally fine.

118
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,317
Why did I do that? I acted so impulsively.

119
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,487
I must've lost my mind.

120
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,244
I should just tell him not to come.

121
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,679
-Come in.
-Hey.

122
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,604
What's with the alcohol?

123
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,941
It'll be nice to drink together.

124
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,317
It'll be fun.

125
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,737
Oh, I drank some already.

126
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,490
I couldn't do this sober.

127
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,827
This is cheating.

128
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,286
What do you mean?

129
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,040
We didn't decide on anything.

130
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,210
Decide what?

131
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,755
Weren't we going to study
Human Anatomy together?

132
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,925
Oh, right.

133
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,845
Right. Human Anatomy.

134
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,015
Yes. We should study.

135
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,022
Stop laughing.

136
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,317
I have a gift for you.

137
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,330
Jae-eon is too smooth with everything.

138
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,626
It's like everything
comes naturally to him.

139
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,712
All done.

140
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,800
Do you like it?

141
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,511
Yes.

142
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,973
It's pretty.

143
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,227
It'll be prettier
with the sunlight in the morning.

144
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,534
Like this was always
going to happen between us.

145
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,458
You got me again.

146
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,757
Hang on.

147
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,555
PARK JAE-EON

148
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,559
You saved my number.

149
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,859
I can stop this right now.

150
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,657
Because there are so many reasons
why I shouldn't do this.

151
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,621
But…

152
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,230
You know, you have a mole here.

153
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,107
Where?

154
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,109
Here.

155
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,155
I didn't know.

156
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,997
You look even more pretty today.

157
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,875
I'm still attracted to him,
even at this moment.

158
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,420
Like crazy.

159
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,610
That one simple reason

160
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,488
buries all my concerns again.

161
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,706
Didn't it hurt when you got that tattoo
behind your neck?

162
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,419
Of course, it hurt.

163
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,213
I almost died.

164
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,842
I thought of quitting in the middle.

165
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,057
I'm going to get another one soon.

166
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,351
Where?

167
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,065
Around here.

168
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,444
Another butterfly?

169
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,570
Yes.

170
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,909
A butterfly with lots of black spots
on its wings.

171
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,369
The name's pretty difficult.

172
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,623
Taiwanese black-star hairstreak butterfly.

173
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,168
Taiwan…

174
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,837
That's a really long name.

175
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,010
They eat flowers instead of leaves

176
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,638
when they're caterpillars.

177
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,057
It's unique, right?

178
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:17,935
Yes.

179
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,314
Since that day, a lot of things
have changed between us.

180
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,360
And Jae-eon slowly seeped into my life.

181
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,117
Get washed.

182
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,877
I'm starting work
at the department office.

183
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,880
You decided to do that? Aren't you busy?

184
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,925
I won't work that long. Just for a while.

185
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,513
It's because of you.

186
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,934
Why?

187
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,229
Come visit often.

188
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,399
-Why would I?
-What?

189
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,569
Come visit me.

190
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,031
All right?

191
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,240
Why would I?

192
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,994
Okay, I will.

193
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,879
Jae-eon, where's that suncatcher
you made last time?

194
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,380
The butterfly-shaped one.

195
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,049
Oh, that?

196
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,509
I gifted it to someone.

197
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,055
That's too bad. I wanted to see it
when it was finished.

198
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,058
-Can you tell us how to make it?
-Tell us!

199
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,393
Learn that from
the Ceramics and Glass students.

200
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,437
Jae-eon is mine now.

201
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,607
What are you talking about?

202
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,692
Darn it! You're so noisy.

203
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,738
If you're done, please just leave.

204
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,075
-Guys, get out.
-Okay.

205
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,160
-Bye.
-Bye.

206
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,333
I heard he doesn't date,
but I guess he has a girlfriend.

207
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,710
I wonder who it is.
She must be really pretty.

208
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,896
-It's raining a lot.
-It is.

209
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,741
-Don't do it.
-I have to do this!

210
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,077
Stop working. Let's just sleep.

211
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,954
-Already?
-Yes.

212
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,916
-Already?
-Yes. I'm sleepy.

213
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:58,679
Our relationship only exists
at night, but…

214
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,932
Are you washing the dishes?

215
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,185
Yes. It seems like you don't do the dishes
when I'm coming.

216
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,020
You caught me.

217
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,898
I think you're pretty good at housework.

218
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,484
Will you do the laundry too?

219
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,237
-Should I?
-Yes.

220
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,408
-Then let's do it together.
-No. I don't want to do it.

221
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,078
It sometimes felt like we were lovers.

222
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,372
What's your goal today?

223
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,502
Really? Can you do it?

224
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,047
Don't strain yourself.

225
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,054
What was that?

226
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,602
My tongue gets numb when I eat this.

227
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,604
So I kissed you first.

228
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,773
Jae-eon is still a mystery to me.

229
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,233
What are you on about?

230
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,526
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

231
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,362
Here.

232
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,329
You said your tongue gets numb.
This is good, though.

233
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,955
-Really?
-Yes.

234
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,254
Just eat.

235
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,678
-It's good, right?
-Yes. It's tastier today.

236
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,079
I can't tell if he's warm or cold,

237
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,499
serious or joking.

238
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,099
Are you done with assignments?

239
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,934
No.

240
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,687
Go sleep at your house.

241
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,817
I can't just leave.

242
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,333
My anxiety about Jae-eon
hasn't disappeared, but…

243
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,555
We're much more compatible than I thought.

244
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,604
So the transverse arch

245
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,690
can be seen the best from the front.

246
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,901
I see. You're right.

247
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,488
This is the transverse arch?

248
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,032
Yes.

249
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,452
And this is the medial longitudinal arch.

250
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,331
-Yes.
-This is the lateral longitudinal arch.

251
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,291
Correct.

252
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,379
-What about this?
-Stop. It tickles.

253
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,672
Stop.

254
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,674
I'm studying right now.

255
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,093
What about this?

256
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,137
Hey, it tickles.

257
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,772
And I enjoy

258
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,232
spending nights with him.

259
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,451
Thank you.

260
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,872
-It looks delicious.
-I want corn.

261
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,290
I thought you were on a diet.

262
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:58,627
-That's why I'm only eating the shrimp.
-Oh, is that right?

263
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,424
Are you dating someone these days?

264
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,051
Me?

265
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,263
No. Why?

266
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,142
You just seem to be in a good mood
these days.

267
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,812
Your face seems to be glowing a bit.

268
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,273
I've been sleeping well.

269
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,280
I mean, I've been getting lots of sleep.

270
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,119
Right. Sleeping is the best way
to improve the condition of your skin.

271
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,289
Oh, right!
Gyu-hyun, would you like a blind date?

272
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,878
A blind date? With who?

273
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,296
My high school friend.

274
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,049
She saw a photo of you on social media,
and she wants to meet you.

275
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,427
She hasn't been dating for a while,
so she's always saying she's lonely.

276
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,929
Tell your friend

277
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,807
that seeing any guy just because
she's lonely won't end well.

278
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,977
Lonely people will be lonely
even if they date someone.

279
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,395
And I think

280
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,273
that if you're in a relationship,

281
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:05,360
you have a kind of duty
not to make the other feel lonely.

282
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,070
You're right about that.

283
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,280
Today?

284
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,073
Let me see her photo.

285
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,867
All right.

286
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,868
Let me see.

287
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,662
-She's pretty.
-Do you like her?

288
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,997
Introduce me to her.

289
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,499
Should I give you her number, then?

290
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,209
She likes you.

291
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,921
I'm not going to give you what you want.

292
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,218
So are you interested?

293
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,391
-Send me her number.
-No way. She's going to be so happy.

294
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,311
-Come on, eat.
-I don't feel like it.

295
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,272
BRING ICE CREAM
OKAY

296
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,274
-Can I eat the shrimp, then?
-Just eat it.

297
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,947
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

298
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,366
-Bow.
-Hello. And then…

299
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,037
-Take one step forward.
-One step forward.

300
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,955
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

301
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,000
-Are you really okay?
-Yes. I'm fine.

302
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,418
Let's try it again.

303
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,465
Grab each other's hands…

304
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,134
-Go.
-Go.

305
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,470
-One, two.
-One, two.

306
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,764
-Turn.
-Three, four.

307
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,849
-One, two.
-All right.

308
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,352
-Here.
-Now? Oh, my gosh.

309
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,980
Are you okay?

310
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,066
You're going to break my feet soon.

311
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,694
Should I just give up?

312
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,571
I got scammed by Bit-na.

313
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,823
She said this class was really easy.

314
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,702
Do you really think it's her fault?

315
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,623
Let's try it just once more.

316
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,417
You seemed to have potential,
from what I saw at the club.

317
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,503
Forget it. Stop teasing me.

318
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:51,341
Why are you so good at dancing, though?
Did you learn this before?

319
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,093
Or are you a natural?

320
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,970
I'm not sure.

321
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,888
My mom's a dancer.

322
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,724
Really? Does she still dance?

323
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,317
Do you have time this Sunday?

324
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,904
Sunday? Well…

325
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,448
Today's Friday, though.

326
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,159
What?

327
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,746
Do you think I'm a sex maniac?

328
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,331
Then what is it?

329
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,502
There's an exhibit that ends this weekend.
I thought we'd go together.

330
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,878
Oh, that?

331
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,382
I did want to go…

332
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,717
Should we go together?

333
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,888
I'll think about it…

334
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,474
Let's go together, okay?

335
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,834
He probably doesn't even know
what day it is.

336
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,545
I'm weird for thinking about this.

337
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,259
AUNTIE

338
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,934
Auntie. Did you pull an all-nighter again?

339
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,770
I should work as hard as you.

340
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,272
I'm used to this anyway.

341
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,858
Are you going to your mom's this Sunday?

342
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,361
It's your birthday,
so I was thinking of visiting.

343
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,946
You don't need to come.
It'll only be tiring for you.

344
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,366
I'll visit you once the semester is over.

345
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,785
Do you want anything as a present, then?

346
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,037
I'll get you anything you want.

347
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,416
Gosh, I wish you were my mom.

348
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,712
You're lucky because you have
both your mom and your aunt.

349
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:01,805
You should spend your birthday with
the person you want to be with the most.

350
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,103
The person I want to be with?

351
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,832
Hi. I just finished. I'll be there soon.

352
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,380
This looks good.

353
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,718
Hello.

354
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,929
Jae-eon just left.

355
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:47,100
What? Oh, I just came to apply
for late-night work.

356
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,146
-Did you eat?
-Come sit. You can eat with us.

357
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,022
We ordered three servings.

358
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,399
All right.

359
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,165
Do you have something to say?

360
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,335
Well…

361
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,757
Would it be weird to spend your birthday
with someone you're not dating?

362
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,968
Then you're getting to know each other?

363
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,263
It's not like that.

364
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,849
But if you do everything else…

365
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,518
Do everything else? What do you mean?

366
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,817
Oh, then I'd say no. A birthday gift would
be fine, but spending the day together…

367
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,903
That's a bit too much.

368
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,947
Right?

369
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,117
-Do you love him?
-What?

370
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,997
No, I wasn't talking about myself.
It's about my friend.

371
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,626
-Does she love him?
-You're always going on about love.

372
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,586
That's not a good relationship.

373
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,506
You're sure to regret it soon.

374
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,509
Tell your friend to use birth control.

375
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,137
Okay.

376
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,188
Do you still have the butterflies?

377
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,566
Yes. We're getting along very well.

378
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,986
You said you'll let them go.

379
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,865
Did I say that?

380
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,456
I thought about it,
and I guess you were right.

381
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,835
About what?

382
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,921
Your butterflies.

383
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,592
You said you were keeping them
from their freedom.

384
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,846
I think you're right.

385
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,142
There's a huge world
just outside the glass.

386
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,728
You're giving them false hope.

387
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,315
Did I say that?

388
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,485
But…

389
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,072
I don't want to let go. Not yet.

390
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,116
Then at least be good to them.

391
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,703
You know what your problem is, right?
You torment the things you like.

392
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,126
Hang on.

393
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,044
YU NA-BI

394
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,631
Can you talk right now?

395
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,509
Yes. What is it?

396
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,386
I just called to say

397
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,140
that I can't come with you to the exhibit
this weekend.

398
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,851
I'm going to see my mom.

399
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,603
Really?

400
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,855
That's too bad.

401
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,899
Sorry. You can go with someone else.

402
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,567
All right.

403
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,403
Is there anything else?

404
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,449
No, that's it. Bye, then.

405
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,726
Na-bi?

406
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,190
Yu Na-bi?

407
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,235
Do-hyeok?

408
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,196
Yes.

409
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,616
Yang Do-hyeok?

410
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,536
Hey, it's been such a long time!

411
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,331
Has it been about 10 years?

412
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,709
That's right. I thought I'd never
get to see you again.

413
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,213
Me too. What are the chances?

414
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,007
-Are you living in Seoul?
-Yes.

415
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,677
I'm learning to cook here
after military service.

416
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,637
You're cooking? Like your grandpa?

417
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:57,100
I'm working at a noodle place
at Hongseo University Intersection.

418
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,727
Hongseo University Intersection?

419
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,314
-I know that place.
-What?

420
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,567
I never went there before,
but my friends said it was good.

421
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,069
Really?

422
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,363
You should come sometime.

423
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,240
All right, I will.

424
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,454
Do-hyeok, I have to get off.

425
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,291
Hey, Na-bi. Here.

426
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,335
Can you give me your number?

427
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,212
Oh, right.

428
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,589
Of course.

429
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,594
Here.

430
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,972
Oh, my gosh!

431
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,728
Oh, no.

432
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,816
Are you getting off?

433
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,153
-Sir, just a minute!
-It's fine. Go.

434
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,822
Sorry, I should go.

435
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,764
It's raining.

436
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,726
I'll take you to where you're going.

437
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,146
What about your potatoes?

438
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,907
That's so funny.

439
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,664
How are the others?
I'm curious how they're doing.

440
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,875
Some came to Seoul like you.

441
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,586
I only keep in touch with a few of them.

442
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,214
I see.

443
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,343
I thought we'd all keep in touch
back then.

444
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,598
I know. It would've been nice
if we had kept meeting up often.

445
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,060
What about the noodle place?

446
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,479
Your grandpa's noodles were amazing.

447
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,440
He's not doing so well,
so it's closed for now.

448
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,401
I'm preparing to run it again.

449
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,363
Then you'll run it by yourself?

450
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,405
For now.

451
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,450
Just until my grandpa feels better.

452
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,037
I can't open it right away,

453
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,081
but I'm learning bit by bit.

454
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,791
You're so cool.

455
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,461
You made a big decision.
I'm sure your grandpa will be happy.

456
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,048
I'm not sure. He always nags me
about how I'm not that reliable.

457
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,843
I'm sure he's proud of you, though.

458
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,057
You should come visit when I open it.
We have a guest house,

459
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,727
and it'll be fun to hang out together.

460
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,731
Sure, of course. I will.

461
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,234
We're here.
I just have to turn the corner here.

462
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,319
Oh, really?

463
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,451
Oh, no. You're all wet.

464
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,744
-My gosh.
-It's fine.

465
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,122
You should have said so.

466
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:12,211
It's so nice to see you again.

467
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,637
Thanks for walking me home.
I should go inside.

468
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,599
Right. Take this.

469
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,268
-No, it's fine!
-I can just use my hood.

470
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,899
Hey, Na-bi. Is it…

471
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,944
Is it okay if I message you?

472
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,988
Sure.

473
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,532
Go inside, then.

474
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,309
Ttoli!

475
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,144
Ttoli!

476
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,898
Hey, it's been a long time.

477
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,373
Mom.

478
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,625
Mom?

479
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:40,800
I thought you'd come in the evening.
Why did you come so early?

480
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,513
Stay in your room.

481
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,934
Or why don't you go for a walk with Ttoli?

482
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,103
Come on. Hurry.

483
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,355
Go walk Ttoli, okay? Come on.

484
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,107
Go, Ttoli.

485
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,070
You're neglecting me again.

486
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,613
What?

487
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,449
He's going to leave soon.

488
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,618
Just stay in your room.

489
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,918
-You went to the signing event, right?
-Yes.

490
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,920
-Did you take photos?
-I couldn't!

491
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,006
You should have taken photos.

492
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,550
I know. But he was so handsome.

493
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,470
-Did you shake his hand?
-Of course!

494
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,597
And you went to the concert, right?

495
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,682
-Was it fun?
-I watched from the front row.

496
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,309
It was amazing.

497
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,648
There was a time
when all I cared about were friends.

498
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,192
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

499
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,320
Happy birthday to you

500
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,280
Happy birthday, dear Yu Na-bi

501
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,740
Happy birthday to you

502
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,995
Hey!

503
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,790
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

504
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,375
All right. My wish.

505
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,464
And when I started dating,

506
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,592
I thought love was everything.

507
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,847
And it's been almost two months

508
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,891
since my crazy first relationship ended.

509
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,330
I have friends that I talk to
and have meals with

510
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,707
from time to time.

511
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:27,299
And a friend I have sex with.

512
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,103
Do you want anything for your birthday?

513
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,146
I want you.

514
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,441
But where are we going?

515
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,152
-It's a secret.
-Come on.

516
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,738
-Why isn't the train coming?
-It's late.

517
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,282
How about an amusement park?

518
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,618
But I don't have anyone to spend

519
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,745
my birthday with.

520
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,676
THE TRAIN FOR GUJA
WILL BE ARRIVING SHORTLY

521
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,134
I got you!

522
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,999
I thought our relationship
only existed at night.

523
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,174
Do you like your gift?

524
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,428
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this.

525
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,848
Come on. Can't you express your
happiness so I can feel proud?

526
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:06,018
All right. Thank you!

527
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,436
Wear it tomorrow, okay?

528
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,355
Okay.

529
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,567
But weren't you going to the exhibit?
It's the last day today.

530
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,780
How could I think about that right now?

531
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,199
He's making me get my hopes up again.

532
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,283
Then…

533
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:25,329
You got me a gift,
so let me buy you a meal.

534
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,331
Well…

535
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,876
Oh, do you have plans?

536
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,628
Then--

537
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,880
No. It's your birthday, so…

538
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,051
INSTANT SEAWEED SOUP

539
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,516
I thought it was the worst birthday ever.

540
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,353
But I guess life is full of variables.

541
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,981
Hang on. I'll make this right away.

542
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,863
You're talking
as if you're really cooking.

543
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,783
It's the heart that matters.

544
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,496
It's been a while since I had
seaweed soup for my birthday.

545
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,208
Really?

546
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,586
I thought everyone had it except for me.

547
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,547
I feel comforted now.

548
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,767
What?

549
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,019
You've never told me
something like that before.

550
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,481
You don't talk much about yourself.

551
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,401
Well…

552
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,576
That's because
you know me so well already.

553
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,706
I don't know anything about you.

554
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,589
I really don't.

555
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,508
You're still such a mystery to me.

556
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,644
Stop fooling around
and finish making this.

557
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,438
Not that.

558
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,150
Then what?

559
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,217
Why can't you be my boyfriend?

560
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,807
So when are you going to make me
the seaweed soup?

561
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,519
I'll make it now.

562
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,105
Why aren't you getting up, then?

563
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,066
I have no energy. Five more minutes.

564
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,331
SEOL-A

565
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,502
Let me take a call.

566
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,088
Hang on.

567
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,345
Should we have a drink first?

568
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,015
Or go right away?

569
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,517
Well, whatever you prefer.

570
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,525
Let's drink here.

571
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,698
What's your ideal type?

572
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,991
-Me?
-Yes.

573
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,246
Are you okay?

574
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,292
Yes. I'm okay.

575
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:53,013
This place is actually pretty lame.

576
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,726
-Let's drink somewhere else.
-What?

577
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,853
-Let's go.
-Somewhere else?

578
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,908
Do you know her?

579
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,202
No, I don't.

580
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,621
Excuse me. Can I have some ice water?

581
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,836
Sorry. Something urgent came up
with a friend.

582
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,632
Okay. You should go, then.

583
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:33,261
Make sure to eat.
And don't ignore your mom.

584
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,015
I'll get going.

585
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,226
Okay.

586
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,842
I'm hungry.

587
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,777
Do-hyeok…

588
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,495
Come in.

589
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,211
Sorry. You're closed, right? I…

590
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,420
We're not.

591
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,806
What? You have 3,000 subscribers?

592
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,933
You started only three months ago.

593
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,643
You have so many views.

594
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,686
Do you edit the videos yourself?

595
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,647
Yes.

596
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,234
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER

597
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,569
I saw this before.

598
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,031
The channel name reminded me of you.

599
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,616
You thought about me?

600
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,451
Of course.

601
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,789
I can't believe it really was you.

602
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,332
And a culinary arts major?

603
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,128
The Yang Do-hyeok I know

604
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,923
always played with food.

605
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,512
I knew you'd major in art, though.

606
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,348
You were always good at drawing.

607
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,018
Well…

608
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,188
Not that good.

609
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,482
I just liked it.

610
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,572
Your videos are really good.

611
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,743
Here you go.

612
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,167
Weren't you making noodles for me?

613
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:52,878
Next time.

614
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,755
Isn't it your birthday today?

615
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,466
You're right.

616
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,931
You have a good memory.
You remembered my birthday?

617
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,641
Of course, I…

618
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,606
I have a good memory.

619
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,107
Right.

620
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,027
-Do you still like chocolate?
-Yes.

621
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,239
Did you make this yourself, too?

622
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,075
-Yes.
-You're so skilled.

623
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,410
It looks delicious.

624
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:31,499
What?

625
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,170
Make a wish.

626
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,672
A wish?

627
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,841
All right.

628
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,278
Happy birthday, Na-bi.

629
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,491
Thank you. I can't believe
I'm with you like this on my birthday.

630
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,493
Life is full of surprises.

631
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,996
I know.
I never imagined this would happen.

632
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,459
-It's so good.
-Really?

633
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,127
-Yes!
-That's a relief.

634
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,630
I felt this last time,

635
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,508
but it's not awkward
even when we haven't met for a long time.

636
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,260
Maybe since we're childhood friends.

637
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,637
Do you think so?

638
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,014
What's that response? Do you feel awkward?

639
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,726
I feel kind of nervous.

640
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,319
Remember when we had a birthday party
at the beach?

641
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,654
Yes. Right.

642
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:44,948
Of course I remember.

643
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,410
We set up a tent and made ramyeon.

644
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,121
Right. And we played with fireworks.

645
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,123
Right.

646
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,916
It was so fun.

647
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,378
I want to go back to that moment.

648
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,752
Do you like your gift?

649
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,006
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this.

650
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,133
Wear it tomorrow, okay?

651
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,997
-Hello?
-Are you at school?

652
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:16,998
Yes. Why?

653
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,001
I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.

654
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,253
Me too.

655
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,605
It looks good on you.

656
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,277
Because you bought it?

657
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,863
Well, the model is pretty.

658
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,408
You're right.

659
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,412
Right, I made up with my mom.

660
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,456
Well, it was more like

661
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,834
I just listened to her talk and hung up.

662
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,795
Good job.

663
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,259
What about you?
You went to see your friend.

664
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,719
Right.

665
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,681
It wasn't anything good.

666
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,518
He's drawing the line again.

667
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,442
Why aren't you giving me one?

668
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,194
What flavor is it?

669
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,417
Are you crazy? We're at school!

670
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,629
A pretty girl was gazing at me, asking me

671
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,007
the flavor of my candy.

672
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,390
I was only looking at your candy.

673
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,270
-This?
-Yes, that.

674
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,107
It tastes good, right?

675
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,818
-Is it good?
-No.

676
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,445
-It's not?
-No.

677
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,574
There's something between them.
And my friend said

678
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:18,203
she saw Jae-eon several times at the
convenience store near Na-bi's house.

679
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,872
Come on. She lives near our school.

680
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,916
He never goes to that convenience store.

681
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,461
You know so much about Jae-eon, honey.

682
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,087
Did you just call me "honey"?

683
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,048
Come to think of it,

684
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,842
they were giving each other looks
before they disappeared!

685
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,636
Are they dating, then?

686
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,472
Jae-eon doesn't date.

687
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,682
Then are they just sleeping
with each other?

688
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,976
You can gossip among yourselves later.

689
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,813
We still have to discuss the venue
and budget of our workshop.

690
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,149
Didn't we decide to finish this
in an hour?

691
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,735
Come on, don't be so serious.

692
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,195
It's all right.

693
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,489
I guess he's in a hurry to go on a date.

694
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,658
Let's finish up quickly.

695
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,373
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine. Sit down.

696
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,127
The professor wants us to check
the venue in person beforehand.

697
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,129
We should go this weekend.

698
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,465
Who can't make it?

699
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,764
What? You can't make it, Jae-eon?

700
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:21,766
No.

701
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,644
Why?

702
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,569
Hey, Na-bi!

703
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,446
Why are you so dressed up today?

704
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,490
-Is it okay?
-It looks great on you.

705
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,370
Why weren't you at school?

706
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,290
I was a little sick.
Don't you think I lost some weight?

707
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,042
Yes, it looks like it. Are you okay now?

708
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,920
I'm fine.
Right, and how was your birthday?

709
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,547
Sorry I couldn't contact you.

710
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,215
You don't need to be sorry.

711
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:58,052
Did you talk to Sol?
She seemed pretty worried about you.

712
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,140
The weather's really nice today.

713
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,351
-It's totally spring, isn't it?
-It is.

714
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,147
I don't want to work on assignments.

715
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,608
Hey, Na-bi. You look so pretty.

716
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,984
-Here to work?
-So pretty.

717
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,612
-We're just having a short meeting.
-They're both pretty.

718
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,740
Okay.

719
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,659
Go on.

720
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,714
What about me?

721
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,424
It's been a while, Ji-wan.

722
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,551
Why did you suddenly go off the grid?

723
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,219
I was a bit sick.

724
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,099
How does a fit girl like you
suddenly get sick?

725
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,143
I know. Ji-wan is built like a brick.

726
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:48,895
What were you sick with?

727
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:53,066
Well, Jae-eon can't come
since he has plans.

728
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,651
Anyone else who can't come?

729
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:59,489
Na-bi. We're going to check the venue
for our workshop. Want to come?

730
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,616
Well…

731
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,414
I have plans.

732
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,585
Right. If you have plans, I guess not.

733
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:32,230
Na-bi and Jae-eon really seem
to be dating, right?

734
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,774
I thought Na-bi had a crush on me.

735
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,236
Are you still on about that?

736
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,447
Do you guys want to go out for drinks?

737
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,990
I have plans.

738
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,619
Me too. I have plans, too.

739
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,801
Jeez…

740
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,477
What are you doing here?

741
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,355
Na-bi. I'm really heartbroken.

742
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,190
I know you're in a lot of pain after--

743
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,734
What are you talking about?

744
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,740
I heard the rumors. A lot of my students
attend your school.

745
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,784
I keep hearing rumors about you,
even if I try not to.

746
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,035
What do you mean?

747
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,456
-What rumors?
-I heard you're seeing

748
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,459
some jerk named Park Jae-eon or something.

749
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,211
I heard he sleeps with everybody.

750
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,797
I was so shocked when I heard
you were seeing him.

751
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,221
I don't enjoy hearing that about my ex.

752
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:50,767
Let go of me.

753
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,187
You're giving me advice?
Who do you think you are?

754
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,106
What? Then it's true?
You're seeing that jerk?

755
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,066
Who are you to call him a jerk?

756
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,693
-Yu Na-bi!
-What?

757
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:06,324
You're not that kind of girl.

758
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:10,745
You must've been lonely after we broke up.
But still, seeing a guy like that?

759
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,330
Shut up and get lost.

760
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,713
Hey, Na-bi…

761
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,844
LAUNDRY

762
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,149
That bastard.
Who is he to say such things?

763
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,551
I feel like I'm doing something wrong.

764
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,096
Don't you know any hot girls?

765
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,057
Ask Jae-eon to introduce you.

766
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,017
Park Jae-eon?

767
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,229
To be honest,
we don't feel comfortable with him.

768
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,566
Why? Did something happen?

769
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,777
Don't you feel that he shows off
about being popular?

770
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,238
When I asked him to introduce me
to a girl,

771
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:31,033
he said something about feeling guilty
towards them. It totally pissed me off.

772
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,453
Jae-eon really said that to you?

773
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,163
He did.

774
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,082
He's so rude just because he's popular.

775
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,042
We don't think of him as a real friend.

776
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,295
The others don't consider him
a friend, either.

777
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,298
They just keep him close
since he's good-looking, that's all.

778
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,593
His target is Na-bi these days.

779
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,845
They seem to be getting close.

780
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:52,430
I could totally tell.

781
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,849
I did hear about that.

782
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,310
So the rumors spread already.

783
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,353
Jae-eon has nothing to lose.

784
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:00,563
He must be so proud.

785
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,984
I didn't think Na-bi would be like that.
She must be pretty open-minded…

786
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,405
Open-minded?
That's just a nice way to put it.

787
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:13,451
You really can't judge a book
by its cover.

788
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,162
I should get going now.

789
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,247
Okay. Let's go together.

790
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:24,712
Yu Na-bi?

791
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,926
Hello, Professor.

792
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:34,096
Is this for the exhibit?

793
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,975
Yes, I'm thinking of handing this one in.

794
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,194
Is something troubling you?

795
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,695
It's in pretty bad shape.

796
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:51,739
A right hook.

797
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,161
But still, if you focus well
and keep working on it,

798
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,455
it could be a decent piece.

799
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:02,083
All right. I'll work harder.

800
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:22,478
People gossip about others

801
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,814
and criticize others so easily.

802
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,858
It's especially worse in Korea,
since it's a small country.

803
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,613
That's why you should be careful
when you're young.

804
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:36,993
You might think reckless behavior
can be forgiven because you're young.

805
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,790
But from what I experienced,
it's not the case.

806
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,583
There are consequences.

807
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,837
You'll get hit with the aftermath
at a crucial moment later on.

808
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,380
A left hook.

809
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:52,216
No one will take responsibility
for your own life.

810
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:55,845
So keep your head on straight.
You're graduating soon, you know.

811
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:58,347
Everyone finds a job
before they graduate these days.

812
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,683
And an uppercut.

813
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,601
Right.

814
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,854
I know how you feel,

815
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:08,065
so I'm giving you advice since
I care about you. So keep that in mind.

816
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,234
Yes, Professor.

817
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:13,863
-Focus on your work.
-I will.

818
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,954
KO.

819
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,802
It feels like

820
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,347
the whole universe is telling me
to end it with Jae-eon.

821
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,349
Na-bi.

822
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,022
Are you okay? You could've
fallen down on the trash.

823
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,108
Yes, I'm fine.

824
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,070
This is good timing.

825
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:57,156
Could we meet for a moment later?
Just the two of us?

826
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,660
Well, I like that you're asking first,

827
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:05,122
but I'll be a bit tired
since I have lots of work today.

828
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:09,251
What? I'm not talking about that.

829
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:13,631
Let's talk.

830
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,551
Okay. Will it be okay
to meet late at night?

831
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:18,761
Yes, it's fine.

832
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,514
I'll call you when I'm done.

833
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,016
Okay.

834
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,447
-Let's send it to the professor tomorrow.
-Okay.

835
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,407
She won't read it until tomorrow anyway.

836
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,626
-Aren't you leaving?
-What?

837
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:56,048
Oh, well… I'm just going to finish
reading the paper I was looking at.

838
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,051
Where is it?

839
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,679
All right, then. I'll be off first.

840
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,181
Okay. Bye.

841
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:10,187
I thought about it, and I guess
I must have lost it after breaking up.

842
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,106
I don't know why I'm doing this

843
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:14,108
with you.

844
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:18,779
What do you mean?

845
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,951
I want to focus on my work and school.

846
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,455
This is an important time for me.

847
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,168
I guess I'm talking too much, right?

848
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:36,839
Yes. Aren't you going overboard?
We're not even going out.

849
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,553
We should end it.

850
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,352
Does this sound like I want to cut ties?

851
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,568
But whatever I say,

852
01:09:57,651 --> 01:10:00,946
Jae-eon won't even blink an eye.

853
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,789
He's always so relaxed and calm,
but I'm always anxious.

854
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:14,335
My ex cheated on me,
I got rejected by a guy who liked me,

855
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:16,962
and rumors spread about me
being sex partners with the guy I like.

856
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:22,176
It sounds even worse like that.

857
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,436
We should end it.

858
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,939
That's all I have to say.

859
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,916
Let's talk.

860
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,626
You have more to say?

861
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,464
To be honest, I don't get
why you're so upset.

862
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,426
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

863
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,307
I said I'll see you at your house.

864
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,311
I thought you'd take a long time.

865
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:18,899
I thought I'd finish by 10 p.m.,
but it's taking longer than expected.

866
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,526
Right.

867
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,445
I see.

868
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:27,074
I ran thousands of simulations
inside my head…

869
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:29,576
You look pretty serious.

870
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:33,622
What did you want to say?

871
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,000
But the moment I looked into his eyes,

872
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,628
my mind went blank.

873
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,005
Well…

874
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,884
My ex-boyfriend came to my house.

875
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,721
He seemed to have heard rumors about us.

876
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:52,808
He said I should just date him instead.

877
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,021
What did you say?

878
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,773
I told him not to talk nonsense.

879
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,026
Really?

880
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:05,070
"Really?" Is that it?

881
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,827
Is that what you wanted to say?

882
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:19,126
Is there someone else you're seeing?

883
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:20,627
What's wrong with me?

884
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,672
Why am I asking this
when I was about to end everything?

885
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:29,887
No.

886
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,222
Really?

887
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,531
Excuse me.

888
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:52,743
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

889
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,204
Yes.

890
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,248
So it's you.

891
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,087
You bastard!

892
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,882
Sir! What's wrong?

893
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:09,009
-What are you doing?
-Move.

894
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,511
-Wait!
-Move!

895
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:13,180
-Why are you doing this?
-Get out of the way!

896
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,225
Na-bi!

897
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:15,742
Park Jae-eon has never been mine.
But it feels like I've lost him.

898
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:18,495
How could Na-bi date a guy like Jae-eon?

899
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:22,166
-My girlfriend?
-Call me. Even if it's nothing special.

900
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:25,210
My whole house is filled
with traces of Jae-eon.

901
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,128
Jerk.

902
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,338
I guess it worked.

903
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,007
How long are you going to avoid me?

904
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,884
We didn't get to finish
what we were talking about.

905
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,721
This is how we always make up.
As if nothing happened.

906
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:37,514
I just picked it up, thinking of you.

907
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,558
-A gift for me?
-Yes.

908
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,351
I was jealous.
Good luck on your presentation.

909
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,854
Who would like to assist Yu Na-bi?

910
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:46,023
I thought it'd be fun. Seems interesting.

911
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:47,983
Hey, Seol-a. I'll be there right away.

912
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,360
How can he not even call once?

913
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:51,904
I miss him.

914
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:56,575
