1
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,554
Na-bi would love this.

2
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,139
Yang Do-hyeok!

3
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,433
You're here.

4
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,020
What happened?

5
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,897
I just got hurt a little.

6
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,274
How? Is it bad?

7
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,110
It's fine. Na-bi took good care of it.

8
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,862
Gosh, it must hurt.

9
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,655
You should have been careful.

10
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,408
Where's Na-bi?

11
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,328
She said she's too tired to come.

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,996
She's not coming?

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,997
Are you that upset?

14
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,168
She went to her aunt's?

15
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,378
Probably. Why?

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,256
It's nothing.

17
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,843
But where is Jae-eon?

18
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,059
Do-yeon, take care of the guests.

19
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,394
What? Where are you going?

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,321
EPISODE 8: I KNOW IT'S A LIE.
NEVERTHELESS,

21
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,055
YANG DO-HYEOK

22
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,817
Is this really okay?

23
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,530
If we continue,

24
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,784
I don't think I can stop.

25
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,111
Oh, there you are.

26
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,655
Do-yeon told me you went home.

27
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,408
Right. I was about to leave.

28
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,494
-I'll take you home.
-No, it's fine. I can go by myself.

29
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,914
It's late. I'll take you.

30
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,459
All right, then.

31
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,021
Well…

32
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,940
What?

33
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,401
It feels like the timing is wrong.

34
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,862
What do you mean?

35
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,848
What is all this?

36
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,868
It's a flower called lisianthus.

37
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,537
It means…

38
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,751
Will you accept this?

39
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,133
Do-hyeok.

40
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,846
You're a really good person.

41
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,603
-Then--
-But I don't think this is good timing.

42
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,275
I don't think
I can have a good relationship right now.

43
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,199
Is it because of Park Jae-eon?

44
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,080
Honestly, I can't say it isn't.

45
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,834
I ran away and came here
because of him too.

46
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,170
Then do you want to see him again?

47
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,468
It's not like that.

48
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,598
Are you disappointed in me?

49
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,475
Yes.

50
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,314
I already knew I'd get disappointed,

51
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,107
so a little thing like this

52
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,445
won't make me get disappointed in you.

53
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,115
You're just
romanticizing me right now. I--

54
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,034
Then just…

55
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,703
disappoint me even more.

56
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,458
Right now, I like you so much

57
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,377
that I don't know what to do.

58
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,135
I like you. Sincerely.

59
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,395
I understand how you feel.

60
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,733
So don't be too hard on yourself.

61
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,829
I don't even know why I'm crying.

63
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,628
Can I give you a hug?

64
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,380
No.

65
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,384
You'll feel better
after you cry all you want.

66
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,095
No. I'd feel even more sorry.

67
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,713
I know…

68
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,675
exactly what my tears mean.

69
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,021
I cried because I felt so pathetic.

70
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,453
Did you take her home safely?

71
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,925
You must like her a lot.

72
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,053
Yes. Unlike someone.

73
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,598
So stop confusing her.

74
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,689
It's none of your business, you know.

75
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,363
Is Na-bi easily swayed by me?

76
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,205
No. Not at all.

77
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,626
She says she regrets
the time she spent with you.

78
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,128
She says she wants to forget it all.

79
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,258
Auntie.

80
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,852
What?

81
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,867
It'll take some time,
so let's wait outside.

82
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,993
Okay.

83
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,877
I'll finish up the rest,
so wash your hands over there.

84
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,878
All right.

85
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,031
You're the one who made
Na-bi come here, aren't you?

86
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,082
-Auntie.
-You're up.

87
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,751
Did you sleep well?

88
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,211
What are you doing here?

89
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,506
I was learning pottery from your aunt.

90
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,553
He came this morning,
saying he was a close friend of yours.

91
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,805
He wanted to learn pottery,

92
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,683
so I was teaching him
a few of my special know-hows.

93
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,102
You don't even know him.
You should've been careful.

94
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,812
You should've confirmed it with me.

95
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,982
Isn't he your friend?

96
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,195
-He is, but--
-Then it's fine.

97
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,531
Let's eat. Do you want to join us?

98
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,369
Sure.

99
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,037
What are you doing?

100
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,539
You two can catch up.

101
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,332
Where are you going?

102
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,188
What are you doing here?

103
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,649
I wanted to see your aunt.

104
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,776
Stop joking around.

105
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,488
We didn't get to finish.

106
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,698
What do you mean?

107
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,829
Just forget about yesterday.

108
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,750
By that,

109
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,671
are you saying it didn't mean anything?

110
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,467
It was a mistake.

111
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,596
We were both drunk.

112
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,685
Well, if that's how you feel.

113
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,104
He's such a coward.

114
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,026
Are you and Do-hyeok dating?

115
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,528
You don't have to know.

116
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,655
It's none of your business.

117
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,745
Hey, you're so cold.

118
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,790
You really hurt me just now.

119
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,253
Na-bi.

120
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,796
Sorry.

121
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,883
-Is there anything you like?
-I'm sorry, but I should get going.

122
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,927
You're not going to eat?

123
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,012
Why? It won't take long.

124
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,556
I have other plans.

125
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,017
I loved your jangjorim. It's too bad.

126
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,521
You tried my jangjorim? How?

127
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,481
I sent them only to Na-bi.

128
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,904
Can I come and learn pottery
during vacations?

129
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,406
Of course.

130
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,786
He's pretty talented.

131
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,831
If I teach him well,
he might be a better assistant than you.

132
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,082
Don't be ridiculous.

133
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,585
I'll be off, then.

134
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,336
All right.

135
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,549
See you in Seoul.

136
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,467
Take care.

137
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,811
Let's go eat.

138
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,580
Surprisingly, my regretful past
still hasn't ended yet.

139
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,791
Here you go. Enjoy your food.

140
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,210
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

141
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,296
Isn't Jae-eon eating?

142
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,423
I guess he's still sleeping.

143
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,050
He left saying he had plans.

144
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,135
-He left?
-What plans?

145
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,682
I'm not sure what plans he had.

146
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,936
-What about Na-bi?
-She went to her aunt's.

147
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,604
I see.

148
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,569
Hey. What about Gyu-hyun? He's not eating?

149
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,449
I don't know.
I guess he's not feeling well.

150
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,370
Gosh. I feel awful.

151
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,748
Do you even remember last night, Ji-wan?

152
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,710
I remember doing the drinking games,

153
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,796
but I don't remember anything after that.

154
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,341
Why did you drink so much by yourself?

155
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,843
Sol took you to your room last night

156
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,762
and washed your face and everything.

157
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,474
How will you live without Sol?

158
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,227
You should
get a grip on yourself. All right?

159
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,230
Hey, look who's talking.

160
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,940
-Without Gyu-hyun--
-Shut up.

161
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,108
Okay.

162
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,034
Darn it.

163
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,355
CENTRAL BUS TERMINAL

164
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,413
Na-bi.

165
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,415
Do-hyeok.

166
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,377
I'm glad you didn't leave yet.

167
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,255
I didn't know you were coming.
When did you get here?

168
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,132
I wanted to see you off this time.

169
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,801
Oh.

170
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,515
Get home safe.

171
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,144
I will. Good luck with the restaurant.

172
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,607
I'm going to try uploading
various contents like you suggested.

173
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,484
And try changing my video styles.

174
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,651
Good thinking.

175
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,906
Can you watch them after I edit them?

176
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,950
Of course.
I'll watch them and give you feedback.

177
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,458
It's nothing special,
but have this on the way.

178
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,130
Thanks.

179
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,384
I only receive things from you.

180
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,552
It's fine.

181
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,724
I'll get going now. Take care.

182
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,435
-Sure, you too.
-Okay.

183
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,448
They look good.

184
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,884
Na-bi. I thought about it…

185
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,806
and I don't think I can give up
on you that easily.

186
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,226
Not until you see someone else

187
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,271
or tell me you'd never like me.

188
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,693
I'll call you later.

189
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,820
See you next time.

190
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,482
It's so pretty.

191
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,054
Go. I'll return the car.

192
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,224
-Thanks. Get back safe.
-Bye.

193
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,308
-Take care.
-Where are you going?

194
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,226
We're going home.

195
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,936
-Home?
-Bye!

196
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,562
-I'm heading to the studio.
-Bye.

197
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,445
Aren't you getting off?

198
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,745
The weather
seems to have gotten hotter, right?

199
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,414
Should we get some shaved ice?

200
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,916
I'm just going to head home.

201
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,377
I can't just eat it by myself.

202
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,800
Do you still not remember
anything from yesterday?

203
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,261
What? Yesterday?

204
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,514
Yes. I brought you
inside the room last night.

205
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,891
And after that…

206
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,728
Gosh. I can't remember anything.

207
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,814
I should really quit drinking.

208
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,942
Did I do something bad to you yesterday?

209
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,110
Yes.

210
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,612
Oh, really?

211
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,574
I'm really sorry.

212
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,869
Sol, if I ever try to drink again,

213
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,414
just beat me up so I'll get a grip.

214
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,502
I was just kidding. Nothing happened.

215
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,131
Hey! You startled me.

216
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,054
I'm tired. I'm going home now.

217
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,431
Okay. Get home safe.

218
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,190
Get off.

219
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,983
Hey.

220
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,071
Did we break up?

221
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,322
If you agree.

222
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,909
You agree, right?

223
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,373
I mean…

224
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,795
To be honest, we both knew
what each other was like--

225
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,338
I know.

226
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,342
But I think we were
on better terms as friends.

227
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,763
You said it was tough
dating a guy like me, remember?

228
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,474
Gosh.

229
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,020
Are you still bothered by what I said?

230
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,439
-You--
-Honestly, it's tough for me too.

231
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,735
And we've been fighting
ever since we started dating.

232
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,613
Were you even happy dating me?

233
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,367
We haven't even been dating that long.
That's a bit too deep.

234
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:35,163
And it seems like we both don't want
to change for each other's sake.

235
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,500
It's best to end things here.

236
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,378
All right.

237
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,464
Then let's be friends again.

238
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,423
What?

239
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,467
You said we were better as friends.

240
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,012
We were friends
for much longer than we dated.

241
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,597
Why wouldn't we be friends again?

242
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,934
Right. We could be friends again,

243
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,937
but it feels like

244
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,691
you might ask
to become friends with benefits later.

245
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:07,487
I won't, so let's just be friends again.

246
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,784
Nobody knows about us,
so I'll do my best not to show it.

247
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,370
I won't cause you trouble.

248
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,960
I ended up…

249
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,671
coming back.

250
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,067
Are you here to work on your assignments?

251
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,404
I'm just going to have a smoke and leave.

252
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,156
I have to return the car.

253
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,909
That's tiresome.

254
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,702
It must've been tiring for you too.

255
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,164
-What do you mean?
-I shouldn't have told you

256
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,624
that Na-bi was coming.

257
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,837
Well, something good came from that.

258
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,214
What?

259
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,217
I can focus on my work better.

260
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,388
I'm ending things with her.

261
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,306
Why?

262
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,141
I'm exhausted.

263
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,769
It's the same for her too.

264
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,397
I guess people never change.

265
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,108
Right.

266
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,492
It's been a while.

267
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,830
Oh, Dimples.

268
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,792
Hey, why were you ignoring me?

269
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,878
When? Oh, right.

270
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,298
I was with my boyfriend.

271
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,300
Boyfriend? You have a boyfriend?

272
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,220
I did, but not anymore. I got dumped.

273
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,098
You? Why? Why did you get dumped?

274
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,101
I don't know.

275
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,022
Hey. What do you think relationships are?

276
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,858
Relationships?

277
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,902
Spending time with someone you love.
Eating, drinking,

278
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,156
watching movies, talking on the phone.

279
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,824
What's wrong with everyone?

280
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,035
Why? What do you think they are, then?

281
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,789
Kissing and having sex with one person.

282
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,045
You didn't
say that to your boyfriend, did you?

283
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,171
I didn't…

284
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,383
No, I guess I kind of did.

285
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,137
Right. I see why you got dumped.

286
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,353
Hey, cute lady.

287
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,980
I'll be there soon.

288
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,066
All right.

289
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,043
I kept thinking about you.

290
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,546
I missed you.

291
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,555
But as always,

292
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,641
you're not contacting me.

293
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,028
I'M THROWING AWAY ALL YOUR STUFF

294
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,783
But at least it doesn't hurt me
as hard as before.

295
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,997
Did I get used to feeling this way?

296
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,709
I'M THROWING AWAY ALL YOUR STUFF

297
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,258
YANG DO-HYEOK

298
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,015
-Hey, Do-hyeok.
-Hi, Na-bi. Did you arrive home?

299
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,102
Yes. I was just about to tell you.

300
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,479
The brownies were good.

301
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,315
That's a relief.
It was my first time making them.

302
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,359
You're good at everything.

303
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,363
The cake you made me
on my birthday was great too.

304
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,200
I did my best to learn how to make that
since you love chocolate.

305
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,370
I was thinking of becoming
a pastry chef because of you.

306
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,789
What? Really? You're lying, right?

307
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,832
Yes.

308
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,792
Was it obvious?

309
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,587
Hey, that wasn't even funny.

310
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,177
It's nice to hear your voice.

311
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,013
The whole neighborhood

312
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,057
seems empty without you.

313
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,977
Everyone living there will laugh at that.

314
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,731
I'm sure they'll understand
if they know how I feel right now.

315
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,694
You're going overboard.

316
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,572
What were you doing?

317
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,659
I was preparing for the exhibition.

318
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,287
I rested for the past few days.

319
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,539
I have a lot to do now.

320
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,376
I think I'll be going to Seoul soon.
Do you want to meet up?

321
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,298
Sure.

322
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,218
-Is there anything you want to eat?
-What about you?

323
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,888
You're coming all the way here.
I'll treat you.

324
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,610
What?

325
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,154
That's way better.

326
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,656
Isn't it too noisy?

327
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,868
What are you talking about?
I was about to raise the volume.

328
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,538
-What? You can't hear that?
-You can hear that?

329
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,041
Your hearing is really bad.
You listen to music loudly, don't you?

330
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,668
You should fix that habit.

331
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,961
You'll lose your hearing.

332
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,964
The volume you lowered it to
is way too quiet.

333
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,633
Okay. Then just raise it by three.

334
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,844
-No.
-Just three more.

335
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,720
-My ears hurt.
-Just ten, okay?

336
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,305
-Just ten.
-We can hear it fine.

337
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,849
-Just ten.
-What's with you?

338
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,183
-Come on.
-Just…

339
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,571
Are you okay?

340
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,781
Are you hurt?

341
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,536
No. I'm fine.

342
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,997
I'm okay.

343
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,203
Thanks for this.

344
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,413
-Sure.
-Thank you.

345
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,666
This place has the best tteokbokki.

346
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,585
-Really?
-This place?

347
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,546
Hey, Na-bi!

348
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,590
Applying to work late?

349
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,175
Yes.

350
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,718
Come have some tteokbokki.

351
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,262
-Chopsticks.
-Come and eat.

352
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,057
Chopsticks.

353
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,309
Thank you.

354
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,020
How is your piece going?
I'm looking forward to it.

355
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,690
Jae-eon volunteered to be her assistant,
so it's going to be great.

356
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,401
But I saw Jae-eon earlier,

357
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,155
and he was talking to some foreigners.
What's that about?

358
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,115
They're from VCU.

359
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,242
They saw his works
and wanted to talk to him.

360
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,913
Awesome. Why?
Are they trying to scout him?

361
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,998
Yes. They wouldn't want
to lose their chance.

362
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,000
They're probably trying to scout

363
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,544
some kids while they're here
for the symposium.

364
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,799
Gosh. He seems a bit overqualified
to be Na-bi's assistant.

365
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:51,094
Hey, that's ridiculous. There's
no such thing as qualifications in art.

366
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,429
Of course there is.

367
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,389
Right.

368
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,060
Then I guess Jae-eon would become
an artist for sure. Like Su-yeong.

369
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,395
I guess so.

370
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,730
You don't have to only become an artist.

371
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,108
There are lots of jobs
related to our major.

372
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,820
That's only for talented people.

373
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,449
My parents did so much to send me here,
thinking they'd have

374
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,368
an artist in the family.

375
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,036
They spent so much money on me.

376
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,789
I feel so bad.

377
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,835
It's fine, Ji-wan.
I'm sure they didn't expect much.

378
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,336
What?

379
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,965
You're getting
the exchange program results soon.

380
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,550
Are you preparing your portfolio?

381
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,178
Well, yes.

382
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,557
I'm preparing that
along with the exhibition for now.

383
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,184
"For now"? What do you want to do, then?

384
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,061
Well…

385
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,732
I'm not sure…

386
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,737
I'm not sure yet, so if I get accepted--

387
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,489
What you want is more important, you know.

388
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,199
Why do you want to go to Paris?

389
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,288
Are you doing an interview or what?

390
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,252
Working hard is nice, of course,
but you should focus on one thing.

391
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,254
-It's a critical time right now.
-Right.

392
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,133
I'm worried I might end up
not gaining anything at this rate.

393
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,260
Don't worry. Everyone feels the same.

394
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,179
Even us graduate students.

395
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,390
There must be something you like more.

396
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,894
Keep asking yourself what you like.

397
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,272
I will.

398
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,621
What I like more…

399
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,581
I thought I already found it, but…

400
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,670
I'll do it. Where should I move it?

401
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,923
It's fine. I'll do it.

402
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,718
I should do it.
I'm your assistant, remember?

403
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,428
I can do this much.

404
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,975
By the way, I was at the office earlier
and Gyeong-jun told me.

405
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,144
I heard you got scouted.

406
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,980
Are you going to America?

407
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,398
I'm going to give it some thought.

408
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,319
Right. I see.

409
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,450
Oh, and I can throw away
your stuff that's at my house, right?

410
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,494
You still have them?

411
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,248
I'll throw them away.

412
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,250
No, don't. I'll go get them soon.

413
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,627
Fine, then.

414
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,841
Do you have a lot of work left?

415
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,180
Well, I did finish…

416
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,934
But why?

417
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,228
We have somewhere to go, remember?

418
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,258
INTERNATIONAL ART FAIR

419
00:36:58,966 --> 00:36:59,800
Let's go.

420
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,033
You said you wanted to see this.

421
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,293
What do you think? Don't you like it?

422
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,504
Well…

423
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,092
Would it be okay to go closer?

424
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,426
Sure.

425
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,024
When did you buy a car?

426
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,528
My mom gave it to me for my birthday.

427
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,197
That's a generous gift.

428
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,117
We lived separately since I was ten.

429
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,410
I guess she feels sorry.

430
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,832
This exhibition was nice.

431
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,251
I should come again.

432
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,880
Right. It did feel different
seeing the pieces in person.

433
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,507
Honestly, I didn't want to come.

434
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,591
Why?

435
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,803
It wasn't because of the exhibition.

436
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,224
I just have bad memories about this place.

437
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,351
Really?

438
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,981
I saw someone so beautiful here

439
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,734
that I fell in love at first sight.

440
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,653
I'm sure.

441
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,448
It was snowing that day.

442
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,615
I didn't ask.

443
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,701
It was an opening exhibition
for an artist.

444
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,453
What was the artist's name?

445
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,706
It was boring, so I was about to leave.

446
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,209
But then I saw a girl standing
in front of a piece for a long time.

447
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,046
Just like you back there.

448
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,428
And one day,

449
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,722
I ran into her again.

450
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,269
I was startled.

451
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,398
If I believed in fate,
I would have felt that this was it.

452
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,612
But you don't.

453
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,030
I don't.

454
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,955
Right, there's no such thing as fate.

455
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,043
Everything is just
a meaningless coincidence.

456
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,089
Yun Sol!

457
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,598
All right…

458
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,183
Hey, Yun Sol!

459
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,937
Your phone's broken, right? I know.

460
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,314
It's not.

461
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,943
Oh, then did your fingers break?
Did they just get healed?

462
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,281
Hey. What's going on with you?

463
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:11,951
What?

464
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,954
You keep ignoring my messages.

465
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,040
Are you angry at me about something?

466
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,794
Why would I be?

467
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,379
What?

468
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:29,677
It's nothing. I'm just not feeling well.

469
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,595
You're not well? Let me see.

470
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,852
Well…

471
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,897
I have to finish my project. I'll be off.

472
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,372
Let's go!

473
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,708
Keep going forward!

474
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,960
I can only go forward!

475
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,303
FRIENDS LIST
GYUHYUN777

476
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,519
SEONGJU-DONG, 24, HANDSOME

477
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,579
I'm totally screwed! What do I do?

478
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,456
What is it?

479
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,876
PART-TIME MODEL:
I CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY

480
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,380
I feel like crying.

481
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,382
-Your pizza's here.
-Thank you.

482
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:54,094
Darn it. It's for today's class.
The professor's going to flip.

483
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,888
Even if we don't pay much,

484
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,140
how can they cancel on the day of the job?

485
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,393
We should ask
for a bigger budget or something.

486
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,104
We can't make up
for missing models too, you know.

487
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,025
Let's contact everyone
who might be able to make time.

488
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,193
What class is it?

489
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,945
Well…

490
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,578
Jae-eon, how would you like
to do a part-time job?

491
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,875
Well, I…

492
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,211
Jae-eon, try this too.

493
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,922
This looks so filling.
You'll be full with just that.

494
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,507
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

495
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,508
Go on.

496
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,471
-Isn't it good?
-It's good.

497
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,765
-You should eat too. It's good.
-Sure.

498
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,351
Isn't it good?

499
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,687
It's great. Jae-eon, try the sauce too.

500
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,355
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

501
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,569
What? It's Mr. An again.

502
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,946
-What?
-Jeez.

503
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,823
When are we getting a real model?

504
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,783
Even if we can't get nude models,

505
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,743
we can't keep having you as our model…

506
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,453
We're getting sick of it now.

507
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,622
You guys, quiet down.

508
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:09,837
All right. We have
a special model for today's class.

509
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,171
-Is it you?
-Me?

510
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,007
It's probably Ms. Jo again.

511
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,550
All right, come in!

512
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,558
No way.

513
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,102
I can draw a hundred sketches of him.

514
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,563
He could be our main model.

515
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,030
Next pose, please.

516
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,720
Why did Jae-eon agree to do this, though?

517
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,681
It's so unlike him.

518
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,265
Because Mr. An told him--

519
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,525
Good work today, everyone.

520
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,360
-Thanks. You did good.
-Thank you.

521
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,278
-Thank you for today.
-Thank you.

522
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,655
The model was great today.

523
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:01,156
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

524
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,991
She just said the model was great.

525
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,827
-Are you going to the studio?
-Should we eat?

526
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,495
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

527
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,790
-Do you want to go eat?
-Do you want to go eat, Sol?

528
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,041
Go ahead first.

529
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,169
Hey, Jae-eon. How do you
do that flirtatious wink?

530
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,839
What? Me? I didn't wink.

531
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,590
-Why would you do that?
-I didn't!

532
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,842
How shameless.

533
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,975
Jae-eon, can you help out?

534
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,352
-Jae-eon? Help us.
-Okay.

535
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,146
He was the model, though.

536
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,400
Do-hyeok.

537
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,738
-It must've been tough coming here.
-It's fine.

538
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,032
-What's that?
-What? Oh, it's nothing.

539
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,618
You're hungry, right? Let's go.

540
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,120
-It's this way.
-Okay.

541
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,668
Gosh. Did you make this yourself?

542
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,836
Yes.

543
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,671
Gosh…

544
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,468
This looks so good.

545
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,306
It's delicious.

546
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,393
I only had delivery
and convenience store food these days.

547
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,023
-I'll make food for you often.
-Sure.

548
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,610
You must've stayed up late making this.

549
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,737
It would've been tough coming here too.

550
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,113
No, it didn't take long.

551
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,407
I brought some fruits too.

552
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,034
Okay. What's this?

553
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,452
Open it.

554
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,247
-What is it?
-Don't get anxious.

555
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,374
I didn't make a heart
with beans or anything.

556
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,960
You noticed that?

557
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,299
Hey, I love these!

558
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,136
-Dip it in the sauce.
-You should eat too.

559
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,137
I'm okay.

560
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,061
-Thanks for this.
-Enjoy.

561
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,981
Jae-eon!

562
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,743
What is it?

563
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,911
It's nothing.

564
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,790
When you said you'd show me your videos,

565
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,752
I thought you'd send them to me
through email or message.

566
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:19,878
I see.

567
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,381
I wanted to see you too.

568
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,424
Right. I'm glad you came.

569
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,760
I got to eat a nice meal too.

570
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,557
Let's watch.
I'm curious about your videos.

571
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:33,892
All right.

572
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,649
Here.

573
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,527
Left ear.

574
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:49,992
Play.

575
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,786
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
DIRECTIONS TO THE NOODLE SHOP

576
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,247
The music is good.

577
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:06,216
Hey! Isn't this the beach
in front of the noodle shop?

578
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,884
Yes, it is.

579
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,512
Gosh. I want to go there too.

580
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,603
-It's kind of weird, right?
-No, it's fine.

581
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,899
How do you chop so well?

582
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,198
Nice.

583
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,006
This is amazing.

584
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,300
Stop looking at it.

585
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,761
If you keep looking at it,
you'll see the flaws.

586
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,680
I knew it.

587
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,058
You're really talented.

588
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,645
It's nothing. Everyone can do that much.

589
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:01,813
That again?

590
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,775
Na-bi.

591
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,737
You don't seem to know
how talented and charming you are.

592
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,369
What's with the sudden compliment?

593
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,413
You keep saying stuff like that
out of the blue.

594
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,292
I'm not the one who doesn't know.
It's you who doesn't know me.

595
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,757
Oh, by the way, did you get an assistant?

596
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,345
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

597
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,473
I'm working on it
with two juniors from my department.

598
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,559
-I see.
-Yes.

599
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:44,314
I can't bring myself to tell him
that Jae-eon is one of them.

600
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,236
Why does it feel like I'm cheating?

601
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:51,905
That's great.

602
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,950
It's too bad I lost my chance

603
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,494
to help you, though.

604
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,205
Right.

605
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,292
Your class must be starting soon.
Go on inside.

606
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,796
No, it's fine.
I'll walk you to the main gate.

607
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,134
Are you going back home today?

608
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:16,304
I'm visiting the restaurant later,
so I'm not sure.

609
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,891
Oh, right. The one you worked at?

610
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:20,976
-Yes.
-Okay.

611
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,562
Are you working late again tonight?

612
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,357
Probably.

613
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,152
Isn't it scary at night?

614
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,237
Not at all.

615
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,948
I actually focus better at night.

616
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,620
Thanks for walking me here.

617
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,623
I didn't really do much.

618
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,333
And thanks for watching my videos.

619
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,586
I'll use some of the ideas you gave me.

620
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,421
Okay, then.

621
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,548
-I should get back now.
-Okay.

622
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,508
-I'm really going.
-Okay.

623
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,303
Thanks for the meal.

624
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,805
Thank you. Go on.

625
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,140
Be careful on the way.

626
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:02,809
I don't ever want

627
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,438
to disappoint Do-hyeok.

628
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,239
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SELECTED
FOR THE EXCHANGE STUDENT PROGRAM

629
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,187
MY SOL

630
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,356
LET'S EAT DINNER TONIGHT IF YOU'RE FREE
SURE, I'M FREE

631
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,277
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE ARE YOU?

632
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,987
LET'S WATCH THIS MOVIE
WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

633
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,210
I…

634
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,429
LET'S WATCH THIS MOVIE
WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

635
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,575
Aren't you leaving?

636
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,201
You're going?

637
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,996
I have plans. What about you?
Are you staying up all night?

638
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,290
I don't know.

639
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,460
Should I just leave too?

640
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:34,920
Is something up?

641
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,090
No, nothing.

642
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,676
You don't look so good.
Don't strain yourself.

643
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,846
-All right.
-Bye, then.

644
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,973
Bye.

645
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,785
I really don't feel like working.

646
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,253
You're late. Did you eat dinner?

647
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,254
I did.

648
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,884
I told you not to drink
straight from the bottle!

649
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,678
Oh, okay.

650
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,855
You look exhausted.

651
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,691
Was it your part-time job at the academy?

652
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,568
No, I was setting up stuff
for the exhibition.

653
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,237
My part-time job is on weekends.

654
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,990
Don't strain yourself.
We have to write our thesis too.

655
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,618
By the way, who was your roommate before?

656
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,246
-My roommate? Yun--
-Yun-ji?

657
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,164
Yun-seok, a contemporary art major.

658
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,250
-He went to the military.
-Is that all?

659
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,710
Well, before that,

660
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,129
-there was--
-Oh, never mind.

661
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,257
I'm still looking for a room.
I'll be able to leave soon.

662
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,800
What's the hurry?

663
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,095
If you're overworking these days
because of that…

664
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,431
Jeez. You're at it again.

665
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:10,890
What?

666
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,227
Why are you so nosy?

667
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,354
You don't need to mind me.

668
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,030
Is that a cat?

669
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,408
Oh, I forgot.

670
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,702
Are you allergic to cats?

671
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,704
No, I'm not. But…

672
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:33,830
That's a relief.

673
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,167
I've been taking care
of this stray cat for a while.

674
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,545
I was waiting for its mother,
but she never came.

675
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,839
And it must've been in the rain.

676
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,508
I thought it shouldn't be alone,
so I brought it home.

677
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:49,262
Gosh, you're taking care of animals now?

678
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,014
You're unbelievable.

679
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,891
-Isn't it cute? Do you want to hold it?
-Sure.

680
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,562
Oh, my gosh. It's so tiny.

681
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,814
I guess it likes you.

682
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,110
Hey, I'm the one who brought you here.

683
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,738
Have you named it yet?

684
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,656
Not yet. What should I name it?

685
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,949
Let's see.

686
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,411
Congratulations.

687
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,039
You've met a guardian

688
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,583
who is so nosy and full of compassion.

689
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,754
It's trying to go in.

690
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:24,798
It's so cute.

691
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:26,758
What?

692
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,368
Yun Sol.

693
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,329
Let's talk for a minute.

694
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,172
I have to meet someone.

695
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,174
Let's talk later.

696
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:11,386
Who are you meeting at this hour?

697
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:16,182
It won't take long. I'll be quick.

698
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,188
Well…

699
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:27,652
I've been thinking about why
you're acting like this to me these days.

700
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,905
I think you've changed

701
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,034
since we came back from the workshop.

702
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,995
So I guess

703
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:41,040
it's because of what I did that night.

704
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,585
What I mean to say is…

705
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,714
I remember what happened that night.

706
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,721
So?

707
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,723
Is that it?

708
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,641
What?

709
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,146
-No, that's not it.
-What is it, then?

710
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,733
Well…

711
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,612
I don't know!

712
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:14,449
I thought you'd say something too.

713
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:17,869
Do you want to apologize
about what you did that night?

714
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,705
What?

715
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,832
Well, I…

716
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:28,755
I guess you think
I should apologize for what I did, then.

717
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,091
If what you did

718
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,054
was just a mistake you need to fix.

719
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,599
What? What do you mean?

720
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,977
Because if you did that with no meaning,

721
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,189
then you're hurting me.

722
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,110
Because…

723
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,738
I like you.

724
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,202
Of course, I like you too.

725
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,370
Not as friends.

726
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,380
Yun Sol. What's going on?

727
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,550
I'm not saying I'll do anything.

728
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,930
And I know very well
that you don't like me.

729
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:28,940
I thought I'd be able
to act like nothing happened.

730
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,194
But it's difficult.

731
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,748
I guess I'm the one
who needs to apologize.

732
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,668
I'm sorry…

733
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,462
for liking you.

734
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,010
Well…

735
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,055
I'm going to be late. I should get going.

736
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,357
It wasn't meaningless.

737
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,943
So I won't apologize.

738
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,575
But I'm not sure how I feel.

739
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,321
Hey, guys. I'm here.

740
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,073
Hey, Do-hyeok.

741
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,283
How have you been?

742
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,868
Good. Just the two of us.

743
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,704
-What's this?
-It's nothing special.

744
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,916
You look really happy.

745
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,627
He's the owner of a restaurant now.

746
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,004
I don't think that's it.

747
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,048
Your face is totally glowing.

748
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,636
I'm in a pretty good mood these days.

749
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:22,929
What?

750
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,683
-I get it.
-What?

751
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,603
You're finally dating someone, right?

752
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,146
It's not that.

753
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,607
-Is it true? Who is it?
-No.

754
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,317
That girl from before?

755
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,611
Well…

756
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,637
PARK JAE-EON

757
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,070
PARK JAE-EON

758
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,116
PARK JAE-EON

759
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:50,952
Do you want to go see butterflies?

760
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,139
I'll be there soon.

761
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,642
Na-bi keeps looking somewhere else
instead of looking at me.

762
01:04:56,726 --> 01:05:00,980
Na-bi. I really wish you were happy.

763
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,356
Do you like him?

764
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,733
Let's not make another mistake.

765
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:07,236
Maybe Na-bi was already drifting
away from me.

766
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,447
Can we meet right now?

767
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,324
If it's not urgent, let's meet next time.

768
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,451
Did you eventually lose to Jae-eon?

769
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:15,912
Maybe it was all wrong from the beginning.

770
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,747
I can't find a solution.

771
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,081
I miss you.

772
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,918
I'm not used to how I am
when I'm with Na-bi.

773
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:26,005
Have you felt, even once,
that he sincerely likes you?

774
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,049
Do you really think this is a mistake?

775
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,717
-Of course.
-That's a lie.

776
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,345
Let's go out.

777
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:37,516
