1
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,000
Childe Leng, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,680
It's okay,

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,440
it's okay,

4
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,120
Zhou Luochen,

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,600
I'll be angry if you don't get up.

6
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,480
Zhou Luochen.

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,160
What is it?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
What about this one?

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,040
This one suits you well.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,480
This one doesn't look good either.

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,680
They are all so ugly.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,680
Miss,

13
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,680
the investigation is clear,

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,200
When Childe Zhou and Miss Xu were in Yangzhou City,

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,160
they ate the black chicken of Wu Yaoyang, the leader of the Five Poison Sect, by mistake.

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,200
I heard that

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,240
the black-bone chicken is fed by precious treasures,

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,560
The pills made from his flesh and blood,

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,120
can warm and tonify kidney yang,

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,080
The essence of tonifying,

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,840
but,

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,680
But what?

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,760
But those two ate all the black-bone chicken,

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,640
which was too much to make up.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,480
Every time the moon is full,

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,200
my spirit will run amok,

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,680
What makes people

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,760
yearn for? Go on.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm eager to go to Wushan with others

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,760
to have fun.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,960
It's about the sex and rain.

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,840
What he said,

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,800
could it be,

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,280
Isn't that what you're doing?

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,880
Zhou Luochen.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,720
Help!

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,200
This is

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,920
Xu Yinuo's cry.

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,560
Could it be?

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,760
Luo Chen,

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
you still can't control yourself, right?

42
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,200
Miss,

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
don't cry.

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,400
Zhou Luochen,

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,640
what do you want now?

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,760
Xu Yinuo,

47
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,720
how dare you ask me?

48
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,120
I almost choked to death.

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,760
Here you are.

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,720
I can't believe he's in danger.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,520
I don't want it.

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,160
Zhou Luochen,

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
don't be shameless.

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,680
Xu Yinuo,

55
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
calm down.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
The world is so beautiful.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,480
But I'm so indulgent.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,960
This is not good.

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Not good.

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,760
Luo Chen,

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,400
don't touch me!

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,560
Luo Chen, don't be angry anymore.

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,200
Go away!

64
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,200
Zhou Luochen,

65
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,160
You,

66
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,880
What are you doing?

67
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm warning you.

68
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,200
Don't act rashly.

69
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Otherwise,

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,440
you can be angry tomorrow,

71
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,160
Today,

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,840
let's get things done first.

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,680
Get things done.

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,160
Okay.

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,280
Then tell me,

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,560
what exactly are we going to do?

77
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,520
Today is the full moon night,

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,640
Then I.

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm going to transform.

80
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,720
Sure, Zhou Luochen.

81
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
I'm really tired of living

82
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,160
Hey,

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
Why did you only tie me up?

84
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,120
Don't move.

85
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,520
Xu Yinuo,

86
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,960
let go of me!

87
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,440
What rope

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,440
can tie me up? Just stay here.

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,160
Hey,

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,520
I'm thirsty,

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,280
I want to drink water,

92
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,040
Xu Yinuo,

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,720
do you have humanity?

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,240
So annoying.

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,240
Luo Chen,

96
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,400
I've prepared fried chicken for you.

97
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,080
I did it

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,680
on purpose. Why are you here?

99
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,280
Luo Chen,

100
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,720
why are you tied up like this?

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,000
Are you

102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,120
making a promise now?

103
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,640
What are you doing?

104
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,360
Don't touch me!

105
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,520
Let me untie the rope

106
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,440
for you. Go away.

107
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,440
Leave the fried chicken.

108
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,520
Luo Chen.

109
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,200
Luo Chen,

110
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,440
what are you doing?

111
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,840
Although,

112
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,360
I've always liked you,

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,560
But,

114
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,600
don't you think we're a little bit,

115
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,160
Too,

116
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,840
Is it too fast?

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,200
Get out!

118
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,760
Sword worship meeting postponed,

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,920
Master Tang,

120
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,560
What do you want us

121
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,640
to tell the audience in front of the TV,

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Everyone is waiting to watch the game.

123
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes,

124
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,880
I bought the exclusive title

125
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,560
for the opening ceremony of the Sword Worship Conference,

126
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,520
32thousand,

127
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,320
the silver is gone.

128
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,680
Master Tang,

129
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,000
if those contestants were here,

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,920
If you stay for one more month,

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,160
it will cost a lot of money.

132
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,400
How are we going to calculate the performance

133
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,120
of our accounting office?

134
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,880
Our casino

135
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,760
is open.

136
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,240
Now you're telling me it's over.

137
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,200
What do you want me to compensate those who bet?

138
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,920
That's right. If you say you don't want to compete,

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
then you don't want to compete.

140
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
My 32 thousand silver,

141
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
you have to solve the problem.

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,920
You've gone too far.

143
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't make so much noise.

144
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
Can you solve the problem by quarreling?

145
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
I also want to know what to do.

146
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,800
Where's my 32 thousand silver?

147
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,640
It's gone.

148
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,840
You have to give me an explanation.

149
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,160
With what you said,

150
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
why are you making so much noise?

151
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,600
A bunch of old men are whining,

152
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,760
Hunian.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Where am I?

154
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,600
My head hurts.

155
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,240
Not good.

156
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,240
Luckily, the clothes are still here.

157
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,320
How was Zhou Luochen last night?

158
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,200
I shouldn't have been greedy to eat that black-bone chicken,

159
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,600
instead of eating black-bone chicken,

160
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,880
I won't lose my memory every full moon night.

161
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,440
Forget it.

162
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,320
Let's go back and see Zhou Luochen.

163
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,920
Wait.

164
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,000
Why does the person in this painting look so familiar?

165
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,360
Why did Leng Wuyou draw me?

166
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,200
Me

167
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,120
This is the medicine I made for you

168
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
last night. Where am I?

169
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,560
Yesterday,

170
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,760
you had a toxic attack,

171
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
He almost killed Su Qi.

172
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,240
Luckily, I followed you all the way to the ruined temple.

173
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,520
Is Su Qi okay?

174
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,200
