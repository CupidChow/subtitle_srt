1
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,600
Please come in.

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,880
Master Tang,

3
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,640
that's great.

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,760
You haven't rested yet.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,800
Why are you here?

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm grateful to you for saving my life.

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,800
specially

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,040
I prepared some gifts.

9
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,200
If it's gold,

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,040
I'll accept it without hesitation.

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,400
Oh, by the way,

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,440
This is.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,360
Master Tang, you're too kind.

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,480
Well

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,520
How did Master Tang know I was hungry and thirsty?

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:27,600
How did Master Tang know I was hungry and thirsty?

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,280
Sword Saint and his wife are really extraordinary.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,800
This is the highest concentration wine in our villa.

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,800
Commonly known as alcohol,

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,240
it's alcohol for guests

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,520
to disinfect.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm making you anxious,

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,080
Then.

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,560
I'll take my leave now.

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,160
Rest early, gentlemen.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,960
See you tomorrow.

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,480
Xu Yinuo.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,520
Xu Yinuo.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,960
Mine

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,560
All the gold is mine.

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,760
Zhou Luochen,

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,160
let me tell you,

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,800
Don't think about my dowry.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,240
I won't give you a penny.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,880
Xu Yinuo,

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,640
you're such a cheapskate.

37
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,120
What the hell is that?

38
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
It tastes so bad.

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Have you found the coffee beans I asked you to find for me?

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,840
Everyone in the clan has gone to look for it.

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,040
I haven't found it yet.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,560
Second Master,

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,960
didn't you say that only the contestants

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,280
can attend the ceremony?

45
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,120
She

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,160
You can bring a maid,

47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,600
Yes.

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,440
She,

49
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
Well,

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,400
in this Sword Worship Conference,

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,360
I sponsored 102 pieces of silver,

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
and I want to bring some maids.

53
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,760
Just a few maids.

54
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
What do you care?

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,480
Which sect are you from?

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Do you know the rules of the Sword Congress?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,520
We are from the Western Regions'Fire Worship Sect, because

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,840
Saint Girl likes to be lively,

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,000
So I bought a sword sticker,

60
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,520
and I bought a rich one.

61
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,160
Isn't that great?

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,640
That's amazing.

63
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,160
Calm down.

64
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,480
Don't argue with them.

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,560
Calm down. I don't know about

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,040
the wealth of the Fire-worshiping Sect.

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,160
Can you compare with her Imperial Sword Villa?

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,200
Where did the beggar come from?

69
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,160
It's dirty for my eyes.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,880
You can insult me,

71
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,400
but you can't insult us beggars.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,800
Because the Beggars'Gang is

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,680
the best in the world.

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,480
Sorry,

75
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Everyone

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm late.

77
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm waiting for you two.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,560
Hurry up.

79
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,520
Su Qi,

80
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,600
you're everywhere.

81
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,400
Luo Chen,

82
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,600
I finally found you.

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,280
Come here.

84
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,440
Song Ningyan,

85
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,280
You.

86
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,680
Are you okay?

87
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,600
Luo Chen, come here!

88
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,880
I'd better stay here.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
Childe Leng.

90
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Miss Xu,

91
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
we are destined to be together.

92
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:34,960
Yes,

93
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,080
I remember now.

94
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,520
You're the one who saved me on the city wall.

95
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
It's you guys.

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,920
Now that everyone is here,

97
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,080
I'll announce.

98
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,640
we

99
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,440
See you tonight.

100
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,080
What?

101
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,080
Well,

102
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
It's just started.

103
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
You haven't even had a cup of tea.

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
I just came in.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,120
I haven't been here for a long time.

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,680
What's wrong with you?

107
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,200
Hey,

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,200
Are you serious?

109
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
This is so weird.

110
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:11,960
Hello.

111
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,280
Babies,

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,320
go find your mom.

113
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,280
Okay,

114
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,840
Now that everyone is here,

115
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,280

Well,

126

This one

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,640
There's nothing in the box.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
But is it important?

129
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,200
It's not important.

130
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Why?

131
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,920
To be safe,

132
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,560
next,

133
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,920
For the last time,

134
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,480
please take the sword.

135
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,240
There really is a sword.

136
