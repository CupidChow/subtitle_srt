1
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,160
Tell me,

2
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,600
you handsome guys,

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,000
You only lie to girls all day,

4
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,080
besides that,

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,760
What else can I do?

6
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,560
Sure.

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,720
There's nothing you can do.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm not a jerk.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,440
I'm an actress.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,200
actor

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,360
That's all

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,480
I can drink.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,000
Xu Yinuo,

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,520
I'm back.

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,440
Come and eat.

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,800
I don't want to eat.

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,240
I want to drink.

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,760
Here you are.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,760
Drinking?

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,120
I'm working

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,120
so hard at home,

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,480
You went out to have fun.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,040
It's not fun.

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,360
It stinks.

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,600
You smell like alcohol.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,960
Poetry.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,880
What is this?

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,480
I stole it when I was drinking with the landlady.

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,000
What do you think?

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,600
Smells good, right?

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
You can write poems.

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,400
I didn't write them.

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,240
It was written to her by her ex-boyfriend.

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,600
All I have to do

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
is sing.

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,600
Forget it.

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,200
I'll take it if you don't want it.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Hold on.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,360
You were my favorite

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,560
when I first met you.

41
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,960
When I first saw it,

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
it was like a hundred flowers in full bloom.

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,600
Just like your face.

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,080
It's red now.

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,640
I was waiting for a door,

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,920
burst through

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,520
A few words of expectation.

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,800
Xu Yinuo,

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,120
let's watch the fireworks.

50
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,840
Let's go!

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,240
Hurry up!

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,880
Xu Yinuo,

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,480
look over there.

54
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,160
Qingge,

55
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,120
don't you think it's beautiful?

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,320
Just so-so.

57
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,360
This is the second time this month that the spark of love has been set off, right?

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,120
Someone has found love again.

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,280
This kind of person is disgusting.

60
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,240
Show off your love

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,960
and show off your wealth?

62
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,160
Although 50 liang is indeed quite expensive,

63
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,480
love is priceless.

64
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,880
Love is priceless.

65
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,040
But,

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
I don't have money,

67
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,440
No,

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,240
It's okay. I don't want

69
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,640
the spark of love.

70
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,120
Wild flowers on the roadside are fine too.

71
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,440
If there's no such thing,

72
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,960
you're enough.

73
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,480
Li Xia,

74
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,720
I'll try my best.

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,120
Qingge,

76
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,760
don't you think,

77
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,920
Is it a little cold

78
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,960
outside now?

79
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,240
Could you please

80
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,360
Help me

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,520
Warm.

82
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,280
Well,

83
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,920
I might not be able to do that.

84
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm cold too.

85
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,440
Let me tell you,

86
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,520
there's an inn behind here,

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,280
You can take a sauna,

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,600
which is much more useful than drinking hot water.

89
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,480
Li Xia,

90
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
I'm sorry,

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,160
Me,

92
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,600
I might have lost my mind for a moment,

93
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,920
so I said this.

94
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,040
Don't be angry.

95
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,560
You've come

96
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,760
to your senses.

97
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,680
Yeah,

98
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,440
it just occurred to me,

99
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,720
That inn only accepts male guests,

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,560
so I'll go there.

101
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,600
Go to the one on North Street.

102
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,680
Xu Yinuo.

103
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,920
Let's get to work.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,600
It's only a few days.

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
Day by day,

106
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,160
I don't let people sleep well.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,480
Forget it if you can't sleep well.

108
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,160
The key is that the food is not good.

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,120
Don't you know?

110
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
People are iron, rice is steel,

111
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,240
how can we work if we don't have enough to eat?

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Pickled this week.

113
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,680
Forget it. It's good

114
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,360
that you can't starve to death.

115
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,760
What are you doing?

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,320
Xu Yinuo,

117
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm so hot.

118
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,600
I feel like I'm on fire.

119
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm so dizzy.

120
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,400
My mind

121
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,200
is full of little stars,

122
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Something's wrong with me.

123
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,760
I feel like my heart

124
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,560
is about to explode.

125
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,920
Why are you blushing?

126
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,200
Are you sick?

127
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,320
I can't take advantage of people's danger.

128
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,120
Xu Yinuo,

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
I can't help it anymore.

130
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,960
I'm 24 years old,

131
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
although it's the legal age to get married.

132
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,680
What are you waiting for?

133
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
I didn't brush my teeth.

134
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,760
I don't care.

135
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,600
If you move your feet again,

136
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,760
I'll start talking.

137
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Don't regret it.

138
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,280
I won't regret it.

139
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,840
Zhou Luochen,

140
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,400
Zhou Luochen,

141
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,200
-Help! -Doctor,

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,880
Help!

143
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,840
Doctor,

144
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,720
buy some medicine.

145
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,240
What symptoms?

146
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,800
Burn,

147
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,400
It's burning badly.

148
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,920
That's because of the virus,

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
a lot of people have been infected recently,

150
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,040
People will die.

151
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Look over there.

152
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,000
That's right,

153
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,800
That's right.

154
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,200
Just like that.

155
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,680
Virus particles,

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,800
20 taels,

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,680
Robbery? Is the virus

158
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,400
so popular lately?

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,760
20 taels.

160
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,040
It's not too expensive anymore.

161
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you want to buy it or not?

162
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,800
Don't delay my business if I don't buy it.

163
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,760
Look at them.

164
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,960
I'm dying.

165
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,160
He's waiting for me to save him.

166
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,440
I got it.

167
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,320
Wait for me.

168
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
I'm going to get some money.

169
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,080
Hurry up and come back.

170
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,600
The medicine will be sold out soon.

171
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,920
Boss,

172
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,440
I want to return my clothes.

173
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
My family is sick and in urgent need of money,

174
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,680
