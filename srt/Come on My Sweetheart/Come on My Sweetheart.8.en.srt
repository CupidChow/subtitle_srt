1
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,600
My kidney,

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,480
you know.

3
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm so happy.

4
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,040
I'm talented,

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,760
for my princess's best friends,

6
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,200
I also prepared a few small gifts,

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,480
please accept them.

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,320
Really?

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,440
Do we have all of them?

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,320
Of course,

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,120
Of course.

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,840
Thank you.

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,400
However,

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,000
there is one more requirement,

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,120
Just mention it.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,840
Go ahead,

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,840
go ahead,

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,560
At this point,

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,400
when it's a good day and a beautiful view,

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
My princess and I

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,680
have more important things to do.

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,840
Please

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,200
Please understand,

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,240
understand,

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,280
We'll get going.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,880
Take care.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,680
Wait for me.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,520
No,

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,480
I won't.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,360
What do you think?

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,800
Madam,

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,440
is my acting okay?

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,880
Your acting is pretty good.

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,080
Now,

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,920
Look at those three hillbillies who can't be killed.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,760
Of course.

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm a professional.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
in view of

39
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,240
With your good acting skills,

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,360
I've decided to let you

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,080
and that girl take a day off,

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
Go to the accounting room and pay 20 taels of silver.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
By the way,

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
make two new clothes,

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,080
Really?

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,360
Thank you, madam.

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,720
Xu Yinuo,

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,240
we have a holiday.

49
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,840
They have sword stickers.

50
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,880
Who are they?

51
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,360
Boss,

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,840
how much is this dress?

53
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,640
20 taels,

54
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,360
18 taels, okay?

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:13,880
Okay,

56
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,360
Deal.

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,360
Su Qi,

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,320
you're really everywhere.

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,560
What

60
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,560
a coincidence.

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,000
Thank you, Zhou Luochen. I

62
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,720
didn't expect this dress to be so expensive.

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,120
It costs 88 taels of silver.

64
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,240
It's okay.

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,440
I'm rich,

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,600
be rich

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
Do you feel that the atmosphere is not right?

68
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,640
I think so.

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
It's usually very lively,

70
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,600
Now there's no one here.

71
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,240
The Zoroastrianism is here.

72
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,680
Bad news.

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,320
The Zoroastrianism is here.

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,960
Let's go!

75
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,960
Zoroastrianism,

76
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
Zoroastrianism is here.

77
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Run!

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
It's really Zoroastrianism.

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,200
Run!

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,720
Run!

81
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,160
Auntie,

82
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,640
don't go!

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,360
How dare you!

84
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,480
How dare you be unruly,

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,040
yet you dare to stand in the way of the Saint Girl.

86
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,040
What kind of person?

87
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,400
How dare you stop the Holy Lady's carriage?

88
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,520
What a brilliant strategy!

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,920
Old man

90
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,360
Leng Wuyou,

91
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,160
Are you okay?

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,080
Old man,

93
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
let's step aside first.

94
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,640
Come on,

95
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,520
Be careful.

96
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,280
Grandma,

97
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,480
I've learned boning,

98
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,320
Let me show you.

99
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,280
You even know how to straighten your bones?

100
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,480
What do you think?

101
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,320
I think I can move.

102
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,920
All right,

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,880
I feel much better.

104
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,760
All right.

105
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,080
It's okay.

106
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,960
Grandma, be careful.

107
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,520
Thank you.

108
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,200
Thank you.

109
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,720
Thank you.

110
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,920
Hey,

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,040
Xu Yinuo,

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,920
have you seen enough?

113
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,840
It's getting late.

114
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,280
We have to go back to the inn.

115
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,920
Otherwise,

116
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,000
it's time for the madam to rush me.

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,960
Hold on.

118
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,520
May I have your name?

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,360
You look like an old friend of mine.

120
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,080
Hey, bro,

121
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,880
you're too old-fashioned

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,920
to strike up a conversation.

123
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,920
My name is

124
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,880
Song Ning Yan,

125
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,360
your name is Song Ning Yan?

126
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,080
Song Ningyan,

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,840
right?

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,800
Why is she ignoring me?

129
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,040
She's highly nearsighted,

130
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,400
probably because

131
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,880
she didn't wear it on the sun,

132
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,960
That's right.

133
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,520
Do you know the new Saint Virgin of Zoroastrianism?

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,480
Do you know him

135
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,200
or not,

136
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,480
She also looks a lot

137
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,720
like an old friend of ours,

138
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,560
But no.

139
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
That's right,

140
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,120
bro.

141
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,160
I can assure you.

142
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,880
Don't look at them. They're pretty,

143
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,360
right?

144
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,600
It's impossible for them to know the Saint Virgin of Zoroastrianism.

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
They're about to become the disciples of my Beggars'Gang.

146
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Right?

147
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,560
No,

148
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,840
I was wrong just now.

149
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm Leng Wuyou.

150
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,080
It's the leader of Shence Mansion. Nice

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
to meet you.

152
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,000
My name is

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,880
Zhou Luochen,

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,560
Her name is Xu Yinuo

155
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,080
and his name is Su Qi,

156
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,840
We have a long time ahead of us

157
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,080
Ah, no.

158
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,960
I won't see you

159
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,840
in the future. Bye.

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,840
Go, go, go, go, go,

161
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,600
go, go, go, go, go, go.

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,280
Let's go.

163
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,560
Bye.

164
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,600
Is it really not you?

165
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,560
Xiaoman.

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,720
Master,

167
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
this is the sword post of Tianlei Sect.

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
The two elders of Tianlei Sect

169
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,640
have been disposed of by me.

170
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,680
That's great.

171
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,480
The Imperial Sword Villa sent out ten sword posts this time,

172
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,120
and now we have obtained six.

173
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,440
The remaining four

174
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,240
are in the Infinite Gate,

175
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
Among Xing Yue Sect,

176
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,160
Beggars'Gang and Five Poison Sect,

177
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,440
These sects

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,120
are tough bones to chew on.

179
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,080
Be extra careful.

180
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,760
Yes.

181
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,480
You may leave.

Master,

I found a new sword post.

184
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,360
Where is it?

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,560
In the hands of

186
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,200
a man named Zhou Luochen,

187
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,320
I've checked.

188
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
I didn't find any background.

189
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,920
He's staying

190

at Sifang Inn

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Zhou Luochen,

192
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
My name is Leng Wuyou.

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,080
Her name is Xu Yinuo

198
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,720
and his name is Su Qi,

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
We have a long time ahead of us

200
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,040
Ah, no.

201
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,600
I won't see you

202
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,760
in the future. See you there.

203
