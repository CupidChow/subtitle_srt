1
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,800
Childe Leng,

2
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,120
looking at your face, you don't change your color and your heart doesn't beat,

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,960
You won.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,000
To you for being a hero.

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,880
After you,

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,320
Childe Zhou.

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,600
You can treat me first.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's all.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,520
Really?

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,920
Are they going to start?

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,520
That's right.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,120
The two contestants are ready for the final battle.

13
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,120
At the same time, they ate the red pepper

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,480
symbolizing determination.

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,240
After eating Rejuvenation Red Pepper,

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,440
they are about to face the final test.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,520
Ouch! Death-taking Soul-taking Pot?

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,680
Now let's hold our breath

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,880
and concentrate on the final battle.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,240
It's not spicy at all.

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,440
Please.

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,280
What are you doing?

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,520
Let's go together.

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,920
Let's do it first.

25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,280
I won.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,800
I won.

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,400
There's only one bowl of instant noodles left.

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,040
Go ahead.

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,720
I'm not hungry.

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,760
I want to lose weight.

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,880
When you become a superstar in the future,

32
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
you should eat it.

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
How about we eat half for each of us?

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,120
Okay?

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,640
Okay.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Did you burn your stomach?

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,720
I'm fine.

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,840
No way.

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,320
It'll leave a scar.

40
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
It's okay.

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm a master.

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,480
It's normal to have a scar,

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,320
but when I see the scar on your stomach in the future,

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
I knew it was you.

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,280
Don't make so much noise.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,800
There's only one seat in here.

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,920
Line up.

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,960
Line up.

49
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Line up at the back.

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,080
This is such a stupid toilet.

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,440
Why is there no toilet paper?

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,360
Get out of the way.

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,760
How could he cut in line?

54
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,880
Line up.

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,640
I can't take it.

56
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240
Toilet paper.

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,840
I forgot to mention,

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,600
toilet paper

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,400
There's also a charge.

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,560
What?

61
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,320
How much

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:31,840
is it?

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,360
10 taels?

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,440
10 taels?

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,600
Why don't you just rob the bank?

66
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,440
It's illegal to rob a bank.

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,240
Besides,

68
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
this business sells toilet paper,

69
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,880
It's about your love and my wish.

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,960
You don't have to.

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,480
Am I right?

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,440
Here,

73
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,960
Toilet paper.

74
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,320
Toilet paper. Hurry up.

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,360
Line up.

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,720
Master,

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,440
wait in line too.

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,080
Treasure Pavilion was stolen.

79
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,000
What did you lose?

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,400
I've sent someone to check it.

81
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,320
I lost a lot of things.

82
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,360
What?

83
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,120
Mu Feng,

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,080
stop.

85
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,320
Sister, what are you talking about?

86
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,120
I don't understand.

87
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you understand?

88
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,280
Tomorrow is Mu Yun's death anniversary.

89
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,480
Vengeance has no time to be avenged.

90
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,360
Besides,

91
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,920
that's enough.

92
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,080
Other than telling the truth to our brothers,

93
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,920
what else can you do?

94
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,120
All of this happened because of those people outside.

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,880
Including you.

96
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,440
That's what you think?

97
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,200
I'm tired.

98
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,160
Mu Feng,

99
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,720
get out.

100
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,840
Okay,

101
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm leaving.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,600
However,

103
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
I hope you won't make mistakes again and again.

104
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,200
In this way, Mu Yun

105
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,440
can rest in peace in the grave

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,600
Sis,

107
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,880
Have you thought it through?

108
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,960
Don't blame me.

109
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,960
Don't blame

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,880
my silly brother,

111
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,120
You're right. It's all Hunian's fault.

112
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,680
I didn't take good care of your brother.

113
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Please forgive me.

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,800
Sis,

115
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,280
Don't die.

116
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,200
Sis,

117
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,480
Don't die, okay?

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,680
Sister.

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,320
Sister.

120
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,360
After nearly a month of fierce competition,

121
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,040
this Sword Worship Conference has finally come to an end.

122
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,160
Next,

123
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,040
let me introduce you.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,120
The rules of the third round,

125
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
the rules of this round are very simple,

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,840
Similar,

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,080
Hide and seek,

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
I'll be the pursuer.

129
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,000
As escapees,

130
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,880
isn't it easy?

131
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,800
As a genius,

132
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,840
I have given this project

133
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,600
a very nice name.

134
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,800
Run away, bro.

135
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,080
Run, bro.

136
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
Run, bro.

137
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Now I announce,

138
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
the competition begins.

139
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,560
Three.

140
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,400
Two.

141
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,880
One.

142
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,640
Come on!

143
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,960
The sword

144
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,440
is on fire.
