1
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,400
Who are you?

2
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes.

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Why are you chasing us?

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,760
You love me. I love you.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,920
Big drumsticks are delicious.

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,760
Hand over the sword stickers,

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,000
and I'll spare your lives.

8
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
Our Tianlei Sect is all dead.

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,360
I won't give it to you.

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,880
Okay,

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,560
Then I'll let you go.

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:00,720
Hey.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,200
It's her.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,160
It's you.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,440
Zhou Luochen, go, go, go, go,

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,120
go, go, go, go, go, go,

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,600
Let's go!

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I knew you would come to me.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,920
Don't think I don't know you

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,040
just because I'm wearing a mask.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,480
Who is this?

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,240
Let me take a good look.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,840
This little guy looks pretty.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,760
It looks familiar.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,440
I don't care.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,200
Anyway, I,

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,000
Miss,

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,960
Are you okay?

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,920
I'm not drunk.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,120
I told you,

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm not drunk.

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,800
I just want to buy medicine for Zhou Luochen.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,120
You drank a little bit,

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,880
Miss,

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,160
You're really drunk.

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm not drunk.

37
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,360
I am

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,560
Xu Yinuo,

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,240
Come on, landlady.

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,360
-There's a handsome guy

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,720
here. -Strange. Did he see a ghost in broad daylight?

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,200
Forget it. Let's save Zhou Luochen first.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,680
Gosh,

44
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,160
you two,

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
One is poisoned

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,480
and the other is drunk.

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,880
I'm exhausted.

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,120
Madam,

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,400
this is a gift I bought for you.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,880
What is this?

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,160
It's cheap,

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,400
but,

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,720
but

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,360
I think it will look great on you.

55
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,640
Then all the men in the world

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,000
will like you.

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,560
Silly girl,

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,160
lie down and rest.

59
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,200
I'll get some hangover medicine.

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,440
I'll be back soon.

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,920
I didn't expect this silly girl to be so thoughtful.

62
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,880
Xu Yinuo,

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,200
Xu Yinuo,

64
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,320
Where have you been?

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,120
I've been looking for you for a long time.

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,720
You,

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,240
How did you recover?

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,600
Xu Yinuo,

69
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,200
what are you doing?

70
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,200
What's that smell?

71
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,040
You're done.

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,480
You drank so much in the morning,

73
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,400
are you going to die?

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
Since you've recovered,

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,280
let's continue.

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,080
Continue what?

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
What do you want to continue?

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,240
You kissed me first.

79
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,000
If you move your feet again,

80
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
I'll start talking.

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,160
Don't regret it.

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,600
I don't regret it.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,520
original

84
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,640
I didn't expect her to care so much about me.

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,280
If you hadn't fainted,

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,800
we would have,

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,040
All right,

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,040
I'll help you to bed first,

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,800
Don't sleep.

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,960
I don't want to sleep.

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,160
I don't want to sleep.

92
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,520
I'll get you the antidote.

93
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,720
Don't go.

94
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,520
How did you recover?

95
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,840
How can you recover?

96
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,040
I knew it.

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
You must want to kiss me

98
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,000
because you're sick.

99
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,880
Be good,

100
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,160
Xu Yinuo.

101
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,120
You haven't brushed your teeth yet.

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Two days ago,

103
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,720
I asked my husband to buy me a ring.

104
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Unexpectedly,

105
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,480
he bought so many clothes for me

106
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,480
and couldn't even wear them?

107
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,880
My husband,

108
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,880
I told him,

109
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,320
Give me a gold bracelet.

110
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,400
He bought me a whole gold mine.

111
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,200
Nan Feng,

112
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,160
Touch,

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,040
Touch,

114
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,800
this month, my husband,

115
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,040
You just gave me pocket money,

116
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
and I bought a 17-in yard on the main street,

117
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,240
Come and have fun whenever you have time.

118
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,960
That's great,

119
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,560
Tangtang.

120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,440
Why have you been single for so long?

121
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,720
As for a woman,

122
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,600
the older she gets,

123
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,240
the harder it is to find a girlfriend,

124
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,640
Are you still infatuated with your first lover?

125
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,640
He's been dead for 20 years.

126
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,280
Oh, no.

127
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
My dear little princess,

128
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm sorry,

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,080
I'm late.

130
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
So handsome.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,600
Tangtang,

132
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,520
who is he?

133
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,880
You love me too.

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm also in love,

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,360
with one heart and one mind,

136
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Earth turns into gold,

137
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,840
workers and peasants,

138
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
We're brothers

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
and soul mates,

140
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,320
Tuanjieqing,

141
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,560
why are you here?

142
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,520
It's because I can't see you.

143
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,280
I can't eat enough,

144
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,280
I can't sleep enough,

145
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,160
So,

146
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,200
here I am.

147
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,480
silver ticket

148
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,400
Many.

149
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,440
Can I have one?

150
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,000
12thousand。 .

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,640
Follow me.

152
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,800
Let's go.

153
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,160
I won't like you.

154
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,840
You can leave.

155
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,440
No.

156
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,920
Just like these silver tickets,

157
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,680
if you don't use them,

158
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,320
They have no meaning.

159
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,880
Just like

160
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,000
if I can't get your love,

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,200
He lost

162
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
his soul.

163
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,560
So handsome.

164
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,080
Please allow me to love you.

165
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,680
because

166
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,440
This is the only meaning

167
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,560
of my life in this world,

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
Be together.

169
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Promise him.

170
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,440
No.

171
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,960
We are not suitable for each other.

172
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,240
You're still young.

173
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,960
As for me,

174
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm already half old.

175
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,760
