1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,120
Brother,

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,760
I've got everything ready.

3
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,840
I'm sure everything will be safe.

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,200
That's good.

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,560
But be on guard at all times.

6
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,160
We need to use this Sword Worship Meeting

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,280
to retrieve the glory of Imperial Sword Villa.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,240
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,800
Xu Yinuo,

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,400
why do you think Master Tang

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,960
suddenly changed us to this cabin?

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,040
Who told Song Ningyan to stay in our room?

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,280
I can't

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,240
help it. She's rich,

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,760
It hurts,

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,960
Do you know how to do it or not?

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,360
You're so spoiled.

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,040
I just squeezed it twice.

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,520
I even dislocated your arm.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,240
Xu Yinuo,

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,120
how dare you do this to me.

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm not done with you.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,960
What's that sound?

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,560
Don't move.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,760
It hurts a little the first time.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,480
It hurts,

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,400
It hurts,

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,680
It's Luo Chen's brother Xu Yinuo.

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,120
He's not flirting with Luo Chen, is he?

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,800
You do it.

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,400
Bear with it.

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
It hurts a little the first time.

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,640
It hurts,

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:38,960
No way.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,120
I'm going to save Brother Luo Chen,

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Brother Luo Chen,

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
I'm here.

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,160
All right,

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,760
Xu Yinuo,

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,320
I didn't expect you to know this.

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,680
What is this?

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,200
My knee

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,160
fell off a building

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,120
ten years ago,

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,320
There are ten nails

46
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,240
in this arm.

47
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,320
Two years ago,

48
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,800
I was dragged by a horse for two kilometers.

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,720
And this belly,

50
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
there's a red mark on it,

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,120
The instant noodles are hot,

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,400
and on my chest,

53
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,160
Don't look at it.

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,080
Stop looking.

55
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,040
What are you doing?

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,480
Luo Chen,

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,640
have you really come this far?

58
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,360
Song Ningyan,

59
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,760
it's not what you think.

60
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,840
I dislocated my arm.

61
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,320
Xu Yinuo is helping me reset,

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,240
Yes.

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,120
reset

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,080
You need to take off your clothes to reset.

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,520
I didn't take off my clothes.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,960
We were just

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,000
looking at the wound,

68
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:37,960
Yes.

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,520
Wound,

70
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,000
Luo Chen,

71
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,960
Would you rather see her wound?

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,200
You don't want to look at me.

73
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,880
Her wound is healed.

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,240
My heart is bleeding.

75
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Zhou Luochen,

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
my wound is bleeding.

77
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,760
Luo Chen,

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,200
No.

79
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,600
No!

80
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,080
Looks like the old saying is right.

81
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,040
If a woman goes crazy,

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,600
I won't stop.

83
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,840
There's nothing to do with men.

84
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,680
Help!

85
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,600
So cruel.

86
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,200
No.

87
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,160
I'm not stopping.

88
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,680
Wake up!

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,680
Bad news.

90
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
Did someone set us up?

91
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,040
Do I have to ask?

92
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,800
Can we tie ourselves up?

93
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,760
But why did you just tie us up?

94
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,080
Aren't you going to kill us?

95
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,240
Could it be that

96
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,560
this is the sound of the Sword Worship Conference.

97
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,560
If you're late,

98
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,160
you'll be disqualified.

99
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't care about this stupid competition.

100
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,240
I'd rather be tied up with Luo Chen.

101
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,320
Stop fooling around.

102
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,960
Song Ningyan,

103
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,680
Siyun Sword concerns our hope of going home.

104
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,120
We have to take part in the competition.

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,000
You're right.

106
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going back.

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480
You are no longer the Sword Saint couple.

108
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
Then we can separate.

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,880
Xu Yinuo,

110
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,640
don't you usually have a lot of strength?

111
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:21,960
Hurry up!

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,520
Break it.

113
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,880
Xu Yinuo,

114
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,840
aren't you usually strong?

115
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,000
You're so useless

116
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,440
today.

117
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,160
Sorry,

118
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,920
I didn't have breakfast,

119
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,800
Try again.

120
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,680
Come on!

121
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,920
Come on!

122
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,640
You made it.

123
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,760
Master Tang,

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,920
we still need one last ring,

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,680
Do you still want to knock?

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
No one came.

127
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,280
Knock what?

128
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,760
What's the point of not showing up alone?

129
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,360
By the way, what time did you announce it yesterday?

130
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,600
It's going to be too late.

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,520
Hurry up.

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,840
Childe Tang.

133
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,560
We're not late, are we?

134
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,480
The weather is not right.

135
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,240
You.

136
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,000
How do you do things?

137
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,120
Knock the gong an hour in advance,

138
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,800
No wonder no one came.

139
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,280
No.

140
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,840
Well,

141
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,480
Interbank reporter,

142
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,200
I don't know much about rules.

143
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,760
I'm fine.

144
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,960
Good morning.

145
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,480
Good morning,

146
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,120
Miss Song.

147
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,880
Mr. Tang,

148
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
have you found the earrings?

149
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,920
I found it.

150
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,480
Here we go.

151
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,640
Second Master,

152
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,000
why are these two so pale?

153
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,480
Where's

154
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Second Master's toilet?

155
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,000
The second phase of our villa hasn't built a toilet yet.

156
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,560
Where are we

157
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,600
going?

158
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,480
Damn it.

159
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,840
What's wrong with them?

160
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,240
Good morning, everyone.

161
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,280
Why is he here?

162
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,200
Good morning.

163
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,000
Good morning,

164
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,680
Miss Xu.

165
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,400
Morning,

166
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,080
Childe Leng,

167
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,000
have you eaten?

168
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,920
I've cleared the valley,

169
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,040
and I don't eat common things.

170
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,600
Nice.

171
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,120
I can't tell Childe Leng is so young.

172
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,320
Your cultivation is so advanced.

173
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,520
Did I oversleep?

174
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,000
They're all waiting for me.

175
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
