1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,760
What should we do?

2
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,000
Where is this place?

3
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,360
I can't figure it out.

4
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,560
Could it be that,

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,240
yes,

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,080
It must be.

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,360
We must have crossed it.

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,720
If my little orange can't see me,

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,520
she'll miss me so much

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,000
Who is my little orange?

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
It's my cat.

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,800
In this world,

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,560
what if we meet bad guys?

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,000
What if we don't have money?

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,960
We'll starve to death,

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,000
freeze to death,

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
Don't worry.

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,840
With me by your side,

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,840
no one dares to touch you.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,160
Your stomach is growling?

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,400
How could it be me?

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,880
Me

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,920
It must be you.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,560
Did you see that?

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,520
Yes, I did.

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,280
What a fat black-bone chicken.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,440
It's clearly a rooster.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,960
Take a good look.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,120
It's a black-bone chicken.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,560
Master,

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,120
you may leave.

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,800
Yes

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
You're here.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,640
Yes.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,240
Brother,

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,440
Siyun Sword has been cast,

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,560
That's right.

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,720
Our Imperial Sword Villa will return to its former glory.

39
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,320
Their martial arts skills are extraordinary.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,480
And he's wearing the Sword Saint Waist badge.

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,840
There's no doubt that they're the Sword Saint couple.

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,120
Now that you're here,

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,240
you have to use it for me.

44
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,400
In this Sword Worship Tournament,

45
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,320
the Five Poison Sect will definitely win the sword,

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,080
Rejuvenate your glory.

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,000
Master, you're amazing.

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
What if they don't agree?

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,200
You need to pay attention to strategy when you ask for help.

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,160
We'll sell it badly later.

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,120
To win their sympathy.

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,680
How bad is it?

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,000
Look at me.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,920
Let's go.

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,920
Let's go.

56
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,320
Mine.

57
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,800
Mine.

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,920
Then let's make a rock-paper-scissors decision

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,240
by guessing boxing

60
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,080
Okay,

61
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,880
Rock, paper,

62
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,840
scissors. That's great.

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,840
Hi,

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
The room smells so good.

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,400
What are you eating?

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,120
Sir.

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,000
You,

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,800
you guys

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,760
Let go of me

71
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,960
What's going on?

72
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,280
Are you hungry?

73
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,680
Xiaowu,

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,840
Xiaowu,

75
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,800
Xiaowu, Xiaowu,

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,520
you and I have been together for decades,

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,440
Why did you leave me alone today?

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,680
What do you want me to do?

79
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,440
What should we do?

80
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,000
Well,

81
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,640
there's a drumstick here,

82
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,160
How about you

83
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,440
Try it.

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,360
You're welcome.

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,320
Master, you can't die. Master,

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,120
what should I do if you die?

87
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,840
Sir.

88
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,400
Sir,

89
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,240
Sir,

90
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,000
Call the doctor!

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,960
What's going on?

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,960
I don't know.

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Brother Su Qi,

94
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,240
may I ask,

95
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,360
Clan Leader Wu, is he okay?

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,880
It's okay.

97
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,880
It's nothing.

98
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,760
That black-robed chicken

99
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
was raised by the clan master after his wife and daughter both died.

100
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,120
He devoted

101
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,440
all his efforts to it.

102
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,280
You just ate it?

103
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,440
You guys are so cruel.

104
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,080
Me,

105
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,400
I don't know either.

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,120
Yes.

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm sorry. Is it useful

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,080
to be sorry? Can you come back

109
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,720
with your black chicken?

110
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,520
Sir,

111
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,880
Xiaowu,

112
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,520
Sir,

113
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,560
Sir,

114
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,440
Sir.

115
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,840
actually

116
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,840
My deep relationship with that black-robed chicken is only one of them,

117
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,520
and two of them,

118
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,640
I raised the black-robed chicken with thousands of poisons.

119
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,920
It's poisonous.

120
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
You two won't live

121
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,280
long after eating.

122
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Really?

123
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,480
Clan Leader Wu,

124
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,680
do you have any antidote?

125
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,120
I'd like to

126
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,000
ask you two for a favor.

127
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,960
As long as you agree,

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I will do my best to develop the antidote.

129
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,400
What is it?

130
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,680
This is the sword post of the Sword Worship Conference,

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,040
I'd like to invite you two to participate in the competition on behalf of the Five Poison Sect,

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,520
Take the sword.

133
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,840
But we won't.

134
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,480
Don't worry,

135
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,520
since

136
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,080
We ate your favorite chicken,

137
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,080
so about this,

138
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,880
I'll take care of it.

139
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm on my way.

140
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,080
What are you waiting for?

141
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,680
If you don't leave, you can't leave.

142
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,600
Let's go!

143
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,560
Be careful on your way.

144
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,480
Go early and come back early.

145
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Goodbye, Clan Leader Wu.

146
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,480
Zhou Luochen, go!

147
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Hurry up!

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,480
Slow down.

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,480
The world is so beautiful.

150
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,320
So big.

151
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,360
Where did we go?

152
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,320
I can't figure out

153
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,840
what the media is.

154
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,680
Don't think about it if you can't figure it out.

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,960
As the saying goes,

156
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,160
take things as they come.

157
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,320
No way.

158
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,680
I must find a way to go back.

159
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,880
Think about it yourself.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm going to play.

161
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,520
Of course you think it's fun.

162
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,360
Xu Yinuo,

163
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,320
wait.

164
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,560
Xu Yinuo,
