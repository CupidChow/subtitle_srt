1
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,520
Legend of the Jianghu,

2
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,520
a famous martial art circle,

3
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Imperial Sword Villa,

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,040
you get the iron from beyond the heavens,

5
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,480
It's made into a peerless divine weapon,

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,240
named Siyun.

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,760
As soon as Siyun Sword came out,

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,720
the martial arts circle started to stir up again.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,320
There are even more malevolent people playing tricks on each other,

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,120
causing all sects to fight against each other.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,760
When the martial arts community

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,280
is in danger and dying,

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,400
The couple of hidden masters, Sword Saint,

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,520
are back in the world.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,760
Take up the banner of love and light,

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,440
and use your precious life

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,000
to quell the catastrophe

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,240
of the martial forest.

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,840
That's great.

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,880
We won!

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,520
That's great.

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,040
Why are you so silly?

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,160
Didn't you agree to let me protect you?

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,080
Do you love me?

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,440
I will always

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,720
Love

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,520
What are you doing?

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
What are you doing?

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,760
Achoo.

30
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,240
Zhou Luochen,

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,320
can you be more professional?

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,320
No problem.

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Oh, no.

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,800
It fell.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,160
Hold it.

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,960
Hurry up!

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,320
Director,

38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,080
what are you doing?

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,920
Director,

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,480
Look,

41
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,840
This is.

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,320
Cut.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,080
Xu Yinuo.

44
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,320
You must not know

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,440
my first kiss,

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,920
It's for the most important person to me.

47
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,240
Zhou Luochen, as an actress,

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,600
how could you lie to a ghost

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,840
with your first kiss?

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,240
You.

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,400
Which shameless little fox is it?

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,760
He kissed my brother Luo Chen,

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,480
Luo Chen,

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,200
Are you okay?

55
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,680
It's so mushy.

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,240
I'm leaving.

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
Who am I supposed to be?

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,600
In such a hurry to seduce the leading actor,

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,400
you turned out to be my Xiao Wu substitute.

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,280
Wait.

61
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,720
What did you say?

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,360
Say it again,

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,840
is she going to hit someone again?

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,520
What's wrong with Wu Di?

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,920
You can do it yourself.

66
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,120
Bah!

67
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,920
Today,

68
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,880
I'll use this Siyun Sword in my hand,

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
I'll teach you a lesson.

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,360
Do you want Luo Chen to lose his son?

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,640
Stop fighting!

72
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,960
Ladies, stop fighting!

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,400
Stop fighting!

74
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,920
Director,

75
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,200
I invested

76
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,040
in this play,

77
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,640
Either she leaves

78
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,880
or you leave today

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Song Ning Yan, why are you being so unreasonable?

80
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,440
What did I do wrong?

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,560
Why should you let me go?

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,440
Stop arguing.

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,520
Don't leave, either of you.

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,680
I'm leaving.

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,280
Mr. Zhou,

86
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,560
Xu Yinuo,

87
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,720
Wait and see!

88
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,680
Mr. Zhou,

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,320
Luo Chen, don't go.

90
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,680
I'm here for you.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,640
We still have a kiss scene to shoot.

92
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,320
That's it?

93
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,920
As an actor,

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Luo Chen,

95
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,320
That ugly woman dared to molest you.

96
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,240
I will,

97
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,680
well,

98
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,480
They're all here.

99
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,640
The deputy director said,

100
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,000
let the actors ride in the carriage.

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,640
Get in the car and get ready to go.

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,920
Hyah!

103
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,320
Hyah!

104
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,400
A substitute.

105
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
What kind of actor are you?

106
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,040
Shut up if you don't want to be beaten.

107
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,080
Be quiet.

108
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,960
You two,

109
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,440
Xu Yinuo,

110
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,240
What you just said,

111
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
the martial arts novel you wrote?

112
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,040
Can you show it to me?

113
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,320
Why can't I see it?

114
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,920
Look.

115
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,120
The moon is dark and the wind is high,

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,280
the hero and heroine and the annoying second daughter are riding in a carriage,

117
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Through an empty street,

118
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,040
all of a sudden,

119
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Thunder and lightning from the carriage,

120
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,640
Si Yunjian from the male lead,

121
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,480
Just like a key,

122
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,280
it opens the door to the martial arts world.

123
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,160
There,

124
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,600
Wu Yaoyang,

125
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,080
the leader of the Five Poison Sect,

126
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,560
and Bai Yueguang,

127
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,400
the leader of the Carefree Sect,

128
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,200
are engaged in a ten-year battle.

129
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,560
But the hero and heroine fell from the sky,

130
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,600
and got involved in this martial arts dispute,

131
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Start a wonderful trip to the rivers and lakes.

132
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,320
That's all.

133
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,680
What do you know?

134
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,440
A perfect creation.

135
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
It takes time to lay the foundation.

136
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
Who are you

137
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,240
lying to? You're a puppy.

138
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
What's the final result?

139
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,480
Wait.

140
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Why did the carriage stop?

141
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,480
Hey,

142
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,880
What are you looking at?

143
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,960
What are you looking at?

144
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,880
Hey,

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,520
Don't talk.

146
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,000
Is the door over there glowing?

147
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,640
Come on

148
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,000
Eat my last move.

149
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,320
Bring it on.
