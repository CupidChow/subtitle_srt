1
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,720
Li Xia.

2
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
I got a big melon today.

3
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,680
Qingge is so handsome.

4
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,560
Li Xia,

5
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,240
your eyelids are open,

6
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,400
I took it off for you.

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,400
What are you looking at?

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,440
Get lost!

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,600
Li Xia

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,560
My eyelids are open. I'll remove them for you, okay?

11
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,800
Li Xia,

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,760
let's go too.

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,320
Let's go,

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,360
let's go,

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,360
You want to run away?

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,600
Xu Yinuo,

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,000
do you know the way or not?

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,680
From day to night,

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,840
if you don't know the way, don't take it with you.

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,040
Why are you yelling at me?

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
Besides,

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,720
I'm not from here,

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,840
You know the way?

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,520
Show me the way.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,160
Point

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,600
You're being unreasonable.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,600
it's easy for me to find them.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,560
May I ask,

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,000
who is your Excellency?

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm the sixty-eighth generation leader

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,480
of the Beggar Sect,

33
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,640
Hong Bagong is also.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Sorry,

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,160
it's Master Hong.

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,280
Excuse Me

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,880
What can I do for you?

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,480
Do you want to

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,760
treat us to a meal?

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,480
Nonsense!

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,680
Pay for my doggy stick.

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,720
Didn't you say it in the novel?

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,280
The dog stick is indestructible.

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,000
Are you blackmailing me?

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,160
Silly girl,

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,080
the glory of my beggar for a hundred years,

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Destroyed.

48
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,120
Losing money?

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,120
Is it,

50
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,240
Let me do it.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,200
It seems that you really did it.

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,600
So annoying.

53
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,840
How much?

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
One price,

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,840
fifty taels of silver,

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,480
Isn't this one or two?

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:55,680
That's right.

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
It's a one-off price.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,880
How about this?

60
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,200
How about one or two lines?

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,640
One or two will do.

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,200
There's not much bargaining

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
for silver

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,360
It's a loss.

65
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,520
What are you doing?

66
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,600
Give us the money Wu Yaoyang gave us.

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,080
It's gone.

68
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,560
It's gone.

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,480
Where's the money?

70
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,040
I took it to fortune-telling.

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,640
Fortune telling,

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,840
Fortune telling,

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
What?

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
I can't even get a silver or two.

75
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,480
Guards!

76
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,360
Arrest him!

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,360
Run!

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,520
Stop running!

79
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,280
Don't run!

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,960
Stop right there!

81
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,080
Go after him!

82
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,160
You go this way.

83
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,920
Go over there.

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,400
Okay,

85
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
There's a hole next to it.

86
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,280
What are you doing?

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,520
If you want to get in,

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,960
you can get in.

89
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,000
Xu Yinuo, you,

90
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,440
Zhou Luochen,

91
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,400
Where are you?

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,680
Who?

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,400
Who touched my butt?

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,800
You even broke my bracelet.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,720
Smelly rascal.

96
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,120
You guys,

97
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm sorry,

98
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,160
I'm sorry,

99
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm sorry,

100
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,080
He looks pretty watery.

101
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,240
just now

102
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,920
You touched my butt.

103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,440
Annoying.

104
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,760
Why don't you admit it?

105
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,400
I'm the proprietress of this inn,

106
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,640
and you broke my bracelet.

107
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,360
It cost hundreds of taels of silver.

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
You're losing money

109
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,240
again. Do you want money?

110
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,240
It's killing me,

111
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,440
I don't have money.

112
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
I don't have money to pay for it.

113
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,520
I'll pay off my debts with my work.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
Let's talk about it after losing my bracelet.

115
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
I don't agree.

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,040
Who knows if your bracelet

117
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,400
is worth hundreds of taels?

118
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,160
The landlady

119
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,720
is working here,

120
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,560
Do you want food and shelter?

121
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,680
Bag,

122
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,440
Deal.

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,960
No way.

124
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,880
I don't agree.

125
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,400
If you don't tell the truth, I'll just … He'll say

126
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,320
yes,

127
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,640
Deal.

128
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,040
I'll arrange for you to stay in a room later.

129
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,680
I'll arrange for you to stay in a room later.

130
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,160
Then have dinner.

131
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,920
Okay.

132
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,560
Madam.

133
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,160
Why?

134
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,520
Pretty boy,

135
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,280
wait a minute.

136
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Come to my room first.

137
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
No problem.

138
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,400
Why?

139
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,200
Why?

140
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,160
We

141
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,480
… Enough, enough.

142
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,160
Wake up.

143
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,720
It's midnight.

144
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,960
Let's get to work.

145
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,120
Ghost.

146
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,240
Madam,

147
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,920
it's not dawn yet.

148
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,240
Drink

149
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
If it's not enough,

150
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,200
keep drinking.

151
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,880
It tastes awful.
