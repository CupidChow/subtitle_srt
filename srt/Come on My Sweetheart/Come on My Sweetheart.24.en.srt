1
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,640
Well,

2
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,400
This is.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,040
I have it,

4
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,640
Wow,

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
You're too hasty.

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,680
Isn't it?

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,560
The director, deputy director,

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,640
and producer all said that the funding is insufficient,

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,640
Later, the director communicated with the scriptwriter,

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,920
speeding up the unnecessary plot.

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,400
The audience can make up for it by themselves,

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,720
or we'll have to shoot five more episodes,

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,240
hence

14
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,480
It's the finale.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,120
Now,

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,440
do you understand?

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,720
What a mess.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,920
Hey,

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,240
Why don't you ask me what I do for a living?

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,480
Then what do you do?

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,760
Yes, I am.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,600
It's said that

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,760
I have the certification of the national professional department.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,480
Open,

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,320
Lock it.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,360
Master.

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,400
Then why did you go to so much trouble to act in front of me?

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,720
Pretending to be caught by me?

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,560
because

30
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm a divine strategy.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,240
I made such a big detour,

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
just to bring you to justice.

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,360
I see.

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,240
But do you think that with the two swords of seeking the sun

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,480
and chasing the moon,

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,120
Can you

37
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,040
fight with me?

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,920
Even if we have Sun-seeking Sword and Moon-chasing Sword now,

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,840
we are no match for Blood-thirsty Siyun Sword.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,880
What else can we do?

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,360
method

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,880
There's only one way.

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,080
What can I do?

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,320
That's right.

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,320
Don't drink it.

46
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm so anxious.

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,320
Tell me.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,840
I'm so anxious.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,760
Tell me.

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,800
All right,

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,360
here's the way,

52
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,960
Find a man and a woman

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,120
to confess to each other and create a spark of true love.

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,040
Only in this way can we use the true power of the two swords.

55
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,240
Which one of you is willing to do it?

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,720
Li Xia and I are willing,

57
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,280
we are willing to go through fire and water for the peace of the Jianghu.

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,240
Brother Qingge,

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,000
you are so responsible.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,720
No way.

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,800
Why?

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,920
What does it have to do with you?

63
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,840
Because the scriptwriter said that you're not the main characters.

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,520
They're not the Sword Saint couple,

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,280
so we can't.

66
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,480
Then what do you want to ask?

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,120
Yes,

68
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,680
the scriptwriter asked me to tell you.

69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,760
It's true that we're the main characters,

70
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,800
but we're a fake Sword Saint couple.

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,320
No.

72
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,680
I see.

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,600
You have the love and responsibility of the Sword Saint couple.

74
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,720
Besides, you have eaten the century-old black-bone chicken of the Five Poison Sect,

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,960
and your internal strength is no longer comparable to that of mortals.

76
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,880
So,

77
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,720
you are

78
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,320
Sword,

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,080
Saint,

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,000
Husband,

81
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,080
Woman,

82
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,320
Nice.

83
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,440
Nice.

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,080
Wait.

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,680
Isn't it a black-bone chicken from more than ten years ago?

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,600
No,

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,160
that's what it says in the book,

88
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,640
That would make it look like the hero is very strong.

89
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,640
Nice.

90
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,240
Yeah!

91
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,520
Zhou Luochen,

92
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,640
I can do it.

93
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,520
Xu Yinuo,

94
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,160
will you do it?

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:37,040
Yes.

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,560
Yes, I do.

97
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,800
Yeah!

98
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,640
That's great.

99
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,040
Yeah!

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,320
Okay,

101
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,360
that's great.

102
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,720
Let's go then.

103
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,520
Let's go.

104
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,800
Let's go.

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,400
I'll leave it to you.

106
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,120
Do well,

107
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
Let's go.

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,160
Xu Yinuo.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
Are you scared?

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,120
What are you afraid of?

111
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm afraid I won't be able to come back to reality.

112
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
If you can't see your friends,

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,560
don't be afraid,

114
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
Because,

115
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,840
I don't have many friends.

116
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,440
They all think I'm a freak.

117
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,000
No.

118
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,600
You do.

119
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,360
I'm your friend.

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
It's been a long time

121
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,680
since a long time ago,

122
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,360
That's right.

123
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,320
It's you.

124
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,360
Cut the crap!

125
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,360
Tonight,

126
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,120
I'll let you die with my brother.

127
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,600
Xu Yinuo.

128
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,400
Are you scared?

129
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,640
I'm not afraid.

130
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,080
This is.

131
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,800
Where?

132
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,400
This is...

133
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,440
Could it be that,

134
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,280
We crossed again.

135
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,760
Aren't you afraid of me?

136
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,400
Why should I be afraid of you?

137
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,680
Since I was a good fighter since I was a kid,

138
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,160
they were all afraid that

139
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,480
I wouldn't play with me,

140
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,600
I'm not afraid of you.

141
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
You helped me get rid of those who bullied me.

142
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,840
You are my good friend.

143
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,600
Really?

144
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,560
When I grow up,

145
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,720
I'll protect you too.

146
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,120
Okay,

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,480
Really?

148
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,200
Pull the hook.

149
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,000
Really?

150
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,880
Pull the hook.

151
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,200
Let's play a game.

152
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,640
Rock, paper,

153
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,480
scissors. Take care.

154
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,280
Brother,

155
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm here to accompany you.

156
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,080
That's great.

157
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,120
We won.

158
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,880
Why are you so silly?

159
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,400
You promised me to protect you.

160
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,120
Do you love me?

161
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,840
I will always

162
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,080
love you.

163
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,840
Cut,

164
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,560
It's done.

165
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
It's done.
