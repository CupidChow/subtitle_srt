1
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,920
Follow them

2
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,680
and monitor their every move.

3
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,320
Yes.

4
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,120
If they can't take out the sword,

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,080
I'll ask them to bury my beloved chicken with them.

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,960
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,640
Wait a minute.

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,800
Sir,

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,680
Then.

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,080
The travelling expenses.

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,800
Hold on.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,160
Just now, in order to make up for the Sword Saint couple,

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,600
there was no money left in the account.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,800
This one hundred coins is my private money,

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,880
and the rest,

16
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,520
Figure it out on your own.

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,600
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,120
Thank you, sir.

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,880
Xiaowu,

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
I hope you didn't choose the wrong master.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,720
Hurry up.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Excuse me,

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,800
handsome guy.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,360
Call me?

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,120
I can tell from the sound of your footsteps

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,640
that

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,840
you are very energetic,

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
His eyes are bright,

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,240
like stars in the sky,

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,200
He must not be an ordinary person.

31
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,480
A star?

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,680
No,

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Not a star,

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,680
but a superstar.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,760
Yes.

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,080
That's right,

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,720
Young Master Lai,

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,680
Sit down. Let me

39
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,680
tell you the divination.

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,600
Master,

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,600
how is it?

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,960
Well,

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,320
Young Master,

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,040
It's really not an ordinary child.

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,600
The future is bright.

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,280
It's just...

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,840
It's just what?

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,440
This one.

49
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,840
But,

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,840
Love,

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,240
It's a little hard to figure out,

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,600
love,

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,560
May I ask what love is?

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,360
It's love.

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,400
Master,

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,840
do you dare to ask me when my love will come into being?

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,080
Young Master's love has already appeared.

58
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,120
As long as you close your eyes,

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,760
you can see her face.

60
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,720
Young Master,

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,360
you can close your eyes and try.

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,200
Silly girl,

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,960
you believe that.

64
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,440
Someone jumped off the building.

65
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,720
Someone jumped off the building.

66
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,440
Someone jumped off the building.

67
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,800
Hurry up

68
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,000
Go,

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,840
go, go.

70
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,760
What are you waiting for?

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,720
Let's go and watch the fun.

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,160
Really?

73
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,120
Is it her?

74
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,080
Excuse me.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They've been standing there all day.

76
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
As long as you close your eyes,

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,560
you can see her face.

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,360
Young Master,

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,200
you can close your eyes and try.

80
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,440
Let's go.

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,320
What are you waiting for?

82
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,120
Let's go and watch the fun.

83
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,320
Here we go.

84
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,760
What color do I like?

85
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,280
Pink,

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
what weather do I like,

87
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,000
From sunny to cloudy to light rain,

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Then.

89
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,120
How many hairs do I have?

90
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,120
Before going up to the city wall,

91
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,840
you had 112, 365?

92
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,920
But you just dropped one.

93
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,320
There are only 112, 364 of them now.

94
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,120
Amazing.

95
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,320
This man is so sincere.

96
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,720
Okay.

97
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,240
Then.

98
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,440
Who is my idol?

99
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,000
Tang Mufeng of Imperial Sword Villa,

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,760
Wrong

101
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,920
General Shen Ce, Leng Wuyou,

102
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,360
you said Tang Mu Feng last week,

103
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,320
Last week was last week.

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,960
I had a lot of idols. Do you know?

105
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,280
Li Xia,

106
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,080
I'm sorry,

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,960
Don't stand there.

108
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,640
It's dangerous.

109
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,360
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
I can only say sorry.

111
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,400
Don't you know what else to say?

112
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,200
I've told Senior Sister long ago,

113
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,520
don't look for men from Everlasting Sect.

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,480
She wouldn't listen.

115
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,080
Exactly

116
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,640
How nice would it be to find someone from Imperial Sword Villa?

117
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,600
Forget it.

118
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,720
According to Senior Sister's plan,

119
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,280
She's about to jump.

120
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's get ready.

121
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,560
Come on,

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,920
Come and eat melons.

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,520
Su Qi,

124
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,080
why are you here?

125
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,040
Me,

126
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
Why can't I be here?

127
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,360
Aren't you from the Five Poison Sect?

128
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,520
Why are you in the Beggars'Sect, a

129
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
versatile person like me,

130
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,480
To promote cultural exchange among all sects, of course.

131
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,880
To build a bridge of peace,

132
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,760
I think,

133
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,880
You must be poor.

134
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,040
I'm not poor.

135
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,600
This one hundred coins

136
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,360
is my private money,

137
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,400
As for the rest,

138
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,320
you can figure it out yourself.

139
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,600
Okay, sir,

140
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
this is mine,

141
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,080
Exactly

142
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,400
Careful consumption.

143
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,760
Yes,

144
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,040
One minute has passed.

145
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
Why don't you say anything?

146
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
Do you want to give me a cold shoulder?

147
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,440
Li Xia, that's not what I meant.

148
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,560
I don't care.

149
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,960
You must give me an explanation today.

150
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,600
Otherwise,

151
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,040
Me,

152
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll jump from here.

153
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,520
Li Xia,

154
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:16,960
No

155
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,840
I dropped it.

156
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,360
Something big is going to happen.

157
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,880
Let me do it.

158
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,120
Woman.

159
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
What a beauty to save heroes.

160
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,280
Saving people is a beautiful thing.

161
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,640
Are you okay?

162
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,640
Gu Qingge

163
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,360
is also here.

164
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,840
Who are you?

165
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,960
Why did you touch

166
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,960
a scumbag like me?

167
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,360
-I'll save her. -Save

168
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,680
her.
