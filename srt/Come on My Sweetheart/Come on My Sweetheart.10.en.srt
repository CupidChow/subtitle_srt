1
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,840
Madam,

2
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,080
we

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,600
No need to say more.

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,240
Don't say anything.

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,120
I know everything.

6
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,240
Junior pays respects to Sword Saint and his wife.

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,800
Every time before the Sword Worship Conference,

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,520
there will always be a bloody storm in the Jianghu.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,360
The two of you came here this time,

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,200
presumably

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,160
It must be to keep

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,520
the Sword Worship Conference going smoothly.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,680
Looks like

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
you've seen through our identity.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,280
You still have a good eye for it.

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,120
There's no need to be polite.

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,760
Rise.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,480
Please rise.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,640
Thank you, Senior Zhou.

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,600
However,

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,040
the identities of you two

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,320
are already known in the whole city.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,200
We shouldn't stay here for long.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,680
Madam,

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,560
are you abandoning us?

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,280
Here are some silver and two sets of clothes

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,520
I prepared for you two,

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,240
Rich,

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,720
Still hope

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,680
Don't

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,200
mind it.

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't mind.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,760
Yes.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,480
I don't mind.

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,840
this life

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,800
I can see Sword Saint and his wife.

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,960
My life

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,360
is worth it.

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,760
original

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,600
Mr. and Mrs. Sword Saint are treated so well.

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
This is.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
Zhou Luochen,

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,240
tell me why Sect Leader Wu wrote a letter

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,800
asking us to meet here.

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
It seems that he hasn't come yet.

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,040
What do you think happened to Clan Leader Wu?

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
But he asked us to come to a place like this where birds don't shit.

48
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,480
Who?

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,600
How are you,

50
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
heroes?

51
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,520
What?

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,600
Don't you even recognize my voice?

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,840
Clan Leader Wu,

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,920
may I ask,

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Are you here to bring us the antidote?

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,600
Medicine,

57
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,120
What medicine?

58
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,640
Yes,

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,520
Wait.

60
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,600
He's not Wu Yaoyang.

61
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,400
What?

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,480
You two are joking.

63
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,920
I'm not Wu Yaoyang.

64
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,960
Who else could it be?

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,920
Let me ask you,

66
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,840
how long has your black-bone chicken

67
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,080
been raised?

68
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,080
Yes.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,680
How many years?

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,280
It's just a black-bone chicken.

71
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,880
How can I remember it?

72
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,600
No,

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
there's something wrong with it.

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,040
Xiaowu, Xiaowu,

75
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,960
you and I have been together for decades,

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Why did you leave me alone today?

77
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,160
What do you want me to do in the future?

78
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,120
What should we do?

79
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,840
Old man,

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,160
I think you're confused.

81
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,920
Don't go there.

82
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,320
Are you okay?

83
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,960
Something seems to have stuck my butt.

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,120
This is.

85
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,760
It's over. What should we do

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,760
if we get sick

87
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,560
after the antidote is broken?

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,680
You were the one who broke it all by yourself.

89
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,560
Can't you

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,760
have some self-control?

91
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,960
I'm Tang Mufeng from Imperial Sword Villa,

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,040
I didn't know you're here,

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,680
Tang Mou

94
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,080
Take a break and leave.

95
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,600
Master Tang,

96
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,640
you are Master Tang of Imperial Sword Villa,

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes, I am.

98
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,720
Just in time,

99
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
We have sword stickers.

100
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
We're going to the Imperial Sword Villa, too.

101
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,600
We shouldn't stay here for long.

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
There's a Zoroastrianism killer,

103
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
who's after me.

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,720
Master Tang made it easy for me to find him.

105
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,200
Stay and play with him.

106
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,520
They are the Sword Saint couple.

107
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,440
Evacuate quickly.

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,000
What?

109
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,360
Mr. and Mrs. Sword Saint,

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,400
are you Mr. and Mrs. Sword Saint?

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,640
So Sword Saint and his wife are here.

112
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,480
It's inconvenient for us two sisters to stay here.

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,520
Let's go.

114
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,640
It turns out that these two assassins

115
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,920
are working with that fake Wu Yaoyang.

116
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right.

117
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,560
So you are the Sword Saint couple.

118
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,480
Tang Mou

119
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,600
Thank you, Sword Saint and his wife, for saving my life.

120
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,760
Don't mention it, Master Tang.

121
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,360
It's my duty.

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,240
Since you two

123
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,600
are going to the Imperial Sword Villa together,

124
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,600
Then come with me.

125
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,640
We'll leave at dawn.

126
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,400
General

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,160
The mission of assassinating Tang Mu Feng of Imperial Sword Villa failed.

128
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,320
I know.

129
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,800
Well,

130
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,920
What should we do next?

131
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,080
What should I do?

132
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Undercover Zoroastrianism

133
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,040
sneaked into the Imperial Sword Villa,

134
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,160
Yes.

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,480
Imperial Sword Villa.

136
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,480
Hurry up.

137
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
It's so grand and magnificent.

138
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,720
Zhou Luochen, hurry up.

139
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,960
Come and take a look.

140
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,880
Xu Yinuo, slow down.

141
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,080
Be careful if you sprain your foot.

142
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
The Imperial Sword Villa is so big

143
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,320
and nice.

144
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Our Imperial Sword Villa,

145
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,000
is the biggest villa in the whole show,

146
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,160
This is just the first phase,

147
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,880
and there will be the second, third and fourth phases later.

148
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,800
The fifth phase is still being planned.

149
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,840
Six issues are still being prepared.

150
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,200
Keep a low profile,

151
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,920
Keep a low profile.

152
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,600
Yujian Villa is really a big family.

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,960
It turns out Master Tang brought capital into the team.

154
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:38,880
Come on,

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,720
This way, please.

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,000
Come on,

157
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,800
This way, please.

158
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,640
I'll take you two

159
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,600
to the villa area of Phase 3 first.

160
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,200
It's so luxurious.

161
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,680
That's great.

162
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,160
Gentlemen,

163
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
this is Imperial Sword Villa,

164
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,720
A guest room for you two.

165
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,960
Do you

166
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,400
want us

167
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,600
to share a room?

168
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,200
Aren't you husband and wife?

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,040
You made a mistake,

170
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,080
Nuo Nuo.

171
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,120
we

172
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,640
Just listen to Master Tang's arrangement.

173
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,960
Master Tang,

174
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,560
our Sword Saint couple,

175
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
We've always been close to each other.

176
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
They love each other very much.

177
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,040
It's up to you.

178
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,480
That's good.

179
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,800
If that's the case,

180
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,160
you two should go to bed early.

181
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,400
Just tell the servants if you need anything.

182
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,120
I'll take my leave now.

183
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,920
And they love each other very much.

184
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,400
Isn't it great to have a wife?

185
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,280
This room is much more luxurious than the landlady inn.

186
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,520
The hero

187
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,240
in a horror movie,

188
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,600
It's all kick the bucket's after we split up.

189
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,640
So I think,

190
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,800
we must unite.

191
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,040
That's how it's safe.

192
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,760
The hero won't be kick the bucket.

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
The main characters

194
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
have the aura of the main characters,
