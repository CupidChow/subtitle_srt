1
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,800
So we must get Siyun Sword.

2
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,040
In that case, we'll be saved.

3
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
You love me.

4
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,120
Xu Yinuo,

5
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,120
I'm calling you.

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,720
Xu Yinuo.

7
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,320
What kind of person?

8
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,320
Su Qi,

9
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,680
you scared me.

10
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,480
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
What are you holding?

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,880
Well,

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,560
You poisoned him?

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,560
Well,

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,840
Su Qi,

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,320
how can you be that kind of person?

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,600
How can you say that?

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,240
I'm doing this

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,920
for you, aren't I?

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,440
Me.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,800
As far as I know,

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,360
the contestants'food, drink and water,

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
They all came from this well.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
How do you know?

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,920
Because this is the only well

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
in Imperial Sword Villa

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,760
Cut,

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,800
Hey,

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,160
don't you want to be like this?

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,680
I just put some croton powder,

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,160
so that they can go to the toilet a few more times tomorrow.

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,080
My hands and feet are weak,

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
and I don't know martial arts,

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,440
If I go up there,

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,080
I'll give my head off. That's all I can do.

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
It's all up to you tomorrow.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,840
Cut,

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,680
Hold on.

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
We are the Sword Saint couple.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,160
How can you do such a dirty trick?

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,600
That's right.

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,160
No, no, no.

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,320
We have a sense of justice,

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,360
we have a sense of justice,

45
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,800
All right,

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:16,920
all right,

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
If I lose tomorrow,

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,280
don't report me.

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,720
Hold on.

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,440
Hold on.

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,600
Well,

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,680
how much croton powder do you have?

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,360
That's right.

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,040
How many

55
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,280
water tanks are left,

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,200
Big pot,

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,120
vegetable basin,

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,040
Let's go.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,960
Is everything done?

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,200
It's done.

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,760
You're so thoughtful.

62
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,760
This is called,

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,600
the most poisonous woman's heart.

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,400
Now that you've done it,

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,960
you should cover everything,

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,960
ensure

67
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,280
It's foolproof.

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,960
It's so pretty.

69
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,720
Oh no,

70
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,880
I'm burning up.

71
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,600
It's on fire.

72
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,800
Five poisons will win.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:49,360
Five poisons will win.

74
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,760
Yes.

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,000
There can never be only one plan.

76
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,680
Croton flour is only the first plan

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,880
and the second plan is to draw a salary from the bottom.

78
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,320
Then we only have one goal,

79
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,280
Siyun Sword.

80
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Siyun Sword,

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,240
we can finally go back.

82
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,800
Siyun Sword must be the key to time and space,

83
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
this sword must cut meat very quickly.

84
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,160
Li Xia,

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,240
Li Xia,

86
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,760
This way.

87
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Li Xia,

88
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,680
Get in

89
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,280
Li Xia, why are you naturally mad at me?

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,360
Don't touch me!

91
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,760
I'm not angry.

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,680
You're not angry.

93
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,040
That's good.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,440
Siyun Sword?

95
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,840
Gu Qingge,

96
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,360
why are you looking at a broken sword?

97
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,600
Me,

98
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,040
No,

99
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,600
Me

100
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,600
You said you wanted to chase me first.

101
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,080
I don't understand. You said

102
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,840
you wanted to chase me first.

103
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,720
Forget it if you don't take the initiative.

104
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,600
I'll take the initiative,

105
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,000
Are you chasing me just to say … Hey, hey, hey?

106
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Li Xia,

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
it's not like you don't know,

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,920
I can only do half of what I do.

109
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
When I was little, my parents told me

110
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
to be a good person.

111
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,840
But I've only done half of it now.

112
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,080
Now he is a very handsome person.

113
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,240
I said I want to chase you.

114
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,680
However,

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,800
I've only done half of it.

116
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,240
I only know what to say.

117
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,360
But I don't know how to chase him.

118
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,200
Okay.

119
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,480
Since you can only do half of it,

120
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,040
I'll be your other half.

121
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,960
In that case,

122
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,640
we'll be complete.

123
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,120
Yes.

124
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,240
Come on.

125
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Hurry up.

126
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,440
Come on,

127
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,200
This way.

128
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,120
Well,

129
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,520
Hi,

130
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,280
Hello.

131
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,240
Hurry up.

132
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,440
This way.

133
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,160
Come on,

134
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,440
Watch out!

135
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,200
What kind of place is this?

136
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,640
This is the Imperial Sword Villa,

137
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,520
which is not as big as my toilet.

138
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,520
You are Siyun Sword.

139
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,880
I thought it would be hard to get it.

140
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,240
When I see you,

141
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
I think of

142
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,640
Luo Chen,

143
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,160
You will fall in love with me.

144
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,080
You two,

145
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,520
let me in!

146
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,000
Let me in!

147
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,280
Miss Song,

148
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,400
why are you here?

149
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,240
Me

150
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm looking for earrings.

151
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,760
They're all here.

152
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,240
I have three,

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,840
Then.

154
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
Let me find it for you.

155
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,840
No, thanks.

156
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
I have plenty of earrings

157
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,920
like this.

158
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,440
I'll leave you to it then.

159
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,360
Bye.

160
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,800
Why are you still working overtime at this hour?

161
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,640
It's not easy.

162
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,480
You are indeed a Renminbi player.

163
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,400
No one is allowed

164
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,720
to enter the hall tonight.

165
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
Yes, Master.
