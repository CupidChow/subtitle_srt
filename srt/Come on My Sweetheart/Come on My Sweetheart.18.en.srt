1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,920

00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,080
Pinyu Pavilion selects the Four Treasures of Study,

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,320
if you win the prize,

6
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,480
Remember to marry me when you come back,

7
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,480
I secretly set a lifelong relationship with you

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,240
behind your parents'back,

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,280
You can't give me

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,600
the treasure of your family.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,080
You can't do that.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,280
Only by passing down the classics,

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,640
can you show

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,080
your supreme identity,

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,080
I'll give you this

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,440
Pinyu Pavilion's selection of the Four Treasures of Study,

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,640
That's why I'm good enough for you.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,760
I've made up my mind.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,920
In the future,

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,800
the top student in high school,

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,360
I will marry you.

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,760
I'll get you an imperial edict and reward.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,440
This apprentice broke into

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,720
the lady's boudoir at night.

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,920
Father,

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,400
Mother,

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,720
My daughter is unfilial.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,480
You.

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
I don't have this daughter.

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,120
Guards,

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,040
Guards,

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,520
Yes

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,600
Arrest this

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,200
apprentice.

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,360
Okay,

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,400
it's none of my business.

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,040
This lady seduced

38
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,080
my husband,

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
How dare you have

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
a daughter?

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,520
Father and mother acted in this play.

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Did you see his true heart?

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,480
Bad guy,

44
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,680
Father,

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,840
Mother,

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,840
I didn't expect that,

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,640
He.

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
It's for our Pinyu Pavilion's

49
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,920
Four Treasures of Study

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,560
Coming

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,520
Pinyu Pavilion selects the four treasures of study,

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,160
as long as you use them,

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,520
Then you can be admitted to the top spot.

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,800
He is my

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,520
arrogant and shameless man.

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,000
It will ruin the reputation of the readers.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,600
Guards,

58
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,240
Send him to the government.

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,400
Okay,

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's go.

62
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,560
No

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,840
Let's go.

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,040

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,000
Shopkeeper Feng,

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
your advertising fee won't be wasted.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,960
Look at this ad.

74
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,520
Tomorrow,

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,440
we'll broadcast it

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,520
in all the specialty stores of Imperial Sword Villa.

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,520
Play it.

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,960
Through brainwashing and repeated publicity supplies,

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,560
the Imperial Pavilion's Four Treasures of the Study

80
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
is a scholar's dream of being the top scholar,

81
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,560
This slogan

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,640
will be deeply imprinted in the hearts of every scholar.

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,880
Will greatly increase our

84
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,360
user

85
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,680
Sticky,

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,320
Interesting.

87
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,640
Very good.

88
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,400
What do you mean?

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Mr. Feng,

90
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,560
it's such a fun thing,

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,720
How could you not take me with you?

92
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Let's go.

93
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,640
Let's go.

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,560
Mr. Pan,

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,840
you're such a conservative person,

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
We play such a fashionable and novel

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,360
way of communication,

98
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,920
Can you stand it?

99
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,760
I used to be a young windchaser,

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,560
and we fed chili sauce,

101
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,760
You have to advertise too.

102
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,600
Mr. Pan,

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,240
please wait a moment.

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,280
Shopkeeper Feng,

105
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,880
let's settle

106
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,200
the final payment of the commercial first.

107
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,880
Wait.

108
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,320
Cash,

109
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,200
I can pay in one lump sum,

110
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,600
As long as you arrange two actors for me.

111
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,000
Well,

112
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,200
the two bosses,

113
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Let's go this way, please.

114
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,640
We had a drink today,

115
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,440
and you won.

116
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll tell you a way

117
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,480
to win tomorrow,

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,240
I won?

119
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,640
Give Luo Chen to me.

120
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Take it.

121
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,960
No way.

122
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,600
I have to rely on my own efforts to get it.

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,240
Hey,

124
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,240
Please

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,640
show some respect to others.

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,160
As a human being,

127
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,240
you have to learn to be flexible,

128
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
The process is not important.

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,240
It's the result that matters.

130
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,240
That's enough.

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm not a thing.

132
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,880
I was pushed around

133
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,360
by you guys. Just tell me,

134
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,280
Can you be

135
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,400
more merciful than me,

136
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,040
I asked you to find someone to drink for me.

137
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,520
No need.

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,960
Arnold?

139
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,160
I'll drink it for you.

140
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,760
I'll drink it for you.

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,600
In that case,

142
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,880
Miss Song,

143
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,240
I'll take your place.

144
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,240
Young Hero Leng,

145
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,320
excuse me.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,760
Childe Zhou.

147
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,800
You're welcome.

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,400
This one,

149
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,360
To us.

150
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,920
Enjoy

151
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,480
while you can,

152
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,280
This one,

153
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,400
Childe Zhou.

154
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,200
Good words.

155
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,840
I'll do it.

156
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,560
tonight

157
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,000
The moon is bright.

158
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,200
This one, then,

159
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,120
is,

160
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,480
Don't let the goblet

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
face the moon with empty air.

162
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,480
I didn't expect Childe Zhou

163
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,280
to know Li Taibai's poems.

164
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,800
Are you dressed up?

165
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,720
Brother Leng,

166
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,080
do you know,

167
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,840
Su Shi,

168
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,200
Su Dongpo,

169
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,840
I've never heard of it.

170
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,480
How long will the full moon appear?

171
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
Ask Qingtian

172
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,320
the wine.

173
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,400
Good lyrics.

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
Childe Zhou's literary talent

175
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,520
is very good.

176
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,640
I can only sing a few words.

177
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,200
I didn't expect

178
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,880
Childe Zhou to be able to create.

179
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
I admire you.

180
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,960
This cup,

181
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,440
this pot,

182
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,160
I'll do it.

183
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,240
Brother Leng, you're so generous.

184
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,280
Let's go with him,

185
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,320
With

186
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,440
a little brother,

187
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,240
I was circled by you in the same place.

188
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,200
We agreed to drink during the competition?

189
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,160
Men are childish indeed.

190
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,080
Drink it

191
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,360
Leng Wuyou.

192
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,280
I'll tell you our position today.

193
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,160
She,

194
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,920
I don't want it.

195
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,880
She,

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,840
Mine.

197
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,920
She,

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,240
She's not yours.

199
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,400
She slept in my bed.

200
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,480
She,

201
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,120
She's mine.

202
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,120
What is it that she slept in your bed?

203
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,200
I slept in her bed.

204
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
I'm telling you,

205
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,160
I know her.

206
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,760
She,

207
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,080
On the left chest,

208
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,840
Hey,
