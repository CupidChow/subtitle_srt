1
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,400
Me,

2
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,960
Why am I here?

3
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,120
You'd better not ask me this question now.

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
Go back to your room and think about it.

5
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,600
Why?

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,560
Because when you think about it,

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,680
you'll feel ashamed.

8
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,440
She,

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,720
I don't want it.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,680
She,

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,680
Mine.

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,920
She slept in my bed.

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,600
Who is instant noodles?

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,520
I'm going to kill him.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,920
Yinuo,

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,840
give me a hug.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,440
Yi Nuo

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,480
Goodbye.

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,600
Anything else?

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,880
Sorry,

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,520
this is yours,

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,080
Xu Yinuo,

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,520
I must ask you to give me an explanation.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,920
Explain what?

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,440
Last night,

26
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,280
why did Leng Wuyou and I sleep in the same bed?

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,240
Also,

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,920
why did you sleep in a cold bed?

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,360
She's not yours.

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,440
She slept in my bed.

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,920
Well,

32
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,800
isn't it because I got sick last time,

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,080
He picked it up.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,160
Yesterday,

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
you had a toxic attack,

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,640
He almost killed Su Qi.

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,600
Luckily, I followed you all the way to the ruined temple.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,600
Really?

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,960
What are you looking at?

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,320
The first round of the competition is about to be submitted.

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,160
Have you decided what to draw?

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,840
Wow,

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,760
Amazing.

44
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,240
Wonderful.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,360
The manuscript is about to be submitted.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,200
What did you draw?

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,520
Master Tang.

48
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,320
Master Tang,

49
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,720
it's almost time for the competition.

50
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,320
Yes.

51
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm here, everyone.

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,680
Okay,

53
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,520
Let's take a look at

54
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,080
the work of the first group of competitors.

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,600
Li Xia,

56
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,920
you drew me, didn't you?

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,400
He's quite handsome.

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,320
Gu Qingge,

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,440
what did you draw?

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,440
The most beautiful thing in the world

61
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,400
is just an ideal,

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,160
I drew

63
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,080
my dream.

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,280
Go to the end of the world with your sword.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,320
Hoeing the strong and helping the weak.

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
Gu Qingge,

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,600
what are you doing?

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,040
Go to hell, scumbag!

69
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,520
You don't deserve love.

70
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,200
Let's take a look.

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
The second contestant,

72
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,920
Song Ningyan,

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
Miss Song's entries.

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,240
What Miss Song drew is really a good painting.

75
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,480
Good painting,

76
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,320
Master Tang.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,600
On my drawing,

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
it's a 12-thousand silver ticket,

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,520
If I win,

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,640
this painting,

81
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,720
So he gave it to our Imperial Sword Villa.

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,800
It's easy to say,

83
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:06,800
Okay,

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,480
The last one,

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Mr. Leng Wuyou.

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,760
Mr. Leng Wuyou,

87
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,720
you really are

88
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,200
a straight man,

89
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
Why didn't Xu Yinuo and that beggar come?

90
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
I'm here.

91
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,840
Master Tang.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,520
What do you think?

93
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,280
What do you think?

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,080
Su Qi

95
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,960
and Miss Song,

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,200
They chose the same theme.

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,240
But her drawing skill

98
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,040
is not as good as one hundred thousand of Miss Song's.

99
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm good at drawing.

100
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,480
Hello.

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
Why didn't you draw anything, Miss Xu?

102
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,960
I did.

103
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,960
Really?

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,760
But I didn't see anything.

105
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,160
Take a good look.

106
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,160
Only sages

107
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,000
can see my paintings.

108
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,840
Fools are invisible.

109
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,040
Oh,

110
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,680
Wow,

111
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,600
Nice painting.

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,040
Miss Xu is a superb painter.

113
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,480
I admire Su Qi.

114
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
It's really a good painting.

115
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,600
Well

116
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
You can all see it.

117
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,640
That's right.

118
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,480
Master Tang,

119
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
could it be that,

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,040
You can't see it,

121
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,760
Well,

122
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
How is that possible?

123
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,040
What Miss Xu drew is really a good painting.

124
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,280
Nice painting.

125
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay,

126
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,800
Now that everyone is here,

127
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,760
let me announce,

128
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,480
The winner of this competition is.

129
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,360
Xu Yinuo,

130
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,960
Miss Xu,

131
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,920
It's very

132
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,520
beautiful.

133
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
Also winning

134
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,400
was Song Ningyan and Miss Song,

135
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,880
Also ten points,

136
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,400
Master Tang,

137
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
If it's not tied for first place next time,

138
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,560
it'll be 22thousand's silver ticket.

139
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,480
It's easy to say.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,880
There's a game tomorrow.

141
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,240
Go back and have a good rest today.

142
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,640
Go to bed early.

143
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,560
Take him away.

144
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,160
Okay.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,520
This way.

146
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,480
Brother,

147
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
tell me first,

148
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,960
If Siyun Sword can be repaired in a few days,

149
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,920
the stock of Villa has been falling.

150
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Even the sales of weapons have dropped by 70%.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,960
Tang Mu Feng,

152
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,640
has always been mysterious lately,

153
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,560
What the hell is going on?

154
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,000
I can't hold on any longer.

155
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,320
Brother, tell me,

156
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,200
what should I do?

157
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,760
Why don't you tell me what I should do?

158
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,040
Eldest Brother,

159
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,840
Third Brother,

160
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Your brother has been gone for seven years,

161
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,320
why do you need to use ventriloquism to learn from him?
