1
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,640
Why?

2
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,320
Master Tang,

3
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,560
is something wrong?

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,040
Here's the thing.

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,640
Looking at everyone's bad form today,

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,200
it's unfair to play like this.

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:46,880
So,

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,600
postpone the match.

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,280
I agree.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,320
Who gets stabbed in the water with chin bean powder?

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,120
Don't let me find it.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,640
That's right.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,040
It hurts so much.

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,280
Then may I ask Master Tang,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,720
Excuse Me

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,360
How many days will the conference be postponed?

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,840
This one

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,440
We need to reconvene the Villa Shareholders'Meeting.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,280
Make a new decision.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
I apologize for

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,040
the inconvenience.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,760
All right. It's

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,680
a small matter.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,480
Let's go.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,240
Let's go.

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,160
Let's go.

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,880
Let's go.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's go.

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,400
Childe Leng.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,320
You like Xu Yinuo?

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,800
So what?

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,120
So what if you don't like it?

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,480
I like Zhou Luochen.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,200
Why don't we

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
help each other,

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
You get the one you like,

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
I get the one I like,

38
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,680
Sorry, Miss Song.

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,720
Leng Mou

40
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,200
She has always been a loner.

41
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,720
Childe Leng,

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,440
Eldest Brother,

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,440
The Siyun Sword cracked for no reason.

44
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,080
There has never been such a strange thing in Imperial Sword Villa.

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,960
It must be because he was eager for success during forging.

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,960
Then.

47
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
How long will it take to repair Siyun Sword in the Sword House?

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,720
It will take at least half a month.

49
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,080
Well,

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,160
It's been too long.

51
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,600
Can we only delay time?

52
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,480
Are you waiting for the full moon night next month?

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,080
That's right.

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,640
You can set up more events,

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,600
I see.

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,960
What should I do?

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,440
You've been working all night for nothing.

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,200
There is no way out.

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
we

60
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
There must be other ways.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,080
What can we do? Let's just

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,160
wait for the poison to kill us.

63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,800
It's all your fault.

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
Who told you that your black chicken soup was so delicious?

65
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't have finished it in one go.

66
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,360
You.

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,200
For the sake of praising me,

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,760
I won't argue with you.

69
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,160
What's the date today?

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,760
The 15th day of the lunar calendar?

71
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,720
What?

72
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,400
It's the day when we got poisoned again.

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
What are we going to do tonight

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,400
without the powder?

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,160
Oh,

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,040
Ghost.

77
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,120
Take it away.

78
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,040
You're scaring me.

79
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,120
What is the day of the poison?

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,400
Why don't I know anything?

81
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,120
We didn't say it.

82
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,400
You must have heard it wrong.

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,280
That's right.

84
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,360
You heard it wrong.

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,240
I heard it wrong.

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,240
Go, go, go

87
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,400
Let's go.

88
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,000
You,

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,680
you guys

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,480
Coco Chanel,

91
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,280
Yes,

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes,

93
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,360
Investigate

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,920
their whereabouts in Yangzhou City,

95
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
I'd like to see

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,560
what kind of poison they were poisoned by?

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,080
Yes.

98
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,240
This is what I'm going to use tonight.

99
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,240
Take a look.

100
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,560
Do you have anything else to add?

101
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Why are you holding the candle?

102
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,520
Well

103
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,840
There are no candles at home.

104
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,920
I got two today,

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
not for tonight.

106
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,120
What about this?

107
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,000
This is to

108
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
prevent you from kissing me.

109
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,600
This one,

110
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,680
in case you can't control it.

111
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,280
It's used to control you.

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,480
Control me,

113
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,400
I think it's you who should control me.

114
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,520
With all your strength,

115
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
if you really do it,

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,000
No one can control you.

117
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,040
Childe Leng,

118
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,120
why are you here?

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,960
It's okay to string them up.

120
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,200
He must be ill-intentioned.

121
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,840
Excuse me,

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,600
Leng Mou

123
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,520
May I come in?

124
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,360
Of course.

125
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,040
Please come in.

126
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,440
May I ask,

127
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,080
what brings you here,

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Childe Leng?

129
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
It's nothing important.

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,840
It's just,

131
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,360
The Sword Worship Meeting

132
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,120
has been postponed.

133
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,000
I have nothing to do.

134
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,480
What are these?

135
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,600
These are

136
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,760
unimportant things.

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,400
By the way,

138
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,160
I made a few dishes

139
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,160
for you two to try.

140
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,880
That's great.

141
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,400
We didn't eat anything either.

142
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,600
Leng,

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,640
I'm not involved in this.

144
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,040
I didn't expect Childe Leng

145
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
not only knows how to gallop across the battlefield,

146
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,040
You must be good at cooking

147
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,080
on the chopping block.

148
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,600
It's just a hobby.

149
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,240
You're right.

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,480
Generals and chefs

151
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,440
galloping across the battlefield,

152
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,040
It's kind of a family.

153
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,280
Brother Zhou,

154
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
what do you mean by that?

155
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,240
This isn't.

156
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,960
They are all sharp-tongued.

157
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,840
Zhou Luochen,

158
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,200
is that funny?

159
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,000
Zhou Luochen, that's enough.

160
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,040
What are you doing?

161
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,760
It's amazing to be able to

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,120
cook on the other side.

163
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,880
What do you think?

164
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,000
Is it good?

165
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,240
Delicious.

166
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,640
I want some too.

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,520
Eat it.

168
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,880
Who doesn't want you to eat it?

169
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,880
My arm hurts.

170
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,120
Feed it to me.

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,320
Didn't I cure your arm a long time ago?

172
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
I don't care.

173
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
I just want you to feed me.

174
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,960
Okay.

175
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
I'll feed you.

176
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,040
Leng,

177
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,200
watch me eat your food,

178
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
Don't you feel aggrieved?

179
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,880
It's salty.

180
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,400
It's a little salty.

181
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,760
Delicious.

182
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,680
I'll do it myself.

183
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,040
Leng,

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,440
I want to be in front of you,

185
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,320
Eat up all your hard work.

186
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,240
I appreciate your heartbroken expression.

187
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
Don't touch me!

188
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,440
Judging from Brother Zhou's expression,

189
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,680
he must have choked.

190
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,120
He.

191
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,160
Sorry to make you laugh, Childe Leng.

192
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,640
He.

193
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
I just love acting,

194
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,560
Love

195
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Love liberates nature,

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,880
may I ask Miss Xu,

197
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,920
What is acting?

198
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,280
Acting,

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,520
Exactly

200
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,520
Love stands out,

201
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,120
what is liberating nature?

202
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
It's liberating nature.

203
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,320
He likes to stand out

204
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
and train exclusively.

205
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,840
Zhou Luochen, that's enough.
