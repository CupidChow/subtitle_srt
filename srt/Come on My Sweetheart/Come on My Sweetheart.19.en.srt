1
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm telling you,

2
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,440
I know her.

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,840
On her left chest,

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,760
Hey,

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,840
There's one

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,880
Scar,

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,720
Hey,

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,720
Who is the instant

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,680
noodle hot?

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,600
I'm going to kill

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,600
you. Go on.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,600
I'll go back now.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,840
Luo Chen,

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,040
don't go.

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,840
Don't leave me.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Are you blind?

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,440
Hey,

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,040
Whether these two people are better than

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,840
Ning Yan,

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,240
Sit down.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,320
I'll go back first.

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,800
You haven't called me that for a long time.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,840
Before that,

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,520
don't go.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:34,880
Ning Yan,

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,080
stay with me.

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,040
No,

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,560
Ning Yan,

29
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,640
What did I

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,760
call you before?

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,840
Ning Yan,

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
you've never

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
been so cold to me before.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,760
It's all Xu Yinuo's

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,640
fault!

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,320
Why wasn't I indifferent to you before?

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,440
You used to

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,520
be gentle,

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
It's warm.

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,440
It's good

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,400
for everyone.

42
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,040
Hey,

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,040
Drink,

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,800
Cheers!

45
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,720
Drink it.

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,400
So,

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,840
Zhou Luochen, you're a central air conditioner.

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,880
Yinuo,

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,800
give me a hug.

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,440
Yi Nuo.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,960
Three rookies.

52
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,680
The Imperial Forty-nine Manor is really big and dark.

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,600
I don't think it can be developed into an uncompleted residential flats.

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,120
When do you think

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
you can finish it?

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,280
Working two jobs,

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,440
getting a salary,

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,200
It's amazing.

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,040
Who told you that we can be killers again?

60
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,120
How can you be a maid?

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,440
Those who can do it work harder.

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,520
Let's go to see Miss now.

63
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,560
Or should we get the sword first?

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,760
Let it be.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
You can go as far as you want.

66
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:10,960
Okay.

67
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,680
My Lady,

68
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,120
why did you drink too much?

69
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,840
My Lady,

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,120
why are you so useless?

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,720
Don't touch me!

72
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,960
I'm not drunk.

73
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,840
You can still drink it.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Miss,

75
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,560
stop drinking. Let's go.

76
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,280
My Lady.

77
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,280
Leng Leng,

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,800
tell me,

79
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,640
The Imperial Sword Villa is quite big,

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,640
but

81
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,920
Why are you selling fake swords?

82
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,840
Making false accounts?

83
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,600
Maybe,

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,480
even these plaques are fake.

85
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
Come in.

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,600
I might hit you.

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,480
Anyway,

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,560
I think,

89
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,520
Here,

90
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,680
there's a big problem.

91
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,360
We should take a good look at

92
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,480
Man,

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,360
Just send me here.

94
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,440
Go home first.

95
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,080
You suspect me?

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
I, Leng Wuyou, have been dominating the world for so many years,

97
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,400
and I will be fine.

98
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,040
Leng Leng,

99
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,240
it's not a big task anyway,

100
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,280
Just let me go with you.

101
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm begging you.

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm begging you.

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,600
No way.

104
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,360
Listen to me.

105
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,640
I can't.

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
You promised not to hit me.

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,800
I don't have to hit you.

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,880
Then let me go with you.

109
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
I promise!

110
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,480
Let go of me!

111
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,600
It hurts.

112
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,040
How about this?

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
I'll go home and cook for you.

114
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
What do you want to eat?

115
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,280
Fatty intestines.

116
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,480
Fatty.

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,360
Release,

118
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,800
Let go!

119
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,320
Let go!

120
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,120
Hurry up!

121
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,200
Let go!

122
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,880
It hurts,

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,520
Why would I like you?

124
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,480
It still hurts.

125
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm exhausted.

126
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,000
Why are you the only one left?

127
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,760
Wake up!

128
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,480
Man,

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,840
Man,

130
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,120
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,680
I shouldn't have asked you

132
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,240
to do what you two want?

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,600
Drink,

134
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,800
Keep drinking.

135
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,400
Drink,

136
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,400
Drink,

137
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,480
Come on,

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,240
Drink more.

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,600
I got it.

140
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,360
I barely managed it.

141
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,520
I'm so tired.

142
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,320
But where should I sleep?

143
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,040
Drink,

144
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,920
Keep drinking.

145
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,680
What happened

146
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,880
last night?

147
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,520
Why am I here?

148
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,880
You'd better not ask me this question now.

149
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
Go back to your room and think about it.
