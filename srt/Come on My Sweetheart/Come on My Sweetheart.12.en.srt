1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,080
Siyun Sword,

2
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,960
you stole my lines.

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,400
That's right.

4
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,120
The name of this sword,

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,320
It's called Siyun Sword.

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,040
Why is it so similar to our props?

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,680
That's right.

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,680
How can there be such a coincidence in the world?

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,520
Worship the sword

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,240
Revitalizing the Imperial Sword Villa is up to you.

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,080
Siyun Sword.

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,280
This is.

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,400
The rhythm is not right.

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Okay.

15
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Okay.

16
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,920
Next, I announce,

17
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,240
the 5th Sword Worship Meeting of Imperial Sword Villa,

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,480
From now on,

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm in,

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm proud.

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,560
I'm contributing to the world of martial arts.

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,160
The moon is so round today.

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,880
This is fun.

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,840
Yes,

25
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,680
let's go.

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,960
Li Xia,

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,840
it's late.

28
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,960
Why aren't you sleeping?

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,200
He's not

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
waiting for someone.

31
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Yeah,

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,880
ever since our last fight,

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,600
We haven't seen each other for a week.

34
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,960
Like seven days apart.

35
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,720
Well,

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,600
I was going to cook something delicious for you today,

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,360
I accidentally cut my hand.

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
Well,

39
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,040
What delicious food did you make?

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,120
Gu Qingge, stop pretending. I like men

41
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,200
who take the initiative,

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,280
I like men who take the initiative.

43
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,520
Blue sky

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,000
and other misty rain,

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,840
And I.

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm waiting for you.

47
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,800
I knew it.

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,200
The moonlight

49
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,480
is extraordinarily beautiful tonight.

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,320
So,

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,800
when I came to this city wall,

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,320
I've been waiting for you.

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,960
Okay.

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,360
But

55
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,400
if it's too late to go back,

56
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,440
My roommate locked the door.

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,680
What should I do?

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,320
You're right.

59
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,320
How about this?

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,960
Go home early.

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,840
Be careful on the way.

62
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,640
Drink more hot water,

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,720
Gu Qingge.

64
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,480
What's wrong?

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
today

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,280
Why is the background music so stuck?

67
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,200
estimate

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Which single dog is it?

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,440
You want to ruin our romantic atmosphere.

70
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,600
Tell me

71
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,160
When can we go back?

72
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,120
What?

73
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,680
Don't you like it here?

74
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,040
Why do you want to go back?

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't know.

76
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,560
Look,

77
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,200
you're in the real world,

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,640
It's just a little Wu

79
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,680
who is here for you.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,920
She will be my Sword Saint Madam.

81
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
Is it because of

82
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,640
your wife

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,240
who treats me, the Sword Saint,

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,640
If you're not satisfied,

85
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,520
you'll get along well with each other,

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,560
Watch out for lonely students.

87
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,760
Yuelao said,

88
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,280
The love in the world, love,

89
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,600
should start from beginning to end in the world,

90
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,000
This isn't reality after all,

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,240
but Yuelao didn't say that.

92
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,600
And here,

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
why isn't it the real world?

94
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,200
Xu Yinuo,

95
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,840
you are just a muddleheaded person,

96
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,560
I can't tell what's in and out of the play.

97
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,400
Little fool.

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,240
Look,

99
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,280
people say I'm an actress,

100
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,880
In fact, in my opinion,

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,040
you're the one who can't tell what reality is,

102
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,160
What do you mean by drama?

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,440
When I was born,

104
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,640
when I punched the doctor,

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
everyone thought I was a freak,

106
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,400
You know what?

107
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Only my dad said,

108
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,840
"Look at my bones, I'm surprised. ",

109
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
He looks like a martial arts genius,

110
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,480
and he took me to read all the martial arts novels

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,760
since I was a child,

112
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,600
if indeed

113
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,200
I must be a master now.

114
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,800
Hey,

115
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,600
Xu Yinuo,

116
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,640
you're starting again.

117
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
You don't believe me?

118
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,120
When I was six years old,

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,800
I was thirty in a dozen,

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,160
I even saved a fatty.

121
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,000
Fatty.

122
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,480
What do you want to be?

123
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
Do you want to be Chubby?

124
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,680
How dare you bully people on my turf?

125
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,960
The crazy woman is here! Run!

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,320
Thank you for saving me just now.

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,200
What's your name?

128
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,480
Just call me "Woman".

129
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,640
Thank you for the chicken leg.

130
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,000
What are you reading?

131
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,800
What kind of self? What?

132
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,760
Can you understand it?

133
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,840
I want to be an actress when I grow up,

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
but they stole the script I wrote.

135
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,960
It's okay.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,760
I'll write it for you.

137
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,760
What do you want to do?

138
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,560
I won't write Fatty,

139
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,520
how about I write you as a handsome guy?

140
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,840
But my dad always said I was a good fighter,

141
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,280
and he wanted me to fight when I grew up,

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
I like boxing, too.

143
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
I promise you.

144
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,040
I will write a good story for you.

145
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
You don't believe me?

146
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,680
Could it be Siyun Sword?

147
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
What Siyun Sword?

148
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,720
Do you remember that day when we were in the carriage,

149
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,160
our prop sword

150
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,160
suddenly shone?

151
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,800
I don't remember.

152
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
What else can you remember?

153
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,120
The sword shines

154
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,000
on the carriage,

155
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,120
And then?

156
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,400
According to my analysis,

157
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,720
Siyun Sword,

158
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,800
It could be the key to travel through time and space.

159
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,800
So,

160
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,200
so we have to get it.

161
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,800
We must get Siyun Sword,
