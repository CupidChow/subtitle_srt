1
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,280
you guys

2
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,080
He ate the black-bone chicken of Wu Yaoyang, the leader of the Five Poison Sect,

3
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,640
we didn't know it was poisonous.

4
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,520
Besides,

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,920
to say the least,

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,840
Well,

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,280
How could we have thought that

8
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,800
it's the kind of poison

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,040
that makes people play hooliganism.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,760
You,

11
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,160
Who are you calling a hooligan?

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,400
If I hadn't been awake,

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,760
I wouldn't have touched you.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,640
Do you still have a reason to play hooliganism?

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,360
Zhou Luochen,

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,840
It hurts,

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,920
Let go!

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,440
All right,

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,440
that black-robed chicken,

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,680
It's to nourish people's essence.

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,160
If you eat too much,

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,600
your spirit will jump wildly.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,800
It's hot and dry

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,400
all over. Come here.

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,000
This is the Hundred-Clear Pill,

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,080
which can

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,360
suppress your poison temporarily.

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,920
That's great.

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,000
Thank you, madam.

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,880
Let's get back to work.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,520
Hold on.

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,720
What is this?

33
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,760
Your Zhou Luochen

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,120
… Oh no,

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,480
Make it up.

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,680
Otherwise, there will be no food to eat.

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,560
Zhou Luochen,

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,520
someone wants to see

39
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,400
the landlady.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,960
Someone wants to see me.

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,760
I'll ask him first.

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,880
Stop!

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
Really?

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,080
you guys

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,480
What does it have to do

46
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,640
with Sword Saint and his wife?

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,560
This one,

48
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,960
this one,

49
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,960
Madam,

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,240
bad news.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,320
What's the matter?

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,280
Zhou Luochen was beaten.

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,320
What?

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,080
Who are you

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,480
to hit people?

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,840
Why did you hit him?

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,280
Stop fighting!

58
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,040
Stop fighting!

59
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,040
Stop.

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,000
Why?

61
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,680
You seduced my wife.

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,520
No, I didn't.

63
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,520
You're slinging mud at me!

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,440
Show me

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,600
the evidence. Evidence,

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,320
Come on

67
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
Do you know this?

68
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,200
This is.

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,080
It's her.

70
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,240
I did send her off.

71
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,680
But,

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,760
you admit it?

73
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,640
Everyone heard it.

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,920
He gave my wife a ring.

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,600
You sent it back and forth,

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,520
yet you even gave her a fake.

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
Now my wife wants me

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,080
to buy her a ring every day,

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,960
If you don't buy it, you'll divorce me.

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,640
Okay, okay.

81
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,960
Don't cry.

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,400
Brother,

83
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,320
calm down.

84
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,800
Let me explain.

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,960
Explain.

86
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,440
Explain nothing.

87
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,840
I'm going to hit you,

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
the boy who seduced my wife.

89
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,880
Good boy.

90
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
You even found a woman to stand in front of you.

91
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,280
Sir,

92
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,280
please calm down.

93
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,360
You …

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,840
You … Your martial arts skills are amazing.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm telling you,

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
so many people are watching.

97
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,280
I'm telling you,

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,520
seducing someone else's wife is a serious crime,

99
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
Beating people is an even greater crime.

100
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,640
We can't let Zhou Luochen be sent to the imperial court.

101
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,040
Otherwise, he's dead.

102
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
Sir,

103
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,480
Then.

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,560
What do you think we should do?

105
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,680
You ask me,

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,120
how about this?

107
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
We'll buy you another real one.

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,040
Look,

109
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,480
Sure

110
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
If you buy one every day,

111
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,720
you're blackmailing me.

112
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
It's fine if you don't want to buy it.

113
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,680
I heard that this guy has a sword sticker in his hand,

114
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,920
and he traded it for it.

115
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,880
No way.

116
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,960
Master Wu of the Five Poison Sect gave it to me.

117
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,720
I can't give it to you.

118
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,000
It's fine if you don't give it to me.

119
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Kneel down and apologize,

120
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,760
or come with me to see the officials.

121
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,720
That's even more impossible.

122
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,680
Men have gold under their knees.

123
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,640
Ouch,

124
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,920
Kneel,

125
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,600
Kneel,

126
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,560
Well,

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,000
How about one knee?

128
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,920
No way.

129
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,040
I can't do it.

130
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,960
Why are you yelling?

131
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,320
Forget it.

132
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,280
Kneel down.

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
Think of it as kneeling on the ground, kneeling on the ground,

134
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,120
kneeling on the parents,

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,680
You can't kneel.

136
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Xu Yinuo,

137
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,200
it's none of your business.

138
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,600
One person will do things and one person will do it.

139
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
Come at me if you need anything.

140
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,760
Xu Yinuo,

141
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,480
get up.

142
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:50,920
You,

143
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,760
What are you doing?

144
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,520
Get lost!

145
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,480
What a strong internal force.

146
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,880
How can Zhou Luochen have such strong internal energy?

147
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,360
just now

148
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,840
Is it an earthquake?

149
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,800
I think so.

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,240
What kind of place is it?

151
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,440
An earthquake?

152
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,120
Is it possible?

153
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,160
They are the Sword Saint couple.

154
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,040
By the way,

155
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,880
I want you to help me find Luo Chen,

156
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,040
Did you find it?

157
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,120
We haven't found him yet.

158
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,920
Saint Girl,

159
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,320
calm down,

160
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,400
The faculty has sent people to look for it.

161
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,720
I don't care.

162
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,680
You must help me find him.

163
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,720
Yes.

164
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,200
Wait.

165
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
I only want Luo Chen.

166
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,760
As for Xu Yinuo,

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,160
if we find him,

168
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,360
Help me kill her.

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,720
Yes.

170
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,200
Get lost!

171
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,600
What should I do?

172
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,640
What should I do?

173
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,200
Stop looking.

174
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,760
Just now,

175
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,000
