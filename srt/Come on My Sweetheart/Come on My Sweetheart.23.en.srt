1
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,440
Stop following me.

2
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,080
The target is too big.

3
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,000
It's easy to be found.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,680
I'll follow you.

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,400
I want to go in.

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:51,800
What's wrong?

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,120
Only one person can stand here.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,800
Look.

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,560
Well.

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,360
I'll leave then.

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,720
You.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,240
You're annoying

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,160
You're so clingy.

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,320
What if you get married?

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,080
If you don't follow me, I won't follow you.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,480
Don't let me follow you after you get married.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,640
Who wants to follow you?

18
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,400
Brother,

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,120
your trick is really amazing.

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,040
Separate them.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,520
And break them one by one.

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Well,

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,280
It's like hunting.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,920
I can't stop it.

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,680
Tonight is the full moon night.

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,400
It's also the time when we're done.

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,760
Yes.

28
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,680
Let those so-called noble families

29
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,440
come down to accompany you tonight.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,000
Use their blood

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,800
to cut the edge of Siyun Sword.

32
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
So what Leng Wuyou said is true.

33
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,360
Really?

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,080
You said Tang Mu Feng took our sacrifice sword,

35
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,040
did you make a mistake?

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,480
Absolutely not.

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,360
Master Tang is such a nice person,

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,920
and he treats us well,

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,520
We have no grudges against him,

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,880
why would he do that?

41
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,080
That's right.

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,480
I don't believe it.

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,280
I'll leave now.

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,800
-Good afternoon. -Good

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
afternoon.

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,560
Master Tang,

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,080
we have no grudges in the long run and no grudges in the near future,

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
Please let me go.

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
Master Tang,

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,800
Master Tang,

51
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,520
I'm innocent.

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,280
Stop yelling.

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,880
No one will talk to you if you shout again.

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,640
I don't want it.

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm going to shout,

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,680
Master Tang.

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Stop yelling.

58
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,840
It's really noisy.

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,600
You might as well save your energy.

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,080
Enjoy the happy time now.

61
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,280
Tang Mu Feng,

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,400
we have no grudges.

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
Why did you plot against us?

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,200
No grudges or enmity.

65
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,920
Then why don't you ask them,

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,200
how did my brother die?

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,160
Your brother committed suicide because of poor management of the Imperial Sword Villa,

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,760
too much debt to pay off,

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,720
What does it have to do with us?

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,320
Bullshit!

71
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,600
If you hadn't said that the quality of the swords sold in Imperial Sword Villa

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,400
was questionable,

73
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,320
How can the Imperial Sword Villa be poorly managed?

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,200
How could my brother kill himself?

75
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,400
The name Xiaoman

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,480
is familiar to you.

77
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,720
Xiaoman,

78
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,520
that's right,

79
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,520
As the female leader of Tiance Mansion,

80
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,040
Situ has no worries.

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,200
Xiaoman,

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,000
what Xiaoman?

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,080
Anyway, tonight

84
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,520
is the day of your blood sacrifice to my brother.

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,520
Master Tang.

86
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,320
No.

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,240
Guards,

88
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,280
Master,

89
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,600
Bring them here.

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,560
I'm going to sacrifice my sword

91
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,600
with their blood,

92
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,120
Yes.

93
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,440
Brother,

94
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,840
it's time.

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,320
Our Imperial Sword Villa

96
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,560
will be able to regain the glory of the past soon.

97
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,600
We still need to build lots of houses

98
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,000
to fulfill your wish.

99
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,800
Brother,

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,320
we made it.

101
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,520
You made it.

102
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,080
It must be a fine product

103
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,520
produced by Imperial Sword.

104
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,040
This feeling,

105
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
this is what it feels like.

106
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,200
Why hasn't the sacrifice been brought?

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,240
Somebody!

108
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,560
Somebody!

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,840
Stop yelling.

110
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
No one will talk to you

111
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,400
even if you shout your throat out.

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,600
you guys

113
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,000
Why are you here?

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,480
Don't worry about that.

115
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,640
You didn't expect that, did you?

116
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,920
We saw through your scheme.

117
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,000
Right?

118
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,560
Really?

119
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,520
Do you think Tang Mu Feng wants to sacrifice our swords?

120
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,240
Is there a mistake?

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
It's absolutely impossible.

122
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,120
Master Tang is such a nice person,

123
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,400
and he treats us well,

124
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,760
We have no grudges against him,

125
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,280
why would he do that?

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,400
That's right.

127
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,200
I don't believe it.

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,640
If Luo Chen doesn't believe it,

129
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,560
I don't believe it either.

130
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,240
Xu Yinuo,

131
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,800
what do you think?

132
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,280
It's true.

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,280
Tang Mu Feng, you scum,

134
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,000
killed the landlady with Siyun Sword.

135
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,680
Now, the wife of shop-owner's body

136
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
is in his room.

137
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,120
What?

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This scum killed the landlady.

139
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,840
I must cut him

140
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,640
into pieces,

141
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,160
Calm down, okay?

142
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,360
Don't take revenge all the time,

143
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,360
you little brat,

144
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,240
Are you scared?

145
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,560
Now Siyun Sword is bloodthirsty

146
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
and has become a magic sword.

147
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,920
We are no longer Tang Mu Feng's match.

148
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Well,

149
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,320
What should we do then?

150
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,320
It's not that

151
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,480
there's no way.

152
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,400
Just tell me.

153
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,360
That was a year ago.

154
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,560
Tell me,

155
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,640
Cut the crap.

156
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,280
Say it.

157
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,000
Tell me.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,640
All right.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,880
I'll cut to the chase.

160
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
The only way to defeat Tang Mu Feng now,

161
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
is to gather Qi Xun Yang,

162
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,080
Two famous swords, Chasing the Moon.

163
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,000
Now,

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,240
you have the Sun-seeking Sword,

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,480
As long as we find the Moon Chasing Sword,

166
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,120
we can defeat Tang Mu Feng and Siyun Sword.

167
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,000
What are you waiting for?

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,520
Let's go.

169
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,760
Let's go.

170
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,720
Keep the change.
