《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再哽咽

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
而我盲目的追不低头妥协

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
想保护着谁

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿拥有你的明天

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我只想在我一边

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
每天都能将面对

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
生命总会有机会

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
而你准备要浪费

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
在我一边

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
在我一边

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
大家想一下

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
我们好位子都要被占光光了

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
好啦好啦

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
好啦你还给我用走的

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
走啦

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
余希姑你怎么还在这啊

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
等我一下

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
凭什么等你啊

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
放学了

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
不要造成大家困了好不好

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
你们这样干扰我

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
只是拉长原本要等了半小时

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
学霸了不起是不是

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
你说了算

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
好啦那好什么东西啊

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
他要做功课不会回家做

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
故意在这边写给谁看

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
假鬼假怪

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
浪费我时间

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
早走不就好了

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
不是你有看到他眉毛吗

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
那边毛很夸张

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
我没看到那么丑

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
向先生又没来接你

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
最近很少看到他

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
吵架了

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
怎么会

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
他不是会有余宝宝吧

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
干嘛向阳很可以

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
长得帅有什么用啊

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
长得帅有什么用啊

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
长得帅有什么用啊

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
还不过是一根杆子

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
怎么想都是余希固比较好吧

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
长得帅又聪明

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
一定可以考上国立大学

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
你已经在想以后了

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
如果我要考前三支院

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
有个国立大学男人很正常吧

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
也是吧

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000

How to say

I was also from your father's iron powder

I heard you

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Dad, I think

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't be so greedy

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You have two hands

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Just play a switch

What's wrong with you

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then you don't have to be angry with me

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm the most handsome

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Forget it, Teng

No matter how it is

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's a little strange

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's less than two weeks

164
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
How can you make it to ten thousand

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I want to call

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000

I need to find out like this

Three days in a row

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why don't you go to class for ten months?

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You go on

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You keep going down like this

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How can you go to college

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Where are you going to give me a party

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's normal to see me hit you

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come on

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I didn't hit it

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000

Can't hit

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay, okay

Yes, mom's

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Xiao Qi, what are you doing

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Look at her

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't be angry

199
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Sit down, sit down

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She is not studying

201
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes

202
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm so angry

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll scold her later

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hey

205
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Hey

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hey

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Hey

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Pinocchio

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's really Pinocchio

211
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Why are you here

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm going to class

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,120
Can you help me move this to the gym?

214
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,960
Move it yourself.

215
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,080
Hurry up. It's too late for class. Can you help me?

216
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,280
Hurry up.

217
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,880
Hurry up. I'm so tired.

218
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,800
Then you guys can help me later.

219
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,080
They're still together.

220
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,840
You guys are in the second class too?

221
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,840
But I fell asleep during class.

222
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Can you help me fix my shoes?

223
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Please.

224
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
This one.

225
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
What's wrong with your homework? You're playing football.

226
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
What's wrong with him?

227
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
He's too late.

228
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
The factory is here.

229
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
What time is it?

230
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
He's not even holding hands.

231
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840
He's holding hands again.

232
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Tell him.

233
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Maybe there's some misunderstanding.

234
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
There's no misunderstanding. He's thinking about Ah Hong.

235
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
What's wrong with him?

236
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
I can't believe it.

237
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,840
He gave you his jacket so quickly?

238
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
I don't know.

239
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,840
I told him it was a bit cold. He just lent it to me.

240
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Okay.

241
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I'll keep my jacket.

242
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
I'll clean it up.

243
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
So cool.

244
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
It's good.

245
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
When people are beautiful, they study hard.

246
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
It's different.

247
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
It's just that two big husbands are on your side.

248
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
You're taking pictures very carelessly.

249
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Me?

250
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
I took it myself.

251
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm not taking pictures.

252
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,840
You're not going to post it, are you?

253
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Yes.

254
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Aren't you afraid that your family will be shocked?

255
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
If they're shocked, they'll be shocked.

256
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
I just want them to be shocked.

257
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Don't post it.

258
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Yu-Feng has a lot of girls.

259
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Do you think I'll take pictures of them?

260
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
She's very good at taking pictures.

261
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Let's take pictures together.

262
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Yu-Feng is so bad at taking pictures.

263
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Let's take a three-point shot.

264
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Okay. Here you go.

265
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
You're so handsome.

266
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Can you see Yu-Feng?

267
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Hey, handsome Wang Xiao-Hua.

268
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
You're so good at taking pictures.

269
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Take a picture for me.

270
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Okay.

271
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
They have something to ask you.

272
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Why are you looking for me?

273
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
What do you mean?

274
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
I don't know what you're asking.

275
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
What are you trying to get at?

276
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Don't you know what it means to give a jacket to a girl?

277
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm not trying to steal Xiang Hao-Ting's girlfriend.

278
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I'm warning you.

279
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Don't get close to Li Si-Yu.

280
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
Be careful.

281
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
You tell Li Si-Yu yourself.

282
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Xiao-Huan.

283
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Xiao-Huan.

284
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Calm down.

285
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Why are you protecting her?

286
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Li Si-Yu is Xiang Hao-Ting's girlfriend.

287
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
If you don't want to cause a misunderstanding,

288
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
don't contact her.

289
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Say something.

290
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
I've made it very clear just now.

291
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
You go and tell Li Si-Yu yourself.

292
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
Xiao-Huan.

293
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
What are you talking about?

294
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Xiao-Huan.

295
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
What are you doing?

296
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Let's go.

297
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Why are you hitting people?

298
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Be careful.

299
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
She's my brother's girlfriend.

300
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
You're going to get her.

301
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Let's go.

302
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
After the two public places are connected,

303
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
you can get 5A plus B equals 4.

304
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
This is the public place.

305
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Then, you can go to the website...

306
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Report.

307
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Why are you still in class so late?

308
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Teacher, I'm sorry.

309
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
I have a stomachache.

310
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Go back to the classroom and sit down.

311
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Thank you, teacher.

312
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
We just talked about this 5A.

313
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Are you really okay?

314
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
I'm really fine.

315
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm fine.

316
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
I'm fine.

317
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
I'm fine.

318
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
I'm fine.

319
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
I'm fine.

320
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
I'm really fine.

321
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Go back to the classroom and sit down.

322
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
I just talked about this 5A.

323
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
After we connect with the 4A,

324
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,840
we can get A plus B.

325
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Teacher Huang.

326
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Can you please not send me to class?

327
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
You want me to not send you to class?

328
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I can't miss class.

329
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
I have to get the scholarship.

330
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
You came in after half of my class.

331
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
According to the rules, you have to send me to class.

332
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Teacher, I really didn't mean to be late.

333
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Can you tolerate this time?

334
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
You know, it's really hard for me.

335
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,840
You just came in and all the classmates saw it.

336
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Then, am I unfair?

337
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
But I have to get the scholarship.

338
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
I don't know if I can cancel your class

339
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
because you're late.

340
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Wow, that's amazing.

341
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
You're so brave.

342
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
You're so brave.

343
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
You're going to work in the afternoon.

344
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
It's so tiring.

345
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
You have to work during the day and go to work at night.

346
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
You have to send a letter at the weekend.

347
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
What will you find out?

348
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I'll switch.

349
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
You'll switch?

350
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
If you buy a switch,

351
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
what game will you play?

352
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Let's play the game of baseball.

353
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
This money should be enough for you to play a game.

354
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Bro.

355
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
I want to play the legendary game.

356
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
I want to play the legendary game.

357
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Let's play the game.

358
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Let's play together.

359
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Let's play the game.

360
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
I heard that you can play the game.

361
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Really?

362
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Yes.

363
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
I want to ask you guys for help.

364
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
What?

365
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Why?

366
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
You're so silly.

367
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Are you being too much?

368
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
You're just getting closer to Yu Xi Gu.

369
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Do you have to hit someone?

370
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
I don't.

371
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Why did you go to hit him?

372
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
I didn't.

373
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
They all listen to you.

374
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
The instructor has gone to them.

375
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
No matter how much you like me,

376
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
you can't restrict my right to teach them.

377
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
What are you talking about?

378
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
I did what I had to do.

379
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
I didn't do what I didn't have to do.

380
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
You...

381
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
You know that I don't like to be blamed by others.

382
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Fine.

383
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Just pretend that you didn't do it.

384
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Do you want to reflect on

385
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
your attitude towards me recently?

386
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Reflect on what?

387
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,840
You haven't treated me as your girlfriend.

388
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
What do you think?

389
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,840
I think I like to go to Yu Xi Gu.

390
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
You're missing again.

391
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
How can you miss this piece of paper?

392
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
So annoying.

393
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
You're missing again.

394
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
Yeah.

395
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
You're so annoying.

396
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Fine. I'm not wrong.

397
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
I hate it when people like to report me.

398
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Gao Xiao Qu.

399
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Gao Xiao Qu, you're so annoying.

400
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Hey, hey, hey.

401
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Hey, hey, hey.

402
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
Hurry up and go.

403
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
So annoying.

404
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
So annoying.

405
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
You're not going to hit him?

406
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
You're not going to hit him?

407
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
You're not going to beat him up?

408
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Who is a student?

409
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
The school is the first school in the school's ha-ha school.

410
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Why are you so stupid?

411
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
What's wrong?

412
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
I was going to the gym today.

413
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
But I came here once in a week.

414
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Damn.

415
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
It's only been a week.

416
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
Maybe this week's every sentence

417
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
is especially like you.

418
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
You can smile.

419
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
That's reasonable.

420
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
How can you smile?

421
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
What kind of attitude is that?

422
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
You should have hit him more.

423
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
How about we treat everyone to a meal after the morning exercise?

424
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
Yeah.

425
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,840
How about beef?

426
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
Huh?

427
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Hey, don't you have a game console?

428
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
I saved up money.

429
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
But you all look like a big movie.

430
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Can I just sit and watch?

431
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Hey, record it.

432
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
Record it.

433
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Cool.

434
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Don't promote us.

435
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
I won't.

436
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Say it again.

437
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
After every school day this week,

438
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,840
I'll treat everyone to beef.

439
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Beef steak.

440
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
And instant noodles.

441
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Yeah.

442
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
Okay, beef steak.

443
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Eat meat.

444
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
Eat meat.

445
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Eat meat.

446
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Hurry up and scan.

447
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
I want to scan and eat the meat.

448
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
It's only been a day.

449
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
It's fast.

450
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I want to eat the skin.

451
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Eat meat.

452
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Yes.

453
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Yes.

454
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Yes.

455
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Yes.

456
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
Yes.

457
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Yes.

458
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Yes.

459
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Yes.

460
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Yes.

461
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Why didn't Bo Xiao come today?

462
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
He said he had something to do.

463
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
He won't come this week.

464
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Really?

465
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
At his age,

466
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
he's always so excited.

467
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
He's always interested in everything.

468
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,840
He's been here for a long time.

469
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
I'm so touched that I'm about to cry.

470
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
You're right.

471
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
At his age,

472
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
he likes a lot of things.

473
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
And he gives up very quickly.

474
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Lu Zhi Gang.

475
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Did you do this weight?

476
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
You're here to slack off.

477
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
You're here to slack off.

478
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
These two.

479
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
It's okay.

480
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Come on.

481
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Don't bend your shoulders.

482
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
Use your core strength.

483
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Come on, lift your chest.

484
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Come on.

485
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Come on.

486
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Chest.

487
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
You're really strong.

488
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Chest.

489
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Chest.

490
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Chest.

491
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Chest.

492
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Up.

493
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Come on, shout.

494
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Chest.

495
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Sit in your position.

496
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Sit in your position.

497
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
I think there's something we need to talk about.

498
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
See you after school.

499
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Hey, why didn't you let him?

500
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Right.

501
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Don't interfere in these two things.

502
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Especially you.

503
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
You're so active.

504
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
What do you want to talk to him about?

505
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Right.

506
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,840
What do I want to talk to him about?

507
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
You're so silly.

508
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
You're so ridiculous.

509
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
What do you want to do?

510
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
Make it clear.

511
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Let him apologize as he should.

512
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
That's it?

513
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
I don't think so.

514
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
If he's a girl today,

515
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
maybe he has a little chance

516
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
to consider to make a friend.

517
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
That's ridiculous.

518
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
It's great.

519
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
It's great.

520
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
I can see it.

521
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
It's very obvious.

522
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Super obvious.

523
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,840
How is it?

524
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
I'm afraid of the temperature.

525
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Don't touch it.

526
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
It's so obvious.

527
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
You're so stingy.

528
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Let me go.

529
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Let me go.

530
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Let me go.

531
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
I didn't get the phone call from him.

532
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
You're stubborn.

533
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Hello, teacher.

534
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
What's wrong, Xiang Xiao Ning?

535
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Yu Xi Gu is not here.

536
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Are you looking for her?

537
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
I'm Guo Zai, Yu Xiang Gu Tu.

538
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Write the exam.

539
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
I'm sorry.

540
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
If you keep doing this,

541
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
my pearl will be round.

542
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
I'm sorry.

543
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
No need. I'm off.

544
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
What's wrong?

545
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Are you not feeling well?

546
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
You don't have a heart anymore?

547
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Nothing.

548
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Are you sure you're fine?

549
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
Or are you thinking about money again?

550
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
No.

551
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Did you have dinner?

552
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
I have dinner.

553
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
I just want to eat later.

554
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
I know. It's the end of the month.

555
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Eat later.

556
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
You won't be hungry in the morning.

557
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
You scared me.

558
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
You eat two meals a day.

559
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Take it back.

560
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Eat it.

561
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
No need.

562
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Call me.

563
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
I'll call you later. Bye.

564
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
But it's nine o'clock in the morning.

565
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
You're in senior year.

566
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
The exam is so big.

567
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Hurry up and finish your book.

568
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Go back.

569
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Let's go.

570
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Hey.

571
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Didn't I tell you not to use it?

572
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
I'll use it later.

573
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,840
If you touch it again, I'll deduct your salary.

574
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Hurry up and finish your book.

575
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
