00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再哽咽

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
而我盲目的追不低头妥协

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
想保护着谁

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿拥有你的明天

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我只想在我一边

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
每天都能将面对

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
生命总会有机会

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
而你准备要浪费

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
在我一边

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
每天都能将面对

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's all done. I'll help you later.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I love you.

22
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

23
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

24
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

25
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Xiao-xian.

26
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What do you want to do in the future?

27
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know.

28
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll do whatever you want.

29
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

30
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What a beautiful night view.

31
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
When I was a kid,

32
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the trees here were not so tall.

33
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I could see a bigger piece of land.

34
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Really?

35
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Look.

36
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What is this?

37
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Guess.

38
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I put my stuff here.

39
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's mine.

40
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you.

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Here.

42
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Be careful.

43
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It smells good.

44
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is it good?

45
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's sweet.

46
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Cook some more.

47
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I really liked to see the stars when I was a kid.

48
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Just like my parents.

49
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Really?

50
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Some people say that

51
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
when people leave,

52
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
they can't see the stars.

53
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But when they come back,

54
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
they will become stars.

55
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
People who look alive in the sky.

56
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So when I was a kid

57
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and didn't know what to do,

58
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I would tell the stars

59
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that they could get the answer.

60
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That time,

61
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
my parents chased the most beautiful rose.

62
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Then they didn't come back.

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So I always believed

64
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
that they were living in that new place.

65
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you believe it?

66
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I believe it.

67
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And

68
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
they must be smiling at you now.

69
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You must study the stars in the future.

70
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Study the stars?

71
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I should study the animal genre.

72
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Physics.

73
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Physics?

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,240
Because the

75
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,000
astronomers usually set up many fields.

76
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Such as physics,

77
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
electronics,

78
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
statistical physics,

79
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
quantum physics,

80
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and relative theory

81
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and particle physics.

82
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Relative theory?

83
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It sounds difficult.

84
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How can I pass the exam?

85
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You are interested in stars too?

86
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's because of you

87
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that I want to study the same subject as you.

88
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No one can decide their own future so easily.

89
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm not.

90
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm serious.

91
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I've decided.

92
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll study the stars.

93
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't regret it later.

94
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I won't.

95
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hey.

96
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The End

97
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's welcome

98
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
the second place in the school

99
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
again.

100
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The second place is

101
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Xiang Hao Tian.

102
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Xiang Hao Tian.

103
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Reward.

104
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Chen Daomei,

105
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the real genius.

106
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He's the real genius.

107
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He's the real genius.

108
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'll announce the award.

109
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you.

110
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
First,

111
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'd like to thank

112
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
my school.

113
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And

114
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yu Xi Gu and Yu Xi Gu.

115
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Thank you.

116
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I won.

117
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can give a dog food.

118
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Great.

119
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Great.

120
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You should treat us.

121
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Treat us?

122
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No problem.

123
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Or you can treat us today.

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay.

125
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can't today.

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Why?

127
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You have to accompany my brother today.

128
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Sun,

129
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
we're your boyfriend.

130
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

131
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes.

132
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We're different.

133
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I forgot the TV.

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't talk nonsense.

135
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Who?

136
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Him.

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You.

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Come on.

139
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Come here.

140
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Stop.

141
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Stop.

142
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Stop.

143
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Stop.

144
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Take off.

145
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Take off.

146
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No.

147
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What are you doing?

148
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Someone is coming.

149
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No.

150
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What are you doing?

151
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We...

152
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes.

153
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What are you doing?

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What is this?

155
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're crazy.

156
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're crazy.

157
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Ignore them.

158
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
My dad wants to treat you to a meal.

159
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Thank you.

160
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Really?

161
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay.

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's go.

163
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Wait.

164
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Don't disturb.

165
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Bye.

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't talk nonsense.

167
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Where are you going?

168
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Nothing.

169
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll go first.

170
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't touch me.

171
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wait.

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Don't touch him.

173
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Wait.

174
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wait.

175
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You don't care about the people outside?

176
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No.

177
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's nice here.

178
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Is your uncle and aunt here?

179
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I want to say hello to them.

180
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No.

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
They're not here.

182
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
My dad is going to find a friend.

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
My mom is going to be a housewife.

184
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Where are you?

185
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm going to see my sister.

186
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So there's no one at home now?

187
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes.

188
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Maybe he's right there?

189
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay.

190
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't know if you can take that handing hand.

191
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That hand.

192
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That hand.

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:43,120
It's just a tiny

194
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
hand.

195
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
I thought

196
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
You just thought of it

197
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
I just don't think it must be in the room

198
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
I want to watch TV in the living room

199
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Why?

200
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Are you going to be like Shen Bo and be tied up by us?

201
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
You guys

202
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Can do anything

203
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
I don't think so

204
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
How do you know?

205
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
And we don't care about the location

206
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Don't make a scene

207
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
I'm not making a scene

208
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
I'm serious

209
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,120
I really want to see you

210
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
I'm not making a scene

211
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
I will be against you

212
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Don't disturb the eyes

213
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Be vulnerable

214
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
I will be like this

215
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
In front of you

216
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
In your eyes

217
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Please kiss

218
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Don't be afraid

219
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Don't be afraid

220
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
What are you doing?

221
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Don't be afraid

222
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I forced him

223
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
I'm bothering him

224
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Tell him to like me

225
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,120
So he had to agree with me

226
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
You have a reason

227
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
What are you talking about?

228
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
I'm not talking nonsense

229
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
It's all true

230
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Like the previous photo

231
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
The person I framed is him

232
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Is he telling the truth?

233
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Tell me clearly

234
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Don't shout so loud

235
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
You can target me if you want

236
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
What are you talking about?

237
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
You have no morality

238
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
You have no shame

239
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Do you have a face?

240
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
You have such an unusual relationship

241
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
And you are so stubborn

242
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
So it's very embarrassing to like a guy

243
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Is it abnormal?

244
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Who I like is my freedom

245
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Xiao-Li, listen

246
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Don't let me finish

247
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
It's all my fault

248
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,120
When we decided to be together

249
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
No

250
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Why not?

251
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
I said no

252
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
You two are so naive

253
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Are you sorry to Xiang-Jia?

254
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
You only trusted me for one day

255
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
I'm really not allowed to

256
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Then I'll change my mind

257
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
What are you talking about?

258
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
What are you doing?

259
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Don't shout so loud

260
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
I'm sorry

261
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Yu, please leave my house

262
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
I'm sorry

263
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Yu Xi-Gu

264
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Stop right there

265
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Where are you going?

266
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Go back to your room

267
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
I'm sorry

268
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
I miss you

269
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
This is the first time I've ever sent you a message

270
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
I'm going to keep a distance

271
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
There's no one here

272
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Still no

273
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
I have something important to tell you

274
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
What is it?

275
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
I'm going to take a vacation

276
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
We need to learn

277
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
The long-term

278
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
You're a student

279
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
You should study hard

280
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Students have the right to relax

281
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,120
You're a student

282
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
You have the right to relax

283
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Compared to the last time you improved seven

284
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Yes

285
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
I'm sorry

286
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
I'll take care of it

287
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Give me half a second

288
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Okay

289
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Go to work

290
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Work hard

291
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
I'm going on a date

292
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
We're going on a date

293
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
I'm sorry

294
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
What are you doing?

295
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
What are you doing?

296
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Stop it

297
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
I'm sorry

298
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
I'm sorry

299
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Anyway, these days

300
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Please take care of her for me

301
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Mom said she didn't eat dinner

302
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
I'm not hungry

303
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
I really like boys

304
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
I like him the most

305
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
You like big secret

306
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
He's bigger than a big secret

307
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
And I like it more

308
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
You're right

309
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,120
You're not so gentle to your ex-girlfriend

310
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
And you're especially demanding to take care of her

311
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Because she doesn't have a phone

312
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
She doesn't have a phone?

313
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Now there's someone who doesn't have a phone?

314
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
I can't bear her

315
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
She must be very scared now

316
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
She must be very scared now

317
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Her fear will affect her career

318
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Even affect her future

319
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
I know

320
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Look, she's been holding on for so long

321
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Finally, she's held on until now

322
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Just because of me

323
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm sorry

324
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Why am I so impulsive?

325
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
I'm sorry

326
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
You know, she just left like that

327
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
I really want to rush out

328
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
And call her

329
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
And tell her

330
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Don't be afraid

331
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
I'm here

332
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
Okay, I have no choice

333
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
I've been free since I went to college

334
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
I can

335
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
I can contact her

336
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Don't meet her, don't talk to her

337
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
I can say I don't like her

338
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I can even say

339
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
I can say I love her

340
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
What if she gives up

341
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
What if she gives up

342
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
I'm really afraid she will give up

343
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
It's okay

344
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
You are brave

345
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Brother, you are the bravest

346
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm not afraid

347
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
I'm not afraid

348
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
Why did you leave

349
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
I still don't understand why I'm waiting

350
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
Waiting for someone to think of who's rely

351
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Only me in the abyss, wandering alone

352
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
When the blue sky and white clouds disappear

353
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
That red blood, red will escape

354
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
When all colors are gone with you

355
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
The tears in my chest are not enough to accompany me

356
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
I still don't understand why you left

357
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
I still don't understand why I'm waiting

358
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Waiting for someone to think of who's rely

359
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
Only me in the abyss, wandering alone

360
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
When a story changes, two regrets

361
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
Let the two hearts run to two futures

362
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
That is the regret of the past

363
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
I still don't understand why I can't stop crying
