1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,160
Every tear in my life

2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,800
Someday I will be brave and never change

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
And I'm blinded by it

4
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,560
I bow my head and compromise

5
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,760
Who do I want to protect?

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,440
I want to make a wish

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,560
To have your tomorrow

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,200
I just want to be in my side

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,680
I can face it every day

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
Life will have an opportunity

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,320
And you are ready to waste it

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,160
One more time

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,040
One more time

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
The End

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Hey, it's itchy!

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
What are you doing?

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
What are you doing?

18
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
I...

20
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Are you okay?

21
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Are you afraid of me?

22
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
You didn't mean it.

24
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Thank you for coming.

26
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Thank you for coming.

27
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Black sugar cocoa bread is delicious.

28
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Remember to try it next time.

29
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Bye bye.

30
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,200
The most exciting Pg game on the line.

31
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
The mahjong is over.

32
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
The mahjong is over.

33
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
The golden queen.

34
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Find the treasure of the golden city.

35
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Summon the rich cat.

36
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
The golden captain.

37
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
The highest target is up to 500,000 times 100,000 times.

38
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
The next lucky child is you.

39
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Macau New Peking Entertainment City 9 31931.com

40
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,200
You watch something?

41
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I didn't.

42
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
I think Xiao Mu is strange.

43
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
It seems he has something on his mind.

44
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Yes, he has something on his mind.

45
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
He is going out with Xiao Ping tomorrow.

46
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm going on a trip.

47
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Are you jealous again?

48
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
You care about him, you care about me.

49
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Every day, besides sleeping for four hours,

50
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
the rest of the time is not with you,

51
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
but with you.

52
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
What about when you sleep?

53
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Did you have a dream about me?

54
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Did I appear in your dream?

55
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Yes.

56
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,200
And you told me that you would go out with me for two days and one night.

57
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Okay.

58
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
You said it?

59
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Yes.

60
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
You said it?

61
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Yes.

62
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Ming Hao Tian and Xia Erlin, they are a double date.

63
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Ming Hao Tian, good night.

64
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Good night.

65
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Don't be shy.

66
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I'll just ask Judy to come to work.

67
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Okay, I'll arrange it.

68
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
You decide.

69
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Then, I'll see what's delicious.

70
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Food, food, looking for food.

71
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Dad's stone soup.

72
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Very romantic, want to eat, want to eat.

73
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Finally arrived.

74
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Damn, this is like Paris.

75
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
How is it? Have you been there?

76
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
I have.

77
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Then, you can go with me in the future.

78
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
What about your staff?

79
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Even if there are staff, they will take me there.

80
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
It depends on your performance.

81
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
You're so smart.

82
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
I'll check in first.

83
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Wait a minute.

84
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Take a picture first.

85
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Take a picture.

86
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Xiao Lu, come here.

87
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Come, come take a picture.

88
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Hurry up.

89
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
It's rare to come out and play.

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
One, two, three.

91
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Be happy, come out and play.

92
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Okay, okay.

93
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
I'll take a picture with you.

94
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Hello, are you Mr. Xiang?

95
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
This is your room card.

96
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Thank you.

97
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Please help me pick up the information.

98
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Yours.

99
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Yes.

100
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Xiao Gu, what's wrong?

101
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
You don't like this environment?

102
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
No, it's beautiful here.

103
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Come on, let's go and see.

104
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Okay.

105
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Go, go, let's go up.

106
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Go.

107
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Sorry, I'm sorry.

108
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Excuse me, you only have a double bed.

109
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
There are no two single beds.

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Yes, our rooms are all double beds.

111
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay, thank you.

112
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
You're welcome.

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200

Xiao Gu.

144
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Xiao Gu.

145
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200

165
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Like to experiment possible inventions.

166
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Xiao Gu.

167
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Xiao Gu.

168
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
I'll go take a look.

169
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
The house is really pretty. You can take a walk.

170
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,100
But...

171
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,900
The key is here.

172
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,800
I'll be back later.

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
I'm so sorry.

174
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Zilan, I really don't know what to do.

175
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,000
He asks me if I'm afraid of him, but I'm not.

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,500
I really like to be with him.

177
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
I really like to see her smile at me.

178
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
But I really don't know why it's like this.

179
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
As long as she treats me well,

180
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
and gets close to me,

181
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
I'll...

182
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
You want to get away from her?

183
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Yes.

184
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
This is love.

185
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
She does this because she cares about you.

186
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
If you really have any problem,

187
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
just tell her.

188
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
You have to have confidence in yourself.

189
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Believe in your true feelings.

190
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Be brave and follow your heart.

191
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
It's almost time.

192
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
You can go to eat.

193
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
I really like you.

194
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
I'm so happy every day

195
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
when I'm with you.

196
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I'm so happy

197
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
that I can have everything.

198
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I'm sorry that I pushed you.

201
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I've never liked anyone.

202
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
So I'm afraid.

203
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I don't know where I can

204
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
be loved.

205
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
From now on, you don't have to be afraid.

207
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Because you're here.

208
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
You're the perfect person for me.

209
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I love you.

210
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I love you too.

211
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
I love you too.

212
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
We're out for fun today.

215
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
You should take a break too.

216
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Where are you going?

217
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I'm going there.

218
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Go.

219
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Go to your own home.

220
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I can't stand you.

221
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
It's already 7.30.

222
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Why hasn't Xiao Ting come yet?

223
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Why hasn't Xiao Ting come yet?

224
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I'm serious.

225
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Don't you think they're weird today?

226
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
I've been bored

227
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
since I entered the restaurant.

228
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Come out and play.

229
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Be comfortable.

230
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Come on.

231
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Don't be naughty.

232
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
I won't.

233
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm sorry.

234
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
No.

235
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
This restaurant is specially reserved for Xiao Ting.

236
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
If she doesn't come,

237
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
what will she eat?

238
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
I'll call her.

239
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Si Mu Qiang.

240
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
You've been saying sorry since you sat down.

241
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Do you love me?

242
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
If you keep doing this, I'll go to the next room.

243
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Okay.

244
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Eat.

246
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
What are you doing?

247
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Nothing.

248
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
You said you didn't.

249
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
You're so naughty.

250
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
No.

251
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
I love to eat.

252
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
But I like it.

253
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
You're so naughty.

254
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Xiao Ting?

255
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Xiao Ting.

256
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
You should have told me earlier.

258
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
I'm so sorry.

259
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
You should have told me earlier.

260
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
I have to leave now.

262
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
You don't have to.

263
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
That's right.

264
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
I'll see you tomorrow.

265
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Xiao Ting.

266
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Xiao Ting.

267
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Hey!

268
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
Are you shooting an ad?

269
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,380
What do you know?

270
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,580
This is romantic, okay?

271
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,500
Romantic?

272
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,780
Yeah.

273
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Let me help you.

274
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,780
Have you said it?

275
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,900
I said it.

276
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,620
Let's do it again.

277
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Okay.

278
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Let's go travel the world, okay?

279
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,500
Okay.

280
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,100
We can go to Africa,

281
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,380
see the elephants,

282
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,580
and the long-distance road.

283
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,900
Then we can go to the island of ice to see the aurora.

284
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
We can go to the Arctic to see the aurora.

285
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,300
Or we can go to Siberia.

286
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,780
Wait a minute.

287
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,980
The Arctic doesn't have aurora.

288
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
The Antarctic has aurora.

289
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,580
You're laughing at me.

290
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,380
I don't know

291
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
how you got into the college.

292
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,580
I did it with my heart.

293
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,180
With your heart?

294
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,380
Are you sure?

295
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,580
I'm not sure.

296
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,260
Look at this little boy.

297
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,060
He's going to be a bullfighter.

298
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,780
Come on.

299
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,780
Give me a kiss.

300
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Okay, don't be angry.

301
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,260
Let me ask you.

302
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,460
If you could choose one place to go,

303
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,780
where would you go?

304
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,780
I can only choose one place?

305
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,380
I want to go with you...

306
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
Back to my room.

307
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,660
No.

308
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
Why not?

309
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,060
I want to go back to my room.

310
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
You want to sleep?

311
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,060
Yes.

312
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,660
You want to sleep so early?

313
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
I can't sleep.

314
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,660
No.

315
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,660
Morning.

316
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,860
Morning.

317
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,260
Don't I feel like...

318
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,260
Good morning.

319
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,260
I think it's all because of me.

320
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Little Hola Max is a distance like agencies.

321
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,860
So they already know

322
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,060
that I can be arrogant.

323
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,620
Great.

324
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,900
But I wanted to tell them

325
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,380
that часто.

326
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,380
Let's have breakfast.

328
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,380
I don't want it.

329
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,380
I don't want it.

330
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,380
I don't want it.

331
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,380
I don't want it.

332
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,380
Then what do you want to do?

333
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,380
I want to hug you all day today.

334
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,380
I don't want to go anywhere.

335
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
I don't want to go anywhere.

336
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
I don't want to go anywhere.

337
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
Gu.

338
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
Come and look.

339
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
It's not wrong.

340
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,380
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
Hey, you only have this one.

342
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
My parents bought it for me.

343
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
They said it's easier to travel like this.

344
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,380
You can go to the train station.

345
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
So cool.

346
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,380
But don't you have a driver's license?

347
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,380
It's hot.

348
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,380
I just got it this morning.

349
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Your app is very powerful.

350
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,380
Of course.

351
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,380
I'll help you.

352
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,380
Okay.

353
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
It's raining heavily.

354
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Do you still want to ride?

355
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,380
Of course.

356
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,380
Don't you think it's romantic to ride in the rain?

357
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,380
You are the first person I want to be with.

358
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Let's go.

359
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
But won't the car break down?

360
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
How could it be?

361
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,380
Get in the car.

362
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
Let's go.

363
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
Okay.

364
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,380
The weather is really like you.

365
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Why?

366
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
Just change.

367
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,380
The more you eat, the more dizzy you are.

368
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,380
It's raining.

369
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,380
I hope it won't rain again.

370
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,380
Trust me.

371
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
It won't.

372
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Why?

373
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,380
Because my sun is right behind me.

374
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,380
Zhongli and Taipei are really far away.

375
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,380
Okay.

376
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,380
I'm worried about you.

377
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,380
You are making excuses again.

378
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,380
You said you didn't have time to study.

379
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,380
It's possible.

380
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Call the police.

381
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,380
Okay.

382
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,380
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,380
I'm sorry.

384
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm sorry.
