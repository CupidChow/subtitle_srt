00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再更变

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
而我盲目的追 低头妥协 想保护着谁

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿 拥有你的明天

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
我只想在我一边 每天都能将面对

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
生命总会有机会 而你准备要狂飞

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:30,000
在我一边 在我一边

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What do you want?

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't bother me.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's none of my business.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's up with Brother Sikang is my business.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you like Brother Sikang too?

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let go.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He's mine.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No one can come to destroy it.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What are you doing?

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Old classmate, trouble.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you okay?

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm fine.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you have something to say, remember to tell the teacher.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thank you, teacher.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're the one who caused all the trouble.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And then you look at...

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Xiao Ting said you were afraid of being alone.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So she made you a hostage.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She wants you to go to the school building to find her.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Can you give me a seat?

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why should I apologize?

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You didn't come yesterday.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I didn't promise you.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You and my brothers were punished to clean up the school.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They hit me.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They hit you because you robbed my girlfriend.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I didn't rob your girlfriend.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She asked me to teach her a lesson.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She said she didn't wear a jacket.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She was cold.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What man?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What kind of man gives a girl a ride?

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're such a nerd.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Do you know how the world is going to turn?

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't like her.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then why did you get close to her?

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Just say I didn't get close to her.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So I said no, I'll say something else.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is it so hard to apologize to you today?

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I apologize?

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Say it again.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I didn't do anything wrong. I will never apologize.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I...

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Xiao Ting, let go of me.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you don't let go, I'll call your parents to school.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Alright, alright.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Go back to the classroom and teach.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You, come with me to the teacher's office.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're so good.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Are you okay?

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You asked me to come to the teacher's office?

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Of course.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
My Xiao Ting is so fierce.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't meddle in my business.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't want to be misunderstood.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't worry.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I was going to break up with Xiao Ting.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't like you getting close to me.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Please stay away from me.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who likes you?

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Nerd!

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Alright.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who's coming?

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There are still 32 minutes left.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You!

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You're so stubborn!

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't blame me for punishing you.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You did wrong this time.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You promised not to hit anyone anymore.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I remember.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I just pushed him down.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I didn't do anything.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How old are you?

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Do you need to make a big deal out of being a student?

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're a kid.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're a kid.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're a kid.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're a kid.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're a kid.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You're a kid.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're a kid.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're a kid.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're a kid.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're a kid.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're so old.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're so tall.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're carrying him.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What if he gets hurt?

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Promise me.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You'll never do this again.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Mommy.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is about the principles.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He's the first in the school.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He doesn't have anything to do.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He's pushing a girl down.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And he's hitting on the kids.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I hate people like him.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's not easy.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You'll be the first for him.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You'll piss him off.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you going to do?

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Chicken leshing method isn't that much of an effect.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I just want to press it off.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I really don't understand.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why are you anyway sniffing on your fucking quantities?

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Damage associated with marriage.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Go return it to her.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Got it?

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You can't just remember it?

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm so useless.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,920
I also looked at you!

124
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,540
byebye

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,740
This room valley

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,440
Are you hungry? Do you want to go eat with me?

128
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,960
I've been seeing a good guy lately.

129
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,120
Why don't we go...

130
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,680
We've known each other for so long.

131
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,120
Do you want to go watch a movie with me?

132
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
Are you stupid?

133
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,880
Jingxiang!

134
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,980
Don't be like that okay?

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
A Missing church

136
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,140
Such a bore

137
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,420
Brother Song asked a leave

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,680
You don't have to wait. I'm hungry.

139
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,600
You even did it on purpose.

140
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
What is this?

141
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,720
Hey, you're here.

142
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,480
You're finally here.

143
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
I bought your favorite.

144
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Hey, you know me.

145
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,160
You're so cool.

146
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
Yours.

147
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,200
Thanks.

148
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,560
Ah Hao, why did you give him the homework?

149
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,640
Don't mention it.

150
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,400
You can't just forget about this.

151
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,240
Why are you making trouble for him?

152
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,480
Don't you think his attitude is too much?

153
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,360
Don't forget that he's been a good boy for a year.

154
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,360
He's always so proud of himself.

155
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,520
He's always with that girl.

156
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,120
Forget it. He's with her.

157
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,320
He's not worth it.

158
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,880
Why are you saying that?

159
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,280
He's just working hard.

160
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,720
He's different from us.

161
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,800
Why are you talking for him?

162
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,600
I can't stand it.

163
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
It's okay.

164
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,040
I'll take care of it.

165
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
What do you want?

166
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,520
Kill him.

167
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,240
Jiayi, you have to find a way to kill him.

168
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,920
Hey, stop it.

169
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,560
We're in the third grade.

170
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,240
We have to think about our future after graduation.

171
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,720
Ah Hao, what do you want to do after graduation?

172
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,280
Ask me?

173
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,480
Look at his attitude.

174
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,120
I know. He's a bad boy.

175
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,680
You're the one who asked me.

176
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,920
I have my own thoughts.

177
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,040
Aren't you going to college?

178
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
I have to go to college.

179
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,280
I think so too.

180
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,480
It seems reasonable.

181
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,400
How dare you say that to your parents?

182
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,880
I dare. Why not?

183
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,680
I don't dare.

184
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,080
You're so mean.

185
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,600
Let's eat.

186
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,160
He must be okay, okay?

187
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,480
His parents, teachers, and girlfriend.

188
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,640
He doesn't care at all.

189
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,960
He doesn't care.

190
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,560
He only cares about...

191
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,720
That's what I mean.

192
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,440
Do you want to eat like this?

193
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,600
I'll eat.

194
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,880
I saw it.

195
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,920
I don't believe it.

196
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,640
Really?

197
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,760
Really?

198
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,280
What's wrong?

199
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,200
You're lying.

200
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,600
Hi.

201
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,800
Hi.

202
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,360
Tell me In?

203
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,760
So what...

204
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Come on.

205
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,040
You say you're okay.

206
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,760
In our school...

207
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,020
Come on, Do you sommes sin de

208
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,440
Citizen's debt.

209
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,360
What?

210
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,560
What!

211
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,280
I said I wouldn't do it again.

212
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,800
Aren't you crazy?

213
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,760
Ö

214
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,040
Mu far见ę...

215
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,640
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,140
You really don't understand or you're pretending to understand?

217
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,040
I was just saying that I was angry with you.

218
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,240
Who told you to ignore me for so long?

219
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,840
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
I like you.

221
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,840
I don't have much time to talk to you.

222
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,740
It's okay. We're preparing for the midterm.

223
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,040
But after the exam, let's go on a trip, okay?

224
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,340
Let's be close.

226
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,440
Let's be close.

227
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,040
No means no.

228
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,840
Too fades!

229
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,740
Don't be mad with him.

230
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
What's wrong?

232
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Can you buy me a cup of soy milk?

233
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
What's wrong with that?

234
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
You asked me to come here

235
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
just to buy you a cup of soy milk.

236
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
And then you told me

237
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
that I'm sorry.

238
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
I know I was wrong.

239
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
I didn't mean to.

240
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Can you forgive me?

241
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Then we can be like before.

242
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
Be good.

243
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Wait.

244
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
You want me to be your apology bag

245
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
and apologize to the girl you like?

246
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
No.

247
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Then what is it?

248
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
It's a guy.

249
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
What the hell?

250
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Who do you want to be?

251
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
You tell me.

252
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
What do you want?

253
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Why are you so angry?

254
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
I really like him.

255
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
I like that kind of guy.

256
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
So what you said is true?

257
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
I thought you...

258
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
I thought you went to the gym

259
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
just to see...

260
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
I heard you.

261
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Which one?

262
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Which one?

263
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
The one on the left or the one on the right?

264
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
The one inside.

265
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
The one inside.

266
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
The one inside is a little old.

267
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
Do you want to help?

268
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
It's not that I don't want to help you.

269
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
You have to apologize

270
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
to be sincere.

271
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
You're not sincere

272
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
when you ask someone to apologize.

273
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
How could they be sincere?

274
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
I'm not sincere.

275
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
I'm not sincere.

276
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
I'm not sincere.

277
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm not sincere.

278
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
I'm not sincere.

279
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
How could they forgive you?

280
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
I'm afraid that they will ignore me.

281
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Afraid?

282
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Everyone is afraid.

283
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
That's why you have to do it.

284
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
That's how you can show your determination.

285
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Do you understand?

286
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Did you bring the small gourd?

287
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
If you have it, go.

288
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
You can do it.

289
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
I'll wait for you here.

290
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Go.

291
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,040
rearrange

292
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Welcome.

293
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
I'm not here to apologize.

294
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Not14

295
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Have you thought about what you did to me?

297
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,040
First, you were in the gym, then you were in my workplace.

298
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
I want to tell you one more time.

300
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Please don't come to mess things up again.

301
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Okay?

302
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
You're so good this time.

304
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
I'm really happy.

305
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
There's a test paper here.

306
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Go back and sit down.

307
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
If there's nothing else, you should practice.

308
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,040
If you have a test, it will be of great help.

309
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,040
What is the star of the person who was born that day?

310
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Raise your hand if you know.

311
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Come on, please say it.

312
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Gemini.

313
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
That's right. Next question.

314
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,040
The person who was born that day is the star of the person who was born that day.

315
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Next question.

316
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,040
What is the star of the person who was born that day?

317
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Come on, please say it.

318
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Figaro

319
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Kareem, wait a second.

320
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Aren't you Kareem?

321
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
I have not written it yet. Hurry up.

322
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Tell him.

323
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
That is so bad.

324
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
When exactly do we end up in our life?

325
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Yes, we are going to the test every day.

326
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
We can't take it anymore.

327
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
The test is going well.

328
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Since I finished the test at Ekym,

329
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
I don't have time to think about other things.

330
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Hey, teacher.

331
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
You got a bad score.

332
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Yeah.

333
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
He's really weird lately.

334
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Say it.

335
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Okay. Don't bother him.

336
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Hey, we're really concerned about him.

337
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Yeah.

338
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
You guys are all like this.

339
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
You guys are not even going to school. It's like playing a game.

340
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Hey,

341
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
tomorrow is the midterm.

342
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
We're preparing for the exam next year.

343
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Do you want to go with us?

344
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
No.

345
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Then I won't go with you guys today.

346
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I have something more important to do.

347
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Hey,

348
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
are you going to campus?

349
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
You don't want to come with us, right?

350
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
You'll know it later.

351
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Again.

352
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
I'm going to buy a drink.

353
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
You're so mean.

354
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
You're so mean.

355
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
I'm going to come secretly.

356
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Here you go.

357
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
No, thanks.

358
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Is it him?

359
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
It's him.

360
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Ah Hao.

361
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Come.

362
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Come.

363
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Senior,

364
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
we didn't get to interview you last time.

365
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
When are we going to see you?

366
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Please come to campus.

367
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Senior, can we add a line?

368
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Add a line.

369
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Please come to campus.

370
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Ah Hao.

371
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Thank you, Senior.

372
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,000
Go here.

373
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,960
Why are they still in the classroom?

374
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
I'm so hungry.

375
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
I'm so hungry.

376
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
I'm so hungry.

377
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm so hungry.

378
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,960
I'm so hungry.

379
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
I want to eat.

380
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Really?

381
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
I'm going to bed.

382
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Be careful on the way back.

383
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Thank you, Brother Lin.

384
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Bye.

385
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:15,840
The

386
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
How long do I have to walk?

387
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,840
Why isn't the bus coming?

388
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
It's weird.

389
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
I got you.

390
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Why wait?

391
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Waiting for who will remember

392
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Who's dependence

393
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Only me in the abyss

394
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,960
Wandering alone

395
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
When the blue sky

396
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,960
When the white clouds disappear

397
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
That yellow paper red

398
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Take you away

399
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
When all the colors

400
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,960
After you leave

401
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Tears in my chest

402
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,960
Constantly fall with me

403
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
I still don't understand

404
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Why you left

405
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I still don't understand

406
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Why I wait

407
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Waiting for who will remember

408
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Who's dependence

409
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Only me in the abyss

410
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Wandering alone

411
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
When the story

412
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Light up the regrets

413
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Let the bright future

414
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Run to the end

415
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I was afraid to forget

416
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Only you and I

417
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
But I don't understand

418
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Why tears can't stop
