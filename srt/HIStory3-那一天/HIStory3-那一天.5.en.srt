Why did you hang up on me?

202
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
You couldn't find anyone this afternoon.

203
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm busy.

204
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Busy about what?

205
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,880
You said you wanted to discuss the Han family matter.

206
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
I already said it.

207
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
I just want to make a decision with you.

208
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Don't I have any opinion?

209
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Why is it always me who decides?

210
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
You only made it so that I want to go and you don't want to go.

211
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
I'm not going to go.

212
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
I'm going to go.

213
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
I'm going to go.

214
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
I'm going to go.

215
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
Did I say I like Yu Xi Gu

216
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
and you didn't want to talk to me?

217
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,880
I already apologized to you.

218
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Didn't we make up?

219
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
I didn't mean to ignore you.

220
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Don't think about it.

221
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Let's discuss it together.

222
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Next.

223
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
I'm leaving.

224
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Bye.

225
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
What do I have to do to make up?

226
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
The exam is very important to me.

228
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
If you want me to apologize, I'm willing to.

229
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
I don't understand what you're saying.

230
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
You say you want to hear it.

231
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
Then tell me the result.

232
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
It's so cool to eat.

233
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Take a bite.

234
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Want to order it yourself?

235
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Let go of that cake.

236
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
That cake.

237
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
The exam is very important to me.

238
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
You can ask her to apologize.

239
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
She can do it.

240
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
So you're still looking for Yu Xi Gu?

241
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
No.

242
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Then why did she call me to say it?

243
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
She misunderstood.

244
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
What did she do to make her misunderstand?

245
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Nothing.

246
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Just...

247
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Just follow her.

248
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Is it follow or stalk?

249
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
What do you mean?

250
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Is there a difference?

251
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Of course there is.

252
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Follow is just right.

253
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Stalk is...

254
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
I don't understand.

255
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
You don't understand?

256
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
What?

257
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Follow.

258
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
What?

259
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Follow.

260
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
What?

261
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Are you okay?

262
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
What do you want?

263
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,880
You must regret that you want to apologize to her.

264
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Don't forget the soup.

265
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
She let us skip the night.

266
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
It's a week.

267
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
A week?

268
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Don't mind it.

269
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
I just skipped one.

270
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
At least we don't owe each other.

271
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
I don't want to get back with her.

272
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
But she's still worried.

273
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
She's afraid you'll get into trouble.

274
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
So she told her to make it clear.

275
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
You guys are even.

276
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
It's fine.

277
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Why do you want Hao to tell her?

278
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Just tell her.

279
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
You're not on the same team.

280
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Hao won't believe it if you tell him.

281
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
It's better to be so exaggerated.

282
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Believe it or not, it's up to him.

283
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
No.

284
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
I think you should tell her yourself.

285
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
It's easier for you to accept it, right?

286
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
But it'sосьf breath, right?

287
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Whatever it takes, you have to accept it.

288
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Come on, let's go.

289
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Then we shall see.

290
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Get some clothes.

291
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Do you feel like your heart is about to jump out?

292
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,480
No, it's more like...

293
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Don't stop! Don't stop! Don't stop!

294
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,880
That kind of feeling.

295
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,880
Boss, I want four red beans.

296
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,280
Four red beans?

297
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,080
I want...

298
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,680
Boss, wait!

299
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Two red beans and two cream.

300
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,480
Two red beans and two cream.

301
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,280
Enough already.

302
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,480
Boss, four cream, thank you.

303
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,080
Four cream.

304
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,480
Two?

305
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Two?

306
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,280
Both cream.

307
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,080
You're so fast.

308
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,880
No, no.

309
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Are you sure?

310
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Thank you, Boss.

311
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,480
Er Lian,

312
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,080
are you nervous when you see me?

313
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,480
Why would I be nervous when I see you?

314
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
But I am.

315
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,280
Every time I think of him,

316
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,680
I feel like I'm in his arms.

317
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
Okay.

318
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,080
Boss, thank you.

319
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,480
Thank you.

320
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,080
Thank you, Boss.

321
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,280
Look at his long eyelashes.

322
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
His soft lips. I want to...

323
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
So juicy.

324
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,880
So juicy.

325
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,280
Are you too narcissistic?

326
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,680
You're not talking about me.

327
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,880
Then who are you talking about?

328
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,280
Hey, who are you talking about?

329
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,080
Yu Shi Gu.

330
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,880
Yu Shi Gu?

331
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,080
Don't bother me.

332
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
That Yu Shi Gu.

333
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,880
I want him.

334
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,080
I really think he's good-looking.

335
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,880
And when I see him, I don't know why my heart...

336
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,280
almost fell out.

337
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
Don't turn me around.

338
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,480
I didn't.

339
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,880
At first, it was because

340
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,080
he cried and I felt sorry for him when I saw him.

341
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,480
So I thought I was sympathizing with him,

342
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
but that's not what I was thinking.

343
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,680
I noticed that I started to notice him.

344
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,880
When he was studying,

345
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,280
when he was smiling,

346
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
when he was walking,

347
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,680
even when he was just standing still,

348
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,880
I couldn't help but look at him.

349
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Even in the infirmary today,

350
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,680
I kept staring at him.

351
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,480
I didn't know what I was doing.

352
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
I just felt that he...

353
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
He's so cute.

354
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
He's really cute.

355
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,080
You like Yu Shi Gu?

356
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,680
Me?

357
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,680
But he's a guy.

358
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,080
What?

359
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,480
You like guys. Tell me.

360
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,080
What's the difference between a guy and a girl?

361
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,480
You're like a girl.

362
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,880
You're the same.

363
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
You're the same.

364
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,480
So I like Yu Shi Gu?

365
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,480
Why are you asking me?

366
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,080
You should ask yourself.

367
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,280
I don't want to ask you. I don't know.

368
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,480
I don't know either.

369
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
If not, how did you know that you like Li Si Yu?

370
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,680
Li Si Yu is...

371
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,880
I kissed him and then I kissed him.

372
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Then he...

373
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,080
Kissed him and then he...

374
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,880
You're a beast.

375
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,080
I know.

376
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,480
I don't want to.

377
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,080
You're a piece of shit.

378
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,280
Didn't the weather forecast say it would rain?

379
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,080
Where's your umbrella?

380
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,280
You didn't bring it.

381
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,480
Thanks.

382
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,680
Love you.

383
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,880
Okay.

384
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
If my parents ask you,

385
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,280
you have to cover me.

386
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,680
Is that really okay?

387
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,080
It is.

388
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,880
You really want to go to the hot spring with Mr. Xiang?

389
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,480
Two days and one night.

390
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
Anyway, he's going to choose a car ticket.

391
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,280
Is that right, baby?

392
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,480
What are you doing?

393
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,280
This is a nightclub.

394
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,480
But why would he go to a nightclub?

395
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,680
What else can he do?

396
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
He's a good student.

397
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
But he's a playboy.

398
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
How is that possible?

399
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,480
Baby Yu is very quiet.

400
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,280
He's not the kind of person who can play.

401
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,880
There are many people who are different.

402
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,680
Who knows what he's like in private?

403
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,480
This nightclub is quite special.

404
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,880
It's like the kind of place boys go to.

405
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,280
Oh my god!

406
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,480
It's like a boy is screaming.

407
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,080
What are you doing?

408
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,680
Baby Yu.

409
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,080
What are you doing?

410
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,480
Working for 2000 yuan a month.

411
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,880
I have to avoid the school schedule.

412
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,480
Just 10 times.

413
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,880
10 times is enough.

414
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,880
He's a very good student.

415
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,880
What are you doing?

416
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,080
I don't want trouble anymore.

417
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,680
Really?

418
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
I'm not.

419
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
I need you to confirm something.

420
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
I don't want to.

421
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
What is there to confirm?

422
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
After I'm sure,

423
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
I'll tell you.

424
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
I've been thinking about you.

425
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
I don't know.

426
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Walking, eating, taking a shower,

427
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
playing games, even sleeping,

428
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
I can see you.

429
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Are you okay?

430
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
It's fast.

431
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
It's true.

432
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
I like you.

433
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
What are you doing?

434
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
What are you doing?

435
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
I'm not.

436
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
What do you mean?

437
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
I'm not.

438
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,680
I'm not.

439
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
I'm not.

440
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
I'm not.

441
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
I'm not.

442
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
I'm not.

443
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
What?

444
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
What?

445
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Does anyone know what a Wasteful World is?

446
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
You're fired.

447
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Yu Shi Gu.

448
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Yu Shi Gu.

449
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
What is it?

450
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
I don't know.

451
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
Be quiet.

452
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,680
You really don't know about the Wasteful World?

453
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Do you know?

454
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Cancel the copyright of the copyrighted books

455
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
and the people's clothes.

456
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
What about the rights of the people and the rights of the people?

457
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
The rights of the people and the rights of the people.

458
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Sit down.

459
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Yes.

460
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Focus.

461
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
Others, go in and read the textbook.

462
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Thirdly,

463
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Economic Reform, as I said, is very important.

464
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
To abolish the trade system and the right of the nobility,

465
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
encourage free trade,

466
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
encourage the common people to be free of trade.

467
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
This exam must be taken.

468
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Did you hear that?

469
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Write it down.

470
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
I don't want to repeat it again.

471
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm sorry.

472
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
I'll help you stand in the bed.

473
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
You don't have both.

474
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
I'm sorry.

475
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
You eat something before you go to bed?

476
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Come here.

477
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
I don't get it.

478
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
You look so thin.

479
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Why do you want to lose weight?

480
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Don't worry.

481
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
The way I chase after my girlfriend is always...

482
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
You don't have one?

483
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,100
I mean what happened between 처리 disappearance...

484
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:20,800
Then

485
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,600
never mind

486
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,880
You will feel it

487
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,140
Don't make me talk nonsense

488
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,640
What're you gonna do?

489
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,640
I really want to chase you.

490
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Are you a man or not?

491
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
I already want to apologize.

492
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Can you be more straightforward?

493
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
I'm very straightforward.

494
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
I just want to chase you.

495
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
I'm sorry.

496
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
I'm sorry.

497
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
I'm sorry.

498
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
I'm sorry.

500
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
I'm sorry.

501
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm sorry.

502
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
I'm sorry.

503
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
I'm sorry.

504
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640

505
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
I'm sorry.

506
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
I'm sorry.

507
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
I'm sorry.

508
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
I'm sorry.

509
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm sorry.

510
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,640
I'm sorry.

511
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
I'm sorry.

512
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
I'm sorry.

513
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
I'm sorry.

514
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640

I'm sorry.

526
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
