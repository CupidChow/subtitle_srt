1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再更叠

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
而我盲目的追不低头妥协

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
想保护着谁

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿拥有你的明天

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我只想在我一边

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
每天都能将面对

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
生命总会有机会

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
而你准备要浪费

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
在我一边

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
每天都能将面对

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
生命总会有机会

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
也太空了吧

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
哪一个

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
不能关房门

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
向永青

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
他不在

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
只剪笔记

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
麻醺是禽兽加野兽

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
必须把房门打开

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
要補上吗

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
这不是钱的问题

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
你妹说得对

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
不可以关门

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
赶快过来读书了

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
包着

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
你都没有在背公信

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
好好用功喔

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
你看这个

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
抛物线

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
划好Y-2的平方

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
等于8抛号X加1的

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
焦点坐标跟准限方程式

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
黄老师有说过

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
看到这个

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
我们一定要先求

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
这个焦点坐标

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
然后这个Y-2的平方

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
你会求吗

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
那你先吃饭吧

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
像好点

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
可是要给我奖励

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
这什么

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
奖励啊

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
还有吗

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
还有什么

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
就这样

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
我不管

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
我还要

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
我以为你不让我去你的庆祝会

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
是有更多其他的奖励

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
你都旋转我

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
我们还没有正式的交往

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
要等你考上国立大学才算

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
我不要

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
不要管那么多了

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
你学测考那么烂

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
还信不信我们顺利交往

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
希望

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
那我要我的奖励

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
好不要赌了

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
也不要搅我

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
对不起

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
是我不够重视

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
从今天开始

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
我会更努力

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
更认真

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
更用功

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
等你上大学之后

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
我一定会把你

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
跟爸爸糖一起吃掉

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
谢谢

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
谢谢

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
谢谢

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
你先把交点坐标求出来

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
出一二

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
再来

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
高老师你们还不过来

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
高老师我要吃了

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
我不要吃这格子什么

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
谢谢

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
谢谢

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
谢谢

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
谢谢

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
谢谢

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
谢谢

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
谢谢

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
谢谢

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
谢谢

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
谢谢

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
谢谢

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
谢谢

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
谢谢

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
谢谢

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
谢谢

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
这是传说中

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
未来奋斗的男人

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
好帅

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
像豪庭

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
原来这就是恋爱的感觉

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
吓人

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
吓人

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
高老师

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
吓人

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
别干嘛

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
马亨西说

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
翻到距离我们

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
多少光年

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
多少光年

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
三十六光年的地光

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
来做测量

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
像豪庭

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
哟

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
上课还在睡觉

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
我没有

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
我在做笔记

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
我看你是在做笔记

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
还是在睡觉

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
马上就知道了

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
来

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
恒星颜色与表面温度

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
何谓光

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
回答

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
电磁波的总称

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
天文观测的两个波段

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
波段回答

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
可见光跟

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
无线电波

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
可以喔

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
大家干什么拍手啊

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
你要记得这一个

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
跟这一个的差别在哪里

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
因为他们两个很像

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
如果你有一点点

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
搞不清楚的话

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
你后面的题目都不用做了

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
这个的话

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
我就可以直接删掉

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
前面这个

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
你怎么了

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
不知道

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
有点不舒服

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
我看

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
没事啦

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
我看啦

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
嘴巴脏脏的

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
你看那么油

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
中午吃饭都不吃干净

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
你看

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
害我又要

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
去洗澡

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
还有脏

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
脏脏的

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
你要干嘛

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
刚刚到底发生什么事情

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
看到了吗

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
看着他好咳

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
好咳口

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
指甲快到了

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
好想咬

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
不行

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
定心

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
定心

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
拜你

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
怎么在这里

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
你不认得我了

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
好久不见

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
你怎么在这

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
买书啊

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
没想到竟然

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
可以被一家明星带

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
无聊

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
我刚就想问

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
你已经高中毕业很久了吧

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
这参考书

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
我爸我没有买的

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
是男朋友吧

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
是啊

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
怎么了

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
没事

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
男朋友挺好的

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
家人都还好吗

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
都很好啊

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
心里都很健康

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
你呢

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
你又要念书又要工作

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
我跟你讲

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
听说设计系压力很大

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
大哦

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
爸爸有点习惯啊

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
爸爸

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
那你身边有人陪吗

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
怎么样

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
你现在是要挖大明星的八卦是不是

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
不过我要谢谢你

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
谢什么

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
谢谢你的壮烈牺牲啊

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
在前面帮我挡了一刀

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
那我在家属面前

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
才可以更

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
轻松直载的生活

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
那今天这次还给你钱

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
我只是个学生

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
学生

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
你这时候就说自己是学生

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
我妈还有外国

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
他们都很想你

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
但是外公想不想你

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
我就不清楚了

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
因为大家也是一样

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
不敢在外公面前

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
想你的名字

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
不过

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
我有感应

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
我有个感觉

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
你回家的日子不远了舅舅

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
那你感应一下

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
我们等一下要吃什么

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
孙伯

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
现在这次让你

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
下次换你拿这个

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
看你怎么有爱

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
你干嘛一直看着我

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
没有爱在那边怪装备

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
因为你比花还可爱

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
最好是

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
你确定要扫我牙

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
你确定要扫我牙

232
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
你不要过来

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
不可以扫我

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
哈喽

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
哈喽两位同学

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
那个

237
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
这里是校园

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
所以呢

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
我们可以不要这样子打情骂俏吗

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
干嘛

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
羡慕啊

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
是有一点羡慕

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
我操我操你

244
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
不要 myself

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
走路

246
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
走路

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,500
民心

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
别 compon

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
bang

250
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
形成

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,440
Go for it!

252
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,360
Then turn around.

253
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:22,820
If you can't três,

254
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,980
go back.

255
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,480
E Image

256
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:39,380
Eyelash

257
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:46,960
Finding Your Foi

258
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,980
Cut gorgeous

259
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,700
Surprise

260
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,680
Aren't you supposed to be studying now?

261
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,980
Happy birthday

262
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,320
What joke is this?

263
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,220
You're 16

264
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,520
Yeap

265
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Why not?

266
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,240
Look

267
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,240
For you, I made it myself.

268
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Fireflies are good at making cakes.

269
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Happy birthday to you.

270
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Happy birthday to you.

271
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Happy birthday, Xu Yuan.

272
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,240
My first wish is to have a good sound and get into the top five.

273
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,240
My first wish is to have a good sound and get into the top five.

274
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,240
That's a waste. You don't need to make that wish.

275
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
You'll definitely make it.

276
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
That's a good thing.

277
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
Hurry up, the second one.

278
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,240
I hope that my aunt, Brother Zhi Kang, and Uncle Sun,

279
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
and the high school students in the countryside,

280
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,240
can all be healthy.

281
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Alright, alright.

282
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,240
You can't tell your first wish.

283
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
Xiao Xiao, let's go.

284
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Thank you.

285
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Thank you.

286
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
It's good.

287
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
It's good.

288
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
This is all yours.

289
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Take a picture.

290
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Take a picture.

291
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Xiao Xiao, listen.

292
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
You can't run away.

293
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Thank you, thank you.

294
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
What are you doing?

295
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
I want to take a picture first.

296
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
If I don't turn back...

297
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
You won't jump into the photo.

298
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
Shoot it!

299
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,480
Dosie, fast.

300
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,540
Meal.

301
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,880
What would it be,

302
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
the retiree's recipe?

303
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,680
End마의 거대는

304
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,040
Emily has failed the test,

305
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
and couldn't get her son's tracks.

306
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,840
Easy-peasy.

307
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,280
Let's eat them!

308
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,080
It's so nice.

309
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,280
How's the empty okumata soup?

310
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
It's so delicious.

311
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Oh, right. You have to review your own barbecue. That's very important.

312
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,280
I'll help you mark the important points.

313
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,480
What's wrong? Are you okay?

314
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,480
I'm fine. I was just thinking...

315
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,280
You're so busy with your week-end schedule.

316
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,680
Anyway, my homework is almost done. I can do it myself.

317
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,080
It's okay. I'll use my time well.

318
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Before school, I'll definitely earn more money...

319
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,680
No. What if you get tired?

320
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,480
Then come home with me later. I want to take notes for Tian Cai.

321
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,280
No need. Just give it to me tomorrow.

322
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,880
I'm going home now. Bye.

323
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,680
Bye-bye.

324
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,680
The end result is determined by the results of the opening ceremony.

325
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,080
Japan has to surrender unconditionally.

326
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,280
Is there a problem?

327
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
No.

328
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Let's end the class here.

329
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Come on.

330
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Let's go.

331
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Let's go.

332
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,280
I'm going to the welfare center. Do you need anything?

333
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
I'm going to the welfare center. Do you need anything?

334
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,080
A kneecap?

335
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,880
No, thanks.

336
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Then I'm leaving.

337
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,080
Senbo.

338
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,080
Are you looking for Xiang Yangting?

339
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,880
Yes, he's here.

340
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,080
He's asking for a sick leave. He didn't tell you?

341
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,680
Sick leave? No.

342
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,080
That's so strange.

343
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,280
He's also asking for a sick leave when I'm on the phone.

344
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,080
He's crazy.

345
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,480
Did he say anything to her?

346
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,680
I thought he was going to tell you.

347
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,280
He's probably been using his brain too much lately.

348
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,280
He's become weak and suddenly has a fever.

349
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,880
Poor thing.

350
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
He's wearing a cotton blanket.

351
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,080
He was like this last night. He was a bit tired.

352
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,680
He said he was dizzy and had a headache.

353
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,680
It's good that I took him to the doctor this morning.

354
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,280
How could this happen?

355
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Auntie, what did the doctor say?

356
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,280
The doctor said it's okay. Just rest well.

357
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,680
Take your medicine on time and cool off. You'll get better faster.

358
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,080
Thank goodness you're here. I'm going out with Dad later.

359
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
Help me take care of him.

360
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,280
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Hello, Mr. Liu.

362
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm going out now.

363
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,880
We'll be there in about 10 minutes.

364
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Yes, okay. See you later.

365
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,280
Okay, okay. Bye.

366
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Bye.

367
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Dad.

368
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,080
Yes?

369
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,480
Mr. Liu.

370
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,280
Yes?

371
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Dad.

372
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,480
He's still not asleep?

373
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,480
You're all warmed up.

374
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,280
It's the flash somersault.

375
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,680
Come here.

376
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
Xiang Li.

377
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Be careful

378
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Lie down

379
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Give it to me

380
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
I want it

381
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Stop it

382
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
Lie down

383
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Help me

384
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
Lie down

385
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll help you

386
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Lie down

387
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Enough

388
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Lie down

389
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Why are you here?

390
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
I

391
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
I want to give your brother my notebook

392
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
So weird

393
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:10,280
I still don't understand why I'm waiting

394
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Waiting for someone who will remember who's rely

395
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Only me wandering alone in the abyss

396
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,280
When the blue sky and white clouds disappear

397
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,280
That yellow paper and red coat will take you away

398
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,280
When all the colors with you leave

399
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Deep tears will not stop falling with me

400
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,280
I still don't understand why you left

401
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,280
I still don't understand why I'm waiting

402
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Waiting for someone who will remember who's rely

403
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Only me wandering alone in the abyss

404
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,280
When a story is not a regret

405
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Let two hearts run to the future

406
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Those past memories are only regrets

407
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:29,280
I still don't understand why tears can't stop
