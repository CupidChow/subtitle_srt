陪你老板燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再更变

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
而我盲目的追 低头妥协 想保护着谁

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿 拥有你的明天

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
我只想在我一边 每天都能将面对

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
生命总会有机会 而你准备要浪费

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000

18
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Please

19
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We are students

20
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We will be taking exams in a few months

21
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you don't eat well and take good care of yourself

22
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You will fall down before the exam

23
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And

24
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You have to go out to work in the middle of the night

25
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Really?

26
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't like to take advantage of people

27
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't want to be pitied either

28
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't pity you. I like you

29
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm trying to please you

30
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because as long as you are happy

31
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I will be very happy

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then I don't want you to be happy

33
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What are you doing?

34
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is this ok?

35
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What ok?

36
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not happy

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Who?

38
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Who?

39
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Who?

40
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Who?

41
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Who?

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Who?

43
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Who?

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Who?

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Who?

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Who?

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Who?

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who?

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You smiled

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You smiled

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes! Really!

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's eat some noodles

53
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How am I supposed to eat if you are holding me like this?

54
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then after I let go

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You can't run away

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What do you want?

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How can a man be more difficult than a woman?

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Sir, can you not be so mean?

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not a man

60
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm a woman

61
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not a woman

62
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You are a woman

63
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm a woman

64
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You are a woman

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You are a woman

66
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm a woman

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm a woman

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm a woman

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sir, can you not be so angry

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and complain?

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You are so divided

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ok, shut your mouth

73
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You are blind

74
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You can't blame me

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He finally finished the noodles I gave him

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And I found out

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He seems to like carrots

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He picked up the carrots with great care

79
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He finally

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is so weird

82
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You are eating noodles

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What are you looking at?

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What do you know?

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is called watching with your heart

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Listen and watch

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Feel

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you really like boys?

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I only like him

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yu Xi Gu is also a boy

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't know what to tell you

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Anyway, I like him so much now

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I just want to be with him

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I just want him

96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You always say that

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You mean

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He is at your uncle's

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Brother

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Brother

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is he working at your brother's?

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Then you help me ask

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What he likes or where he usually goes

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Why?

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
No, he is not like Brother Zhigang

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I saw him touching his head

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't want

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why do you touch his head?

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can't admit it

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Who?

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
When?

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So you already know

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He is working there

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What do you mean?

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What do you mean?

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I didn't hear what you said

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Really?

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What do you mean?

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I give you a chance

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I forget

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You are a bad brother

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Go away

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why did you take so long?

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How long?

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't know

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I am sorry

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Do you know

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is more scary than the A movie

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The girl is looking at me

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And she is laughing at me

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Have you seen it?

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We have the courage to watch it alone

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We should watch it together

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't be so exaggerated

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's watch it together

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why?

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But we can understand A-Xiao

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
by watching the A-Xiao movie

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
For the brother

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
For our friendship

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We should know more about him

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If we are not told the right things

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Or if we are not told the right things

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Sun will leave us

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
For the brother

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
For the brother

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
See

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So big

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What?

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So big

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Where do you want to go?

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You scared me

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I forgot to tell her

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
She grabbed me and wanted to kick me

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I was beaten

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You didn't react

164
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't love anymore

165
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You are lying

166
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I am sorry

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So what do you want now?

168
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I said

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I want to keep a distance

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It doesn't matter

171
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So do you want to help Xiao Hao?

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Help what?

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I told you five minutes ago

174
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You didn't listen

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What?

176
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He wants to chase the fish in your shop

177
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Xiao Gu

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You know him?

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Kind of

180
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You are not afraid of me?

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What?

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You don't need to wait for me

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You are going home alone

185
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I have been gone for two and a half years

186
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You can't be so careless

187
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What if you are offended by the criminals

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I am a boy

189
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So you think all the victims of the social news

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Are not boys

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You should be hurt by the social news

192
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I will help you

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No need

194
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What are you doing?

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I am telling you

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I am hurt by the social news

197
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You should be more careful

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It hurts

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It hurts

200
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You are fooled

201
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You said you don't need me

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What do you want now?

203
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I am a bad guy

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You are a bad guy

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I won't forgive you

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I need you

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I need you

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What do you need?

209
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I need you to wait for me

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Then?

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Then go home with me

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And

213
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What else?

214
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What else?

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I need you

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I need you

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You need me

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I need you

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I love you

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I love you

221
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I love you

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I love you

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,280
You're so cool.

224
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,160
Pass.

225
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,120
Pass.

226
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,040
Air ball.

227
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,880
You don't need to return the ball.

228
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,120
Why do you need to return the ball?

229
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,880
How dare you?

230
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,600
Again.

231
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
Pass.

232
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,480
Come on.

233
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,680
White.

234
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,240
White.

235
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,600
White.

236
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,480
White.

237
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,400
So beautiful.

238
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,920
Damn it.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,680
Pass.

240
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,360
It's so hot.

241
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,160
So thirsty.

242
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,920
Let's go play.

243
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,320
Let's go.

244
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,960
Okay.

245
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,840
Let's go.

246
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,960
Hey.

247
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,440
You just bought drinks.

248
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,520
Why do you go to the mall

249
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,040
after two people went to buy drinks?

250
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,440
How can we three play if we're left alone?

251
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,360
Right?

252
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,960
Come back.

253
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,000
Wait.

254
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,720
How about

255
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,880
Ah Hao buy us drinks?

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,040
I'll pay you.

257
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,600
No.

258
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,920
You want to buy Switch.

259
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,720
But you haven't bought it.

260
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,800
You asked me to buy drinks

261
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
and you still pay me.

262
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,760
You're really brothers.

263
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,560
Brother.

264
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,120
Stop it.

265
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,840
Go and buy it.

266
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,240
You two, don't think that I didn't find out

267
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,920
that you two are always

268
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,440
acting like a couple.

269
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,120
Tell me.

270
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,600
What do you want from Sun Bo?

271
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,360
Well...

272
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,200
Okay.

273
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,720
We want to tell Ah Xiang

274
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
that we understand him.

275
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,800
Do you understand him?

276
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,200
No.

277
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,840
I want to see him.

278
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,480
I ada understand him.

279
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,320
What do you want to say?

280
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,520
There are just no chances in life.

281
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,640
Will I find a girl

282
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,280
to hide the truth?

283
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,760
Just잉

284
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,360
Just.

285
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
I have to kill you.

286
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,320
finest.

287
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,480
Don't be afraid of being called real.

288
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,560
Okay.

289
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,880
Okay?

290
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,000
What do you understand?

291
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,640
You just like...

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,600
So that's what you're talking about.

293
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
What?

294
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,200
We want to say that even if you like a guy,

295
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
we are still brothers.

296
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,900
Actually, we've read some comics.

297
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,400
But we really don't know that world.

298
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,000
If we say anything wrong in the future, don't mind it.

299
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,200
Yes, just say that love is your freedom.

300
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,300
No matter what, we are still good brothers.

301
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,000
Brother, you're not that heartless.

302
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Jiayi, you're good at everything.

303
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
That's a must. I'm good at everything.

304
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,200
What is it?

305
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
I like guys.

306
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,600
How is that possible? How can you not know?

307
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,400
I've been chasing after others for so long.

308
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,400
It seems like you really didn't notice.

309
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,600
You didn't notice?

310
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,600
Don't die!

311
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
It's okay.

312
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
What is this? What is this?

313
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,800
Let's go.

314
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
You're so silly.

315
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
What are you doing here?

316
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm here to find him.

317
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Me?

318
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know.

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,800
If it's about Siyu...

320
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm not going to help you.

321
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,400
What are you doing?

322
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,400
You're so weird today. Why are you looking for me?

323
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,000
You have a lot of photos of the fish tank.

324
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
How did you know?

325
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Photos. Photos of the fish tank.

326
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Wait, I know you and Baby Yu have a lot of things to worry about.

327
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
I won't betray you.

328
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
You've misunderstood.

329
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,000
You've misunderstood.

330
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We're now...

331
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,800
brothers.

332
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,000
How is that possible?

333
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Nothing impossible.

334
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,400
I don't believe you.

335
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,800
I'll exchange the photos.

336
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,600
Exchange what?

337
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,200
Photos.

338
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,200
You have a photo of my friend!

339
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,600
I don't have one.

340
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
I play with him every day to play with myself.

341
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,400
I play with him every day after school. I don't have a photo of him.

342
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
You're so bad at taking photos.

343
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
I took it secretly.

344
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,400
Mine is also a secret.

345
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,000
You took it secretly too?

346
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
You took it?

347
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
This one?

348
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,600
I want this one.

349
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,200
Wait, wait.

350
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,400
I said I wouldn't let you hurt my boyfriend.

351
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,200
I can only tell you a secret.

352
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
What secret?

353
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
I like...

354
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Yu...

355
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,800
Xi...

356
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
Gu.

357
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Really? Really?

358
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,000
Really.

359
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Really? You didn't take it, right?

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,400
When? When?

361
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
Now.

362
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
Really? You didn't take it, right?

363
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
Really.

364
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,800
What?

365
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,200
The password.

366
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Are you sick?

367
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,800
Excuse me, please put water in your cup.

368
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Be careful.

369
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Thank you.

370
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,200
You have to drink colby's tea today, okay?

371
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
A cup of colby's tea, please.

372
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,200
Colby's tea.

373
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
What about you?

374
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Water. Thank you.

375
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,800
Ask.

376
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
Brother Zhi Kang, that...

377
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
Grandma Sun said you have something to ask us.

378
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,200
We thought we had something to ask you.

379
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,400
You want to ask about Gu, right?

380
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,200
Yes. Yes, Yu Xi Gu.

381
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,600
She works at your place.

382
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,200
So you should know her well when we were young.

383
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know...

384
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I can't help you with her.

385
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Excuse me.

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Here is your colby's tea.

387
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay. Thank you.

388
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,800
Thank you.

389
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,200
Here is your soda.

390
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,000
Please enjoy.

391
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,600
Do you know Gu lives alone?

392
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
I know.

393
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,600
Do you know why she works so hard to get a scholarship?

394
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't know.

395
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,400
Because Gu needs to take care of herself.

396
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Her parents left her very early.

397
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,400
So she grew up with her aunt.

398
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,400
But since she got married and had a child,

399
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,800
she doesn't want to bother her aunt anymore.

400
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
So she works hard to get a scholarship.

401
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,000
But she works part-time at my place.

402
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why does she work so hard?

403
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
To get into a good university.

404
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Because only in a good environment can she find a good job.

405
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,800
Her future life will be better and better.

406
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,400
I don't understand what Zhigang means.

407
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,600
She is different from you.

408
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
She has dreams and ambitions.

409
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,000
She doesn't have time to play with you.

410
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Why does she work so hard?

411
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,400
She is a better future.

412
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,400
So you only want to ruin her.

413
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,600
I don't want to.

414
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,800
Gu doesn't look like that.

415
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,600
She is shy and introverted.

416
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,000
She has no friends.

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,200
She has never been in a relationship.

418
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,800
So?

419
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,800
Please let her go.

420
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
You came here to tell me this?

421
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
You are not my dad or my mom.

422
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,000
Why do you have to tell me so much?

423
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
Like what?

424
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,600
You are so bad to me.

425
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
You want me to let her go and ruin her.

426
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
What? You are doing this on your own.

427
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,000
Okay.

428
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,200
I will do it on my own.

429
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,400
I am so angry.

430
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,600
Where are you going?

431
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,800
You are not my brother.

432
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,400
Hey!

433
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,000
You are not allowed to scold Zhigang.

434
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
What are you doing?

435
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,200
When the blue sky and white clouds disappear

436
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,600
The red blood and red blood will take you away

437
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,000
When all colors are gone with the dawn

438
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,800
The tears in my eyes will not stop falling with me

439
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,200
I still don't understand why you left

440
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,200
I still don't understand why I'm waiting

441
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,000
Waiting for someone to remember their dependence

442
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm alone in the world waiting for you

443
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,800
When a story turns into two regrets

444
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:02,200
Let two hearts run towards the bright future

445
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,600
But I can't forget the good times

446
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,600
I still don't understand why I can't stop crying
