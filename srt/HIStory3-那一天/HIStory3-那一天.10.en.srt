00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再更叶

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
而我盲目的追 低头妥协

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
想保护着谁

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿 拥有你的明天

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我只想在我一边

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
每天都能将面对

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
生命总会有机会

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
而你准备要浪费

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
在我一边

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
在我一边

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It hurts! What are you doing?

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're going to eavesdrop on it.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll close the door and open it.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If you're going to eavesdrop on it,

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it's not going to hurt your ears.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Go away.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Sit on my bed.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sit.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How did you know my house was here?

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I wanted something from Uncle Sun.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I wanted to tell you.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You wanted to be with me?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I wanted to say I knew it wasn't your house.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How did you know it wasn't my house?

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're not that kind of person.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're not going to marry me.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't care if you believe it or not.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I know it wasn't your house.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It must be the midterm exam.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They thought you hated me.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's why they used this method.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You don't have to come to the court.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But...

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But I came.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And I said it was my house.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I said the photo was taken by me.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You've never been to a bar.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You were beaten and locked up at home.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I know you know what I mean.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I believe you know what I mean.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I know.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You've always liked me.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I didn't.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You didn't?

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Liu Meifeng gave me 132 photos of you.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How could that be?

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't lie. I have evidence.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This one.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Your vision is on me.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I used the red circle to look up.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You said you didn't.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I did look at you.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Of course.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You said you didn't like me.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I didn't like you.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was just curious.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Curious?

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you curious about?

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I...

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know I care about my grades.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I go to the school card.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The second-place exam...

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I got the second place in the school.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was four points behind.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I thought you were my rival.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I was wrong.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I was wrong.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was wrong.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I was wrong.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You were my rival.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wait.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No way.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So you started to notice me because of this?

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I thought...

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I thought...

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But after that, you kept your discipline.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I thought you were special.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I did whatever I wanted.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I did whatever I wanted.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I didn't get restricted.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I didn't care about others.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's like...

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You were holding everything in your hands.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't praise me.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not praising you.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I really envy you.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What?

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I can't be like you.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why?

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't want to burden others.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't be the burden of others.

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why?

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How can you be the burden of others?

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I really envy you.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I grew up with my aunt.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She got married and had a baby.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She was tired.

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I had to be independent.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I had to be strong.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I had to rely on myself.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I really want to be like you.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can laugh and be angry.

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can easily be a burden to others.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't care about being punished or sent to prison.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Just looking at you...

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I feel a little bit more independent.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you know?

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
After I met you...

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I started to think...

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I thought...

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If parents didn't leave so early...

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Would everything be different?

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Would everything be different?

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
From now on, you and I...

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I will give you everything I have.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:57,940
When it's time to

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're right.

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But Xiang Hao Ting is still protecting him.

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Listen.

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Xiao Guo won't have any problems if you don't date him.

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't hate Xiang Hao Ting.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If you know him longer,

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
you'll know he's a real man.

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You're saying you're a real man after a few years.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're old enough.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm angry.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're angry so easily.

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That means you're still a little boy.

141
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But you're my little boy.

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Whatever.

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
My brother sent me to work out this week.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why don't you come to work out later?

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Go to work with me.

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Did you work out that day?

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I was so busy.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay. Did you work out that day?

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's go.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's go.

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay.

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay.

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's go.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Good morning.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Breakfast.

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I miss you so much.

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why did you call me?

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I prepared breakfast.

161
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You eat that.

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And eat that.

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I prepared it.

164
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you.

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You really want to give it to me?

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Of course.

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Actually, I have one more important thing.

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Please.

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
My dad is still angry.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I want to say that

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll do better next time.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
To make him happy.

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Please count me as the second place.

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll do better next time.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay.

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're so good at your homework.

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's no problem.

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And I can follow you.

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm not working.

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm at school.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm going to study.

183
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
My class schedule is less.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Especially on weekends.

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Then let's do it on weekends.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll go to your house on weekends.

188
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay.

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Go home. Don't be scolded.

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay.

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm going to class.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You like this?

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't you think it's cute?

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What's its name?

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It has no name.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Just call it Xiao Bai.

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Xiao Bai?

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Xiao Bai.

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Xiao Bai, eat jelly.

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yu.

202
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Eat chocolate.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm going to work.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay.

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll go to your house on weekends.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay.

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm going to class.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay.

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm going to class.

211
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay.

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm going to work.

213
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay.

214
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm going to class.

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay.

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm going to work.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay.

219
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll go to class.

220
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll go to class.

221
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Okay.

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay.

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What's wrong with her today?

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's wrong with her today?

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
She said that her classmate is coming to teach her.

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Is she working?

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't know.

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Come here.

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Come here.

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Is she a girl?

231
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If she is, the door will open.

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yu Xi Gu.

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hello, I'm Hao Ting's classmate.

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm Yu Xi Gu.

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Not bad.

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
She's awesome.

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
She's the best in every class.

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
She's the best student in the whole school.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're so nice.

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Welcome.

241
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm glad you have a good classmate.

242
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Come here.

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Sit down.

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She's coming to study with me.

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't disturb her.

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

247
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Go to work.

248
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Do you want to eat or drink?

249
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll prepare it.

250
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thank you.

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Mommy.

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I saw this person in the phone.

253
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
She didn't let me talk to her.

254
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I think it's weird.

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's okay.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's a boy.

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Since it's a guest, you should prepare to eat.

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I drew some points.

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Put it away.

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll do it later.

261
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Come with me.

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Call me.

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Come with me.

264
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Call me.

265
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I want to make your dad happy.

266
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're happy when you come to my dad.

267
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You said studying hard won't be a waste of time.

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have.

269
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Focus.

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll study.

271
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll study.

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll study.

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I've always been modest to teachers.

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But I don't have to be modest to face the truth of the new person.

275
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
People who recite usually should know...

276
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Hello.

277
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Mommy.

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Be careful.

279
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You've worked hard.

280
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Drink some water if you feel sore or tired.

281
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And fruit.

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't be shy.

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why don't we eat some apples now?

284
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Here.

285
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Thank you.

286
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I want to thank you.

287
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Thank you.

288
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Why are you so naughty?

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Auntie.

290
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Mission accomplished.

291
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yes.

292
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Keep going.

293
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Mom, close the door.

294
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm more focused.

295
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's reasonable.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If you're free tonight,

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you can stay for dinner.

298
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Auntie, don't bother.

299
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's okay.

300
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Keep going.

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Keep going.

302
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll do my best.

303
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll go get ready.

304
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Love you, mom.

305
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Goodbye.

306
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Goodbye.

307
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Goodbye.

308
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Bye-bye, mom.

309
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
Mom.

310
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Goodbye.

311
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Bye-bye.

312
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
line

313
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,000
Miwa

314
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Bye-bye, Miwa wildly.

315
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Miwa.

316
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Goodbye.

317
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
You're fine by yourself, right?

318
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm fine.

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm looking for a girlfriend.

320
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,800
Okay.

321
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
You have to clean up everything.

322
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Also, I know.

323
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
The equipment is back in place.

324
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,800
The lights are off, so you can get some air.

325
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,200
The security system.

326
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Yes, yes, yes. I remember.

327
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Don't worry.

328
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
Shhh.

329
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,600
Hello, Baby.

330
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Yes, I'm on my way. I'm almost there.

331
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,600
I'm downstairs at your place. In five seconds, he'll...

332
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,000
Five, four, three, five, five...

333
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Do you have a ticket?

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
No.

335
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,200
Hurry up and pack up. I'll take you to eat later.

336
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,800
Okay.

337
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
Why are you here?

338
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,800
For you.

339
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,600
You must be tired from working so hard.

340
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,000
Be considerate.

341
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
Thank you.

342
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,400
You're welcome.

343
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,200
Merry Christmas.

344
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Happy Birthday.

345
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Happy Birthday.

346
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,800
But I'm not ready.

347
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I have you.

348
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,600
Yes.

349
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
What are you doing?

350
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm happy.

351
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Idiot.

352
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,600
Let's go.

353
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,400
Wait for me.

354
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
What are you doing?

355
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,400
I'm calling a cab.

356
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,000
No, it's expensive.

357
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,800
How do you get home at this time?

358
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
At the convenience store.

359
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,600
I have my books.

360
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
You just finished work. What books are you reading?

361
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,200
You need to relax now.

362
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,200
I'll take you to a place.

363
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,600
I don't have a bus right now.

364
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,800
I have a car.

365
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,200
Ta-da. Get in the car.

366
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I have everything you want.

367
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,800
Is it convenient?

368
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,000
Idiot.

369
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Let's go.

370
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Follow me.

371
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Wait for me.

372
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Where are we going?

373
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Where are we going?

374
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
I can't tell you yet.

375
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Why?

376
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Where are we going?

377
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Where are we going?

378
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,800
It's almost done. I'll help you later.

379
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,600
Okay.

380
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
I'm sorry.

381
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I'm sorry.

382
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I'm sorry.

383
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
I'm sorry.
