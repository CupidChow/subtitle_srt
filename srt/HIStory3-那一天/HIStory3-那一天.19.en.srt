00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再更叠

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
而我盲目的追不低头妥协

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
想保护着谁

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿拥有你的明天

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我只想在我一边

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
每天都能叫面对

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
生命总会有机会

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
而你准备要浪费

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
在我一边

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
在我一边

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How is it? Have you contacted the professor?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Almost.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When do you plan to book the flight?

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In mid-July.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Mid-July? That's so fast.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll go to the airport early. It's more ideal.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have to tell your dad. He's been concerned about you.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's asked me many times.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Did you tell me that you'd pick up the flight tomorrow or the day after?

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He hasn't bought the ticket yet. I'll wait for him to tell me.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Where are you going to stay when you come back?

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll help you clean up your room.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll give you the kitchen.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's okay. I won't be leaving so soon.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There are still a lot of things to do.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm planning to take her to Huan Tao.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
After all, I have to stay for a while before I come back.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You should take her to Huan Tao.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Although she went two years earlier than you,

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
this time she applied for a US lab

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and is going to run a school.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You should thank her.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait a minute.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It smells so good.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When can I drink the pineapple kumquat tea that Mom made?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I can't wait for you to leave.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll wait for you.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Why so sudden?

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Hey, Uncle.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Please change your clothes.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's been a long time.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Here.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Here.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is meaningful to me.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Look at our new products.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Not bad.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You've made a lot of money lately.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There are stores all over Taiwan.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A few friends of mine are willing to invest.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Invest?

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you want to be my friend and make a movie together?

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Movie?

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Your uncle might not be able to.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's take a picture of our cover.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Cover?

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Sure.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How much do you want to pay me?

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You are...

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm your uncle.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Uncle?

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll give you 9.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The best award is the Queen of gold.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's to protect the golden city.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The best award is the captain.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's to set the standard for violence.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The highest award is 50,000 times or 100,000 times.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The next lucky person is you.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Macau's new Beijing Entertainment City.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
931.931.com

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tell me.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's wrong?

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
My grandpa asked me to give it to you.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He said he didn't need it.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Grandpa is still the same.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I really admire you two.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You've been holding on for so long.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You haven't given up.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Who said that?

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I've already given up.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is from my grandma.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No wonder.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was thinking that every time you see this

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
you'll smile even if you wear a bitter face.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're just laughing in pain.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We finally have an appointment.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We haven't been together for so long.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I really miss you.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What have you been up to lately?

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Lately?

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've been busy working with the platform.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's great.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You can look for me.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let me tell you.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
My photography skills are at another level.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can look for him.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
How about next time?

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Be serious.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Be serious.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's take a picture.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's been a long time.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's take a picture.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wait for the camera.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He's late.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ignore him.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Miss me?

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're still so shy.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why are you so late?

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Am I?

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm late.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What's the point of being late?

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Three cups.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I can't.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm driving today.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Driving is a trick.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let me tell you.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Water.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Boss, I want water.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I want a big can.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can't.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You have nothing to say about water, right?

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Thank you.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sun.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Just for you.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Come on.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Give me a drink.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You can't avoid it.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Drink it up.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Drink it.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Drink it.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Cheers.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Too much.

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's just water.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Drink it.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Drink it.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Wait.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What?

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Who is this for?

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm asking you.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You want to drink it, right?

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You want to change your mind.

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You want to drink it first.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I can't.

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Drink it.

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's just water.

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why are you so dramatic?

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm late.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're late.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We haven't met for a long time.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I dare not.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Just one cup.

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't make a fuss.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Just three cups.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What are you doing?

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Drink it.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm done.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How about we drink it slowly?

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're so smart.

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're so smart.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll drink it.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Brother.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Brother.

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Sorry.

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's my fault.

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't make a fuss.

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait.

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You have to add coke to the rice ball.

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You can't do that.

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a service department.

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's different.

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But you can graduate like this.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're pretty good.

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Speaking of this,

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
it's not interesting enough.

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How long has it been?

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right.

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm afraid you'll drink it.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll graduate this week.

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's been many days.

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm working on my research plan this week

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and some recommended things.

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm going to Stanford.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Stanford.

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Is it a hair cut?

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, it's a hair cut from the school.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's the top school of the Department of Physics in the United States.

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a different world.

200
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're not only graduating,

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
but also a bodyguard.

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
A bodyguard.

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
A bodyguard is different.

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
A bodyguard.

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A bodyguard?

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What does it mean?

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What does it mean?

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It means a bodyguard.

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's a high school student.

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're a teacher.

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You should teach me.

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've graduated from college.

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I have two years of work to do.

214
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What have you been doing these two years?

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're so shy to say that.

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
A fashion director.

217
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes.

218
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're a good friend.

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You know me.

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You're as good as me.

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Who's as good as you?

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's different.

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm a professional.

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're a professional.

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you talking about?

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I want to talk about something.

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm telling you.

228
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm serious about my profession.

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I dream of it step by step.

230
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's great.

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Did you step out of that step?

232
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What are you talking about?

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Drink.

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What do you want to drink?

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Eight-spice.

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll give you my Lamborghini.

237
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Friendship.

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Friendship.

239
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Cheers.

240
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go.

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Coach, let's practice.

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sure.

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You don't practice.

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll practice.

245
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're so strong.

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can do it.

247
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You lost.

248
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I can do it.

249
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're too young.

250
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're too tall.

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
When will your son come back?

252
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I cooked the last dish.

253
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He should be back.

254
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Why did you come back so late?

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
After I finished eating with Sun Bo and the others,

256
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Professor Chen asked me to help.

257
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I really miss your teacher.

258
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Your brother is a talented student.

259
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Unlike you.

260
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If he wants to go to college, he can't graduate.

261
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, let's eat.

262
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can graduate from college.

263
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's right.

264
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're a girl friend.

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why are you dressed so pretty recently?

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm not.

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Your brother is too rude.

268
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Really?

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I bought a nice one.

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll go and put the bag away.

271
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Remember to wash your hands.

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Brother.

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dad.

274
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm young.

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Do I look pretty?

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's different.

277
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're a girl.

278
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Listen to your dad.

279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What took you so long?

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Shan Haoting, come out.

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Brother.

284
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Have you eaten?

285
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm hungry.

286
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm hungry.

287
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm hungry.

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm hungry.

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm hungry.

290
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm hungry.

291
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm hungry.

292
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm hungry.

293
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm hungry.

294
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm hungry.

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If there's a lot of things

296
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
that can't be put together

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
when you go out for the first time,

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
you can put them together

299
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and mom will take you there.

300
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go out and eat.

301
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The food is getting cold.

302
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Dad.

303
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Son.

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You've been so busy

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
these past few years.

306
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You've been spinning

307
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
like a spinning top.

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I know

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
it's not good.

310
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But

311
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
it's time.

312
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You should take it slow

313
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and let yourself live again.

314
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Otherwise,

315
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
you will

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you will miss

317
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
a lot in your life.

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And

319
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
there are a lot of people

320
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
who love you around you.

321
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I know.

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I know.

323
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I know.

324
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I know.

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I know.

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I know.

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I know.

328
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I know.

329
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I know.

330
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I know.

331
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I know.

332
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I know.

333
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I know.

334
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I know.

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I know.

336
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I know.

337
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I know.

338
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I know.

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I know.

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Dad, mom is back.

341
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Mom is back.

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm coming back.

343
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It looks so delicious.

344
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What's wrong?

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why are you so upset?

346
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Did you tell me something?

347
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Huh?

348
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I didn't.

349
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You're being returned?

350
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I was thinking about your dad's birthday.

351
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm not sure if I can give you a birthday present.

352
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm not sure if I can give you a birthday present.

353
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm not sure if I can give you a birthday present.

354
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I was thinking about your dad's birthday.

355
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I should say something.

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Didn't we agree not to give you presents?

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Don't forget.

358
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We were kicked out every year.

359
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But I think one year is better than another.

360
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Do you remember the first time we went there?

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Your dad came out to chase us with a knife.

362
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
At least we didn't step into their house this year.

363
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes, we didn't step in.

364
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But we were kicked out immediately.

365
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And it was embarrassing for our whole family.

366
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But I think this year is more embarrassing

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
than last year.

368
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's the best.

369
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I think your dad smiled this year.

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Smiled?

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think you're just a designer.

372
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Maybe.

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But that's my motivation.

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You have to do it to have a chance.

375
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Right?

376
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I know.

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I know you're nice to me.

378
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But this is not your responsibility.

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll feel bad.

380
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We're so lucky now.

381
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's not bad to have your dad to stimulate us.

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Forget it.

383
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can't stand you.

384
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Then I'll do it my way.

385
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're not only good at cooking,

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
but also a good craftsman.

387
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Dad, you can only have dinner today.

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Dad, I'm sorry.

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000

392
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm sorry.

393
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm sorry.

394
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry.

395
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm sorry.

396
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sorry.

397
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm sorry.

415
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm sorry.

430
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm sorry.

432
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sorry.

433
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sorry.

434
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry.

435
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm sorry.

436
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What sort of constant friends like you

452
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
are there?

453
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Latest to last year

454
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Li Qing,

455
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
in this photo,

456
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
who's in charge of getting better at dance troubled dance?

457
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This is the very same anarcho doctor.

458
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Not much different toarry urban icon.

459
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,680
I should have told them first.

460
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,600
We've known each other for a long time.

461
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
What do you mean?

462
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,360
Nothing.

463
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,160
I just told them.

464
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Do you know each other?

465
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,680
She said she was my senior.

466
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,200
We were together before she graduated.

467
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,160
Wow, that's great.

468
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,640
I'm not as lucky as you.

469
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,920
I want one too.

470
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,480
I don't know any senior.

471
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:30,960
Here you are.

472
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,240
I'll take a picture of you.

473
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,600
Thank you.

474
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,800
Thank you very much, attach to makeup for me.

475
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,400
What is it?

476
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,240
Is there something that has been applied on my face?

477
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,080
Look at this.

478
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
What's this?

479
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,640
My gear.

480
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,560
Gear?

481
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,000
Why show it to me?

482
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,680
You can say that later.

483
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,300
NotMC

484
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,880
Hi I really love this

485
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,160
That's cool

486
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,260
I bought a camera

487
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,000
I think

488
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,340
You are so strong

489
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,420
You go mountain climbing outside right

490
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,400
I can be a toilet patient

491
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,740
Just tell me

492
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,060
You like star so much

493
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,440
Almost become a space man

494
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,600
Never willing to give up

495
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,680
Then, I will not pick anymore

496
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,500
That's really great

497
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Okay.

498
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
If I don't have time, I'll send it to you.

499
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Hey!

500
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Before you go abroad, we have to make another deal.

501
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
And I have so many of your equipment.

502
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I must treat you to a big meal.

503
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
I'll treat you to dinner within 150 yuan.

504
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Do you know?

505
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
That day, Apple was going to have a competition with you.

506
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Whoever says his name first, loses.

507
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
The pear said,

508
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Come on.

509
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Then the pear lost.

510
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
What?

511
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
I don't understand.

512
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Joke.

513
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Joke?

514
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Where is the joke point?

515
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Senior,

516
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
You're really hard to laugh at.

517
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
I tell you, I really can't laugh.

518
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Joke.

519
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Bye.

520
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
It's not another joke, is it?

521
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500
I want to say goodbye to you this time.

522
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
It seems like we won't see each other anymore

523
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm telling you

524
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There are still many mountains that don't have a bow

525
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Don't be unreasonable

526
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,500
Eh?

527
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,500
There are too many

528
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh

529
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Every time it's like this

530
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
I'll just leave

531
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,000
Hmm?

532
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,500
Someone's treating us

533
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
I'm not a child

534
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Don't touch my hair

535
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Okay

536
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Who are you meeting today?

537
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Mountaineering equipment

538
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Oh

539
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Thank you for coming out with me today

540
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Of course I want to help you

541
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
It's going to rain soon

542
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Let's go

543
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Let's go

544
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Why did you leave

545
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,500
I still don't understand why I'm waiting

546
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Waiting for someone who will remember who's dependence

547
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Only me wandering alone in the abyss

548
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,500
When the blue sky and white clouds disappear

549
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,500
The yellow line and red line will take you away

550
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,500
When all the colors leave with you

551
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,500
The tears in my chest keep falling and accompanying me

552
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,500
I still don't understand why you left

553
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:51,500
I still don't understand why I'm waiting

554
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Waiting for someone who will remember who's dependence

555
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Only me wandering alone in the abyss

556
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,500
When a story is a regret

557
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Let two hearts run towards the future

558
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,500
But I can't forget the regret

559
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:25,500
I still don't understand why I can't stop crying
