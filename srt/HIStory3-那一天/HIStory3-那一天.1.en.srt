1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再哽咽

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
而我盲目的追不低头妥协

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
想保护着谁

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿拥有你的明天

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我只想在我一边

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
每天都能将面对

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
生命总会有机会

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
而你准备要浪费

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
在我一边

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
每天都能将面对

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
生命总会有机会

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
高群很饿

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
给我吃啦

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
给我吃啦

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
给我吃啦

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
给我吃啦

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
给我吃啦

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Bai Zhi Hao!

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're done for!

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Xie Yi Cheng, 28 points

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Jiang Sen Sen, 38 points

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Xiang Hao Ting

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Xiang Hao Ting's score is...

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
13 points!

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's too bad!

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Teacher, did I score wrong?

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I plan to get a higher score

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You got a full score in the last exam

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You didn't treat Guo Wen as a friend

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
when you got this score this time

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I thought that the teacher's day was coming

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'd like to give you a present

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Actually, I got a good score last time

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
because my sister

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She always used me as an excuse

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I thought that I should be an example

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is called a deep lesson

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Deep lesson?

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You got such a good score

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and you have an excuse?

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Teacher, I didn't mean it

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You have to believe me

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I planned all of this carefully

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm challenging myself

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
to make my decision

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's been three years

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You only know how to play

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
after a day of work

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You still want to graduate?

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Teacher, this is called freedom

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's an English class

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
not a Chinese class

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Freedom is the same

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Shut up!

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
As a student

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you should study hard

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and study hard

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What freedom?

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What freedom?

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You don't want to go to class?

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Can you not go to class?

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can I?

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can go out from there

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can?

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Freedom

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What are you doing?

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You are going back?

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Come back with me

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are so funny

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Come back

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why are you hiding?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come back

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Come back

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You are so funny

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You are so funny

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are so funny

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't go to class

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm going

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let him watch the video

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hurry up

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Look, this is the video

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
that Hao just sent to me

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He flew out

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and you were so handsome

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He actually crossed the class

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and then flew out

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Everyone was so happy

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you know what the point is?

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You don't have to go to class

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's so cool

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So comfortable

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
To freedom

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Freedom

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Freedom

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
300 per person

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You want money?

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why did he ask for 300?

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't know

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm going to buy you fried chicken

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You don't have to pay me

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
a little money

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But I just ate

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Right

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And you ran out by yourself

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No one forced you

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Xiao Shun knows

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Is there any reason?

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Fatty, don't eat before you pay

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You eat your fried chicken

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's 300 yuan a day

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm very short recently

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
300 yuan is okay

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Rich people

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Bullshit

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm really short recently

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I want to buy a Switch

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why is it only 1.5 yuan?

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't play with me

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Xiao Shun is really good

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A friend is not as good as a friend

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you for the fried chicken

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Didn't someone just say

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
300 yuan is okay?

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Give me 500 yuan

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's too much

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I really didn't eat much

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is there a classmate who hasn't paid yet?

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This classmate

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I didn't hear what you were saying

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What do you mean?

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Xiao Xu, you're looking for death

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Give it or not?

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What do you mean?

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll give it to you later

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm going to eat

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's too good

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're going to be naughty

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's bad to have a face repair

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's okay

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Take your time

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't come back

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're taking lessons and hurting yourself

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're really

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Here?

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Who found out that you were eating?

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So impulsive

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Crab is very noisy

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where does it hurt?

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It hurts here

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm warning you

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't do this again

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm worried about you

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm worried about you

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Pull up

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Xiao Zui

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How do you feel?

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Do you feel better?

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
After eating

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I won't throw up anymore

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You always save money to not eat lunch

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you keep doing this

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I won't be able to stand it

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Occasionally

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You always give me snacks

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm sorry

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Did I say

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Steamed food is the right way?

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Remember

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you feel uncomfortable

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't endure it

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You must go to the hospital for check-up

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay?

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Then you go to class when you're ready

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll go first

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Give it to me

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's go

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I was stolen by them

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm the first in the game

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why did you pay attention to him?

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He's so handsome

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We, the couple, the kids

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We will take pictures of him

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We are

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The same age

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm not

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let me show you

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How handsome he is

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is there a school?

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Mom took a picture of me

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why is he the only one in the picture?

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Does he have any other friends?

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No

214
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's tall and cold

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He only reads

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He only reads

217
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
My love

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Does he have a girlfriend?

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He's just a nerd

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Let's go

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let me show you

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How handsome he is

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm full

225
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How's the soup today?

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's good

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you, mom

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You two are so in sync

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm happy if you like it

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay, I'll go and cut the vegetables

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Thank you

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Qianqian

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Eat more flowers

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't let him eat the food

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I know

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why are you eating so slowly today?

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Does it hurt?

238
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I saw it on TV

240
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He said that a slow-cooking can help with digestion

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're so annoying

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Hello, Uncle Huang

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I know

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I've already written down

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What you told me

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Li Ming's business is my business

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't worry

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll help you with it

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll find you a place to ask

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What's wrong with him?

251
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Help me eat the chicken

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What are you laughing at?

253
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Li Ming

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Can I have some money from you?

255
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll give you three thousand

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll take it for myself

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Three thousand isn't enough

258
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I need half a year

259
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why do you want so much money?

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Be quiet

261
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I need to buy a Switch

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Switch?

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You're...

264
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't waste money

265
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I want to buy it

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I've been wanting to buy it for a long time

267
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's very expensive

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Don't be so nosy

269
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Xia Mo Qing

270
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What are you doing?

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He wants to buy a Switch

272
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're so bad at the exam

273
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You still want to buy a Switch?

274
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Dad

275
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're so bad at the exam

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You still want to buy a Switch?

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's two different things

278
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Two things are different

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You have to be fair

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You should be fair

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Fair?

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're already in the third grade

283
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
without a Switch

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and you're already in the second grade

285
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You should be happy about it

286
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You don't even go to school

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're even worse than your last name

288
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll borrow from you

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You can ask me to do housework

290
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
or run errands

291
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I can help you with the service

292
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You want to help me with the service?

293
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No

294
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He's a third-grade student

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Why do you always cut my money?

296
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm borrowing from you

297
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
not from my mom

298
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's weird

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You're always like this

300
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Annoying

301
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Fine

302
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can give you

303
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
half a year's salary

304
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Really?

305
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
As long as you promise me

306
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the rest of the college entrance examination

307
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll be the top three in the whole school

308
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
just like the second grade

309
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay

310
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Eat some fruits

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm only betraying my body

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm not betraying my brain

313
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can kill yourself

314
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No way

315
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What are you talking about?

316
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I want you to do better

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm not insulting you

318
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Do you know that

319
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
you can get into college with this kind of grades?

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Are you going to

321
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
go to the ghost club again?

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Say it again

323
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I've said it

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why should I say it again?

325
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I can't hear you

326
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'll hit you

327
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
to make it normal

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Open the door, Xiao Xiaoqi

329
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't want it

330
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm not going to

331
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
She's my sister's best friend

332
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Come on

333
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Eat like a family

334
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I love you

335
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Xiao Xiaoqi

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What did you say?

337
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm listening

338
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We'll eat

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Three hours of cooking

340
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm not going to

341
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're good

342
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not going to

343
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Xiao Xiaoqi

344
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Damn it

345
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What are you doing?

346
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm asking you what you're doing

347
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm a professional camp

348
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You're taking pictures of me

349
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm not taking pictures

350
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I didn't take any pictures

351
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm not going to be fooled by you

352
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Do people dare to

353
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
go to the gym?

354
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Is it that serious?

355
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're a loser

356
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm asking you to

357
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
take care of me

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You're making me

359
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
so angry

360
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're taking pictures of me

361
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Take a picture of me

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't want to

363
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't want to

364
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let me see

365
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't want to

366
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What's wrong?

367
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Did you guys fight?

368
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Nothing

369
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I found a

370
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
hidden camera

371
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's here

372
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't talk nonsense

373
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I didn't talk nonsense

374
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I saw the photos of

375
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Xiao Gang in person

376
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Didn't you?

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Which one?

378
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I saw the photos of

379
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
A, B and P

380
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You took pictures of me?

381
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let me see

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're talking nonsense again

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You're messing with me

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I took pictures of you

385
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Did you?

386
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm helping you

387
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
record the growth of your members

388
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What growth?

389
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
All my members

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You see, he's growing

391
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Xiao Gang

392
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Nothing has changed

393
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let me see

394
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You have a secret training

395
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Boss, what are you going to do?

396
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm going to quit the membership

397
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Don't be like this

398
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What else do you have

399
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
that I haven't seen

400
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I've even seen

401
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
your leg

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's okay

403
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Are you okay?

404
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why are you sweating so much?

405
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Xiao Gang

406
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
There are some

407
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
new protein in the company

408
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Do you want to try?

409
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Sure

410
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You recommended me

411
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
a good place to stay last time

412
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes

413
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Help me finish it

414
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'll help you

415
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Okay

416
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Gu

417
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's time to get off work

418
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll get off work after I finish the repair

419
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's okay

420
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's the peak season

421
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You need more time to rest

422
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
before you can practice

423
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The point is

424
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
you have to prepare yourself

425
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Did you have dinner?

426
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I had it today

427
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You look like you know

428
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
you didn't eat

429
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Listen to me, okay?

430
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Finish it all

431
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Thank you, Brother Zi Gang

432
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yu Xi Gu

433
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Wait for me, Yu Xi Gu

434
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Can you teach me math?

435
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't have time

436
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why don't you have time?

437
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You always stay at school

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
after school

439
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't stay at school every day

440
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I've observed

441
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You stay at school

442
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
for two days a week

443
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I have my own degree

444
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't want to be disturbed

445
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But

446
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Damn

447
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What's wrong with you?

448
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Sasha

449
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What the heck?

450
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why didn't you tell me?

451
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Hey, you don't believe me?

452
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Hey, listen again!

453
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Sun!

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I saw it with my own eyes!

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So is Yu Xi Gu going to rob Li Si Yu or Li Si Yu?

456
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Of course it's Yu Xi Gu!

457
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Your classmate. Is that okay?

458
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Hey, you have a picture?

459
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't believe it!

460
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Really?

461
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Hey, your girlfriend is hugging someone!

462
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you want to see?

463
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Ah Hao, your girlfriend is hugging someone!

464
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Who?

465
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yu Xi Gu!

466
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Who?

467
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The top student of the 10,000-year-old school!

468
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's okay.

469
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You really don't care?

470
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
They hugged each other like this!

471
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm telling you, it's not like that!

472
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
They hugged each other like this first!

473
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Hugging like this?

474
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Xi Gu!

475
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Ah, Si Yu!

476
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hey, so romantic!

477
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Hey, Xi Gu!

478
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Hey, you really don't care?

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Hey, are you crazy?

480
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
How could he do that?

481
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There must be a reason for it!

482
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Hey, I'm your brother!

483
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You don't believe me?

484
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He won't like her!

485
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Mu Mian!

486
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey, Ah Hao!

487
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Ah Hao!

488
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You don't care?

489
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Forget it!

490
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He's just thinking about switching!

491
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You can't say that!

492
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Brothers, you have to think of something!

493
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
She's his girlfriend, you care so much!

494
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You're always like this!

495
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Okay, I'll stop talking, okay?

496
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's you again!

497
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I think I'm being robbed again!

498
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What's wrong with me?

499
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Xiao Li!

500
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Come here!

501
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Stand still!

502
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Why did you wake my classmate up?

503
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm going to sleep too.

504
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Where are you feeling unwell?

505
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm not feeling well.

506
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm not feeling well.

507
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm not feeling well.

508
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm not feeling well.

509
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm not feeling well.

510
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If you're not feeling well, go back to your class!

511
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You're not sleeping!

512
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Gao Xiao Mian!

513
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Come out!

514
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm not sleeping!

515
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
