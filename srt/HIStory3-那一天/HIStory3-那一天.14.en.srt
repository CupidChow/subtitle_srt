00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢无再更叶

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
而我盲目的追 低头妥协 想保护着谁

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿 拥有你的明天

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
我只想在我一边 每天都能叫面对

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
生命总会有机会 而你准备要浪费

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
在我一边 在我一边

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Are you nervous?

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't worry.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If my parents agree to let us be together, it will be great.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But if my dad says anything bad,

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
don't take it to heart.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Just remember to get a good score in your college.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't want to go to college?

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If my parents don't agree to let us be together,

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
what college should I go to?

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll go out to make money after graduation.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't allow it.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I said we would have a good future.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's good.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Who cares which college you graduate from?

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But...

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's okay.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can make money first and then go to college.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Otherwise, you finish your studies first and then I'll study.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you don't study, I won't study either.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's make money together.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We will do everything together.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Listen to me.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Trust me.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We can prove to everyone that we will have a good life.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Sorry to interrupt you.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Can you hurry up?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We have been waiting for a long time.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why are you in a hurry?

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You don't know how to choose time.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're welcome.

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Come on.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Here.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Here's some tea.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Mom's помощью large olis?

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's my mom's signature.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Delicious.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Here,으리애.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll sit next to you. You guys talk.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then I won't talk any more.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yu, the thing you told us last time,

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've already discussed it with Hao Ting's dad.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We know our son very well.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We know what he's capable of.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So, as long as he works harder,

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
he'll definitely get into college this year.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, we don't agree with your suggestion.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What? No, Mommy, no.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because the scope of the exam is very small,

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can just get into the second place in the whole school.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This time it's different.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This time it's just a test.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
1 to 6.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The horse is down.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The horse is down.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The second prize is the Queen of gold.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Find the gold city.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Call the fortune teller.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The captain of the gold.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The sound of the alarm.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The highest can be up to 50,000 times 100,000 times.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The next lucky one is you.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Macau New Peking Entertainment City 931 931.com

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The scope is too big.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
How can I do it myself?

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, you have to ask Yu Xi for help.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can't get into college when you're in college.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're so reckless.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You don't take your future as a matter of fact.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Then you guys can help me take my future as a matter of fact.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Just accept his proposal.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not that hard.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't accept it.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I just don't want to make you do whatever you want.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You've been very rude lately.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's your attitude?

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't fight.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's talk.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Sit down.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I was just an opening.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I haven't talked about the point.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The point?

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What point?

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is an important point.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're very important.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So we'll ask Dad to come in and talk.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're a kid.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You have to learn from your teacher.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you like to argue with me?

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let me tell you, I'm your dad.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm in charge of this place.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can't be a kid anymore.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm going to call my dad.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm going to call my dad.

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm going to call my dad.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm your dad! I'm in charge of this place!

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Dad, have you finished talking about the key points?

112
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,800
What are you going to say? Hurry up and say it!

113
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,600
What's the key point? You still don't know?

114
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,000
Let me tell you.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,600
Getting into college is just a basic thing. It's too easy.

116
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
You said that you guys will have a good future.

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,000
Then the key point is...

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,200
Let me think about it first.

119
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:11,400
Maybe ourrey It's my mistake.

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
Jacques!

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Stri slack! Is it okay to practice a falsification exam?

122
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Who cares about the difference?

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,400
A year is a year after Bachelor. different things starts to happen.

124
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,000
The old computers,

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Uncle, Auntie, as long as you promise to date me,

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I will do my best to meet your requirements.

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
See? How polite he is.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Do you understand?

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Actually, our requirements are very simple.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
As long as you can make this kid

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
get into college this year,

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
it's not a big deal.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Science is not too popular,

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
but it's definitely not too popular.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The most important thing is

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
to get into the national university.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The top five in the national university.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
As long as you can get into it,

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I will promise to let you date me.

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No problem!

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What promise?

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's not a request.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Didn't you say I was going to get into it?

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Fine!

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Come on.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't care!

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I will do my best to reach my goal.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The top five?

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We'll talk about it after we get into it.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The top five.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The top five.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I will do my best.

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Drink some water.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Is it enough?

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I took him home yesterday to see my parents.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Really?

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So, you decided to make it public?

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But did your parents really agree?

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I guess so.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Really?

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's so hot.

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The condition is to get into the national university.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No way.

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The top five.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The top five.

169
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The top five.

170
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm sorry to tell you two here.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Please cherish every day.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We all support you.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We all support you.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Bless you.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Bless you.

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Bless you.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Bless you.

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're so smart.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You don't believe me.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's really hard to get into the top five.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So, this is how I can show my determination.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Right?

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes.

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Good luck.

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hao, it's not a joke.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you don't make it, what will you do?

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We will make it.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm serious.

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And he's here.

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Right?

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But what if you really don't make it?

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I...

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I won't let this happen.

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay?

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You have to believe me.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But there are only five months left.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No buts.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Five months is a long time.

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Look, I prepared for a week or two

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and I'll be more nervous than I am when I'm serious.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Maybe I'll get a good grade in the exam.

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What are you doing?

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What are you two doing?

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Aren't we feeding the dogs?

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wait a minute.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Good.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Very good.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Very good.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He's a dog.

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Little dog.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Your dog.

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's your turn.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He's shaking his hand.

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Meow meow.

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's a bad girl.

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What are you doing?

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We're feeding the dogs.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He's been doing this for a long time.

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What?

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, the dogs are all talented.

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're the dog.

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The dog king.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're the dog king.

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm the dog king.

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I want to hear the dog king.

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Me?

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Wait.

233
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I want to hear the love version.

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You've been doing this for so long.

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You've been doing this for so long.

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The love version.

237
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
For my owner.

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He's a genius.

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He's a genius.

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're still eating the red packet.

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So cute.

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
She bent the resistance.

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's little one Pearl.

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But she isn't cool.

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This!

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This!

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This!

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think both are cool.

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Put it straight ahead.

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Put it straight ahead?

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes.

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're putting your Passive Switch here.

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
barbecue...

254
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let's just go this way.

255
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hey, Gao Xun, what's wrong? Are you unhappy?

256
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I failed in the exam and I got scolded.

257
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,300
How bad did you get in the exam?

258
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't ask. You'll be afraid.

259
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
What did you get?

260
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Don't ask. You'll be afraid.

261
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm afraid. The person I'm most afraid of right now should be Xiang Hao Ting.

262
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,500
That's right. Where's she?

263
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,000
She got bad in the exam.

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,900
She's comforting her little lover.

265
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Don't come over.

266
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Why not?

267
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,900
I'll save you.

268
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Get off me.

269
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Get off me.

270
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,900
This time, the score is really not accurate.

271
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
I didn't take the exam seriously.

272
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
We were separated at that time.

273
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
Don't care about the score of this time.

274
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
But your score is too low.

275
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
I know.

276
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
Because I wrote everything wrong.

277
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
I saw the question.

278
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
I didn't finish the question.

279
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
I just wrote the answer.

280
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
AACCB, BBCAA.

281
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
I kept writing it wrong.

282
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
You have to believe me.

283
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
I can definitely get into the National University.

284
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Really.

285
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Look.

286
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
This is my reading plan.

287
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Are you careful enough?

288
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
I even wrote the time of the bath.

289
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,900
I can definitely kill the one who wrote the answer.

290
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,900
Okay.

291
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Then this week,

292
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,900
Brother Zhi Gang invited me to celebrate the full-fledged dinner.

293
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
Don't come.

294
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
According to this plan, don't read well.

295
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
Mom.

296
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,900
I think we should have dinner.

297
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,900
Time is the best.

298
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,900
How can we not eat for studying?

299
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Eating is to walk a longer road.

300
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Then you eat at home.

301
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Brother Zhi Gang invited me to the restaurant.

302
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
You don't know how long it will take to come back to the car.

303
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
You want to waste time.

304
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
I want to celebrate with you.

305
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,900
I'll go to you after dinner.

306
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
I'm serious.

307
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
I'll try my best.

308
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Then this weekend,

309
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,900
you have to give me a reward.

310
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
I'm serious.

311
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,900
I should wake up at 3 a.m.

312
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
What's wrong?

314
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Why did you drag me here?

315
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
You don't have to accompany someone to the bath.

316
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
I have something to ask you.

317
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Is it serious?

318
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Why did she come to my house?

319
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,900
Then?

320
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Did you and your brother Zhi Gang have a relationship?

321
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
I mean that...

322
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,900
What are you talking about?

323
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
I'm serious about this question.

324
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
What kind of question is this?

325
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
It's not a question.

326
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
I've never had a relationship with him.

327
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
I just know that.

328
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
We are now in the college entrance exam.

329
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,900
So?

330
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Can't we be in the college entrance exam?

331
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
I don't believe you guys.

332
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
Right?

333
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
It's your fault.

334
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,900
You should check it on the Internet.

335
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
I've checked it.

336
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
The Internet says that the first time it will hurt.

337
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
I'm not going to do it.

338
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
The Internet says that the first time it will hurt.

339
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,900
But I don't want it to feel like I'm bad.

340
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Why did I ask you?

341
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
I don't know.

342
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
It's just the atmosphere.

343
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
It's not going to hurt if the atmosphere is right.

344
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
It's impossible. It's your first time.

345
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
I'm this one.

346
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
You idiot.

347
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Brother Si Chang is really kind to you.

348
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
What's wrong with him?

349
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
No.

350
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
My problem is still not solved.

351
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
The weekend is coming.

352
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
It's almost here.

353
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Let me ask your Brother Si Chang.

354
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Do you want to die now?

355
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Or you tell me.

356
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
What happened to you when you first met?

357
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,900
And what was the state like?

358
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
Why did the angel come to earth and the human being happened?

359
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
I want to tell you something special.

360
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
I want to tell you a trick.

361
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,900
You have to pay attention to the place.

362
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
You can relax a little bit.

363
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
Don't turn around.

364
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
I'm begging you.

365
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,900
No one can ask this question.

366
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Really?

367
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
I don't know.

368
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Go away.

369
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Go away.

370
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Go away.

371
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
It's so painful.

372
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
Friends.

373
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
We are friends.

374
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Go away.

375
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Go away.

376
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,900
That day.

377
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,900
That day.

378
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
Who can do this?

379
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
Go away.

380
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
You are done?

381
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Yes.

382
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Will Xia Xiao Ting pick you up?

383
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,900
I have to use my time to read at home.

384
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
I have something on my pants.

385
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,900
No, I'm thinking about something.

386
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
Xiao Gu, are you leaving?

387
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
You have already passed the exam.

388
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Why don't you take more classes?

389
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,900
I want to accompany Hao Ting to her study.

390
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Don't forget to save your tuition.

391
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
The college fee is different from high school.

392
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,900
I know.

393
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
I'm calculating.

394
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
I'm going to the library.

395
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
I'll calculate later.

396
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Go home.

397
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
You've been working all day.

398
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
I'm leaving.

399
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
See you.

400
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
Bye.

401
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Bye.

402
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900

403
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
Bye.

404
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
Bye.

405
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Hao Ting is so cute.

406
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,900
I have something to ask you.

407
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
What is it?

408
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,900
You know it's my first time.

409
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,900
So I want to know if it hurts in the bathroom that day.

410
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,900
Does it hurt?

411
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,900
Does it hurt?

412
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
It's comfortable.

413
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
