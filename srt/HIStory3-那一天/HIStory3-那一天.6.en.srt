Why aren't you eating?

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll eat for you.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Uncle Sun, what's wrong?

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why are you so upset?

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Just tell me if you have any problems.

I'll help you solve it.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The midterm is coming.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What if you're not happy with your results?

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm really impressed with you.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We're caring about each other.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can also go to the exam.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Give us a quiet midterm, okay?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm serious.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're serious too.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What?

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What should we do?

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What should we do?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Just hit him.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What should I do?

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I want him to believe me more.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I want him to be more forceful.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know what to do.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, don't say that here, okay?

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm not here to say it.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where should I say it? Tell me.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How can you not know?

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're the one who likes that uncle.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You don't love him.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What do you want me to say?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You idiot.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What are you doing?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Brother.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I...

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm done.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Did you hear that?

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's so annoying.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You always do the same thing.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How many times have you said that?

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I know I was wrong.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I can't help it.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What can't I do?

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He's afraid of me.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What?

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't know if I should use the word, afraid, right?

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But...

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Every time he sees me, he's very timid.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's very cautious.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's like I'm going to eat him.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Am I that scary?

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Nonsense.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You...

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How did you get along with that uncle?

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Big brother.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Big brother?

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How did you get along with him?

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Actually, it's the same.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's the same?

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let me tell you.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
When you're in love, the most important thing is the heart.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You don't care about everything.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You don't care about the heart.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Otherwise, you won't touch it.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why does it like you when the whole world doesn't like it?

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're too naive.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why didn't I think about it?

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The Golden Queen, looking for the treasure of the Golden City.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Summon the fortune-teller, reward the captain, and the violence is heard.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Up to 50,000 times, 100,000 times.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The next lucky one is you.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Macau's new Peking Entertainment City, 931 931.com

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I...

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I...

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was right.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We have to make them believe.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Even if there's no hope at all.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't let them know that we really have love.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's do it together.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:02,700
The

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I didn't even touch the lunch box.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Gao Xiao Qin, hurry up.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why are you so fast?

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm helping.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What do you mean by helping?

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hurry up.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm going to sleep.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm going to sleep now.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't push me.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't want to.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Who said that?

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to sleep.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What's the matter, Sun?

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What's the matter, Sun?

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's the matter, Sun, buddy?

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What's the matter, Sun, buddy?

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's the matter, Sun, buddy?

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Is it true or not?

123
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
What is it?

124
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,600
Just ask him what kind of boyfriend he has.

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
So,

126
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,600
Sun really likes guys?

127
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,900
Come.

128
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,100
What do you think?

129
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,300
If he likes guys, he can't be a brother.

130
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,100
What do you think?

131
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,100
You don't know what I mean.

132
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,100
You just want to care about him.

133
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,600
If you really care about him, just ask him.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Okay, then even if he is really a boyfriend,

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
does it have any impact?

136
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
What's with the face?

137
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,300
No way.

138
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
You think too much.

139
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,600
Even if he is,

140
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,400
he will never like you two.

141
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,900
At least he is above my level.

142
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,900
We were serious just now.

143
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
What are you talking about?

144
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,100
What?

145
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
We were just talking.

146
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,100
Hao.

147
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,600
Yes.

148
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,700
Come, two.

149
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,900
Not bad.

150
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,900
Come, chest up.

151
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Come, three.

152
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Focus.

153
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Come, four.

154
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,900
Come, let's go.

155
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,900
Come.

156
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Come, let me see here.

157
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Is it okay?

158
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
You first.

159
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Xiao Ke.

160
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
How are you?

161
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Fine.

162
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm fine.

163
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
Did you eat anything?

164
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,900
No.

165
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Are you okay?

166
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
I'm fine.

167
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
I mean, what's wrong with you today?

168
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
You were absent-minded all day.

169
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
What's wrong?

170
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
It's the last thing I have to do in the company.

171
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
You.

172
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
You will be like this next time.

173
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
I know.

174
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
You are hurt.

175
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Hao.

176
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,900
Go.

177
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,900
Hello.

178
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
What happened?

179
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
You didn't see the picture?

180
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,900
How did you hurt him?

181
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
It's none of my business.

182
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
You are useless.

183
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
I have helped him to be a soldier.

184
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Okay?

185
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Is he okay?

186
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
He's fine.

187
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
You are helping me with the shift this weekend.

188
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
Don't forget.

189
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Don't let the birds go.

190
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Okay.

191
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Okay.

192
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Go.

193
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
We will put the money for the customers here.

194
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
This will be the point of view every day.

195
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
The record of the next order

196
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
is also something you must be familiar with.

197
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Because we have to write

198
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
the order on the record.

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
And the simple documents will be here.

200
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Hello.

201
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Zi Lan.

202
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I heard you are hurt.

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Are you okay?

204
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm fine.

205
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Do you want to drink some water?

206
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Are you free?

207
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I want to talk to you.

208
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
So you came down today to tell me

209
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
what you did to me last time.

210
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
It's okay.

211
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I didn't put it in my heart.

212
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
You don't have to care.

213
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
I like you.

214
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm not new.

215
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Since I went to my brother's gym,

216
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
the first time I saw you,

217
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I've always liked you.

218
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
I've liked you for 473 days.

219
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
And after getting familiar with you,

220
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
I'm more sure that I like you.

221
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I saw you get in a man's car that day.

222
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
You were so intimate.

223
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
If you can accept men,

224
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
then give me a chance.

225
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I really want to be with you.

226
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I believe you like me.

227
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
But what about the future?

228
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
I will.

229
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Do you like me?

230
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Who doesn't like you?

231
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
You are so cute and handsome.

232
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
And you have a good personality.

233
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Of course I like you.

234
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
You mean the kind of love that comes with being together?

235
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm serious.

236
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
I want to be with you forever.

237
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Forever?

238
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
You are too young.

239
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Do you know what it means to be forever in high school?

240
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
I know.

241
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Can you promise that you will like men forever?

242
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Yes.

243
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Maybe you will like your classmate or your classmate next door.

244
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
You will like your classmate.

245
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
You will like your classmate.

246
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
You will like your classmate.

247
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
You will like your classmate.

248
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I will never like my classmate.

249
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
I will be your contact.

250
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Don't use age to pressure me.

251
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
What does it matter if you like someone or not?

252
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Of course it does.

253
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
But you still can't understand it.

254
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Because time and reality exist.

255
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
In the future, you will meet some people

256
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
and encounter some things.

257
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Their selfishness will let you slowly understand

258
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
that there is no forever in this world.

259
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
So...

260
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Please don't say forever.

261
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Okay?

262
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
But I'm not them.

263
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
You can say that I'm young.

264
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
You can say that I don't understand.

265
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
But you can't say that I can't love someone forever.

266
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
No matter if you are a boy or a girl,

267
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
my body tells me

268
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
that I want you.

269
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
I have no choice.

270
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
I have no choice.

271
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
I have no choice.

272
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
I have no choice.

273
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
I have no choice.

274
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
I have no choice.

275
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
I have no choice.

276
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
I have no choice.

277
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
I have no choice.

278
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
I have no choice.

279
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
I have no choice.

280
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
I have no choice.

281
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
I have no choice.

282
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
I have no choice.

283
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
I have no choice.

284
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,500
You should leave your child.

285
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,320
Okay?

286
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,240
It doesn't matter how ugly your eyebrows are.

287
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,760
What else do you want?

288
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,460
Can you change to another option?

289
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
What else are you going to do?

290
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,940
Feel bored?

291
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,600
So

292
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,480
How could you not be hungry?

293
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,200
How did you know?

294
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,520
Of course I know.

295
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,600
And I know that

296
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,800
the police will come to close the door at 9pm.

297
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,880
So you better hurry up and eat.

298
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,160
You're following me and investigating me?

299
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,280
Of course.

300
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,120
My senior in love told me

301
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,760
that if you like someone, you have to observe him,

302
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,960
understand him,

303
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,920
and control him.

304
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,840
I'm so cool.

305
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,360
And I'm not asking you

306
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
if you like me.

307
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,720
Are you okay?

308
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,640
I'm fine.

309
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,640
I'm going to the bathroom.

310
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,160
Let me ask you.

311
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,680
We're both men.

312
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,000
If we really date,

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
will it be stressful?

314
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,920
But it feels good to be the enemy of the whole world.

315
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,640
I like it.

316
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,360
You think too much.

317
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,360
It won't happen.

318
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,840
Okay, stop looking.

319
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,840
Eat your noodles.

320
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,280
You're not eating?

321
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,280
It's a waste if you don't eat.

322
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Are you going to hell?

323
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Then be honest to me.

324
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,960
That is a gift as my apology gift.

325
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,680
Add it up.

326
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,520
Eat plain noodles.

327
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,160
I'll leave every requirement you make to me.

328
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
You have my word.

329
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
I can't let you miss me.

330
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Then...

331
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
I can't let you chase me.

332
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Are you going too far?

333
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
I've done so much.

334
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
I feel bad.

335
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
I feel like crying.

336
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I've had enough of you.

337
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Where are you going?

338
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Hurry up and eat.

339
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I don't want to.

340
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
You don't want to?

341
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Then I won't be polite to you.

342
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
If you dare to hit me,

343
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
I'll tell the instructor tomorrow.

344
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Fine.

345
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,160
Then you say you don't need to be polite.

346
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Are you and my team

347
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
just trying to make me kiss you?

348
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
The lunch box is mine.

349
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Choose one.

350
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Three, two, one.

351
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I want lunch box.

352
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
I want lunch box.

353
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
I'm home.

354
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
What?

355
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,160
You normally spend 26 minutes.

356
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
Today you only spend 21 minutes.

357
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
You don't want to be with me.

358
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
You can go now.

359
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
I'm going to the gym.

360
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
I'll be right back.

361
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Bye.

362
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Bye.

363
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Bye.

364
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Bye.

365
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Bye.

366
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Bye.

367
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Bye.

368
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Can I come to see you tomorrow?

369
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
No, I have to study tomorrow.

370
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,160
I have time in the day, afternoon, or evening.

371
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,160
I have to study in the day, afternoon, or evening.

372
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Then let's study together.

373
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Please.

374
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
I want to be with you.

375
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Really?

376
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Okay.

377
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Come in the day.

378
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
We'll leave after lunch.

379
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
That's all.

380
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160

Let him go.

415
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
What over the limit?

416
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,760
You...

417
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Go away!

It's you who's the problem!

I knew you were teasing me!

00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,560
You were waiting for this opportunity, right?

00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,960
You ruined all my efforts!

Don't tease me anymore, okay?

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360

I need to make money.

436
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,560
If I don't get the scholarship,

437
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,760
I can't pay my tuition.

438
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,360
