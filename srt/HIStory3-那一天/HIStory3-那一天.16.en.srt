00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再更叠

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
而我盲目的追不低头妥协

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
想保护着谁

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿拥有你的明天

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我只想在我一边

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
每天都能将面对

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
生命总会有机会

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
而你准备要浪费

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
在我一边

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:30,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The exam is coming. Are you nervous?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Not really.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm just a little short of it.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What are you short of?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're really kissing me?

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No, no, no.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Kiss five times.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You little jerk.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're too greedy.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you for being by my side.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You make my life better.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No matter what happens,

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
as long as you're by my side,

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and love me,

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and like me,

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
it's okay.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mei Mei.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to the travel agency.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Mommy is so cute today.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She's not cute at all.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's why she likes you.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mommy.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're awake.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're awake?

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Mommy's going out.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I want to take a shower.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Remember to take your medicine.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
By the way,

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
thank your classmate, Yu Shi Gu.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes, Yu Shi Gu.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why?

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why?

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You forgot?

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I forgot.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He came to take care of you for me this afternoon.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yesterday?

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He came yesterday?

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He said he'd come and bring you a note.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yesterday?

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're not dreaming?

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're so stupid.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're so stupid.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Mei Mei.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Help me take care of my brother.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Call me if you need anything.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm running out of time.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going out.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Bye.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Bye.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What's wrong?

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Nevertheless,

79
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,960
I can smile at you

80
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
whenever I want.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're losing your mind.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yun Kai Le.

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
You...

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you're losing your mind.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You...

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you're losing your mind.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Which is different

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
from fidgeting?

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:21,880
澳门新蒲京娱乐城931-931.com

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:51,880
澳门新蒲京娱乐城931-931.com

91
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,680
Okay, please.

92
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,320
Yu Shi Gu.

93
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,520
Are you angry?

94
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,640
I had a high fever yesterday and I can't remember.

95
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,680
My memory is blurry.

96
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,760
How...

97
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,120
Are you going to bother me like this?

98
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,840
Sorry.

99
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,760
Did I...

100
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,920
Did I treat you...

101
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,240
I...

102
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,360
Did I truly treat you...

103
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,100
Yes.

104
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
Look at him.

105
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,780
What was it?

106
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,840
We actually...

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,160
What do we really mean?

108
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,200
Just...

109
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,240
Just...

110
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,280
Simple satire

111
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,080
We don't have that

112
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,680
Only toys

113
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm still like this

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
after you gave birth to me.

116
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
It's okay.

117
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
I know you didn't mean it.

118
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,360
And I know you'll get into the exam.

119
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,360
I'll do it for you.

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
I'll do it for you.

124
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
I'll do it for you.

125
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
What?

127
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Are you nervous?

128
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
A little.

129
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Me too.

130
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
How is it?

131
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
We're getting more scores online.

132
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Although the scores are very high,

133
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
if we get into the top five international universities,

134
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
it will be pretty hard.

135
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Dad,

136
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
that cup is mine.

137
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
You're my wife.

138
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
What's wrong with having a drink?

139
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
But it's coffee.

140
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
I'm afraid you'll lose your sleep at night.

141
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
I lost my sleep last night.

142
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Zhe Han, I'm going to college!

143
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
I can go to Zhe Han University!

144
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Yeah!

145
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
I'm going to find my late wife.

146
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Xiao Ting!

147
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
I've promised my brother

148
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
that I'll be lucky to be the one who does it.

149
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
You can't be wrong.

150
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Dad,

151
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
don't think too much.

152
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Anyway, getting into a good school

153
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
means a very good thing.

154
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
As for the thing with that boy,

155
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
don't worry about it.

156
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Finally, I can have a cup of coffee with my dog.

157
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
If you're worried,

158
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
just call him.

159
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
No.

160
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
He's under a lot of pressure.

161
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
If I call him again,

162
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
he'll be more confident.

163
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
What if he doesn't pass?

164
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
I don't know.

165
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I'll think of a way to comfort him.

166
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
I'll be fine.

167
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
How do you comfort him?

168
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
I mean,

169
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
if his parents don't allow it,

170
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
what will you do?

171
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
He?

172
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,360
You'll be together forever.

173
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Good morning.

174
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
What's wrong?

175
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Central University?

176
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
I got it!

177
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Really?

178
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Of course!

179
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
That's great!

180
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
I got the paper.

181
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Hi.

182
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
I'm still here.

183
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Sorry.

184
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Right.

185
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,360
I have to hold you guys back.

186
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Thank you, Brother Jia.

187
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm still here.

188
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Okay.

189
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Brother Jia Hui.

190
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
You're so good at it.

191
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Yes.

192
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
And I told you,

193
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,360
I've arranged the rest of the classes for you.

194
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Wow, you're so professional.

195
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Don't say that.

196
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
You're the one who's good at it.

197
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
And,

198
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
you're so good at it.

199
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
I'm so proud of you.

200
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
And,

201
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
among all the students,

202
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I think Brother Jia Hui is the most serious.

203
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
You're the best.

204
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
You're the best.

205
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
You're making me feel better.

206
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Don't say that.

207
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,360
I can see that you're getting into it.

208
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
What are you looking at?

209
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,360
You're so crooked.

210
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,360
You're the one who made me think that.

211
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
We couldn't make it in one group.

212
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
You've seen it with your own eyes.

213
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
You're too much.

214
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm just worried about how he did in the exam.

215
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
How did he do in the exam?

216
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Is that all?

217
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
That's all.

218
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Let me see your evil eyes.

219
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
Full of lies.

220
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Sun Wen.

221
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Are you using me to think about this song?

222
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm telling you, you're mistaken.

223
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
We're just worried about how you did in the exam.

224
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Why am I so mad at you?

225
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
What did he say to you?

227
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
I said nothing.

228
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
And you're asking me?

229
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
So fierce.

230
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,360
The middle of the school.

231
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
What about you?

232
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,360
The main character should be Cheng Da.

233
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Cheng Da?

234
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
That's great.

235
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
What's great about him?

236
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
I don't want to.

237
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
It's so far away.

238
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
We just got together.

239
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
I don't want to be far away from you.

240
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,360
I've decided to go to the hospital with you.

241
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
I don't want to.

242
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
I don't want to.

243
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
We can't discuss it.

244
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Hey.

245
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Be serious.

246
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
It's up to you.

247
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Or are you interested in something?

248
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I'm only interested in you.

249
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Really?

250
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
I can read any drama.

251
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
I think the most important thing now is

252
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,360
to find a house first.

253
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
We're looking for a house?

254
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Yes.

255
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
We're dating.

256
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Of course we should live together.

257
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
But you're in the middle.

258
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
I'm in the middle.

259
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
It doesn't matter.

260
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
It's up to you.

261
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
You want to be with me every day.

262
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Yes.

263
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
But...

264
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Why so many buts?

265
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
I've been working hard for a long time

266
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
to achieve my goal of being with you.

267
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Of course I want to see you every day.

268
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Right?

269
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Okay.

270
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Let's start looking for a house.

271
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Xiao Wu,

272
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Have you remembered what you said last time?

273
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Yes.

274
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
I told you.

275
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Stay with us.

276
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Why so?

277
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
You lied to me.

278
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
I didn't.

279
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Just trust me.

280
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
I can understand.

281
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Okay.

282
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Let's go to the place.

283
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Okay.

284
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
You know me well in Mr. Lotus.

285
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm sorry.

286
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Give me your hand.

287
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
I'll find a place.

288
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
A lift building?

289
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Or a condo?

290
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Hello, sir.

291
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Thank you.

292
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Hello, sir.

293
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Can I come in?

294
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Hello, sir.

295
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Let me have a look.

296
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Thank you.

297
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Here's your ID.

298
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Thank you.

299
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
He promised to hang out with you.

300
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Please come again.

301
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Thank you.

302
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Night shift.

303
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
No wonder you're so hardworking.

304
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Yeah.

305
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Why are you still writing a book?

306
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Stop laughing.

307
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
Say it.

308
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
The first one is very important.

309
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
It must be better than the best.

310
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Damn it.

311
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
My first time...

312
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
I won't allow it.

313
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
What?

314
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
I want it too.

315
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
What do you want?

316
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Hello?

317
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Sister Chuan.

318
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
I want Jiaxin.

319
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Because of love.

320
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
I don't care.

321
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
That's it.

322
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Bye.

323
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Wow.

324
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
You want Jiaxin to save money?

325
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Of course.

326
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
You wrote it, sir.

327
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
I can't this time.

328
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Because I want to save money.

329
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I want to publish a heavy book.

330
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
You're a playboy.

331
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
Just once.

332
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Hello, sir.

333
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Thank you.

334
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Please have a look.

335
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Thank you.

336
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Don't put it on the bed.

337
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
It's okay.

338
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
I think there's a paper towel.

339
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
It's so hot.

340
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
What's the temperature today?

341
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
The fan.

342
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
The fan at home.

343
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Yeah.

344
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
I forgot to buy it.

345
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
It's sticky.

346
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Go away.

347
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
I'm going to work.

348
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
I'm going to clean up.

349
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Hurry up.

350
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
I'm so hot.

351
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
So hot.

352
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
So hot.

353
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,360
You're exaggerating.

354
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
So hot.

355
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Wipe it yourself.

356
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
You're pushing me to put it on the wall.

357
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
No.

358
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
What?

359
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
It's hot.

360
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
It's itchy.

361
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
What are you doing?

362
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
I'm going to work.

363
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
I'm going to clean up.

364
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
I'm going to clean up.

365
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
I'm going to clean up.

366
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
I'm going to clean up.

367
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
I'm going to clean up.

368
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I'm going to clean up.

369
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm going to clean up.

370
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
I'm going to clean up.

371
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
I'm going to clean up.

372
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,360
I'm going to clean up.

373
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
I'm going to clean up.

374
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
I'm going to clean up.

375
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
I'm going to clean up.

376
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm going to clean up.

377
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
I'm going to clean up.

378
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
I'm going to clean up.

379
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
I'm going to clean up.

380
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I'm going to clean up.

381
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
I'm going to clean up.

382
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
I'm going to clean up.

383
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm going to clean up.

384
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm going to clean up.
