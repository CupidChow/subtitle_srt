1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,160
Every tear in my life

2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,800
Someday I will be brave and never change

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
And I'm blinded by it

4
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,560
I bow my head and compromise

5
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,760
Who do I want to protect?

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,440
I want to make a wish

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,560
To have your tomorrow

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,200
I just want to be in my side

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,680
I can face it every day

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
Life will have an opportunity

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,320
And you are ready to waste it

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,160
One more time

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,040
One more time

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm a friend

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
I've always wanted to introduce you to people

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
But you suddenly came here

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,080
Without anything

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,680
Would you be rude?

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,120
I don't think so

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
Sorry to bother you

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
Sorry

22
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
This is

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,120
How about it?

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,200
Do you like my friend?

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,360
Isn't this the one we saw together?

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,320
Yes

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,160
This is our home from now on

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,040
Really?

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,480
I'll rent this place

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,440
You

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,600
What a great kitchen

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,320
We can cook together in the future

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,560
This is the map

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,240
Yes

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Dried persimmon

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,880
Wooden floor

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,920
I've always wanted to have a comfortable place to draw

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
And I can keep some small things

39
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,160
I like having a balcony house the most

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,760
It's bigger

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
We'll sleep in this room from now on

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
It's a beautiful blue

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,320
But it's expensive here

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,760
Yes, it's expensive

45
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,400
But we met a good landlord

46
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,520
I used many ways

47
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,400
But he took a long time

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,320
He's the one who gave me a discount

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,720
I'm still in the budget

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,640
You're so great

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,600
I have to buy a lot of things

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
I've already thought about it

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,400
I want to add a projector here

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,440
And hit it here

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
So we can play the electric guitar here all day

56
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,600
And I think the restaurant is a bit boring

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,280
So I want to transform it into

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,800
Xiao Bai's

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,240
Cave castle

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,440
No sound

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
And I have to add a sofa here

62
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
Look, the sunlight hits here

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,400
We can lie here all day

64
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,880
You want to put a sofa here

65
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,320
How can we go to the balcony

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,720
It's okay

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,320
The North European wind is not like this

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,720
The sun is shining all day long and drinking coffee

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
Idiot

70
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,840
We're going to live here together in the future

71
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,480
Yes

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
Thank you

73
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
If you're here

74
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
You can give me a good luck

75
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,320
Me too

76
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,080
The highest can be up to 50,000 times 100,000 times

77
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
The next lucky one is you

78
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,240
Macau New Peking Entertainment City

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
931 931.com

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
The next day

81
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,200
Xiao Ting

82
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
University life is different from high school

83
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,600
I think you should move to a school

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,160
This is too inefficient

85
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,960
The house is rented

86
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
Can you stop discussing this

87
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
You will graduate in four years

88
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
Yes

89
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,080
I have to find a job after graduation

90
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,840
She will continue to go up

91
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,200
I want to make a lot of money

92
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,600
Help her share more and support her

93
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
I have reached our agreement

94
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,480
Dad

95
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
You will obey, right

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,240
We government rely on you

97
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,480
We have this contract

98
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,120
We just pay you

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,640
We can't die

100
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Do you want me to see you get married

101
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,280
Yes

102
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
I should live quietly

103
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,280
Did 촉收快要见到我了

104
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm fine

105
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,520
Did i say that

106
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,800
Yes

107
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,800
I can casino with you

108
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,240
Aren't you afraid of getting married

109
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,040
Promparting

110

You want toom me

111
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,540
You don't believe me, right?

112
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,060
Thanks for your hard work

113
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,800
Then so are you

114
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,620
I'm leaving now.

115
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,620
Cheers.

116
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,980
It's success.

117
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,580
Let's 모두 drink first.

118
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,580
Cheers.

119
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,680
Come on.

120
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Where's Zhi Gang?

121
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
He's busy with the movie.

122
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
He'll be here soon.

123
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
You guys can sit down.

124
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Thanks.

125
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Thanks.

126
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
It's so expensive.

127
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
It's too high-end.

128
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,680
It's only 8,000.

129
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,680
It's impossible. It's at least 18,000.

130
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,680
Yeah.

131
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
He's amazing.

132
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
He's going to be 8,000.

133
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
He's so good.

134
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
He's so good.

135
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
He's so good.

136
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
He's so good.

137
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
He's so good.

138
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Let me help.

139
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Let me help.

140
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Okay.

141
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Let me help.

142
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
You should put your hand on it.

143
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
I'm still a man.

144
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
You guys can get to the bathroom over there.

145
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
You guys can get to the bathroom over there.

146
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Where's your room?

147
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Where's the room?

148
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Here.

149
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
Attack!

150
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Wait!

151
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Wait!

152
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
It's so beautiful.

153
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Why can't I see it?

154
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Okay, just one look.

155
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Hurry up!

156
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
Don't miss it!

157
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
One, two, three!

158
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
No!

159
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Don't miss it!

160
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Don't miss it!

161
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
It's so beautiful.

162
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Okay, okay!

163
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Don't look!

164
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Why?

165
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
You're so good-looking.

166
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Just one look.

167
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Yeah.

168
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
It's not convenient.

169
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
It's so easy.

170
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Okay, sit down.

171
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
It's so beautiful.

172
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
It's so easy to be seen.

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
What do you want?

174
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
It's professional.

175
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Yes.

176
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Let me do it.

177
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Be careful.

178
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Thank you.

179
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
It's not good.

180
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,680
It's so easy.

181
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
I tell you.

182
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
It's almost all made by him.

183
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
No way.

184
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
No way.

185
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
It's so beautiful.

186
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
It's so rich.

187
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Why are there red radish in every dish?

188
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
You like to eat red radish.

189
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Yeah.

190
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Where's the red radish?

191
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Here.

192
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
That's enough.

193
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
That's enough.

194
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,680
How about we order fried chicken?

195
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Okay.

196
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Okay.

197
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
What's your attitude?

198
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
You're eating red radish.

199
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,680
It's good for your health.

200
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Do you understand?

201
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
Look at this dish.

202
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
What's this?

203
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
This?

204
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Take it up.

205
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
What's that?

206
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
It's red radish.

207
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Art.

208
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Do you understand?

209
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
It's a masterpiece.

210
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
It's so beautiful.

211
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Yeah.

212
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Let's eat.

213
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Come on.

214
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Let's eat.

215
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Let's eat.

216
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Come on.

217
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
Sit down.

218
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Thank you.

219
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Thank you.

220
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Let's eat.

221
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Let's eat.

222
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Fried chicken is almost here.

223
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Okay.

224
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Okay.

225
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,680
We must order fried chicken.

226
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
Here you are.

227
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
You're sweating.

228
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Yeah.

229
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Do you want to eat with dog food?

230
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
What?

231
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Do you have any objection?

232
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
Yeah.

233
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
What's this?

234
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
White, go back to the corner line.

235
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Isn't the corner line black?

236
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
Yeah.

237
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
He thinks so.

238
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Let's eat.

239
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Come on.

240
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Let's eat.

241
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
This...

242
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
The moon is so beautiful today.

243
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Can you see it over there?

244
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
In the afternoon,

245
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
many friends came to our house.

246
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
We played the computer.

247
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
We were so happy.

248
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
I feel like this for the first time.

249
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
But I don't know why.

250
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
I don't know what it is.

251
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Can you tell me?

252
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Handsome guy.

253
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Are you alone?

254
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Here you are.

255
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Are you happy today?

256
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
I'm so happy.

257
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
We can come here more often.

258
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
Of course.

259
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,680
But I didn't expect Gao Xun to be like this.

260
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
He only lost two points.

261
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
He's so angry.

262
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,680
You still have a lot of time to get to know him.

263
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
He's definitely not the way you look.

264
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Definitely not.

265
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Do you know who is the real devil in our gang?

266
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Me?

267
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
It's not me.

268
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
Sun Bo.

269
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Sun Bo?

270
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,680
You didn't find out?

271
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Yeah.

272
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
I forgot he's very fierce.

273
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
He's the real emotional barrier.

274
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
Please.

275
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
How could it be me?

276
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
You are getting better.

277
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
I'll be back.

278
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
I'll be waiting for you.

279
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
Do you think your parents will like me?

280
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
They will.

281
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
I hope they can get to know you.

282
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,880
I must take you to a place where the stars are closest.

283
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,880
You guys look at me carefully.

284
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,760
You mean...

285
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,160
Mount Himalayas?

286
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,080
Mount Himalayas?

287
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,320
Er...

288
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,680
I meant Mount Yushan.

289
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,960
If you want to go to Mount Himalayas...

290
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,840
Okay, I promise you.

291
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
I'll take you there.

292
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay.

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,040
Okay.

294
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,200
I'm so jealous of them.

295
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,400
They can all live together.

296
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,580
Unlike me,

297
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,300
I'll move to Tainan in a few days.

298
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
sama

299
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,300
sama

300
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,300
How do you feel?

301
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,700
Come inside

302
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,500
You are right

303
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
I am…

304
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Sama

305
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
On the tap

306
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
On the top

307
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,180
Let'sогlaughing

308
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,640
Can't be it right

309
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,380
Another year is too short

310
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,600
4 year are all things

311
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,560
what?

312
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
Four years is 1460 days.

313
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,560
You're not counting.

314
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
What's wrong with you?

315
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,560
We didn't say we'd be together forever.

316
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,560
These four years are our future investments.

317
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Don't think about anything.

318
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Just focus on yourself.

319
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
I...

320
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
I'll work hard.

321
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
I believe we'll have a better future.

322
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
And we'll be happier.

323
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
What do you think?

324
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,560
We were already happy.

325
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Okay, I know.

326
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I'll work hard.

327
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
I'll make a lot of money.

328
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,560
So you'll only belong to me.

329
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
What are you doing?

330
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
You're playing the guitar?

331
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Oh, you're playing the guitar.

332
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
You don't love me at all.

333
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
Okay.

334
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
It's eleven o'clock.

335
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Can we make it?

336
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Eleven o'clock?

337
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
We can make it.

338
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,560
My mom and I have an appointment at eleven thirty.

339
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,560
But she's a little over twelve.

340
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Okay, look.

341
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
We've got all the dishes ready.

342
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,560
We can serve the dishes after the meal.

343
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
You said that?

344
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Yes.

345
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Taste it for me.

346
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
The onion and the big bone stew are delicious.

347
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Be careful.

348
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
It's hot.

349
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Wow.

350
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Wow.

351
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
It's delicious.

352
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,560
It's so delicious.

353
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Thank you.

354
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Do you think your aunt and uncle will like it?

355
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
They will.

356
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
They prefer salty food.

357
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
I'll make you some.

358
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Okay.

359
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
I'll make you some.

360
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
I'll make you some.

361
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Okay.

362
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,560
I just put my coat on the shelf when I was getting the coke.

363
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Take it.

364
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I'm so sorry.

365
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
It's so delicious.

366
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
Thank you.

367
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Hello?

368
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Qian Ba.

369
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Okay, go back.

370
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
I'll get it for you.

371
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Okay, I'll go back now.

372
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,560
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,560
I still don't understand why you left.

375
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:52,560
I still don't understand why I'm waiting.

376
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Waiting for who will remember who's dependence.

377
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Only me in the ground waiting alone.

378
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Waiting for a story to forgive the regret.

379
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Forgive the bright future.

380
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,560
I can only forget the past.

381
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:27,560
I still don't understand why I can't stop crying.
