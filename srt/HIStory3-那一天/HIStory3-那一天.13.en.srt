Anyway

63
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,380
You really can play the phone

64
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,800
because I miss her

65
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
When did you buy this phone?

66
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,040
These few days

67
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,460
You bought this for her by yourself?

68
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,080
No

69
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,760
It's a gift for her

70
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,060
Because of her

71
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,060
You're willing to accept the gift if it's her.

72
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,060
It seems that she came to you very early.

73
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,060
The message has been sent continuously.

74
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,060
It's not an important thing.

75
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,060
I'll close the door now.

76
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
No, close the door now.

77
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,060
With your personality,

78
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,060
she will definitely rush to our door.

79
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,060
No way.

80
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
I'll be at home.

81
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,060
She might come out at will.

82
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,060
So her parents are against you?

83
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
But I promised her.

84
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,060
I won't give up.

85
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,060
I'll be back soon.

86
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,060
I'll be back soon.

87
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,060
I'll be back soon.

88
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,060
Let's spend this time together.

89
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,060
I'll take you to dinner.

90
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,060
Thank you, Brother Zhi Gang.

91
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,060
I'll give you five minutes.

92
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,060
I'll be back soon.

93
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,060
Thank you.

94
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Uncle.

95
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
Happy New Year.

96
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
I was about to say that we should have dinner.

97
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,060
I'll just take a shower and call you.

98
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
But you called me.

99
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,060
Uncle, I'll call the kids to wish you happy new year.

100
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
Uncle.

101
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,460
Congratulations, Bang Chan.

102
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
Wait a minute. Okay, okay.

103
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,960
Uncle.

104
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,460
Uncle, happy new year.

105
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,460
Bye bye.

106
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,860
Hello? Hello, Auntie?

107
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,460
No, he's doing the housework.

108
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,060
Yes, he's watching TV.

109
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,660
Wait a minute.

110
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,460
Auntie.

111
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,860
Hello, Auntie? Happy new year.

112
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,660
Hello?

113
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,260
It's all good.

114
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,460
Next time, when Auntie comes up,

115
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,460
I'll treat everyone to a reunion dinner.

116
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,060
Okay, wait a minute.

117
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,260
Hello? Auntie?

118
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,460
I'm telling you, tomorrow morning, I'll call Auntie.

119
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,260
I'll wish her a happy new year.

120
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Okay, happy new year. Bye.

121
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,060
He's always on his phone. What is he thinking about?

122
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
Okay, don't be angry.

123
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,660
It's the big new year. You have to be happy and smile.

124
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Only then will you be happy all year round.

125
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,260
Okay.

126
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,860
Here.

127
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,460
Mommy, happy new year.

128
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,260
You're giving it to me first?

129
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,260
Wow, to my dearest daughter.

130
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,460
Romantic.

131
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,460
Mommy, you've worked hard this year.

132
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,460
It's my duty.

133
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,260
Okay.

134
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,460
Come, come.

135
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,060
Who wants to come and get the red envelope?

136
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,260
Brother Wu Bi first. I want the big one.

137
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,860
How much is it?

138
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,460
It's a little more than the one in Furu Donghai.

139
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,060
Sister, it's the new year, not your birthday.

140
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,660
It's a lucky day.

141
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,860
Here, Mommy's.

142
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,660
Thank you, Mommy.

143
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,860
Happy new year.

144
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,860
Give me the red envelope.

145
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,260
You young people, what are you doing?

146
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,060
We have our own ideas.

147
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,260
Make your mouth a little bit thinner.

148
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,260
Young and beautiful.

149
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,060
That's right. That's right.

150
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,660
Okay.

151
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,260
Okay.

152
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,860
Who wants to buy the red envelope?

153
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,460
Xiao Ting!

154
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,260
What?

155
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,060
The red envelope.

156
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,260
Thank you.

157
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,660
You're so stubborn.

158
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,860
Other than that, you have nothing to say?

159
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,860
You haven't agreed to let us date yet.

160
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,860
I don't want to talk to you about auspicious things.

161
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,460
You're not saying anything and you still want to get the red envelope?

162
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,660
You asked me to get it.

163
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,060
If you don't want to give it, don't give it.

164
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,060
What kind of tone is that?

165
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,660
I'll give it back to you.

166
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,660
Call Yu Xi over tomorrow to visit him at home.

167
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,060
What do you mean?

168
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,860
Why are you looking for him? What do you want?

169
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,260
What kind of attitude is that?

170
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,460
Why would you hit him and beat him?

171
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,460
Regarding Yu Xi's suggestion,

172
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,460
I've already discussed it with Dad.

173
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,460
We have to tell him our decision.

174
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,260
You want to reject him or scold him?

175
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,660
Just face me.

176
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,860
The person we're looking for is him, not you.

177
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,660
If you don't want to ask him to come, then forget it.

178
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,660
You're promoting us right?

179
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,060
Right, right, right.

180
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:18,260
Then I'll yell to him.

181
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,660
Correct!

182
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,460
Okay!

183
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Everyone, eat more.

184
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,460
Happy birthday!

185
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,460
It's Brother Gang.

186
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,460
I'm so happy.

187
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,460
Happy birthday.

188
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,460
Hurry up.

189
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,460
Hurry up.

190
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,460
Come on.

191
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,460
Use your mouth to bite the card.

192
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,460
I'm not that good.

193
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
Okay, I'll give it to you.

194
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,460
I'll give it to you.

195
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,460
We have 10 seconds left.

196
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,460
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

197
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,460
Happy birthday!

198
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,460
Woohoo!

199
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,460
Here comes the big show.

200
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,460
Do you think we need something here?

201
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,460
A red envelope before the New Year.

202
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,460
That's so important.

203
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
This is...

204
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,460
There's no such thing as a meal without meat.

205
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Let's have a chance.

206
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
Who wants to go first?

207
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,460
I'll go first.

208
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,460
The fries are the only one.

209
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,460
It's spicy.

210
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,460
I'll help you.

211
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,460
Help me take it.

212
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,460
Thank you.

213
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,460
No problem.

214
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,460
Thank you.

215
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,460
I'll go first.

216
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,460
Let's have a friendly show.

217
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,460
Let's continue eating.

218
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
One day, the rabbit said,

219
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,460
I want to be a rabbit.

220
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,460
The mouse said,

221
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,460
I want to be a mouse.

222
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,460
The eagle said,

223
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,460
I'm not playing anymore.

224
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,460
Gu.

225
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,460
So this is how you guys joke in high school.

226
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Uncle Ji, thank you.

227
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,460
Have fun today.

228
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
What's your favorite dish?

229
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
Hot pot.

230
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,460
I know you like hot pot.

231
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
You never stop.

232
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,460
My friends say you're cute.

233
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,460
They're nice.

234
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,460
And they're funny.

235
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,460
We can stop here.

236
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,460
We haven't arrived yet.

237
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,460
I want to buy something.

238
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,460
Come on.

239
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,460
Brother Qing.

240
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,460
This is my heart.

241
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,460
I want you.

242
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,460
I'll be better.

243
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,460
Thank you, brother.

244
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,460
I'll go home now.

245
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,460
I'll go home now.

246
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,460
Bye.

247
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
Bye.

248
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,460
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,460
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,460
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,460
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,460
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,460
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,460
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,460
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,460
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,460
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,460
Happy Fourth year.

264
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,260
enjoyable

265
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,660
It's been another year

266
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,160
today was a bit later

267
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,260
happy new year

268
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,780
Okay.

269
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,180
Ya, look. My sister still loves me so much .

270
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,600
She gave me the Daddy submersion identification wallet.

271
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,020
You'd better learn what we are going to eat and where we are going to visit.

272
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,640
Try and remember.

273
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,940
I really miss you.

274
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,660
I hope that your eyes can suddenly appear in front of me as long as I look at me.

275
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,880
After how long do I have to keep seeing you creature

276
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,660
You are doing great for us.

277
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,960
You have to work hard.

278
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,560
Okay, go to sleep.

279
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,260
Don't run around.

280
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,260
I will take a picture of you.

281
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,860
I want to say

282
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,560
I will be by your side next year.

284
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,560
We will spend many years together.

285
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
Don't leave me.

286
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
Bye. Good night.

287
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
See you tomorrow.

288
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
So stupid.

289
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Uncle Sikang.

291
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Why are you here?

292
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,860
What?

293
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,860
You just finished your dinner.

294
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,560
Will your family scold you?

295
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,860
It's past midnight.

296
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,360
I just want to see you.

297
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,760
I have something to tell you.

298
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
What is it?

299
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Do you know what my wish is?

300
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,360
I don't know. What is it?

301
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,360
I want to take you home.

302
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
She wants you to leave home.

303
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,860
I want you to go home.

304
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,360
I want you to be with me.

305
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
I want you to be with me.

306
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,660
I want you to go home.

307
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,160
Go back to your home.

308
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
I want you to accept your parents

309
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,360
and believe in our love.

310
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,060
She is your first love.

311
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,360
I want to be your last lover.

312
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
Even if I have to quit and move on

313
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,360
in the end, I want to hold you by my side.

314
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,180
To come

315
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,360
See.

316
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,360
The international dogs also have our names on it.

317
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,360
That means, from now on.

318
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,680
You belong to me.

319
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,000
The wind and rain

320
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,160
Everyone says

321
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,760
What kind of weather will come tomorrow

322
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,200
I just know that I want to see you most when I wake up

323
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,440
Let us be together

324
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,920
Maybe in the future, technology will be very advanced

325
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,440
We can live to be 100 years old

326
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,320
But I think

327
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,160
Fourteen times awkward

328
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,200
Why is it four times awkward?

329
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,200
Because you are exactly 100 years old when you are 14 times

330
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,640
Why are you so stupid?

331
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,440
Remember to prove that we

332
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,640
Do not need any complicated language

333
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,560
Together I want to slowly

334
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Love you in a way you are familiar with

335
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:33,440
Let us be together

336
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,640
We are all in love

337
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,280
You are your own

338
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
I love you

339
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,720
I have you in my heart

340
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,160
I love you

341
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,480
I just know that I want to see you most in the future

342
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,960
I just want to see you most

343
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,640
When the blue sky and white clouds disappear

344
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,000
That yellow paper and red coat will take you away

345
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,400
When all the colors are gone with you

346
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:46,120
Deeply, tears will not stop falling with me

347
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,600
I still don't understand why you left

348
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,640
I still don't understand why I wait

349
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,400
Waiting for who will remember who's dependence

350
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,800
Only me in the ground alone

351
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,160
Waiting for a story to forgive regrets

352
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:19,520
Let two hearts run to the bright future

353
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,920
But I can't forget it

354
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:31,880
I just don't understand why tears won't stop falling
