1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你浪漫燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再更叠

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
而我盲目的追不低头妥协

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
想保护着谁

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿拥有你的明天

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我只想在我一边

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
每天都能叫面对

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
生命总会有机会

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
而你准备要浪费

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
在我一边

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
在我一边

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Miss

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Miss

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sorry, sorry

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is there any other color in this?

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, blue and yellow

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Where is this?

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That one over there

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Brother

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I remember that Phoebe also likes to wear

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Dali's colorful clothes

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How do you think of this one?

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Not bad

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You don't have a phone

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So you can't go out without it

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You have to keep drawing

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I believe in your taste

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you think this one suits her?

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Since we came in

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The staff there has been looking at you

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Xia Houding

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are?

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I didn't expect to meet you there

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Girls go to your store there

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What a coincidence

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If I can hang out with old friends like this

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That would be great

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Tony's

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It feels good

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Tony's

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Are your eyes real or fake?

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They are real

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When did you start wearing glasses?

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And wearing necklace to pretend to be Wen Qing

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You have changed a lot

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You haven't changed a lot

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Of course, I am Li Siyu

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I told my boyfriend that

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I look like a high schooler

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Did I?

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You look more mature and stable

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
than before

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Where did you go when you were like a crab?

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I didn't expect that

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You changed a lot

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I was so happy

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I didn't expect that

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You have changed a lot

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I didn't expect that

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You have changed a lot

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I didn't expect that

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You have changed a lot

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How about you?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you doing well?

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I am doing well

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I thought it would be easy to find a job after graduation

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But I didn't expect it to be so easy

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So I went to this company for an interview

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and worked as a waitress

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I didn't expect that

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
your sister likes our clothes

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Tell her to come to me next time

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I will give her a bonus

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ok, thank you

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You are welcome

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where did you go to college?

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I just graduated from college

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You are so talented

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You are the captain of the award

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You are the best student in the school

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You are the most promising student

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The next lucky boy is you

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You are so blinded

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I took the postgraduate exam for 2 years

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and I only got into the physics department

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Physics department?

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Really?

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's so hard

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You got into the physics department after you graduated

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We didn't have the chance to find a job at that time

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That accident was so sudden

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I heard from Meifang that

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
she didn't have a parents

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
she is the aunt of her parents

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
She wants to be simple and low-key

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No one knows the time and place of the farewell

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So I can't see the end of the journey

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I will miss you

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If I didn't see you today

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I wouldn't miss him either

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I know you are doing well now

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I am so happy for you

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I will miss you

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I will miss you

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I will miss you

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are Yu Xigu

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I really like you

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I really like you

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I really like you

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I really like you

117
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I love you

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I love you

119
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The deepest comfort

120
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Then I bring you by my side

121
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Your tears

122
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I hurt you

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I hurt you

124
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I want to say it gently in the rain

125
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I want to say it gently in the rain

126
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have washed it

127
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Bye

128
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Everyone is looking for you

129
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you know why we are worried?

130
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What are you thinking?

131
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I have changed

132
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We have changed

133
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But he hasn't changed

134
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
When time still stays at 18

135
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I can only go on

136
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The sky will not come down

137
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I always want to be able to pull into the galaxy

138
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So I keep climbing

139
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Keep going

140
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Can go closer to the starry sky

141
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It seems that I can touch the stars with my hands

142
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can touch it immediately

143
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I can't

144
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Exactly

145
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Even if I want to get closer to him

146
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
In fact, the distance between me and him is

147
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It will get further and further

148
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He is still 18 years old

149
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Only I changed

150
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I am very afraid

151
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I am very scared

152
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I am very scared

153
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But he is 18 years old

154
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You have always been 18 years old

155
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I still

156
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I still often dream of that intersection

157
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That car

158
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He is lying there

159
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But I have no way

160
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can't do anything

161
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Finally

162
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The things left are really familiar

163
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But you know

164
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You know, every one is a picture

165
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Every one is a memory

166
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That thing stuffed me so full

167
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Full that I can't hold it anymore

168
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What

169
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You know

170
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I have been trying to forget him

171
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I can't do it

172
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The only thing I can do is to remember him

173
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Remember

174
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Live with him

175
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But I'm really in pain like this

176
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I really miss him

177
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It hurts to be hurt

178
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I can't hold it anymore

179
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You don't need to forget him

180
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You just need to keep going

181
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You have brought him here

182
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If you can't find the direction

183
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You follow the current you go

184
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
How can you get out

185
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I can't

186
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I really don't know how to walk alone

187
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How about you

188
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You can walk alone from here

189
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't

190
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It smells so good

191
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Dad, you are getting better

192
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I didn't know you have this

193
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Unknowing talent

194
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You are good at playing cards

195
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You are not inferior to the breakfast restaurants outside

196
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Is it delicious

197
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Then call it like mommy

198
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You say it yourself

199
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, no, Xiao Ting

200
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Xiao Ting, get up, don't sleep anymore

201
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Didn't you ask me to call you

202
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's more than ten o'clock

203
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You have an appointment with someone, right?

204
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
She came back so late last night

205
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
She can go home and let her sleep a little longer

206
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I want her to sleep longer too

207
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But she didn't answer the phone yesterday

208
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I called her twice in the morning

209
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
She's back to the store

210
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Sister, come to eat

211
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Sister, come on

212
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Xiao Ting, get up

213
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't sleep

214
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Sister, come on

215
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Xiao Ting

216
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Go to bed

217
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Come on

218
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Good morning

219
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Good morning

220
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
My head hurts

221
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Headache

222
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Sister, go get the portable phone

223
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
She must be drunk

224
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
She came back last night and drank a lot

225
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes, she must have drunk too much

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Why don't you go home and go to the convenience store

227
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Buy some alcohol

228
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay

229
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Dad, you are biased towards her now

230
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Okay, brother is going abroad

231
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We don't have much time at home

232
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Don't mind your brother and sister

233
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Go quickly

234
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Go quickly

235
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hao Ting

236
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I said Phoebe is a good girl

237
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay

238
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Phoebe

239
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Phoebe

240
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes, you have to remember

241
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't say it wrong when others come

242
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's embarrassing

243
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Phoebe is a good girl

244
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You went abroad with her this time

245
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Do you want to get used to it?

246
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If you think it's good, just settle down

247
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Such a good girl

248
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If you are not sure

249
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's easy to be chased by others

250
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Really, dad is right

251
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Good girls are not desirable

252
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And you two are so fated

253
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You two are so talkative, right?

254
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But if you have any plans

255
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You have to tell others in advance

256
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Don't delay others

257
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm going to take a shower

258
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Come and eat after you finish washing

259
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Dad made it

260
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You are not answering

261
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I didn't answer

262
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Continue asking after you finish washing

263
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Dad, what are you cooking?

264
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's burnt, right?

265
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
My hot dog

266
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You can't be the boss

267
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Uncle, you are back

268
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why are you suddenly here?

269
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I came to see you

270
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What have you been busy with recently?

271
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I just finished filming

272
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm so tired

273
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Thank you

274
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Cool

275
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I can imagine your life

276
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You don't have to imagine

277
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's not made by people

278
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Busy man

279
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Why are you free today?

280
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay

281
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm thinking

282
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How to apologize to you two

283
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
For the mistakes I made before

284
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Why do you want to apologize?

285
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I know how to draw

286
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What do you mean?

287
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's okay if you have something to say

288
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That healthy food

289
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Grandpa didn't want me to give it to you

290
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I thought that's all

291
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But it has other meanings

292
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What else?

293
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I hope you two

294
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Don't give it to me anymore

295
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If grandpa doesn't like those things

296
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
We can give you something else

297
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's not about giving something

298
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No matter how much you give

299
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Grandpa still can't understand

300
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Grandpa wants to say

301
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Wait

302
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If it's those negative things again

303
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You don't have to say it

304
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You two can imagine

305
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Grandpa wants me to tell you two

306
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Uncle

307
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You can go home

308
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You said

309
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Can you go home by yourself?

310
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Grandpa allows you

311
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You can go with me

312
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I

313
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I can do it too

314
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I can do it too

315
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I can do it too

316
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Did you just say

317
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Are you serious?

318
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Grandpa is waiting for you two to go back

319
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'll go see him

320
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You sit down

321
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay

322
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Don't cry

323
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Isn't this a happy thing?

324
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'll go home with you tomorrow

325
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'll go with you

326
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'll go with you

327
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm here

328
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm here

329
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000

I'm here

I'm here

332
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm here

333
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm here

I'm here

338
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm here

339
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm here

340
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm here

341
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000

I'm here

345
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm here

346
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm here

347
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm here

348
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000

I'm here

00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
I'm going abroad.

00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,700
I'll call you,

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,800

464
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,000
and you'll disappear.

465
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Don't even think of being my brother.

466
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
I won't.

467
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,600
What about after you?

468
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,400
What's your plan after you finish your studies?

469
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I want to stay abroad for another two years.

470
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,600
I want to go to different places.

471
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,000
I want to meet people and do more things.

472
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
This world is really big.

473
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,800
Really.

474
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,800
I've been wanting to ask you something.

475
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,600
It's okay if you don't want to answer.

476
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,600
You told me that you don't like boys.

477
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
You only like girls.

478
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,200
But now you meet him.

479
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Why don't you have feelings for him?

480
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Or do you want to try?

481
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,200
Because no one can be him.

482
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
I'm here.

483
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
I'm going to the Himalayas.

484
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
I think I'm ready to see them.

485
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Don't keep talking about me.

486
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
What about you?

487
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
What about you?

488
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Do you have any plans?

489
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
You're all blushing.

490
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Plans?

491
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I really want to get married.

492
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,200
But he's very busy.

493
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Busy.

494
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I've told you before.

495
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
And you know that day,

496
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
we argued because of the little dog.

497
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
I found out that we argued about something

498
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,200
that's very complicated.

499
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
When I read it,

500
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
I couldn't stand it.

501
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Do you know what we argued about?

502
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
I said I wanted to raise a soldier.

503
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
He's very handsome.

504
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
He said he wanted to raise a bean.

505
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
The cute thing is,

506
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
we argued and argued and argued

507
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
and argued about something.

508
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
We decided to go to the zoo together.

509
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,200
He said he wanted to remove the dog from our family.

510
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
What do you mean?

511
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Just let him raise you.

512
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
I'll raise him.

513
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Please.

514
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,200
I still don't understand why you left.

515
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,200
I still don't understand why I'm waiting.

516
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Waiting for someone to remember their dependence.

517
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,200
I'm wandering alone in the abyss.

518
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,200
When the blue sky and white clouds disappear,

519
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,200
When the red shoes and red coat take you away,

520
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,200
When all colors leave with you,

521
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:01,200
My tears don't stop falling and accompany me.

522
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,200
I still don't understand why you left.

523
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I still don't understand why I'm waiting.

524
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Waiting for someone to remember their dependence.

525
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Waiting for someone to remember their dependence.

526
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Why can't I stop crying?
