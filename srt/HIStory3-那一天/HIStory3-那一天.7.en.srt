《I Will Never Give Up》

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我的生命从不为谁后悔

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
陪你老板燃烧直到熄灭

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
珍惜生命中的每次眼泪

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
有天我会勇敢不再更变

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
而我盲目的追 低头妥协 想保护着谁

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
我想许愿 拥有你的明天

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
我只想在我一边 每天都能将面对

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
生命总会有机会 而你准备要浪费

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
在我一边 在我一边

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
你怎么又在这里

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
所以你最近整个人都怪怪的

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
我原本想说也没什么

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
但看你现在这样

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
事情好像很严重呢

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
也许你现在也在想

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
如果有什么事

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
我可以帮你做一下

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
然后帮你去做一下

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
但是我现在

21
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,620
Yeah

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,580
Hsiao taking a Sw vão

23
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,720
Am I

24
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,700
a selfish person?

25
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,940
How do you know?

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,360
My mom cheering me every single day

27
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,160
with the statement not to transfer

28
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,140
The teachers at the university

29
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,940
hate me expensive funny

30
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,300
Even Sun Bo

31
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,180
He thinks that I don't care about others' feelings

32
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,580
So I'm really a bad person

33
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,100
Actually you're not that bad

34
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,060
Sometimes you're very self-righteous and self-righteous

35
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,340
But you know what?

36
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,340
You have a super big advantage

37
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,940
that no one else has

38
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,540
It's you

39
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,540
You're really very kind

40
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,340
Really?

41
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,940
Of course

42
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,140
You're so loyal to your friends

43
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,540
You see that everyone likes you so much

44
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,540
And you're also a brother who loves his sister

45
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,740
I can tell others at school

46
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,340
I have a brother who treats me super well

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
Really?

48
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,140
Really

49
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,740
Do you remember that time

50
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,340
You got second place in the school just to encourage me

51
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,940
And in the time at Xiaoyu Port

52
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,340
You were scolded by everyone

53
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,340
Just to protect me

54
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,340
I think you're very handsome and very heroic

55
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,140
Really?

56
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,140
So you're really good enough

57
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,140
Sometimes you just need to be more careful

58
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,340
and be more serious

59
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,740
Then you're perfect

60
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,340
Careful and serious

61
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,340
So I

62
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,540
Xiao Xiaoqi

63
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,340
You're really my sun

64
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,540
Let's go home

65
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,740
You're so great

66
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,140
The second prize is the Queen of gold

67
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,940
To protect the golden city

68
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,340
To recruit talented people to be the captain of the gold

69
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,140
The highest rate of violence is up to 50,000 times 100,000 times

70
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,540
The next lucky person is you

71
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,340
Macau's new Peking Entertainment City

73
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,340
Then give me a chance

74
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,140
I really want to be with you

75
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,740
I miss you so much

76
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
I'm sorry

77
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,740
You still know you're sorry

78
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,340
I'm sorry

79
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,340
I'm sorry

80
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,340
I'm sorry

81
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
I'm sorry

82
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,340
I'm sorry

83
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,340
I'm sorry

84
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
I'm sorry

85
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,740
If I want to forgive you

86
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,740
then this

87
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,340
I'm serious

88
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,540
I want to say sorry to you

89
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,340
So

90
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
I asked you out today

91
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,540
to make things clear

92
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,340
What do you want to say?

93
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,740
I can't call you baby anymore

94
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
Siyu

95
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,140
Then you call me baby

96
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,940
We can't be together anymore

97
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,340
Really?

98
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,340
Why not?

99
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
Sounds good

100
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,340
I don't want to

101
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,140
I don't want to

102
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,140
I don't want to

103
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
I don't want to

104
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,140
Why not?

105
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,340
Give me another chance

106
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,340
What's wrong with me?

107
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,940
Because I have someone I like

108
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,740
orada

109
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,780
Yu Yummyouts Vic

110
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,180
déc tangible

111
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,500
I just think he's kinda lost

112
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,780
Could you fill it out for me?

113
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,140
You can pull your pants down

114
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,140
I'm not leaving

115
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,700
No sir

116
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,580
You won't leave

117
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,740
A stone can bring both the wind and the sun

118
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,580
I don't have to

119
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,300
Pull it

120
00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:06,020
You can tie the hair

121
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,520
I understand.

122
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Then, let's goICE think about history!

123
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,620
What do you think?

124
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,020
Was faith created?

125
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,740
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,740
You gave up?

127
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,740
He said I was too young.

128
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,740
I couldn't grow up suddenly.

129
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
He said it's not forever.

130
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,740
I really want to know where to buy it.

131
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,740
I want to say,

132
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,740
I'm beaten by death.

133
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,740
But I can't fall in love.

134
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,740
It's more painful to be beaten by death.

135
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Don't say that.

136
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,740
Love someone,

137
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
not to make him cry,

138
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,740
not to make him sad.

139
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
Love someone,

140
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
should make him happy.

141
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Are you writing a song?

143
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
I'll go.

144
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,740
Where are you going?

145
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,740
I'll help you.

146
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
This is the ticket and your 60 yuan.

147
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
Thank you.

148
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
And hot soy milk.

149
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Be careful. It's hot.

150
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Hi, I'm here.

151
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
I've prepared the gift for you.

152
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,740
Okay.

153
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,740
Thank you. Bye.

154
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,740
What do you need?

155
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
What do you need?

156
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,740
He's serious.

157
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
He's pure.

158
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
And he's a man.

159
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
Are you...

160
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
My brother?

161
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
What are you doing?

162
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
I told him,

163
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
I like a guy recently.

164
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
He told me,

165
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,740
you should use sincerity and sincerity to love someone.

166
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,740
You're crazy.

167
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,740
What are you talking about?

168
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
He will give his everything

169
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
and his brother to his beloved one.

170
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
That person is you.

171
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Shut up.

172
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
I'm sorry. I'll take him away.

173
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,740
I'll talk to him.

174
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,740
I'll talk to him.

175
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
I'll talk to him.

176
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
I'll talk to him.

177
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
Don't say that.

178
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
What's the sense of security?

179
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,740
It's more important than love.

180
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,740
You're a man.

181
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
You only care about him.

182
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
Enough.

183
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,740
You're so annoying.

184
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Calm down.

185
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
I'll have a guest at any time.

186
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,740
I'll help you.

187
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
Your business is my business.

188
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,740
I told you so much.

189
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,740
You should have told him.

190
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
Why?

191
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,740
You did so much for him.

192
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
You don't want him to know?

193
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
No?

194
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
No?

195
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,740
I don't want to see you so sad.

196
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
Enough.

197
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Listen.

198
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
This is my workplace.

199
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
Do you respect me?

200
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
What's the matter?

201
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,740
You're so ridiculous.

202
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
Come out with me.

203
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
Come out with me.

204
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,740
You want to be with me so much.

205
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,740
Have you ever been in love?

206
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
No.

207
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,740
You're the first one.

208
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,740
What kind of love do you have with me?

209
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,740
Do you know me?

210
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,740
Do you know what I like to eat?

211
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Do you know how to make me happy every day?

212
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,740
Do you know when I'm not happy,

213
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,740
you have to come to me at the first time?

214
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
You don't know anything.

215
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,740
I've had three boyfriends.

216
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,740
I love them all my heart.

217
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,740
But what did I get in return?

218
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,740
I gave them too much pressure.

219
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,740
I didn't have freedom.

220
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
No matter how much I worked,

221
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
how much I paid,

222
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,740
they chose to leave me.

223
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
Yes.

224
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,740
I'm selfish.

225
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,740
I'm selfish.

226
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,740
But I don't want to be in love anymore.

227
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,740
Do you understand?

228
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,740
You mean you want me to give up?

229
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Give up?

230
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,740
I feel bad.

231
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Duan Nam-jun

232
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
I don't know do I understand?

233
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,740
I don't know how to make you happy every day.

234
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
I don't know.

235
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,740
I can't solve these problems now.

236
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,740
But I am Sun Bo Xiang.

237
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
I know what I want.

238
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,740
I only want you.

239
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
It doesn't matter if you don't want to love me.

240
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
As long as you let me love you.

241
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Believe me.

242
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
I will prove everything with me.

243
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,740
I love you.

244
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,740
No one can tell what tomorrow will be like.

245
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,740
I just want to see you when I wake up.

246
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Just wait for us to be together.

247
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,740
I can't lie to you.

248
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
I

249
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,740
I really don't want anyone to tell me.

250
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,740
I just want to see you when I wake up.

251
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,740
I'm home.

252
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Can I come to your house?

253
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,740
Yes.

254
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
I have something to tell you.

255
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
Come in.

256
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,740
Put it here.

257
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Here.

258
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,740
Sit down.

259
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,740
Do you want some water?

260
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
I'll get you some.

261
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
No.

262
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,740
I'll get you some water.

263
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
Crying?

264
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
Yes.

265
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,740
What do you want to tell me?

266
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,740
I want to explain it to you.

267
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,740
I've been wanting to apologize to you.

268
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,740
I really didn't want to bother you.

269
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,740
I regretted it after I ruined your exam.

270
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,740
I was so self-contradictory.

271
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
That's why I followed you.

272
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
I wanted to say sorry to you.

273
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
And I broke up with Li Zhi Yu.

274
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,740
I didn't mean to ruin your job.

275
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
It's because...

276
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,740
That's...

277
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,740
I really like you.

278
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,740
I don't like boys.

279
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,740
I didn't like boys either.

280
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
But I'm sure...

281
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,740
I like you.

282
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,740
I'm serious.

283
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
I'm serious.

284
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
I'm serious.

285
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,740
I'm serious.

286
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,740
I'm serious.

287
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,740
I hope you believe me.

288
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
See you.

289
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,740
I just want to stay in front of you.

290
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,740
I just want to say I miss you so much.

291
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
I miss you so much.

292
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,740
I miss you so much.

293
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Thank you.

294
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
Why so sudden?

295
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,740
How can he be so mean?

296
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,740
He's so mean.

297
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
He's so mean.

298
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
He's so dirty.

299
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
He's so dirty.

300
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,740
Did he say who he likes?

301
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740
It's not that kind of question.

302
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
He's so dirty.

303
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,740
He's not worth it.

304
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
What do you mean?

305
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
He's so disgusting.

306
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,740
You must find a way to get him.

307
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,740
How can I get him?

308
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
He's not afraid of teachers.

309
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
He doesn't listen to his parents.

310
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,740
He doesn't care about me.

311
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,740
So you mean that's it?

312
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
I don't want to say that.

313
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
What are you going to do?

314
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,740
I want to find a better person before graduation.

315
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,740
Be my boyfriend.

316
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,740
I want to piss him off.

317
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,740
That's it.

318
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,740
You've done so much for him.

319
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
You're so nice to him.

320
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
You gave him everything.

321
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,740
Don't you want to do something else?

322
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Don't you want to do something else?

323
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,740
I want to go to the bathroom.

324
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,740
I want to go to the bathroom.

325
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,740
I need you to help me confirm something.

326
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,740
I like you.

327
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,740
I need to chase you.

328
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,740
I'm sorry.

329
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
I'm sorry.

330
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
I'm sorry.

331
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,740
I'm sorry.

332
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,740
I'm sorry.

333
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,740
I'm sorry.

334
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,740
I'm sorry.

335
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,740
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,740
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
I'm sorry.

338
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
I'm sorry.

339
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
I'm sorry.

340
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,740
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
I'm sorry.

343
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,740
I'm sorry.

344
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
I'm sorry.

345
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
I'm sorry.

346
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
I'm sorry.

347
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
I'm sorry.

348
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,740
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
I'm sorry.

350
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,740
I'm sorry.

351

I'm sorry.

352
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
I'm sorry.

353
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,740
I'm sorry.

354
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,740
I'm sorry.

355
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,740
I'm sorry.

356
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,740
I'm sorry.

357
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,740
I'm sorry.

358
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,740
I'm sorry.

359
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,740
I'm sorry.

360
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,740
I'm sorry.

361
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,740
I'm sorry.

362
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,740
I'm sorry.

363
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,740
I'm sorry.

364
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
I'm sorry.

365
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,740
I'm sorry.

366
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,740
I'm sorry.

367
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,740
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,740
I'm sorry.

369
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
I'm sorry.

370
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,740
I'm sorry.

371
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,740
I'm sorry.

372
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
I'm sorry.

373
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
I'm sorry.

374
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,740
I'm sorry.

375
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,740
I'm sorry.

376
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
I'm sorry.

377
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
I'm sorry.

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,740
I'm sorry.

379
