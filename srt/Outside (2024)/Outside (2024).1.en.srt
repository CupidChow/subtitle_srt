00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,645
D… daddy…

194
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,773
[crying] No!

195
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,691
D… daddy…

196
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,653
Sorry!

197
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,906
[woman screeching] Francis!

198
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,617
-[breathes shakily]
-[woman] Francis.

199
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,244
[Francis inhales sharply]

200
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,958
[pants]

201
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,554
[Francis] It's so quiet.

202
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,560
We're probably safe here, right?

203
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,316
Safe.

204
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,362
I didn't think I would use that word here.

205
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,281
It's not enough of a reason
for us to stay here.

206
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,494
Why not?

207
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:27,872
Francis…

208
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,252
When I saw you last night,

209
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,548
I understood everything
you said about this place.

210
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,592
About what happened to you.

211
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,139
So that's all the more reason
why we should leave this place, right?

212
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,101
It's better for you, it's better for us.

213
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,524
So there's an "us" again.

214
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,245
All I know is that we're both guilty.

215
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,582
Me, I made a mistake.

216
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,502
But you…

217
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,884
I wish I knew sooner.

218
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,636
If I had told you earlier,

219
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,514
well then,

220
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,017
we wouldn't be together now.

221
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,603
And we wouldn't have Lucas.

222
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,909
I'm ready to move on if you are.

223
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,912
[ominous music playing]

224
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,790
So let's move.

225
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,555
Francis, it's not far to go now
until we reach the north.

226
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,892
And the mountain
that Alice told Joshua about.

227
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,019
That's where people are going.

228
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,063
Let's hope so.

229
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,361
And that's what Uncle Diego said too.

230
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,914
What did you say?

231
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,040
Uncle Diego.

232
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,293
He also told Mom
that we should head north.

233
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,712
When was that?

234
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,339
[Josh] I don't remember.

235
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,176
I just overheard he
and Mom talking before we left.

236
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,178
Right, Mom?

237
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,392
[scoffs] Could've guessed.

238
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,064
He just called to check on us.

239
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,900
Why didn't he call me?

240
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,028
[woman] He says you won't answer.

241
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,864
Oh, really?

242
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,367
Move on.

243
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,996
Francis, don't.

244
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,038
You're lying.

245
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,499
-I said not here.
-I knew it. How could I be such an idiot?

246
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,458
-Pa!
-I'm really…

247
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,794
-Listen to me, I'm telling you the truth.
-Pa!

248
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,879
-What?
-[gasps]

249
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,589

[ominous music playing]

253
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:43,902
It's blocked.

254
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,530
Francis, we'll get through.

255
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,704
Iris, no.

256
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,206
There's still space.

257
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,085
We just have to push back the fence,
then the van will fit.

258
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,338
-We won't get through there.
-We still can!

259
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,427
[Francis] Iris, please, listen to me.

260
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,221
The fence is there for a reason and… and…

261
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,015
It's getting dark!

262
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,267
It's too risky.

263
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,022
Let's just go back.

264
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,524
No.

265
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,402
Iris.

266
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,987

559
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,170
To what?

560
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,464
[Iris] The camp.

561
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,971
Francis, I'm serious.

562
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,016
We have enough food
and we have drinking water.

563
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,227
We can go back and we can fix the van.

564
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,772
If it really is broken.

565
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,742
The bridge is closed but you want to go.

566
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,954
-We can still get through it, right?
-Okay, so

567
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,039
what you want to happen…

568
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,211
So we'll get to the van that doesn't work,

569
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,965
then we'll drive hundreds of kilometers
to find people in a camp

570
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:10,468
that we're not even sure
is in a situation that's better than ours.

571
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,887
There's probably a doctor there.

572
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,015
And probably people who can help us.

573
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,725
Are you hearing what you're saying?

574
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,103
What if that dog had bitten Lucas?

575
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:24,274
Why are we talking about a dog
when compared to whatever is out there?

576
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,776
You're aware of what's happening, right?

577
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,279
Or you've forgotten?

578
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,575
You remember what happened on the bridge?

579
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,079
What happened at Lucas' school?

580
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,168
To his classmates?
You want him to become like them?

581
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,003
You're scaring your son.

582
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,880
It's better to be afraid and alive.

583
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,008
What's the value
of courage if you're dead?

584
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,219
I don't want to die, Papa.

585
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,767
[sighs] That won't happen, okay?

586
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,603
I'll make sure.

587
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,367

588
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,453
[hammer bangs]

589
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:35,803
[Josh] Dad?

590
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:46,689
I just wanted to ask
if we could turn the generator back on?

591
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:49,901
To charge again?

592
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,986
There's no reception.

593
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,280
No.

594
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,909
I was thinking of trying
the music player in the living room.

595
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,537
Maybe I can get reception on it.

596
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,790
It's called a turntable. There's no radio.

597
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,586
I just want something to do.

598
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,382
There's a lot to do here.
Just keep doing it.

599
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:19,222
I just want to know what's out there,
I need to know who else is out there!

600
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,267
Are you blind?

601
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,730
When you boys
were almost killed on the bridge…

602
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,732
You didn't see any of that?

603
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,442
I did.

604
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,777
So you saw me too?

605
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,737
You saw what I did to save you?

606
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,741
Can you do that?

[ominous music playing]

608
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,333
Can you kill?

609
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,509
I can.

610
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:02,682
You can, huh?

611
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,520
[ominous music continues]

612
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:08,980
[Josh] Dad!

613
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,116
[Francis] You know…

614
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:23,995
when I was young…

615
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,456
[sighs]

616
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,299
this land used to be full
of rebels and thieves.

617
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,346
My dad was their target.

[sighs]

619
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,143
But they realized…

620
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,106
Arturo Abel doesn't scare easily.

621
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,160
It was a wild time.

622
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,206
Everyone had a gun.

623
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,002

624
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,425

Fix your stance.

[ominous music playing]

631
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,462
How? How do you aim?

632
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,297
Huh? Let me see.

633
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,926
Front sight and then…

634
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,765
Front sight, rear sight.
It should look like this, understand?

635
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,309
-Like this.
-I don't understand.

636
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,396
Target, front sight, rear sight.
That's it. Come on.

637

Fire.

638
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,245
[breathes shakily] Francis,
what's going on?

639
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,164
I'm just teaching him.

640
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,624
Teaching him? Why?

641
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,461
When I was his age, I'd killed animals.

642
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,171
He needs to learn.

643
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,549
Come on, Francis.

644
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,432
What are you doing?

645
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,434
Why can't you hit it?

646
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,103
I've lined it up for you, now focus!

647
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,439
It's just one line,
why can't you hit it yet?

933
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,351
I can't stop thinking about it.

934
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:19,729
Lukie, didn't you say
you'd love to have a baby brother?

935
01:29:19,812 --> 01:29:22,190
Uh… Sure, but…

936
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:23,941
I think it's time.

937
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:27,236
What do you mean, "it's time"?

938
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:30,198
Francis, don't joke about this.

939
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:31,908
[Francis] I'm serious!

940
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:36,829
Why does our life as a family have to stop
because the world did?

941
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:42,502
We can still live normally, Iris.

942
01:29:42,585 --> 01:29:44,045
Francis, normal is over.

943
01:29:44,128 --> 01:29:46,964
That's all the more reason
for us to get together.

944
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,218
Let's grow our family.

945
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:58,518
No way.

946
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:01,813
What do you mean?

947
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,442
I can't live like this.

948
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:10,530
This is not normal.

949
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:12,990
It's not right.

950
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,830
Do you want to know what my wish is?

951
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,877
I want to leave.

952
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,673
Not the next month.

953
01:30:29,298 --> 01:30:30,925
Not the next week.

954
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:33,678
I want to leave now.

955
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:35,555
Right now.

956
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:38,683
We've talked about this before.

957
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,518
Francis, look at our food.

958
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:44,897
How long until it's all gone, huh?

959
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:50,945
No matter how many candles you light,
no meal will ever feel like fine dining.

960
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:57,743
Those things outside
that we're afraid of, they're dying.

961
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,998
Maybe not all of them,
but most of them are.

962
01:31:02,498 --> 01:31:05,084
Even I can run faster than them.

963
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,127
[Francis] You can.

964
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:09,672
You can. But what about them?

965
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:15,094
Yes, I know we stayed here
because they couldn't.

966
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:18,806
I won't argue with you there.
I understand that.

967
01:31:19,348 --> 01:31:23,102
But just take a look at us.
We have nothing to eat!

968
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:26,856
[inhales] We have to leave here
to find some food.

969
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:28,107
And who will do that?

970
01:31:29,525 --> 01:31:30,359
You?

971
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:36,282
You fortified the walls
but you didn't do anything to find food.

972
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,826
Sugarcane, over and over again.

973
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,453
Do you hear that, boys?

974
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:43,831
Your mother is leaving us.

975
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,585
But I don't have any choice.
We need to eat!

976
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:50,046
How can we be sure you'll come back?

977
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:51,923
Of course I'll come back,
they're my children!

978
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:53,174
[Francis] No.

979
01:31:53,799 --> 01:31:55,218
I know you're not coming back.

980
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:59,222
Because I know you don't even like us.

981
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:02,350
You didn't want this
from the very beginning.

982
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:07,188
You wanted to leave us from the start.
You wanted to be somewhere else.

983
01:32:10,816 --> 01:32:14,529
Did you know that your mother wanted
to leave us, even before the outbreak?

984
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:16,447
Francis, stop. Please.

985
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:17,823
You're leaving?

986
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:22,245
[Josh] Ma?

987
01:32:22,995 --> 01:32:25,540
What is he saying? Where are you going?

988
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:32,547
"I need to fix myself."
That's what you said, right?

989
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:36,467
When were you going to tell the kids?

990
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:40,596
That you plan to leave us.

991
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:43,266
When were you going to tell them?

992
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:45,851
Just say it.

993
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:48,729
Don't lie straight to their faces.

994
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:58,656
[inhales] I was going to tell you.

995
01:32:58,739 --> 01:32:59,615
[cries]

996
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:02,952
I was going to say goodbye.

997
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,454
But why are you leaving?

998
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:07,707
[Iris cries]

999
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:10,960
It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

1000
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,880
Mm. It's not you.

1001
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:17,216
[cries]

1002
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:20,553
I just wasn't happy. [sobs]

1003
01:33:21,637 --> 01:33:22,471
I'm…

1004
01:33:24,056 --> 01:33:25,433
I'm not okay.

1005
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:27,101
I'm tired.

1006
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:36,819
I just wish…

1007
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:39,196
I don't know.

1008
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,700
I wanted to start again.

1009
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:47,872
I wanted to be a good person

1010
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:51,375
so I could be a better mother
to both of you.

1011
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:52,293
[cries]

1012
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,217
The truth, Iris.

1013
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:06,432
Tell us the real reason
why you wanted to leave.

1014
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:09,769
[breathes shakily]

1015
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:17,193
[inhales] You know, boys,
your mother is a liar.

1016
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:19,528
Just ask her.

1017
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:23,240
Come on. Just ask her what she did before.

1018
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:27,912
Francis, what happened before
has nothing to do with our problem now.

1019
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,038
Oh, is that right?

1020
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:33,959
Francis, I want to save you
and Joshua and Lukie!

1021
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:36,337
I want to go outside
because I want to find help!

1022
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,254
Don't you understand?

1023
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,382
Help! But from whom?

1024
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:41,384
[Iris cries]

1025
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:42,635
He's dead!

1026
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:45,304
He's gone.

1027
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,390
[unsettling music playing]

1028
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:54,063
She wants to leave
because she wants to find someone.

1029
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:55,564
Tell them who it is.

1030
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:57,274
Go on, say it, God damn it!

1031
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,776
Don't talk to Mom like that!

1032
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:00,611
You just shut up, you fucking bastard!

1033
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,029
Stop it, now! Stop it!

1034
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:03,948
[cries]

1035
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:07,159
I wanted to leave you!
Don't you understand?

1036
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:12,248
I wanted to leave because I couldn't take
the two of us together anymore.

1037
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:13,791
Huh?

1038
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,752
Can we just stop pretending?

1039
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,965
Please? Stop this!

1040
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:25,010
Please don't do this to the children.

1041
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:26,721
[cries]

1042
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:31,767
Just give me the map.

1043
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:44,989
Francis!

1044
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:06,761
This it?

1045
01:36:13,642 --> 01:36:15,311
[ominous music playing]

1046
01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:16,520
Francis…

1047
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:18,856
Francis.

1048
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,066
Francis, what…

1049
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:23,194
Francis, what are you doing?
Don't do that!

1050
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:25,988
Give it to me!
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1051
01:36:26,071 --> 01:36:27,865
Francis, what's wrong with you?

1052
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:29,492
What the hell are you doing? [grunts]

1053
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:32,328
Give it to me! Let it go!
It's our only chance!

1054
01:36:32,411 --> 01:36:34,371
Damn you! Damn you to hell!

1055
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,457

[ominous music continues]

1057
01:37:14,703 --> 01:37:15,538
Eat.

parents found out,

01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:20,769
they were…

1063
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,314
they were angry."

1064
01:38:39,204 --> 01:38:40,289
Lucas…

1065
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:44,543
Are you practicing how to read?

1066
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:45,461
Mm… Yeah.

1067
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,133
So how does the story end?

1068
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:57,556
I just want to know
what's going to happen.

1069
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:02,603
Can I join you?

1070

[floor creaks]

1071
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:27,544
[Iris] May I?

1072
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:35,552
[inhales] "When the boy's parents
found out what he did,

1073
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,931
they were very angry."

[somber music playing]

1075
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:48,565
Do you know why
his parents were angry with him?

1076
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:53,570
Because they found out he was lying.

1077
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,701
He lied and said he was attacked by a wolf

1078
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:03,038
because he wanted his parents
and the people in the village…

1079
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:05,916
He… he wanted them to help him.

1080
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:09,378
Why? Why did he lie to them?

1081
01:40:13,716 --> 01:40:14,550
Maybe

1082
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:17,261
he just wanted attention.

1083
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:22,433
Maybe he thought

1084
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:25,561
his parents didn't love him anymore.

1085
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:28,814
Maybe that's why he did it.

1086
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:33,736
Or maybe the boy is a bad person.

1087
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:40,409
You know…

1088
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:45,247
I think I might know a boy like that.

[laughs]

1090
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:51,837
He even looks like you!

And has your smile.

Hm.

1095
01:40:59,845 --> 01:41:00,679
Look at that.

There are still so many of them.

They're all around us.

Where?

1109
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:34,523
It's been weeks.

1112
01:42:40,028 --> 01:42:42,156
Why? What else are you looking for?

1113
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:43,991
Huh?

1114
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:48,287
[inhales] He can't get in here.

1115
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:50,038
Ever.

1116
01:42:50,122 --> 01:42:51,248
Bullshit. Rubbish.

1117
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:52,833
[sighs]

1118
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:54,918

-[chains clink]

1120
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:57,254
What did you say?

1121
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:01,133
I said that's bullshit.

1122
01:43:01,216 --> 01:43:03,218
-Joshua, stop it.
-[Francis breathes heavily] No.

1123
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:05,512
Let him.

1124
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,350
You don't have to do this. Okay?

1125
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,811
Why? What are you going to do?

1126
01:43:13,812 --> 01:43:16,523
[breathes shakily] Are you going
to let them all come in?

1127
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:19,026
Who's "them"? What are you taking about?

1128
01:43:19,109 --> 01:43:21,028
We don't see them outside anymore.

1129
01:43:21,111 --> 01:43:22,487
You just want to keep us here!

1130
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,282
You… you son of a… of a bitch.

1131
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:28,785
That's why we don't have the van
and why you destroyed the map

1132
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,037
and why you locked the house.

1133
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,039
Because you don't care
about what's out there!

1134
01:43:32,122 --> 01:43:33,332
Just… just shut up! Shut up!

1135
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:37,085
You just want to lock us up
like your parents used to lock you up!

1136
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:39,379
-You fucking snitch!
-Francis, don't!

1137
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:41,298
You s… son of a bitch!

1138
01:43:44,426 --> 01:43:45,427
Fuck.

1139
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:48,096
You can't even listen properly.

1140
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:49,681
A little shit. Huh?

1141
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:53,852
Listen. They're j… j… just…

1142
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:55,562
[breathes shakily]

1143
01:43:57,314 --> 01:44:00,817
E… everything I did, I did it all for you!

1144
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:03,403
I… I… I wanted to keep you safe!

1145
01:44:04,446 --> 01:44:05,739
So just stay inside.

1146
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:07,866
Just stay inside!

1147
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,409
[knocking on door]

1148
01:44:11,954 --> 01:44:14,164
[man] Hello? [knocks on door]

1149
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:15,374
Anyone?

1150
01:44:15,457 --> 01:44:17,167
-[Francis shouting] Who's there?
-Josh! Josh!

1151
01:44:17,876 --> 01:44:19,461
[man] Sir, please help me.

1152
01:44:19,544 --> 01:44:20,921
My name is Corcuera.

1153
01:44:21,004 --> 01:44:23,966
I'm a soldier, sir. Please,
I beg for your help. [knocks on door]

1154
01:44:24,049 --> 01:44:25,092
There's no help here!

1155
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:26,969
[man] Sir, I'm begging you.

1156
01:44:27,052 --> 01:44:30,055
Even just a little water
or something to eat. Sir, I beg you.

1157
01:44:30,138 --> 01:44:31,682
Go away, I have a gun!

1158
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:35,310
[man] Sir, I beg you.
I have nowhere else to go, sir.

1159
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:37,813
Please, sir. [knocks on door]

1160
01:44:37,896 --> 01:44:39,273
Sir, I'm a soldier.

1161
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:40,649
I won't say it again.

1162
01:44:43,568 --> 01:44:44,403
One…

1163
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:48,865
-Two!
-[man] Sir, please, I beg…

1164
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:50,367
Josh!

1165
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:51,451
What are you doing?

1166
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:53,829
-[groans]
-Move!

1167
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:57,124
Sir, I wasn't bitten.
Please sir, I wasn't bitten.

1168
01:44:57,207 --> 01:44:59,543
Sir, I'm human. I'm human.

1169
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:00,752
No bites on me, sir.

1170
01:45:00,836 --> 01:45:02,754
-The blood is from my wound.
-[Iris] Don't!

1171
01:45:02,838 --> 01:45:04,339
-[Francis] Iris!
-It's just a wound.

1172
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:06,174
[Iris] When did this happen?

1173
01:45:06,258 --> 01:45:07,342
It was yesterday.

1174
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:11,680
Stay with me and talk to me.
Where are you from?

1175
01:45:12,931 --> 01:45:14,308
From Delta… Delta Camp.

1176
01:45:15,559 --> 01:45:17,352
That's it. That's the camp.

1177
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:23,400
[whispering] Okay.

1178
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:26,611
Um… Where is it?

1179
01:45:27,863 --> 01:45:31,033
It's about half a day…
about half a day's drive.

1180
01:45:32,701 --> 01:45:36,872
My unit went to the city
to look for some supplies for Delta.

1181
01:45:36,955 --> 01:45:37,956
[breathes shakily]

1182
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:40,834
Then on the way back…

1183
01:45:42,127 --> 01:45:43,086
[cries]

1184
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:45,213
we were attacked by those…

1185
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:48,467
All of my friends, they're dead.

1186
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:51,928
They're all dead
and I'm the only one left.

1187
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:52,929
[cries]

1188
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:53,889
I was right.

1189
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:56,183
They're everywhere.

1190
01:45:57,559 --> 01:46:00,729
No. No, sir.
It depends upon where you are going.

1191
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:04,232
There's hardly any of them
between here and Delta Camp.

1192
01:46:12,115 --> 01:46:16,411
I'm sure I'd be dead
if it wasn't for the man who helped me.

1193
01:46:17,537 --> 01:46:19,539
[breathes shakily]

1194
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:21,166
What man?

1195
01:46:21,249 --> 01:46:22,834
[Corcuera groans]

1196
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:24,795
I don't know him, ma'am.

1197
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:27,547
I didn't get his name, but…

1198
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:31,635
He told me to run this way.

1199
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:34,805
To run in this direction until…

1200
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:38,433
until I saw your house.

1201
01:46:41,978 --> 01:46:43,313
This man, what happened to him?

1202
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:50,946
I don't know, ma'am. When I looked back,

1203
01:46:52,614 --> 01:46:54,616
he was already being attacked.

1204
01:46:56,618 --> 01:46:59,704
I… I didn't see much.
It all happened so fast.

1205
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:01,957
I'm sorry, ma'am. So sorry.

1206
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:03,417
Sorry.

1207
01:47:06,461 --> 01:47:07,504
You lied.

1208
01:47:09,339 --> 01:47:10,215
So did you.

1209
01:47:13,468 --> 01:47:14,511
Let him go.

1210
01:47:16,721 --> 01:47:17,639
We can't help him.

1211
01:47:18,515 --> 01:47:19,349
No.

1212
01:47:21,893 --> 01:47:22,727
Papa…

1213
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:25,272
Let's help the man.

1214
01:47:33,071 --> 01:47:34,114
[Francis] On one condition.

1215
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:37,033
[door creaks]

1216
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,747
Francis, he's not infected.

1217
01:47:43,248 --> 01:47:44,541
We'll find out tomorrow.

1218
01:47:54,342 --> 01:47:56,344
[somber music playing]

1219
01:48:10,901 --> 01:48:12,235
Josh, son…

1220
01:48:12,944 --> 01:48:13,778
What is it?

1221
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:15,822
I'm leaving.

1222
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,034
Huh?

1223
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:23,580
Joshua, wait a minute… You can't.

1224
01:48:25,373 --> 01:48:27,000
I'll look for Uncle Diego.

1225
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:29,336
I know he can help us.

1226
01:48:29,419 --> 01:48:31,963
But didn't you hear what Corcuera said?

1227
01:48:34,132 --> 01:48:36,676
Uncle Diego may not have survived.

1228
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:44,184
I still want to try.

1229
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:50,774
[cries]

1230
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:53,318
I can't take it anymore.

1231
01:48:56,655 --> 01:48:58,490
I can't stand Dad anymore.

1232
01:49:04,746 --> 01:49:06,623
He doesn't even see me.

1233
01:49:20,053 --> 01:49:21,096
It's because…

1234
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:31,731
[sighs]

1235
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:36,027
[inhales] Because he's not my real father.

1236
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:44,661
I know.

1237
01:49:49,749 --> 01:49:51,126
But he's still my dad.

1238
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:54,045
I just wish he'd realize it.

1239
01:49:57,465 --> 01:49:59,050
But he's still not okay.

1240
01:50:01,219 --> 01:50:02,304
He needs help.

1241
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,516
So let's get out of here.

1242
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:15,817
Josh, I can't leave
your brother here alone.

1243
01:50:27,704 --> 01:50:29,039
Then please tell Lucas…

1244
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:32,083
to be brave.

Thank you.

Good morning, sir.

1253
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:47,283
You're still alive.

1254
01:51:57,001 --> 01:51:57,836
Where's Joshua?

1255
01:52:03,758 --> 01:52:04,592
Lukie?

1256
01:52:06,845 --> 01:52:08,054
