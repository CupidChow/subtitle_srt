Legend has it that Qingyin Parlor

29
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,800
sits quietly

30
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,750
in a hidden valley.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,800
Only women

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,030
are allowed to enter.

33
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,000
If a man barges in,

34
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,840
he will vanish without a trace,

35
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,030

Are you sure

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,280
about that?

39
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,470
Many

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,800
arrogant individuals in this world

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,120
do not believe in this legend.

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
They think Qingyin Parlor

43
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,960
is just a place that houses intimate pleasures.

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,430
They enter without a care.

45
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,800
But once they go inside,

46
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,470
it's as if they disappeared.

Just speak frankly.

When I found out,

116
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,200
he kicked me out of the residence.

117
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,840
He is also an abusive drunkard.

118
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,120
He hits me when he's drunk.

119
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
He is also a gambler.

120
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,510
He gambled away the family fortune,

121
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,910
and even tried to kill me

122
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,750

If you won't show yourself,

136
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,550
I'll have to stop playing nice.

So smooth and tender.

140
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,200
But your skin

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,270
is a bit rough.

142
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,600
You must have been ill-treated.

143
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,360
Don't worry.

144
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,270
This place is blessed by the Divine Maiden.

145
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,510
You are safe here.

148
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,790
A blessing by the Divine Maiden

149
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,670
is like being reborn.

stay here,

156
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,120
just bring a lantern to the Divine Maiden

157
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,320
at the Divine Maiden Shrine at the hour of Zi.

158
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,000
Then, you'll receive her blessing.

At midnight,

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
we will bring you two to the shrine

163

to receive the Divine Maiden's blessing.

164
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,150
See?

165
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,510
I told you this trick would work.

166
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,360
As expected of someone who wants to be part of Baixiao Hall.

167
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,000
I wonder if Lei Lingze is okay now.

We'll wait and see.

169
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,550
Take him down.

170
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,360
You won't be able to escape now.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,670
Many men have tried to barge in.

172
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,670
They thought they were powerful enough

173
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,200
to subjugate us.

174
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,910
Don't come near me.

175
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,750
But we have a way to deal with them.

176
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,390
This

177
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,120
is the Gender Transformation Pill.

178
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,630
Once taken, even the toughest man

179
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,790
will turn into an alluring woman.

180
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,240
Just kill me.

181
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,390
Do not humiliate me.

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,600
I will not take it.

183
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,670
Don't be scared.

184
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,360
Being a woman

185
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,000
is much better than being a stinky man.

186
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,960
Once you're a woman,

187
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,030
you can stay in Qingyin Parlor

188
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,550
and worship the Divine Maiden forever.

189
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,510
It is an honor.

190
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,320
No!

191
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:14,960
- No! - Be nice.

192
