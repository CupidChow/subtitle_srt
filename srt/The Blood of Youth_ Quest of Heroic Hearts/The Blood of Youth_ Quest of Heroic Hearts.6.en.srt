00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,980
[Episode 6]

28
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,720
My friend,

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,920
what is this place?

30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
Hush, miss.

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,000
If the superintendent hears us,

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,200
we'll be beaten up.

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,080
Exactly.

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
You speak like that?

35
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,400
I am not a miss.

36
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm a man.

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000
You must be new here.

38
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,680
While we

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
have the body of a man,

40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,480
we're actually

41
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,200
women.

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,440
Don't say such outrageous things

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
or you might get us into trouble.

44
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,080
You took the Gender Transformation Pill?

45
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
Yes.

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
It won't turn a man into a woman.

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,400
It just makes you very weak,

48
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,040
like you're a woman

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,360
who is being starved.

50
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,960
Every month, the poison will act up

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,040
for a few days,

52
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
giving us an excruciating

53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,560
abdominal pain.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,640
Lie down now.

55
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,800
You have to work later.

56
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,520
That's right.

57
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,280
People in this chamber

58
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,920
are chefs.

59
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
When we wake up,

60
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,920
we must chop wood, gather fruits,

61
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,680
and feed the animals.

62
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,560
If

63
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
we didn't boil the water for the Red Maiden in time,

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,040
we...

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,240
We'll be caned!

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,600
Stop it!

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,760
Wait.

68
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,400
You just accept this fate?

69
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,240
Listen.

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,800
Let's devise a plan.

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,240
I'll bring you with me.

72
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,960
Don't say those things.

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,760
If they think we're still longing

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,760
for the wonderful world outside,

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,440
then

76
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,240
we

77
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,280
will be caged and drowned.

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,320
I can't deal with your nonsense.

79
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,920
Hush!

80
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,920
Hurry up!

81
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,360
To live in Qingyin Parlor,

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
you must make use of your hands.

83
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,000
Why do I even keep you here?

84
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,160
You can't even do your work properly.

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,960
Don't even think about slacking off.

86
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,280
You're lucky that we're feeding

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,520
you here.

88
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,680
You there.

89
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,800
Wipe off the water already.

90
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,760
When will the Red Maiden

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,040
give us a man?

92
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,600
Such favor will never befall us.

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,960
The security is tight. How can I escape?

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,200
Is the woman in this portrait

95
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,520
the Divine Maiden they're talking about?

96
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,480
Who is the little girl?

97
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,480
Who is the one who saved me?

98
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
Are you okay?

99
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,440
I feel

100
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,880
weak.

101
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,280
And I have a headache.

102
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,960
My strength is completely drained.

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,920
Perhaps it's because of the liquor?

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,720
No way.

105
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,120
I

106
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,200
feel energetic

107
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,240
and robust.

108
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Of course.

109
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,840
The liquor

110
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,040
contains the Gender Transformation Pill.

111
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
If a woman drinks it,

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
she'll feel revitalized.

113
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,560
If a man drinks it,

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,720
he'll be greatly weakened.

115
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,160
You think you could fool me?

116
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,040
The moment you set foot in here,

117
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,080
I knew you were a man right away.

118
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,760
Capture this lowly being.

119
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,280
Send him to the courtyard.

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,560
Impossible.

121
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,080
There's no way she's a man.

122
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,320
How can it be?

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,400
You're a woman.

124
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,720
Yet you worked with a man to deceive me.

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,840
I didn't know.

126
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,120
He lied to me as well.

127
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,680
I didn't know he was a man.

128
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,080
I trust you for now.

129
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,880
But decide for yourself

130
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,280
if you want

131
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
to stay in this parlor or not.

132
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,560
Go inside.

133
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,280
I didn't say anything.

134
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,880
Nothing.

135
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,360
Weigui.

136
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,480
I didn't say anything.

137
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,000
You've been captured as well.

138
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
Who is she?

139
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,440
A newcomer.

140
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
How do you feel?

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,800
I feel

142
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,920
weak.

143
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,240
I have no strength left.

144
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,160
Did you take the Gender Transformation Pill as well?

145
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,000
We're done for.

146
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,640
We're done for.

147
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,320
You can't

148
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,600
be my sidekick anymore.

149
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,720
Only side chick.

150
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,880
Oh.

151
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,920
Wasn't Hua Xiaohua with you?

152
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,800
Where is she?

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,880
Oh, no!

154
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,720
Oh, no!

155
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,120
The Divine Maiden Shrine is on fire.

156
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,680
What?

157
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,480
All Red Maidens must head to the shrine to put out the fire now.

158
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,560
Let's go.

159
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,080
Let's go.

160
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
Quick.

161
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,000
Hua Xiaohua.

162
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,080
You've been captured as well?

163
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
No, I'm here to save you.

164
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,800
How did you get in?

165
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,920
I burned their Divine Maiden portrait.

166
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,720
She...

167
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
She burned the Divine Maiden portrait.

168
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,320
She's so mean!

169
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,200
Cage her and drown her.

170
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,840
I also found the Skysplitter fragment.

171
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,680
The Skysplitter fragment?

172
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,880
Then what are we waiting for?

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,640
Let's run.

174
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,040
Let's go.

175
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,920
Come.

176
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,720
Stop.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,880
I can't walk further.

178
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,280
Let's run.

179
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,880
Otherwise, she'll find out.

180
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,000
- We won't be able to escape. - I can't.

181
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,760
I can't.

182
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,960
I'm

183
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,280
too weak now.

184
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
Me too.

185
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,240
Xiaohua, you should run first.

186
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,080
Otherwise,

187
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,000
none of us will be able to escape.

188
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,080
None of you will leave this place.

189
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,760
You burned the Divine Maiden portrait

190
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,200
and stole the Skysplitter fragment.

191
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,160
Meet your demise!

192
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,120
Stop!

193
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
Divine Maiden!

194
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,760
Greetings, Divine Maiden.

195
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,160
Stand up.

196
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,320
I do not need your respect.

197
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Oh, the almighty Divine Maiden.

198
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,120
The Sun and the Moon bear witness

199
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,000
to the Red Maidens' loyalty.

200
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,960
We will follow you forever.

201
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,400
Should we betray you,

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
we'll be condemned to eternal death.

203
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,600
Should we betray you,

204
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,920
we'll be condemned to eternal death.

205
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,600
Enough.

206
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,320
I saved all of you

207
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,880
so that you can live a good life here.

208
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Instead, you turned this place into a living hell.

209
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,920
You delivered us from misery.

210
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,800
So we want to be like you

211
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,680
and deliver all women

212
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,640
from the confinement of men.

213
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,560
Are you saving womankind?

214
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,800
What difference is there

215
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,920
between you and the men you hate the most?

216
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
In Qingyin Parlor,

217
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,680
you are the men.

218
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,120
You bully because you are strong

219
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
and empowered.

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,040
You grow arrogant because of your privilege,

221
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,640
abusing others and thinking that's your right.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,040
Is this what you want?

223
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
How ridiculous.

224
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,400
If I knew this would happen,

225
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,800
why should I save you back then?

226
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,080
Divine Maiden.

227
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,200
We do repent.

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,360
You have the Skysplitter fragment?

229
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,440
Yes.

230
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
We chanced upon

231
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,400
the fragment previously.

232
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,600
But

233
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,480
they snatched it away.

234
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,640
Everyone wants the Skysplitter fragment.

235
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
What is their reason for going after

236
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,520
the fragment?

237
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,560
Forget it.

238
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,040
I will take away the fragment.

239
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,440
Release everyone here.

240
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,240
Do not stay here anymore.

241
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,440
Xiaohua.

242
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,120
Xiaohua.

243
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,200
Xiaohua.

244
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,800
Xiaohua.

245
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,800
How do you feel?

246
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,440
I can feel

247
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,000
my strong pulse.

248
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,160
I don't feel cold.

249
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,440
The Peach Wine

250
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
is a wonderful nourishment.

251
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,040
My skin is better too.

252
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,280
I wonder if she has more in stock.

253
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,800
I can take several bottles of them with me

254
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
to study their medicinal value.

255
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,960
No, thanks.

256
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,520
I won't even

257
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,360
be able to sleep well knowing those things are around me.

258
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,920
However,

259
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,800
I sense that my inner force

260
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,240
has returned.

261
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,800
The Divine Maiden must have

262
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,960
cured my ailment.

263
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,280
She's so sweet.

264
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
Why are you so happy, Lei?

265
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,520
Ye.

266
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,360
What brought you here?

267
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,680
I heard something major

268
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,920
happened in Qingyin Parlor yesterday.

269
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,440
I thought you must have been involved in it

270
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,280
so I came.

271
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,800
But it seems like

272
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,280
everyone has left.

273
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,720
Why are you dressed like this?

274
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,120
It's a long story.

275
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,960
We had quite a perilous journey.

276
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
We disguised ourselves,

277
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,560
got beaten up,

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,640
and was

279
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,040
poisoned.

280
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,400
Did you find the Skysplitter fragment then?

281
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,680
I did.

282
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,080
But I lost it.

283
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,480
I guess

284
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
the Red Maidens took it away.

285
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,560
Wei...

286
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,360
Where's Weigui?

287
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,600
Right.

288
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,000
Where's Weigui?

289
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,000
Weigui!

290
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,200
- Weigui. - Weigui.

291
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,440
Weigui!

292
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:37,960
Weigui!

293
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,680
Weigui!

294
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,880
Weigui!

295
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,280
Weigui!

296
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,120
Weigui!

297
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,560
Weigui!

298
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,800
Weigui!

299
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,080
He isn't here.

300
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,680
He must have gone out.

301
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,160
Let's head out to find him.

302
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,760
Wait.

303
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,200
Is this

304
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,280
what you're looking for?

305
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,640
The Skysplitter fragment.

306
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
I don't need it anyway.

307
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,160
You can have it.

308
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,480
But...

309
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,800
But this isn't right.

310
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,360
Thank you, Ye.

311
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,000
Let's look for Weigui.

312
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,720
Do you want to join us?

313
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,680
I'll stay and examine the place.

314
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,400
Just go.

315
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,400
Okay.

316
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,840
All right.

317
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,480
Let's go.

318
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,720
Let's go.

319
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,520
Xiaohua.

320
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,200
Take this.

321
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,840
I might lose it.

322
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,200
