Si!

Look at him.

30
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,120
Look at him.

You're quite smart.

The mastermind

50
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,150
is laying out

51
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,470
a huge trap,

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,470
waiting to collect our lives,

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,430
one after another.

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,560
We're not that important.

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,360
It seems like the culprit

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,840
is after the Skysplitter.

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,590
My guts tell me that the secret door is the exit.

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Should we take it?

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,910
Let's try.

60
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,830
It seems like

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
there are two temples.

62
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,480
One yin

63
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,390
and one yang.

64
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,430
The door is still sealed.

65
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,120
If this is a trap,

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,270
then naturally, you can't unlock the door from inside.

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,040
Let's search for any contraption.

68
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,310
It's you!

69
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,750
You despicable scoundrel.

70
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,430
You've been lying to me.

71
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,240
Everyone wants the Skysplitter.

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,750
And I shall start with the fragment you have.

73
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,510
So long as I breathe,

74
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,390
you shall never have

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,390
the fragment.

76
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,240
Where is it?

77
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,270
My friends.

78
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,680
How come you two

79
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,240
are fine?

80
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,270
Of course.

81
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,000
We

82
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,720
put up an act

83
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,800
to

84
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,750
lure you out.

85
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,720
It's the same place.

86
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,000
He's dead.

87
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,070
He was probably inflicted

88
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,750
with a cold toxin.

89
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,680
But

90
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,430
there is no snowman in this place.

91
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,630
How did he come into contact with the cold toxin?

92
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,270
We

93
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,680
have been misled.

94
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,630
Misled?

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,480
Look.

96
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,630
There's a wound here.

97
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,870
Someone nearby

98
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,750
pricked him with a needle.

99
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,750
If I'm not mistaken,

100
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,720
the creepy snowmen

101
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,830
are intended to be distractions.

102
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,680
The culprit

103
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,870
might

104
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,240
be among us.

105
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,000
You

106
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,830
sure are ruthless.

107
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,160
Instead of fighting, you opted for tricks.

108
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,270
You even killed your own

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
to get your hands on the fragments.

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,390
San!

111
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,510
San, are you okay?

112
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,600
No one on the other side

113
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
was spared, I bet.

114
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,000
I...

115
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,310
I don't want the fragment anymore.

116
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,510
I don't want the fragment anymore.

117
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,920
Let's talk.

118
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,480
Think about the bigger picture.

119
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,830
We can work together

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,270
and find a way out first.

121
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,560
You'll be in charge,

122
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,240
okay?

123
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,480
Despicable scum.

124
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
I might just kill you.

125
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,720
Try it if you dare.

126
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,670
I'll drag one of you with me.

127
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,670
One of us?

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,550
Weigui.

129
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,320
You're poisoned.

130
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,030
Give us the antidote.

131
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,030
I don't have the antidote.

132
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
That is mine.

133
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,910
Give it back.

134
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,630
Qin Aoxiong.

135
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,840
You're the descendant of a general.

136
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,440
Give it back.

137
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,790
Give it back!

138
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,480
A descendant of a prestigious clan.

139
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,270
Yet you

140
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,720
committed such an unscrupulous deed.

141
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,320
No!

142
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,630
My late father

143
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,080
gave it to me.

144
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,960
And you destroyed it!

145
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,790
What did I do

146
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,440
to deserve such a fate?

147
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,480
I hereby dictate His Majesty's

148
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,320
imperial decree.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,480
I have been working tirelessly to govern the nation.

150
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,120
Fortunately, you, Qin Su, my loyal minister,

151
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,000
with your exceptional bravery on the battlefield,

152
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,270
have killed

153
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,440
2,067 enemies.

154
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,150
This feat struck bandits with fear,

155
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,390
ensuring peace on the border.

156
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,510
The society feels safe, and the people

157
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,750
are protected because of you.

158
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,480
I am delighted to have you as my minister,

159
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,150
and thus, I bestow upon you this special gift

160
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,390
so that everyone will learn of your achievements.

161
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,840
Thank you,

162
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,790
Your Majesty.

163
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,550
General Qin.

164
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,150
This is

165
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,360
a gift from His Majesty.

166
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,840
It is the rarest gift

167
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,390
in this world.

168
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,750
Open it and take a look.

169
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,480
What...

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,910
What is the meaning of this?

171
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,670
There is no gift.

172
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,750
Your death is the gift.

173
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,670
Rare gift?

174
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,670
His Majesty is fearful of the descendants of the prestigious clans

175
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,080
like me.

176
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,360
So he poisoned us.

177
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
I am not long for this world

178
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,080
because of the cold toxin.

179
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,550
No matter how hard I practice, my martial arts skills will not progress.

180
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,270
So I can only find the Skysplitter

181
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,240
to avenge my late father.

182
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,630
You are the son of a loyal general.

183
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,480
Hand over the antidote

184
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,200
and we will spare you.

185
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,870
He has taken many lives.

186
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,270
We have no right to pardon him on behalf of the innocent.

187
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,910
If I can never get the Skysplitter,

188
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,630
there's no reason for me to live.

189
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,440
Father.

190
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,030
I have done my best.

191
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,270
Oh, no.

192
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,390
He's dead.

193
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,510
Your cold toxin...

194
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,870
Weigui.

195
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,390
Weigui.

196
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,270
Weigui.

197
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,270
If I hadn't been training with cold qi since I was little,

198
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,550
I would've been dead like them.

199
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,200
I'm not strong enough.

200
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,390
I can only suppress the cold toxin in you momentarily.

201
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,750
Right now, we must

202
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,320
look for an antidote.

203
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,390
But we can't even get out of here.

204
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,720
Is anyone out there?

205
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,870
I am Lei Lingze

the Skysplitter fragment.

209
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,120
As you already know,

210
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,720
when the Skysplitter appears,

211
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,000
the world will be upended.

212
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,720

213
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
come here and take it.

214
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,390
Stop shouting.

215
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,630
Are you trying to make sure

216
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,840
you'll die once you get out?

you are my sidekick,

I must protect you.

Even if I'll die,

223
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,910
I'll make sure you'll get out of here.

224
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,790
I just arrived here and I overheard

225
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,630
the declaration of such strong camaraderie.

226
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,600
How touching.

227

My friend.

228
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,750
Is there a contraption out there

229
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,000
that can unlock this door?

230
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,870

Thank you for helping us.

Weigui?

00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,270
About the Skysplitter fragment...

247
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,240
About the Skysplitter fragment...

248
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
The Skysplitter fragment

249
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,000
is a lie he made up

250
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,390
to escape.

251
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,670
He doesn't have it.

252
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,200
But we'll try

253
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,320
to give you whatever you want.

254
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,390
It's okay.

255
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,870
I wasn't expecting any reward

256
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,240
from saving you two.

257
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,840
Consider yourself lucky that I'm feeling

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,790
kind today.

259
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,960
Besides,

260
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,270
Weigui is afflicted with the cold toxin.

261
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,870
You should get him treated.

262
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,750
Okay.

263
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,150
May we meet again.

I'm acting under the orders of the Sect Leader of Tianwaitian.

269
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,360
I was told that the sect leader was a woman,

270
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,600
and that she was a rare martial arts prodigy.

271
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,670
At the age of 18,

272
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,720
she attained the Unfettered Celestial Stage.
