Careful.

193
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,870
It turns dark suddenly.

194
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,870
Is it going to rain soon?

195
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,950
Whatever it is,

196
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,830
let's find

197
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,560
the herbs first

198
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,160
to save Weigui.

199
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,920
Did you notice?

200
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,800
This place is different from before.

201
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,510
There are many lanterns too.

202
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,430
Also,

203
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,630
did you realize?

204
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
The villagers are all gone.

205
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,120
It's empty now.

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,120
Right?

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Where did they go?

208
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,680
They are over there.

209
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,430
Why do they

210
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,000
look so pale?

211
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,480
What are you doing there?

212
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,600
Run!

213
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,240
Run, Hua Xiaohua! Run!

214
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,670
Hua Xiaohua!

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,870
Run!

216
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,790
Why aren't they chasing after me?

217
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,670
Don't make any noise.

218
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,390
Save Weigui.

219
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,510
I'll lure them away.

220
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,200
Help!

221
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,440
Help!

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,670
How come

223
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,600
it turns dark so soon?

224
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,480
You see,

225
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,030
this village

226
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,550
is surrounded by mountains.

227
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,750
Days and nights are irregular here.

228
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,270
We're used to it.

229
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,480
Is the bird related to the irregular

230
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,840
days and nights here?

231
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,150
Just stay here

232
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,360
and have some medicinal tea.

233
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,550
He is limping on his other leg now.

234
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,600
Thank you.

235
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,840
The tea is...

236
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,600
Quit struggling.

237
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,790
I added

238
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,390
weakening powder in the tea.

239
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,150
It makes my life easier.

240
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,150
Who are you?

241
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,030
What do you want?

242
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,630
Who I am doesn't matter.

243
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,670
What you

244
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,270
and your friend have

245
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,440
matter a lot.

246
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,480
My friends

247
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,440
will return soon.

248
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,870
You should be afraid.

249
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,670
They can't even save themselves,

250
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,200
let alone you.

251
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,320
Stop chasing me

252
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,200
or I won't play nice anymore.

253
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,240
Help!

254
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,630
No Skysplitter fragment.

255
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,000
Then you

256
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
shall be my thrall.

257
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,790
Ye.

258
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,960
How come you're here?

259
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,120
I knew you'd be in danger.

260
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,960
Ye, save me!

261
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,320
Stay further back.

262
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,200
Watch me.

263
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,440
Ye.

264
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,360
Be gentle.

265
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,670
Don't kill them.

266
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,840
All right.

267
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,550
I can't believe

268
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,120
you're that strong.

269
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,200
Let's go.

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,670
Ye.

271
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,510
What do you think is wrong with the villagers?

272
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,030
I think

273
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,000
they are being controlled.

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,120
Is Weigui in danger then?

275
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:24,460
