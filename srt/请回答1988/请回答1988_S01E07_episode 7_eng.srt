00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,360
Where have you been?

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,830
Somewhere in the countryside...

4
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,010
With those clothes on?

5
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,910
I know. It was freezing.

6
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,860
Why? Did something happen? What are you doing here?

7
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,210
I was waiting for you.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,630
Me?

9
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,110
Why?

10
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,940
Because I had something to say to you.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,850
Say it.

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,720
- I really will. 
 - Yeah, say it.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,730
I like you.

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,110
I said, I like you.

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,630
I like you, too.

16
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,080
You know that I'm not joking.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,010
I'm being sincere.

18
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,720
I have a boyfriend.

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,000
I know.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,990
And I have never thought of you as a man.

21
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,660
Yes, I know.

22
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,120
Why would you tell me this, making things awkward!

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,660
Do you worry about me?

24
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,460
No.

25
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,780
It's your choice for liking me, but I clearly told you my answer.

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,170
Yes, don't mind me.

27
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,150
Of course, I don't mind about you. Why would I?

28
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,460
Don't try to mess with me, you little punk!

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,430
Forget it. Stop. I'm tired. I'm going.

30
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,620
I really don't want to get involved with you for this kind of thing.

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,100
What happened today stays between us, okay?

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,940
Let's bury it forever, okay.

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,880
Thanks.

♫   The sound of an early morning bell    ♫

35

36
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,660
♫   My love always    ♫

 Episode 7: To You 

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,080
 Christmas Eve D-7 

40
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,150
We will now begin

41
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,500
the first Manito game.

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,140
Wow!

43
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,800
What are we doing?

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,780
Manito... Let's do Manito...

45
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,200
What is this?!

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,350
 What do you mean, Manito? 

47
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,540
 Why would we play the manito game? 

48
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,860
Hey, Bo Ra!

49
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,610
What's up? Why did you call me?

50
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,470
 You're here. 

51
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,390
So annoying.

52
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,930
Since everyone's here now,

53
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,460
we will begin the manito game.

54
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,300
What?! What are we doing? Manito?

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,460
Bo Ra... Please lower your voice just a little bit.

56
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,530
My heart...

57
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,460
So you called me for this, when I'm so busy?

58
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,810
Hyung, I have to go to Kiwon as well.

59
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,720
Oh Taek. Wait a moment, I'm almost done.

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,910
Why not? I think it'll be fun. Hyung, let's do it!

61
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,240
Thanks, No Eul.

62
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,630
Okay, since everyone is busy,

63
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,890
we will quickly proceed with this. Everyone, please pick one.

64
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,920
Pick out one.

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,990
The name that you picked

66
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,840
becomes your manito.

67
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,050
You have one week, so until  Christmas eve

68
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,730
You can just secretly be good to the manito that's written there.

69
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,560
Presents are the foundation.

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,800
Hey, why is your hyung suddenly doing this?

71
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,840
He is collecting LPs these days.

72
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,250
For the presents,

73
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,620
you can keep an eye on your manito to learn what kind of gift he or she wants,

74
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,700
and give it to him on the last day.

75
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,690
For your information, just for  your  information, in my case,

76
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,750
if you happen  to pick my name,

77
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,760
I really wanted the LP of the 4th College Music Festival,

78
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,510
but there was just no way for me to get it...

79
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,130
What do I do?

80
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,780
He is collecting College Music Festival LPs, but only the 4th one is missing.

81
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,190
But you guys are rich.

82
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,650
Mom said that if he bought one more, she'd kill him.

83
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,100
Until the test results come out, he's not getting any allowance. He's poor.

84
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,530
Okay everyone, let's focus.

85
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,380
Everyone knows about the manito game rule, right?

86
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,130
Manito is also known as a "secret friend."

87
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,970
You cannot tell others about your manito.

88
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,070
Hyung, I'll buy you that LP.

89
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,520
I got your name.

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,500
What?

91
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,530
What is this? I got Kim Jeong Bong as well.

92
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,750
Me too.

93
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,850
Kim Jeong Bong what is this?

94
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,600
Oh, oh this...

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,210
Give me them.

96
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,860
Here. Oh my...

97
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,030
That was a simple exercise.

98
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,710
Now the practice round is over.

99
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,750
I might just cut off your wrist, Oppa. Huh?!

100
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm going. What am I doing here with the kids?

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,690
But Hyung Jeong Bong tried hard to prepare this. At least pick the name and go.

102
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,840
Jerk.

103
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,070
I'll get going. I'm sorry.

104
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,070
Yeah, Hyung. Let's let him go. He stayed long enough.

105
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,500
Okay. Goodbye, Taek.

106
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,920
- Goodbye, Master Choi. 
 - Bye. 
 - Bye, Taek.

107
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,330
Now...

108
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,350
What happens if they pick each other?

109
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,850
Then they can do well for each other. Like a destiny.

110
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,170
Marry!

111
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,520
Marry! Get married!

112
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,610
Get married!

113
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,150
What if you pick your own name?

114
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,660
If that happens then it's still fated, so marry yourself!

115
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,310
Get married! 
  (Dong Ryeong) 

116
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,610
There's no way that would happen, we're with many people here.

117
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,040
That's it right, everything's finished? I'm also leaving.

118
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,300
Bo Ra, it's on Christmas Eve!

119
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,290
- You have one week left! 
 - I know!

120
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,950
Hey!

121
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,520
Hey, hey, why? What's wrong!

122
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,840
What are you doing? 
  Bo Ra 

123
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,210
You are seriously a jerk!

124
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,350
 Seon Woo 

125
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,870
What are you doing?

126
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,660
They're having community meeting at my house. Hearing them sing, I think they're almost done.

127
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,890
Let's go to Taek's room and eat some ramyun. I also have something to tell you.

128
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,920
To me?

129
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,920
Why are they having those meetings anyway? They see and talk to each other about everything every day.

130
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,360
I know, right? Everyone's super serious. They must be making decisions about something really important.

131
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,110
Is there nothing?

132
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,430
If there aren't any more opinions, let's do it with note.

133
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,470
That's good. Note, note. Then let's please end the meeting.

134
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:06,930
Wait, wait. Then for this this Christmas's present for our kids is note, note, note. Okay?

135
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:15,950
Excuse me. Instead of note how about notebook?

136
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,790
I'm sorry, he isn't well.

137
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,310
Yes... He says weird stuff after eating expensive food.

138
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,670
Whether it is a note or a notebook, I will buy it.

139
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,550
Then, let's end this month's meeting. No more to say, right?

140
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,090
No!

141
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,270
Next month, we will do it in our Ice Hyung's house.

142
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,330
- Yes! 
  - That's the end! 

143
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,830
Good, good! Why do you do a meeting for three hours?

144
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,950
Excuse me, I have something to say.

145
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,350
Ah really Seon Yeong, let's stop this now and just go home.

146
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,170
Hey, can't you see him sleeping?

147
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,290
So last year,

148
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,270
who told my Jin Joo that Santa Claus doesn't exist?

149
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:10,310
Who is it? Who said to a growing child that Santa doesn't exist?

150
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,890
What do you mean "who"? It's their eldest daughter.

151
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,370
  Animal Cookie Set 

152
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,950
  1 year ago 

153
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,190
Some for me? Just one.

154
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,250
I can't! Santa Claus gave it to me!

155
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,210
Jin Joo, your Mom gave it to you.

156
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,350
There's no such thing as Santa Claus in this world.

157
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,990
Anyway, does that temper go anywhere? I forgot.

158
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:16,910
But still children forget things fast. We will buy a Christmas present for Jin Joo.

159
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,210
Wake her up, hit her.

160
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,870
Jin Joo, Jin Joo!

161
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,090
Excuse me, Jin Joo. For this Christmas,

162
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:36,590
what present do you want from Santa. Then I will tell him. What is it?

163
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,170
Santa Claus doesn't exist!

164
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,980
He doesn't exist...

165
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,190
Should we watch a video after eating ramyun?

166
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,270
"Die Hard" is out.

167
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,590
I'm going to go to the library. I have to finish physics by today.

168
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,130
You chose to do that. Do it tomorrow.

169
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,850
Tomorrow I have to do world history and promised to play with Jin Joo at night.

170
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,490
Eat.

171
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,910
Seeing you like this you're a total model student. Shady bastard.

172
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,890
What? Why are you picking up a fight again?

173
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,690
You like Noona  Bo Ra, right?

174
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,370
I heard it coincidentally.

175
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,640
Really?

176
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,570
When?

177
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,810
The day it snowed. Behind the gate.

178
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,510
It's a secret.

179
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:49,350
Of course, I won't tell anyone about it. I was sure you liked Deok Seon.

180
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,470
Why were you sure about that?

181
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,810
Deok Seon is prettier.

182
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,450
What?

183
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,910
She's the prettiest among the ugly girls.

184
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,330
What are you saying, is she pretty or ugly?

185
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,790
She's ugly of course!

186
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,410
But the meeting probably ended now, right?

187
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,050
The kids only believe if they get presents under their pillow.

188
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,590
So just, Bo Ra's dad, buy a present for Jin Joo and put it under her pillow.

189
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:35,590
Jin Joo, what do you want as a present for Christmas?

190
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,370
Ahjumma and Ahjussi will buy it for you.

191
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,190
Tell us, I'll buy it for you. What do you want?

192
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,810
A snowman.

193
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,250
That's easy, easy, easy.

194
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,870
Oh my Jin Joo, you want a snowman? What do we do?

195
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,390
You can get a snowman if Santa Claus really exists.

196
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,690
Who will buy you a snowman?

197
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:03,310
That's right. That's right. You can't buy a snowman. Only Santa Claus can get it.

198
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,610
So Jin Joo, this Christmas, I will ask Santa Claus

199
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,770
and get you a snowman.

200
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,370
She's happy.

201
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:21,350
But on that day— Jin Joo, Oppa Jeong Bong has red bean bread.

202
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,090
So go and ask him for red bean bread.

203
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,150
Red bean bread?

204
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,790
But what do we do if it doesn't snow that day. How do we make a snowman?

205
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,310
Oh, what do we do? We didn't think about that.

206
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:43,070
It will snow. It will snow on 23rd, 24th in Seoul. It says here.

207
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,910
That's it, that's it!

208
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,510
Then that's it. We don't need to worry. Once it snows, it won't be too much work to make a snowman.

209
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,070
Then... it's all set? Let's get up.

210
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,570
If we have a community meeting twice then we will all die.

211
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,170
Hey, wake up.

212
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,950
That person... he's so lucky to be able to sleep in someone else's house like that.

213
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,370
It's because he wakes up at dawn to feed Taek. Anyway, let's all meet on Christmas Eve.

214
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,050
Boss from the Ice house, Do Ryong Nyong's Father should also come. The more people the better.

215
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,370
Let us. Let's meet then. All we have left is time. I will be going first.

216
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,290
- Goodbye. 
 - I'm going.

217
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,910
Aigoo. Be careful on the way home.

218
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,490
Aigoo.

219
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,870
Why again? Your wrist hurts?

220
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,950
Yeah. I think winter is really here. My wrist starts to hurt.

221
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,970
Hyungnim, eat here. Should we have some kimchi handmade noodles?

222
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,510
What kimchi handmade noodles when your wrist hurts? How about Chinese food?

223
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,950
Jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup) for me.

224
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,870
Please get me black bean noodles.

225
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,710
Taek's Dad where are you going?

226
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,110
I need to make dinner.

227
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,910
You can just eat here.

228
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,850
That's right. Eat some black bean noodles and treat us big time.

229
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,110
But still, what if he comes home without eating dinner?

230
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:11,050
Then we could just prepare it for him. One meal is okay.

231
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,850
If I die and get reborn again, I would like to be born again as the son of Taek's dad.

232
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,750
You are first in Korea for taking care of your child.

233
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,910
The mothers should look at you and learn.

234
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,150
Aigoo. No. It's not like I did anything.

235
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,790
If you didn't do anything then this person also did nothing.

236
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:35,510
Compared to Taek's father's my wife is a lazy good-for-nothing.

237
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,610
What did you just say?

238
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,110
Hurry and beg for forgiveness. Say you were wrong!

239
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,070
Aigoo. I'm just saying. It's not like I'm saying that's what it really is.

240
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,990
You know how I really feel.

241
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,670
Hurry and apologize! Go ahead and beg!

242
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,090
Do I have to apologize (sa in sagua means four)over something like this? Forget about the apology.

243
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,870
I will  ohgwa (oh is five in korean, word play on sagwa).

244
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:04,130
Please! Stop! That! Nonsense!

245
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,650
Why? Oh(5)gwa is higher than sa(4)gwa!

246
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,810
What ohgwa!

247
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,730
Seriously!

248
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,610
Yook(6)gwa!

249
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,830
Then yook(6)gwa! Chil(7)gwa!

250
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,270
Aigoo!

251
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,370
Stop it!

252
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:30,070
Oh Deok Seon it's me. We're going to order food, you guys order something too.

253
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,390
  Chinese Food  

254
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,030
You can get the payment from the house up front.

255
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,310
Yes, have a nice meal.

256
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,960
Thank you.

257
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,810
Salamander, how did you come here?

258
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,810
I heard the sound of the motorbike.

259
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,110
What about the rest?

260
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,150
They must be studying. Those jerks.

261
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,650
Who did you pick, Noona?

262
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,690
I don't know, I don't care.

263
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,110
Eat a lot, Hyung.

264
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,380
Ah. What a coincidence.

265
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,230
- No Eul, wait. 
 - Yes, Hyung.

266
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,160
Hyung. Hyung... by chance, are you—

267
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,970
Sssst!  Remember. Rules.

268
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,940
First, they must picked each other, didn't they?

269
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,750
You guys suit each other. You two get married.

270
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,160
Get married! Get married! Get married!

271
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,580
No Eul.

272
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,400
Hyung doesn't have much money these days.

273
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,800
If I did, I would have bought you bunch of bananas.

274
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,220
Ah. It's okay.

275
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,270
Instead, I...

276
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,850
Just say it.

277
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,530
If it is something I can do, anything is fine.

278
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,780
No Eul, you said that you will...

279
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,850
give the 4th University Music Festival LP to me.

280
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,410
What is it that I can't do for you.

281
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,120
If there is anything you want in this room.

282
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,700
I will give you everything.

283
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,260
Hyung. By chance, do you have   Hwang Sa ?

284
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,100
 Hwang Sa?  The unwelcome guest in spring season?

285
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,580
(Hwang Sa means yellow dust)

286
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,690
In my room?

287
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:18,350
No.  Hwang Heol Han  Sa Chun Gi?  
(The Bewitching Puberty)

288
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
The novel?

289
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,900
You have it, right? You do own it, don't you?

290
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,100
Ah. Hyung, I don't have it, but someone I know well has it, though.

291
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,150
If you want it, I can show it to you.

292
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,160
Kim Jeong Bong! Kim Jeong Bong! Kim Jeong Bong!

293
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,850
How come Lee Mi Yeon is so beautiful despite living in such a neighborhood?

294
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,840
- Taek isn't here yet? 
 - Hey!

295
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,350
Knock please! Won't you please knock? Geez!

296
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,220
Knock, my ass. What were you doing?

297
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,060
I didn't do it.

298
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,620
What? You didn't do what?

299
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,820
What? Don't mind it.

300
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,560
Okay.

301
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,660
Is it raining outside? Why is it raining so much?

302
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,600
Hey... Hey... Hey! Wait! Wait!

303
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,550
Give me a break. Geez.

304
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,090
Hey. Where are you touching!

305
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,220
I'll give it.

306
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,470
I'll give it. I'll give it.

307
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,760
Hey!

308
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,220
What the heck is this?

309
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,730
Kids don't need to know.

310
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,170
Anyhow, you just learn bad stuff.

311
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,270
Hey. Other kids also read it.  It isn't just me.

312
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,680
All the kids in my class read it too.

313
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,890
What! So what!

314
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,590
It's just that all guys gather and read this together.

315
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,930
Why are you making a big deal out of this?

316
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,910
How could you read this kind of stuff with your friend?

317
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,470
- Disgusting. 
 - D-D-Disgusting?

318
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,880
Should I read it with my mom then?

319
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,690
Anyhow, you are really... a beast.

320
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,280
Argh. You are really—

321
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,740
Ahjussi will go to pick up Taek. Please watch over the house.

322
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,470
Yes. Don't worry. We will watch over the house.

323
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,440
We can do it, right?

324
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,670
Are you going to pick up Taek?

325
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,510
Yes. He didn't bring the umbrella.

326
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,180
Amazing. Really amazing. Aigoo.

327
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,360
On rainy days, he always bring the umbrella for Taek and picks up him, not knowing when he will finish.

328
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,500
And then he will wait vacantly in front of the association.

329
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,780
Why doesn't he just give him a call and tell him to come out?

330
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,850
Frustrating. Really frustrating.

331
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,510
Taxi!

332
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,050
Welcome.

333
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,070
Bangchuk-dong. Korea Baduk Association.

334
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,330
Hello, sir.

335
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,760
Should I call Master Choi Taek? He is inside.

336
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,430
You can go upstairs though, sir.

337
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,990
N-No. No need to.

338
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,220
It's just I enjoy watching the rain. It's okay.

339
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,440
Ah. I see. I'm leaving then.

340
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,200
Goodbye.
 ♫   Everyday with you  ♫

341
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,510
♫   Just the two of us   ♫

342
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,230
♫   Everyday with you   ♫

343
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,460
♫   I want to talk to you   ♫

344
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,790
♫   Even in the early morning streets in rain   ♫

345
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,060
♫   Everyday with you   ♫

346
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:52,310
♫   In your embrace at night   ♫

347
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,540
♫   Everyday with you   ♫

348
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,190
♫   I want to fall asleep   ♫

349
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,370
Those gloves are pretty, right?  Pink totally suits me too.

350
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,100
It's pretty because she is Lee Mi Yeon.

351
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,030
Should you phrase it like that, huh?  Did I ask you to buy them for me?

352
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,540
Who said I will buy them?

353
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,470
Forget it. I'll ask Taek to buy them.

354
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,670
Why would Taek?

355
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,870
Because Taek is my manito.

356
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,010
You said he is your manito?

357
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,380
So is it you? It's you, right?

358
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,130
No way. It's not me.

359
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,800
If it's not you, it is Taek then.

360
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,470
♫   Under the red sunset evening sky   ♫

361
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,530
Please, let it be Taek.

362
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,220
Who knows?

363
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:46,770
♫   I want to share everything with you   ♫

364
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,820
Dad, when did you come?

365
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,440
Just a moment ago. Let's go. It's cold.

366
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,930
♫   Receive the sunshine in the morning   ♫

367
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:04,180
♫   Everyday with you   ♫

368
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:09,980
♫   I want to talk to you   ♫

369
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:24,090
♫   Everyday with you   ♫

370
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,170
You are going to Busan tomorrow.

371
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,130
What a bother, since it's raining.

372
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,180
The road must be slippery.

373
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,840
It's okay.

374
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,840
The final is on Christmas Eve.

375
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,980
That day is your birthday.

376
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,050
I might come back very late.

377
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,540
I'm sorry.

378
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,700
Aigoo. A birthday at this age?

379
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,680
Just worry about yourself. There is no need to pay attention to me.

380
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,730
But don't you want something though?

381
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,640
No. I don't need anything.

382
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,170
Right. Tomorrow that thing...

383
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,210
Reporter Park?

384
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,770
Dad, you have a shoot tomorrow, right?

385
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,260
I'm sorry. I can't reject it since it is Reporter Park's request.

386
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,260
It's okay. It's Reporter Park though. Not that we don't know her.

387
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,910
For my Taek...

388
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,920
She is the president of your fan club. Of course, I can do that much.

389
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,070
If you feel bothered a lot, give a call to hotel where I stay.

390
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,850
We are close so I could talk it over.

391
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,850
No.

392
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,500
She is someone who always help us. I'm fine.

393
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,440
Yes. It's good.

394
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,710
Don't be nervous. Just answer the questions from Reporter Park, comfortably.

395
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,910
Sir, don't worry. I will edit it well so just relax.

396
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,490
Thank you.

397
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,890
I'm not very good at talking.

398
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,330
I will choose and use the best cut only. Shall we start now?

399
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,190
Sir. Are you ready?

400
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:12,900
Yes.

401
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,350
First, we will talk about 6-Dan Choi Taek's childhood.

402
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,490
Look. Kia Motors will definitely win this game.

403
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,310
Kang Jeong Su, Yoo Jae Hak, Jeong Deok Hwa.

404
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,870
These three together totally have no rivals.

405
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,300
Nope. Samsung Electronic will win though.

406
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,750
Kim Jin, Kim Hyeon Jun, Oh Se Ung. Totally explosive.

407
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,170
Typhoid Fever. Aigoo, I forgot

408
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,340
we also have the special rookie, Hur Jae (South Korean basketball player).

409
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,030
Nah. 'Electric Shooter' Kim Hyeon Jun will score 50 points on his own.

410
00:29:55,030 --> 00:30:00,030
Hey! You brats! You think they will just stay still. Let's see if they can pass 52.

411
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,680
You both are just the same.

412
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,310
Bo Ra, eat this. Grandmother bought it for us.

413
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,400
I'm not eating.

414
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,570
Don't eat then. We don't have enough to begin with.

415
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,890
Hey! You spoiled girl. You are twenty years old and still a picky eater?

416
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,930
Just eat anything. Grandmother sent this, you know.

417
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,260
Hello.

418
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,890
Who is this? Isn't this our Taek?

419
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,560
What's wrong with Deok Seon?

420
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,270
Why did she become that gentle toward Taek?

421
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,730
Noona's friends, in general, are weak to Taek.

422
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,680
He has to be protected, since he is a minor object.

423
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,530
 Greetings to viewers all over the country who love basketball! 

424
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,100
- Dad. The basketball match begins. 
 -  Kia Motors versus Samsung Electronic 

425
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,050
Deok Seon. I have something to ask.

426
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,520
Yes. What is it? 
  At this very moment. Jump ball. With his height, Han Ki Beom... 

427
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,450
Hey! Lower the volume. I can't hear anything.

428
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,380
 On the field, it  has already... 

429
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,950
Our dad's birthday is on the 24th.

430
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,110
- What should I gift him? 
 - Gift?

431
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,730
Yes. Gift. What should I buy?

432
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,620
Hey... How can you ask such thing straightaway?

433
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,420
Can't I? But I think it's fine for you to know though.

434
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,240
No Eul. It seems Taek is the one who picked me. My manito is Taek. Oh yeah!

435
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,180
Really. What the heck.

436
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,790
Hey! Lower the voice. How dare you ignore me. I'm going to beat you up.

437
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,220
LOWER the VOICE! I can't hear ANYTHING.

438
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,400
It's my first time giving a present. I have no idea what to buy.

439
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,590
What should I buy for dad?

440
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:42,550
 Before I leave for Daegu, I have spare time and plan to go to department store. What should I buy? 

441
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,960
Oh. Gloves.

442
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,500
Gloves are nice. What kind of gloves? I really don't know.

443
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,010
Pink gloves. Pink gloves totally pretty.

444
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,190
Pink gloves? Are they good?

445
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,200
Of course they are. You don't seem to know, but these days pink is the new black.

446
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,470
- KIM HYEON JUN! KIM HYEON JUN! SHOOT! SHOOT! 
  - YOU WANT TO DIE?! YOU WANT TO DIE?!

447
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,940
YOU WANT TO DIE?! I said I can't hear anything.

448
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,010
All right.  Kim Hyeon Jun.

449
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,980
Dad will like it, right?

450
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,990
Dad and I have never done this kind of thing before.

451
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,330
Even if I bought the gift, I don't know how to give it to him.

452
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,530
Hello.

453
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,890
All right, Deok Seon. Thanks.

454
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,940
Let's meet on Christmas Eve then.

455
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,490
Christmas? When will you come?

456
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,690
The final is on the 24th.

457
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,860
It will end in Busan, so I think I'll get home after eleven.

458
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,690
I'll wait.

459
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,490
Don't wait. Why would you?

460
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,520
It's up to me.

461
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,870
Okay, I'll drop by to see you a bit then. Don't sleep and wait.

462
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,040
Yes, all right. Do well in the match.

463
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,870
Be careful of the cold. Bye.

464
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,050
Dad. I will get a pair of gloves.

465
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,250
What gloves?

466
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,900
It's nothing. Taek will buy it for me.

467
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,700
This kimchi soup is refreshing.

468
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,930
Mom. I want more kimchi soup.

469
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,400
Okay.

470
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,300
So has he been quiet and reserved since he was a child?

471
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,450
Yes. Since he was young, he has never talked much and was always reserved.

472
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,360
So he has never whined for you to buy him stuff or snatch other people's stuff?

473
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,220
No. He matured quite fast.

474
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,180
A genius like 6-Dan Choi Taek must have a special conception dream. (a dream mothers have just before or after  conception)

475
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,030
Sir, what is 6-Dan Choi Taek's conception dream?

476
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,770
Ah. Conception dream?

477
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,160
I don't remember...

478
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,990
Mom. I'm going to the study room.

479
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,360
Ahjumma. How are you?

480
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,180
Seon Woo. Are you going to study at study room?
Yes.

481
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,890
Why? Today is the weekend. Just study at home. I'll make something delicious.

482
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,040
No. I'll come back by dinner.

483
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,850
Ah. Don't do things like this. Your wrist is in pain.

484
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,980
You're not going to hospital?

485
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,950
I can do it lightly. It's fine.

486
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,160
Ah... Mom...

487
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,000
Stop nagging.

488
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,710
But where is Jin Joo?

489
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,670
That girl, she must have gone to get Bbobgi (melted sugar candy).

490
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,870
Just now Jeong Bong's Dad gave her 100 won.

491
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,380
He did give a lot.

492
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,660
You bring her back. She won't listen to my words.

493
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,060
All right. I'm off.

494
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,270
- Good bye. 
 - Leave quickly.

495
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,460
You raised him well.

496
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,470
Look at how he nags mom about her wrist pain and opens the bottle cap.

497
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,900
Seon Woo, even if he is on his own out there, you will have no worries.

498
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,200
He is good at what he needs to be and he takes good care of his sister.

499
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,920
Such a waste. Just give him to me.

500
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,830
Hyungnim, don't say thing like this. I'm going to cry.

501
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,760
What is it? You made rice cake?

502
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,230
I made a few rice cakes. We have too much rice at home.

503
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,620
Let's eat.

504
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,040
Omo. I bet it tastes good.

505
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,590
Aigoo.

506
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,900
I will make it delicious.

507
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,460
I am bringing Jin Joo.

508
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,700
Jin Joo. Does it taste good?

509
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,590
You had a promise with Oppa, right?

510
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,020
Jin Joo, you can only eat Bbobgi once a week.

511
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,410
Only on the day we watch "Classic Children''s Fairytale". We promised, right?

512
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:37,720
Go brush you teeth with the Dooly toothbrush now. Oppa will buy you ice cream for dinner.

513
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,250
Mom. I'm leaving now.

514
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,760
Why the umbrella? Is it raining outside?

515
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,970
They said it's going to rain. I'll bring it just in case.

516
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,220
Ahjumma. Good bye.

517
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,990
Our son is studying hard.

518
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:09,040
You can't find son like there anywhere. What should I do to give birth to a son like that?

519
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,420
He's exactly like his dad. He goes straight by the book.

520
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,850
Ah, right... Has Taek's dad finished with the shooting?

521
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,290
I should have come and watched.

522
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,310
He is not someone who'll talk much. What

523
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,520
he will probably do is just 'ohoho, ohoho' like this.

524
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,610
The conception dream...

525
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,340
I don't really remember exactly.

526
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,810
Then how about DeolJabYi (First Birthday Grabbing Game)?

527
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,060
What did he grab?

528
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,450
DeolJabYi, too... I don't...

529
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,570
No. It's fine. You might not remember.

530
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,180
We try to look into 6-Dan Choi Taek's new year fortune.

531
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,380
His birthday is?

532
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,870
8th October 1971.

533
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,710
The hour?

534
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,910
Morning? Noon?

535
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,050
I don't know the hour. I'm sorry.

536
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,350
It's okay. Usually fathers don't know things like this.

537
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:17,130
Then, shall we talk about 6-Dan Choi Taek's habits?

538
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,090
Is he also slow at home?

539
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,330
From what I heard from his association's senior,

540
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:26,250
he often comes late and

541
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,440
is a bit slow and sluggish.

542
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,350
Not in a bad meaning...

543
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,280
Oh. It's really raining.

544
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,410
It's good since it's raining.

545
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,510
Jjak Jjak. Rain down. ♫   Jjak Jjak Rain down   ♫

546
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,440
The ingredient jar.

547
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,270
I left the lid open!

548
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:01,810
Ah! I forgot my laundry.

549
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,650
Aigoo!

550
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,860
Oh no!

551
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,970
Aigoo!

552
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,550
Now I see 6-Dan Choi Taek resembles his father a lot.

553
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,840
Of course, it's because you raise him wholeheartedly.

554
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,320
You are really great. The fact is taking care a child alone

555
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,380
is not easy job.

556
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,110
When is the most difficult?

557
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:39,790
There is no difficulty. He is good-natured and well behaved.

558
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,620
He has never made me upset.

559
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,640
He is a good son.

560
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,360
Finally, you said you have something you'd like to say to your son?

561
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,850
Be healthy...

562
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,340
Being healthy is the first, after all.

563
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,620
Don't get sick and just be healthy.

564
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,610
Please say that you love him once.

565
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,170
Aigoo.

566
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,970
Only once, okay?

567
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,100
Aiyoo. I can't. I'm not good at that kind of thing.

568
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,790
Sir, please. Just once will do.

569
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:22,770
I-I never done such thing before. I can't d— I'm sorry.

570
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,000
Why are you like this, Reporter Park?

571
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,390
Geez... did he sell out his mind or what?

572
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,940
Where did he go, leaving the front door open?

573
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,530
Hey... Taek's Dad.

574
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,580
Is there anything wrong?

575
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,440
I don't even realize someone had come.

576
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,910
Hey, Dong Ryong Nyong. Go sleep at home.

577
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,630
These days you sleep ten hours.

578
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:49,150
It's more comfortable here. There is Dean of Students at home.

579
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,120
You go. I'll go after you leave.

580
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,040
It's raining outside, isn't it?

581
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,660
It looks like it.

582
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,350
The rain sounds freaking nice.

583
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:46,420
♫   Do you remember that lonely alley?   ♫

584
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:51,910
♫   I still remember it now   ♫

585
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,020
I like getting caught in the rain.

586
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,090
What a lie.

587
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:02,570
Why would I lie? I really like getting caught in the rain.

588
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:07,380
♫   I won't know   ♫

589
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,540
♫   If you can hear me   ♫

590
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,730
I'm leaving first.

591
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,920
Seon Woo. Hey!

592
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,930
I will look for you tomorrow morning. See you tomorrow.

593
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,150
You don't even drink that much.

594
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,320
Is it because you couldn't talk properly during the shooting today?

595
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:50,630
What is it? Having a drink like this. Are you feeling blue?

596
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,530
Seon Woo Mom.

597
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,630
Yes.

598
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,850
Do you remember Seon Woo's conception dream?

599
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,170
What are you saying? I can even dream the same thing tonight.

600
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,650
A dragon, flying above a waterfall.

601
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,940
It spins its head and looks at me.

602
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:15,390
It has that cintamani (dragon ball) around this big, and throws it upon my skirt.

603
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,790
And then it just leaves and flies above.

604
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,800
How about Seon Woo's hour of birth?

605
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,020
Of course you know the time—

606
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,200
Dawn 4:57 AM. Pig feeding time.

607
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,390
I was kept thinking and hoping him to come before 5 AM, you know.

608
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,760
There were just exactly 3 minutes left.

609
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,170
He was undoubtedly filial even before he is born.

610
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:42,230
But why? Why you are asking such thing?

611
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,740
Did Taek ask?

612
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,700
Today the reporter asked

613
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,240
what Taek's conception dream was, his hour of birth...

614
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,360
I should have known.

615
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,290
Since I don't remember anything, I can't answer.

616
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:06,310
I feel like crawling into a hole to hide if I could.

617
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,190
I feel sorry for Taek.

618
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:23,420
I feel sorry to my child.

619
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,790
Fathers in general won't know this kind of thing.

620
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,850
Where do you get such a father who remembers that?

621
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,790
If he had a mother, she would remember.

622
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,200
If his mother was alive,

623
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:53,380
like Seon Woo's Mom, his conception dream,

624
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,200
his hour of birth,

625
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,590
what he wore on his first day at school.

626
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,650
She would remember everything.

627
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,170
♫  Let's sing a song together   ♫

628
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,830
Afather... is useless.

629
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,640
♫   All the memories which hurt you dear  ♫

630
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:23,620
If only, his mother was alive, instead of me.

631
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,340
Taek would receive a lot of love, like other kids.

632
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,860
He'd get to wear clean clothes every season

633
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,180
and eat a lot of tasty food.

634
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,260
If he were sick,

635
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,290
his mother would hug him.

636
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:49,080
♫   Let's sing to those who have left   ♫

637
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,730
Of all things, his dad is the one who alive.

638
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:00,790
You really have nothing else to say.

639
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:04,310
There is no one like Taek's dad in this world.

640
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:07,720
Every morning, you feed him a warm meal.

641
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,190
If it rains, you go all the way to association and wait for him.

642
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,570
Afraid that it will disturb him,

643
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,620
you never watch television properly.

644
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,960
Taek too... knows everything.

645
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,520
He is a thoughtful kid.

646
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,280
That his dad loves him a lot

647
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,680
and cherishes him. The feelings...

648
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,270
He knows it all... All.

649
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:41,940
What's the use if he knows. What's the use if he doesn't know.

650
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,350
♫   Let's sing  ♫

651
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:49,940
It just that my kid is pitiful.

652
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,270
My kid is pitiful.

653
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:05,320
♫   Tell them that you will dream a new dream  ♫

654
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,850
Christmas Eve D-2

655
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:28,000
One day before Manito is due.

656
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,010
You'll get frostbite

657
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,540
wearing a skirt in winter?

658
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,150
You quit studying, right?

659
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:50,120
I will start studying in January. It's none of your business.

660
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,000
Just give up.

661
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,940
- Deok Seon, you should go now. How come you are late until the vacation day. 
 - Fine.

662
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,030
Alright!

663
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,600
You are not leaving yet?

664
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,000
Yes. I slept late. Let's go.

665
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,690
Hey. Aren't you cold?

666
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,260
What the heck? In winter?

667
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,170
I have an appointment with the girls, right after, to go to Apgeujong.

668
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,110
I should wear this much.

669
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:35,250
What if the wind blows the radish (foot)?

670
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,910
Also on day like today (Christmas Eve), you will trampled to death if you go to Gangnam.

671
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,630
If possible, just stay at home.

672
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:44,800
It's none of your business whether I go to Gangnam or Gangbuk.

673
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,960
No. It's...

674
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,310
Just...

675
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,150
Watch videos with kids in Taek's room.

676
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,590
No way. I promised Man Ok and Jo Hyun.

677
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:02,110
Oh, hi. You guys haven't left?

678
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,730
Bad luck...

679
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:44,020
But then... Everyone is in pairs. What's up with only us girls?

680
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,250
When was it otherwise?

681
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,110
Hey, call your boyfriend at least.

682
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,090
Ask him to buy us some hamburgers.

683
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,780
These girls, seriously!

684
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,230
Hey! He's not her boyfriend. He likes someone else.

685
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,520
Really? Seriously? What the heck?

686
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,920
You!

687
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,170
Hey. Then call the guy beside him.

688
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,510
Right. What's up with just us girls?

689
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,310
Call him and let's hang out together.

690
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,840
Who? 
 - Go (baduk). Call Go.

691
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,750
Choi Taek. We'll just watch.

692
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,560
Taek went to Busan. He's coming back tomorrow night.

693
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,790
Do Ryong Nyong? Should I call him? The one with the glasses.

694
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,490
Never mind. Can you tell him to come?

695
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,850
The tall and slim one.

696
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,250
Who?

697
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:32,590
The one who sat beside the student president? The scary looking one?

698
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,440
Jung Hwan? Dog Jungpal?

699
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,750
Tell him to come. It would be better than just us eating.

700
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:41,310
He looks like he's rich, so tell him to come and treat us with hamburgers.

701
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,350
- He probably won't come. 
 - Why?

702
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,050
It would be good if he wouldn't curse at me. He has a really dirty personality.

703
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,980
Come on. Try to call him.

704
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,730
That's right. He might come. He's your friend.

705
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,910
I don't want to. He's going to throw a fit.

706
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:03,800
Hey. A friend can't even call?

707
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,930
Are we only that much?

708
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,280
Mom, I will go to the store for a while.

709
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,560
To have fun?

710
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,620
No. I'm going to buy something.

711
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,430
Are you going to be late? I made your favorite.

712
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:46,160
No, I will be coming right back. Let's eat dinner together.

713
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,640
Where is our Jin Joo going?

714
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,360
Do you have plans for tonight?

715
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,750
I will be taking Jin Joo with me.

716
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,890
Jin Joo, do you love Oppa or not?

717
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,620
I love you.

718
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,330
We will be right back.

719
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:10,950
Aigoo, my children.

720
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,620
Hello.

721
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,800
Seon Woo.

722
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,050
Jin Joo, where are you going? Are you going on a date with your brother?

723
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,640
You should say yes.

724
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,450
Yes.

725
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,700
But where's Jeong Hwan?

726
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,770
Pardon?

727
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:32,450
You're not going with Jeong Hwan? He also got dressed and went out.

728
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:49,330
Hey. What's with you?

729
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:53,860
What? You said to come.

730
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:08,750
Hey, order. What will you eat?

731
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:19,000
Filet-o-fish burger, french fries and Cola.

732
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,760
I'll also have the same.

733
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,830
That... What did you order?

734
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,810
Ahh... it's hard to understand, right?

735
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:29,600
Filet-o-fish burger, french fries and Cola.

736
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,480
We can order a set, right? That would be quite expensive.

737
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,600
Yes. You can. It's alright.

738
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,710
What will you have?

739
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:43,100
Me.Double burger,

740
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,550
large coke, fried potatoes, ice crea—

741
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:50,390
Again, again, again. Your habits are coming out again.

742
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,150
You can't even eat everything. You're just so greedy.

743
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,040
Eat then order some more.

744
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,000
You're so faithful to your basic instinct. You have no willpower whatsoever.

745
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,890
Just eat a burger and cola.

746
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,180
I'll go to the restroom.

747
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,770
But then...

748
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,410
You must be really close with Deok Seon.

749
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,710
You came running here after just a phone call.

750
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,940
That's not it.

751
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,810
I thought she was alone.

752
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,100
I will go and order.

753
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:45,380
What the heck! What the heck! This time it's real. For sure.

754
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,930
Real.

755
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,280
♫   Bruce, bruce, bruce player   ♫

756
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,840
♫   Don't stop the music   ♫

757
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,250
Meeting! Meeting!

758
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,540
- Is the US on the move? 
 - Yes!

759

♫   Bruce, bruce  ♫

760
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:10,360
What is the matter?

761
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,410
The forecast has changed.

762
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,930
Tomorrow and the day after, it won't be snowing.

763
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,700
What big trouble is that then?

764
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:23,030
Snowman. What are we going to do with the snowman?

765
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,210
Let's gather some ideas.

766
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:30,030
We promised the child a snowman even if snow was not certain.

767
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,550
What should we do about this?

768
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:40,770
Here. Try and say anything. Even if it's  an embarrassing idea

769
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,930
first, throw it out here.

770
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,280
Say it.

771
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,820
Here. How about this?

772
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:03,960
Let's put Jin Joo to sleep on the night of the 24th

773
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,520
and wake her up on the 26th.

774
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,190
Then there's no need to make a snowman

775
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:15,560
because there's no 25th.

776
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,020
Stop it.

777
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,370
To Jin Joo, "Jin Joo,

778
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:24,050
because you were asleep, the snowman melted."

779
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:27,660
"Why didn't you get up?"

780
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,380
I'm sorry.

781
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,380
Just because I said to say anything you just spout anything.

782
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,150
That's why a person gets killed.

783
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,680
Ahh! Then all we need is to just make a snowman however it is, right?

784
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,700
We can just make it with paper and some blankets.

785
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,980
I'm late. I'm sorry.

786
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,450
You have nothing to do, so why are you always late?

787
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:55,670
Did you hide honey somewhere?

788
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,720
I was late making some deliveries.

789
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:06,140
Oh right! Ice! We can just make it using ice!

790
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,170
Oh my! Oh my! That's right! We just need to use ice!

791
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:13,550
Rather than that, on the 24th-

792
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:18,910
That's right! Ice! We could just cut it out and shape a snowman.

793
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:22,160
And Taek's dad is good with his hands. That's doable, right?

794
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,830
Well... I haven't tried making one but I think it won't be too hard.

795
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,080
We got it then!

796
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,410
Then, Ice Store Boss can just treat us with the ice.

797
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,310
Or you could just give it at a cheap price.

798
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,920
Aigoo. No, anyway there's no one who needs ice.

799
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,930
I will bring a block on the street tomorrow.

800
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,340
Yes. Yes.

801
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,530
Now, let's meet up on the street up front tomorrow.

802
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:52,980
Eat dinner deliciously. Though there are two days left, Merry Christmas.

803
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,260
Now, dismissed.

804
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:04,100
Are you okay?

805
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,650
Aigoo!

806
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,330
What are you thinking so hard about, since earlier?

807
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:14,160
Did you leave something behind?

808
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,450
Why are you so serious?

809
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:21,540
Did you cause trouble?

810
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,450
Hey, Dog Jeongpal.

811
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,250
What?

812
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,920
You...

813
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,670
are my manito, right?

814
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:36,120
That's strange. My manito is Taek.

815
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,700
Why am I your manito?

816
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,870
You're my manito. That's why you came. With your temper, would you have gone all the way to Gangnam?

817
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,680
Are you crazy?

818
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,240
I also have that much brains.

819
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,040
I'm not your manito.

820
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:52,020
You should stop insisting.

821
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,170
My manito is Taek.

822
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:57,160
Should I show you the paper?

823
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,310
Then why did you come?

824
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,700
Why?

825
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,900
Seriously, why? Are you crazy!

826
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,210
With this head of yours, think carefully

827
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,130
why I came.

828
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,630
Get that?

829
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,660
♫    Stay by my side   ♫

830
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:36,320
Seriously why? Is he crazy?
♫    Stay by my side   ♫

831
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:40,120
♫    You can't leave   ♫

832
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,680
What?

833
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:28,940
  Hello! The festival of youth celebrating romance and dreams through music. 

834
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,850
 88 MBC's College Music Festival. 

835
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:31,700
 Three hours from now... 

836
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,760
Should we bet on who wins the grand prize?

837
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,940
Yes. I like that.

838
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,910
That's good. How much?

839
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:42,750
1,000 won. Each of us gives 1,000 won and the one who gets it right takes it all.

840
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:46,270
You could become a host somewhere.

841
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:48,160
Oppa.

842
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,290
Huh?

843
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:53,300
Let's not promote gambling and let's watch quietly.

844
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,350
Wow, Taek's Dad also has this kind of talent.

845
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,380
Wow. It's a masterpiece.

846
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:16,510
You could be a sculptor.

847
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:19,260
Taek's dad used to carve out stamps.

848
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,430
He's a man of the arts.

849
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:25,340
There's no eyes and nose. The face is empty.

850
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,380
Should we put a white stone or black stone?

851
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:30,370
- For me, a white stone. 
 - Black stone for me.

852
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:32,220
Then it would be mismatched.

853
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,740
Oh my, what is that?

854
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,160
Don't! It will melt.

855
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,880
It's below O degrees Celcius.  It won't melt, don't worry.

856
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:54,620
My Jin Joo would like this one very much!

857
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:57,980
She would really believe that Santa made this for her.

858
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,390
But anyway,

859
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:03,430
a small kid makes the adults go through so much hard work.

860
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:05,760
No matter how she likes it...

861
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,730
The weather is cold and the night is deep. How about a drink?

862
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,510
Then we will go to Seon Woo's house.

863
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,700
Then should we also...

864
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,850
Hurry and go. Why talk about what's obvious?

865
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,460
Let's go.

866
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:26,270
But then, Teacher said he had something urgent and left early.

867
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:28,690
Right, go on.

868
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:33,290
Yes. Go on in.

869
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,280
Me, 11.

870
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,900
Me too. 11.

871
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,110
There are still five teams left.

872
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,500
It's 11. There's impact.

873
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,270
Me, 3. Jeon Soo Kyeong.

874
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:11,270
It's 3 for me as well.

875
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:14,570
Don't you think it's weak this time? It's all the same.

876
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:19,160
Hey, the first time you hear a song it's all the same. Where would you find a song that draws you in on the intro?

877
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,480
Number 1 for me.

878
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,430
Are you Beethoven? How could you remember 1?

879
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,460
I think she was pretty.

880
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,670
What?

881
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,790
Won't it be Taek's dad's birthday?

882
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:41,970
Is it really your birthday?

883
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:45,640
Then, we should have a congratulatory toast.

884
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,810
Cheers!

885
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:53,330
This morning, my wife made some seaweed soup.

886
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:57,150
It's your birthday. Aren't you having a party?

887
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:02,200
What party in our age?

888
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,020
For me, on my birthday, just looking at the numbers on the cake

889
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,800
makes me tear up.

890
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,840
That's right.

891
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,680
I also don't welcome my birthday thinking how I am over forty.

892
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,810
It just makes me needlessly depressed.

893
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:20,980
But what can we do? We just live watching our kids grow.

894
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:27,580
Hey, alcohol is just going straight down, is something wrong?

895
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,390
Nothing.

896
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,730
When is Taek coming back?

897
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:34,520
It's your birthday. How nice would it be to eat dinner together.

898
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,220
He is coming from Busan. I got a call earlier.

899
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:43,710
But then, Taek is a busy person. It's not like he would have time to take care of his birthday.

900
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,340
Isn't that right?

901
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:50,030
Taek... Just the fact that he grew up well

902
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,550
is a great gift to you, isn't it?

903
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:58,110
Yes. I am so grateful for that alone.

904
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:01,420
With only a father, he just received half the love

905
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,850
but he still grew well.

906
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:07,420
For me, you gave Taek twice his mother's love.

907
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:11,960
Don't say that. If Taek hears that he would cry.

908
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,010
He's just boasting himself.

909
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:20,010
Speaking frankly, what's the use of having much?

910
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,930
No one would be able to catch up to what Taek's dad does for his child.

911
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:24,740
It's just boasting one's self.

912
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:29,290
Here, here, here. Cheers. Give me a drink.

913
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:34,380
Here. Cheers.

914
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:45,810
Today is Christmas, but why is the atmosphere like this?

915
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,750
I will sing a song.

916
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,280
Don't!

917
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:57,520
Is Jin Joo asleep?

918
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:06,110
She played so hard so she's tired and asleep.

919
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,390
Good for Jin Joo.

920
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:11,300
The whole neighborhood gathered to make her Christmas present.

921
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,890
It's her luck.

922
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:16,060
Jin Joo won't forget this Christmas present for the rest of her life.

923
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,020
She will forget next year. There's a limit to what children remember.

924
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,820
Why?

925
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:23,680
I don't know about anything else, but when I was about Jin Joo's age

926
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,390
with my mom there was nothing like Christmas.

927
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:31,720
On my birthday, she stayed up all night just to make me a doll.

928
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,850
Where would she get the money? She made it from chunks of cloth on the floor.

929
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:39,370
I still remember that doll. It's so fresh in my memory.

930
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:40,480
Of course.

931
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,080
Our Jin Joo would have it as a lifelong memorable Christmas gift.

932
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,560
Is that so?

933
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,050
Fine then, now.

934
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:51,760
Cheers.

935
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,010
Oh my!

936
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,240
Still, 11.

937
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,860
Me, 13 again.

938
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,860
Me too.

939
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,140
It's vague, for me 7.

940
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,370
Me 15.

941
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,660
- Me too, 15. 
 - Don't follow me.

942
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,700
What follow? It's my ears.

943
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,690
Aigoo, it's cutting close. Is there only one team left now?

944
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:19,370
  College Music Festival. We only have one team left now.  

945
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,680
Hey!

946
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,510
  Representing Seoul, group sound, Infinite Orbit.  

947
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:29,990
  Group Infinite Orbit. They'll be performing as the last team among the contestants today. 

948
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:32,410
  What did you think about while you were waiting?  

949
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:37,070
 I didn't think about anything specific. Just that I want to go home soon and see Mom.  

950
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,020
  Now, contestant #16. 

951
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,900
  Representing Seoul, group Infinite Orbit. The song is "To You."  

952
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:48,650
  88 MBC College Music Festival, #16 Infinite Orbit (Seoul National Univ., Yonsei Univ., Seogang Univ.) Song - "To You" 

953

970
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:13,290
 Noona. It's me Seon Woo. Just give me a moment. 

971
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,850
What is it?

972
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:32,540
- What is this? 
 - A gift.

973
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:39,600
Hey! I told you not to bother me. This is really burdensome.

974
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,460
Noona.

975
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,580
You are my manito.

976
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:51,650
The manito present is just until today.

977
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,090
I will be going. Ah,

978
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,280
Merry Christmas.

979
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:23,520
Taek! Hee Dong!

980
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:27,490
Hey! There's only 30 minutes left.

981
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:31,650
Today. Today, there's only 30 minutes left of today.

982
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:38,230
It's really 11:30 now. Deok Seon, I'll be going in first.

983
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,530
Hey, Choi Taek!

984
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:49,460
What about the gloves?

985
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,240
I bought them.

986
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,720
Thank you. Thanks to you I picked well. I think Dad will like it.

987
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:03,820
Thanks a lot.

988
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,460
Dad.

989
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:42,320
Did you drink? You should go inside and sleep.

990
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,810
My son is here. Did you eat?

991
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:50,150
I already ate. It's already late.

992
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:56,530
Oh, right. Wash up and sleep. You worked hard, my son.

993
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,370
Oh...

994
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,770
Dad... this.

995
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:17,010
What is it?

996
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:20,910
Birthday present.

997
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,400
Happy Birthday, Dad.

998
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,560
Open it.

999
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,620
It's your birthday and I wasn't able to eat dinner with you.

1000
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,180
I'm sorry.

1001
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,750
Dad...

1002
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:59,480
I... You know that I love you very much, right?

1003
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,650
Dad.

1004
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,970
What's wrong?

1005
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,480
My son, when did you grow this big?

1006
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,900
Huh?

1007
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:36,840
Like this... Thinking about me.

1008
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,920
You're all grown up. My son is all grown up.

Noona, what are you doing here?

1022
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,050
Did you fight with big noona again?

1023
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:08,630
No Eul... nobody picked me.

1024
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:14,100
I don't even have a manito.

1025
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:19,710
I'm a child who is not worthy of receiving love.

1026
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:24,560
Isn't it Taek Hyung? You said he'd buy you gloves?

1027
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,460
It's not mine, it's his dad's.

1028
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,740
What the heck?

1029
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,200
Should I kill Choi Taek?

1030
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:36,870
No. Hyung Taek lost today. By half a point.

1031
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:43,440
That's why, don't be needlessly harsh on him. Just think of it as your luck.

1032
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:48,810
And Hyung Taek probably doesn't remember about manito or whatnot.

1033
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:52,460
He's not in the state to mind about a manito.

I'm sorry. I totally forgot.

1044
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:21,580
- I'm really sorry. 
- For what?

1045
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:25,550
My manito... is you.

1046
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:32,040
I'm right? You're my manito, right?

1047
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:38,270
Yeah. It's me. But I was so out of it. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1048
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:43,400
It's okay. It's not the time to be worried about manito.

1049
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:48,600
And I didn't also mind about the manito thing, it's just that everyone was doing it so I was curious.

1050
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,160
It's okay.

1051
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:56,160
What do you want as a gift? I will buy it all.

1052
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:00,500
No. Never mind.

1053
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:05,080
Hurry and say it. I will count to 3. 1...

1054
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,690
Gloves.

1055
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:10,660
Pink gloves. Angora.

1056
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:13,780
Okay.

1057
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:18,430
I got it. I will buy you the same one as Dad's.

1058
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,450
Hurry and go in, it's cold.

1059
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:25,450
Okay. Sleep well.

1060
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:27,320
You too.

1061
01:21:52,050 --> 01:21:55,820
  Christmas morning arrived with warm weather.  

1062
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:59,380
  Seoul's temperature is 2 degrees Celsius. Gwangju and Jeonju are each at 4 degrees Celsius. 

1063
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:02,480
  Daejun and Choonchun are at 3 degrees Celsius.  

1064
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,920
Oh my. My insides don't feel well.

1065
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:10,160
Aigoo. I knew it would be like that. You drank so much yesterday. Should I get you medicine?

1066
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:14,400
No, no. Never mind.

1067
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,600
But then, where did the kids go?

1068
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:22,190
It's school break so they are sleeping in. They said it would be really cold today but it's not.

1069
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:29,460
Yeah... That... Did you hear the rain last night? I thought it was raining hard.

1070
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,360
What rain? I din't hear.

1071
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,110
 Last night, there was rain. 

1072
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:35,760
 Atypically, it rained a lot. 

1073
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,840
Oh my! Your ears are so good.

1074
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:43,170
Aigoo! You were down from all that alcohol so how did you hear the rain?

1075
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:47,680
I am capable, aren't I?

1076
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:53,560
Rain is better than snow. It's good that everything in the streets would be washed—

1077
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:53,000
What should we do about this?

1078
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,680
- What about Jin Joo?
- She's still asleep.

1079
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:00,060
Jin Joo would be so disappointed. What should we do?

1080
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:05,540
We should lure Jin Joo with her favorite snacks.

1081
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,070
What's the matter?

1082
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:18,950
Oh. Jin Joo said she wanted a snowman for her Christmas present so we made one last night.

1083
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,570
It's all melted now.

1084
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:24,960
It would be hard to make one now, right?

1085
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,490
Aigoo. I feel sorry for Jin Joo, what should we do?

1086
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:32,860
Jin Joo said she wanted a snowman?

1087
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:37,960
Yes. Your sister wanted a snowman for her Christmas present.

1088
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:42,340
But it's all melted so what should we do?

1089
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:45,150
They sell one in Dooly's supermarket.

1090
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:49,400
They sell snowmen in Dooly's supermarket.

1091
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,940
What does that mean?

1092
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:55,080
Jin Joo calls an ice cream snowman.

1093
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,500
Should I buy some? How many?

1094
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:08,470
Wow! A snowman!

1095
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:16,750
 The reason why religions somehow exist 

1096
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:21,560
  may be because of sons and daughters. 

1097
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:29,160
 It may be because of the parents who wish them health and happiness more than anyone else. 

1098
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:38,080
 In this world, all the mothers and fathers, for the sake of their children, 

1099
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,480
 God, Buddha, Allah 

1100
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:45,750
 and also Santa—they all must exist. 

1101
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,050
Noona, this.

1102
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:03,020
What is it?

1103
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:08,940
Gift.

1104
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:23,230
When did he buy this?

1105
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:26,930
The department store probably isn't open yet.

1106
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:29,490
Is Taek still outside?

1107
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:34,180
He still hasn't left, right?
- Hyung Taek isn't the one who gave that.

1108
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:38,640
Hyung Jeong Hwan  gave that as your Christmas present.

1109
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:44,390
That hyung must be crazy.

1110
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:22,310
 Now, we're at the age where we don't believe in Santa and are not excited about manitos. 

1111
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:30,670
  I was at an age where a secretly placed gift or gifts given in secret aren't satisfactory.  

1112
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:38,970
  That breathless excitement that plugged up my throat when I tried to suppress it... 

1113
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:43,870
  The shyness that felt as if  it would blow up my heart if I opened up.  

1114
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:50,950
 We can't handle being obvious but didn't want to get caught. 

1115
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:56,530
  The excitement of 1988. We were 18. 

1116
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,160
You're here.

1117
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:24,510
Yes.

1118
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:30,690
That's great. This, Reporter Park asked me to give this to you.

1119
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:38,020
She said it's a Christmas present. It looked like a videotape. Anyway, I'm going.

1120
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:43,660
And also, on days like today, go home and sleep.

1121
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:45,750
I'm going.

1122
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:01,620
 Master Choi Taek, it's a Christmas present. 

1123
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:07,670
 I don't know if you will like it, but still I sneaked and edited this the whole night. I hope you watch it with enjoyment. 

1124
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:11,510
 It's a very special video that you can't get anywhere. 

1125
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:15,990
 Spend your Christmas well and I cheer you on for a better record next year. 

1126
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:20,460
 Choi Taek 6-dan's forever fan, Park Ji Yoon. 

1127
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:33,520
 Aigoo. No. No. I can't do those well. 

1128
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,290
 Father, just do it once. Just once. 

1129
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:44,280
 Aigoo. I don't really do that. I'm sorry. Reporter Park, why are you being like this? 

1130
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:50,680
 Then, we will not put this on air. Just think of it as practice and do it once. 

1131
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,270
 With no camera. 

1132
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:57,960
 I don't like you in times like this, Reporter Park. 

1133
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,260
 What did I do? It's just because you two look so gruff. 

1134
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:07,280
 Why don't you practice with me. Try saying "I love you" 

1135
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:13,040
 - It's not like I can't say it. 
 - It's not hard so say it. 

1136
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:19,090
-  I love you, son. 
 - See, you were going to do it so easily. 

1137
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,300
 One more. 

1138
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:40,060
 I love you, my son. 

1139
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:49,990
 You're doing well. You should say it regularly. 

1140
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:54,680
 I can't do it well but you keep on telling me to do so. 

1141
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:59,760
 Time is flowing. That's why time eventually makes farewells, 

1142
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,440
 and with no fail, time leaves regrets. 

1143
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,380
 It would be so nice if you would say it often. 

1144
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:09,060
 You did so well today. 

1145
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:12,160
 The camera. Thank you. 

1146
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:15,760
 If you love them, you should say it right now. 

1147
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:22,470
 Before this moment passes and becomes a regret, you should say it. 

1148
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:30,300
 Somehow the biggest gift that time gives is the memory of love. 

1149
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:36,650
 So before it's too late, you should overcome the timidness and confess 

1150
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:40,450
 to the person you love. 

1151
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:46,740
 - These! Do you take me for a fool! 
 - It's not you? 

1152
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:49,280
 I'm telling Mom! 

1153
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,670
 Mom! 

1154
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:53,270
 You pay attention to the color of your head! 

1155
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:57,630
 It's not me, Mom! It's really not me! 

1156
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,140
 Well, a person who likes Seong Bo Ra wouldn't be in his right mind. 

1157
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,140
 Hi, Noona. 

1158
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:09,320
 - It's Hello (formal). 
 - Hello. 

1159
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:18,720
 What is this? 

1160
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:22,260
 I will give all of this to you. I don't need it anymore. 

1161
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:25,250
 If only it wasn't for that surgery. 

1162
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,830
 Jeong Beong, it's Mom. Mom. 

1163
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:32,230
 Mom is a strong person, 

1164
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:36,690
 but her son's body is weak.
