 October 8, 1994
 Ssangmun-dong, Dobong-gu, Seoul 

5
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,370
Batman!

6
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,390
You don't look alike at all.

7
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,130
Really?

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,880
Keep trying.

9
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,960
Batman!

10
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,320
Who wants dinner now?

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,640
Teacher! Me, me! Teacher! Me, me!

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,130
Turn it off.

13
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,940
I'll be at Taek's.

14
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,730
Come home early! I think I'm going to forget what my second son looks like.

15
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,580
I'm meeting up with the gang, so I think I'll be late.

16
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,900
He hasn't seen them in so long. Why would he come home early?

17
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,450
Stay out late if you'd like. We can see you to our heart's content tomorrow.

18
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,410
I'm sorry. I'll get going now.

19
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,380
Okay, go ahead. I'm sure they're waiting.

20
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,150
This is that age when you want to spend all of your time with your friends, huh?

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,620
He was our child only when he was in our bosom.

22
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,550
Right. I liked it when he was in high school.

23
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,640
Those were good times.

24
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,680
I'm going out. I'm meeting the gang. I'm coming home late.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,430
Alright, have fun then.

26
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,770
OK. Have fun

27
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,350
Have a good time.

28
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,250
Bye.

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,430
What is it? Why are you standing there like that?

30
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,140
Go inside.

31
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,750
Okay. Get going.

32
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,100
Yeah.

33
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,050
What the heck is with that girl?

34
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,440
It's been so long since she came back. She can't have one meal with her family?

35
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,500
It's been a while since she's seen her friends.

36
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,600
Why? Do you feel hurt? Should I tell her to come home early?

37
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,830
Why would I feel hurt? I don't feel that way at all.

38
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm hungry. Just give me some food.

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,910
Let's wait to eat with Bo Ra. She should be here soon.

40
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,640
Did she call? Is she on her way home?

41
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,920
Oh, so she's going to sleep here tonight?

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,890
Don't come back, you brat!

43
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,820
Hey, it's been a week now. Are you that busy?

44
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,930
Yes, I am busy, Mom.

45
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,030
Jin Joo, aren't you going to say hello to your brother?

46
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,750
You've changed so much. I used to be your favorite person.

47
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,580
You act like you're the busiest person ever.

48
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,990
When you come home, all you do is sleep.

49
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,920
You think I should apologize first? But I don't want to.

50
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Just say sorry first. It makes you the bigger person.

51
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh, really? But then I would lose.

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,850
Jin Joo, you're speaking in informal speech!

53
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,490
Aren't you going to fix that? You want to get in trouble with me?

54
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,240
What's wrong with losing? Back when you fought with Gyeong Hee,

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,280
she apologized to you first.

56
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,680
Did you feel like Gyeong Hee was losing to you? You didn't, right?

57
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,780
You're right. Okay, okay.

58
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,520
Why isn't Taek here yet? Does he know that it's his birthday?

59
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,930
Of course, he knows that much.

60
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,680
Do you think he's struggling to park again?

61
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,590
Go outside, check on him.

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,940
Ah, that punk.

63
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,990
Hey, get out.

64
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,430
I'll park it. Go home ahead.

65
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,320
- I'll do it.
- Why, I ought to justâ€”

66
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,180
The family is waiting for you. Just go.

67
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,060
I'm home.

68
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,110
You're here?

69
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,710
Oppa, why are you so late? Japchae is probably cold now!

70
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,460
Get washed up. The kids will be here soon.

71
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,890
Okay.

72
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,760
Jin Joo, this is for you.

73
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,660
Oh, yeah!

74
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,480
 Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you! 

75
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,520
- Happy birthday, dear Taekie 

76
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,030
 Happy birthday to you 

77
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,290
Choi Taek, you need to get here earlier! You're not the only busy one here!

78
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,820
- Blow out the candles.
- One, two, three!

79
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,260
Hey, Jeong Pal. You bought it, right?

80
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,580
Yeah, here's your present.

81
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,410
Oh, Dog Jeong Pal, you bought a pretty one.

82
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:21,060
Are you a primitive man? You're probably the only person on earth without a beeper.

83
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,780
What's this? It's actually tasty! What the heck!

84
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,060
She goes to cooking school these days. We wrote our numbers there, so beep us.

85
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,860
I don't need a beeper.

86
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,580
We need it, okay? Really...

87
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,100
I don't know how to use it.

88
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,830
There isn't much to it. Just call the number that's flashing.

89
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,390
Alright.

90
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,530
I feel it every time I come here, but I really like this room.

91
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,790
What do you mean?

92
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,230
It never changes.

93
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,750
It's like my grandfather's place.

94
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,750
It's pleasant-tasting.

95
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, but honestly, you really need to buy a computer. The millennium is coming up.

96
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,830
Wow, you've improved a lot. You even know such terms.

97
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,670
Are you kidding me? My TOEIC score was 700.

98
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,920
Oh, Deok Sun ranked 989th.  What a success story!

99
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,130
Is Hyung Jeong Bong doing well? How is he doing, preparing for his bar exam?

100
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,320
Heedong, these days, my brother is a chat room administrator.

101
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,900
Hyung Jeong Bong leads a quiz room.

102
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,090
He's the leader of a chat room that learns through quizzes.

103
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,660
What?

104
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,370
My brother isn't studying. Just plays.

105
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,740
If you think about it, Noona Bo Ra really toughed it out.

106
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,270
She succeeded in the end, you know?

107
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,620
She lived in that dormitory room, and didn't even come home for the holidays.

108
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,820
She's scary. She really is.

109
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,680
She's so dogged. So dogged.

110
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,420
 Quiz Chat Room 

111
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,080
 Quiz Chat Room - Five Users 

112
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,580
Alright now.

113
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,190
 James Bond: 1. Commonality Quiz 

114
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,570
 James Bond: 2. Rubber
James Bond: 3. Mute 

115
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,940
 Little Mermaid: Give me sugar
James Bond: Give me sugar 

116
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,620
 Bob Lynch: Gloves 

117
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,260
Their levels are good.

118
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,470
Let's go.

119
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,320
Why is a boy singing on stage wearing a skirt?

120
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,240
It looks like girls would like him a lot.

121
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,460
But, he's handsome so he looks good even in a skirt.

122
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,510
He's even a singer-songwriter. He writes songs really well.

123
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,780
Kim Won Joon is actually burdened by his face.

124
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,930
He's not as burdened by his face as you are.

125
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,160
Why are you like this, Noona? My friends all tell me that I'm handsome.

126
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,340
Don't hang out with those kinds of kids.

127
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,790
They're not honest.

128
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,830
Bo Ra, do you still have some side dishes left? Did you not run out of kimchi?

129
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,870
Should I make some more for you?

130
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,890
What's Hyeon Jeong like? Don't you fight?

131
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,310
Do you always lock your doors?

132
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,120
Oh right. Washing machine. I always forget.

133
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,720
If you run the washing machine, you know you have to pour water and soak it.

134
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,010
Mom, one at a time.

135
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,360
Ask one at a time.

136
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,470
Really?

137
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,620
And big Noona is Seong Bo Ra. Even if you drop her in the Amazon she would survive.

138
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,910
Don't worry, Mom.

139
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,220
Yeah, I'm not a kid anymore. I eat and live well so don't worry about me.

140
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,910
You kids.

141
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,590
It's because your mom is extremely lonely.

142
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:47,380
Bo Ra, you come by every two to three weeks because you're with your friends.

143
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,030
Deok Seon frequently calls and says she can't come because she's staying at her friend's house near the airport.

144
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:58,000
No Eul always comes late because he's practicing for a show.

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,220
This half basement  is so lonely. It's a Buddhist Temple!

146
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,080
You should be the one to come home early! Every day there's some crisis.

147
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,420
Every day there's some accident and you come home past midnight.

148
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,980
If it's like recently, after you work so hard to earn money,  there won't be a need to move to an apartment.

149
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,860
Then, Mom, are you going to stay in this house forever?

150
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,330
- No! Of course not!
- You, seriously.

151
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,440
No.

152
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,680
Hello?

153
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,290
Yes, hold on.

154
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,440
Answer the phone.

155
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,660
Yes, speaking?

156
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,880
What?!?!

157
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,540
Oh, okay. I got it.

158
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,130
I'll be there soon.  I'll leave right now.

159
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,700
Why? Was there another accident?

160
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,300
My goodness.

161
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,510
The one in charge of Dongdaemun accounting

162
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,480
- ran off with one billion won. 
 - Oh my!

163
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,660
I'm going to have to go.

164
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,440
You should finish eating. Who knows when you would come back?

165
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,840
We don't know where he'll run to. I have to go and investigate.

166
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,290
Well, I'm sorry Bo Ra.

167
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,770
I'm going to have to go out. Finish eating... Where's my bag?

168
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,330
I'm getting so tried of this.

169
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:22,710
Sorry. Keep on eating.

170
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,860
Bye.

171
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,340
Dad's going to be retiring soon. Can't he transfer to another department?

172
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,540
Your dad still has a lot of energy in him.

173
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,480
He should earn more money while he can.

174
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,270
He still has a few years left in him. He's fine. He's invulnerable.

175
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,370
Where is Deok Seon, anyway? I thought she didn't have any flights today and tomorrow.

176
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,010
Where else? The neighborhood gang has gathered.

177
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,150
In Taek's room. It's 9-dan Choi Taek-nim's birthday today.

178
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:56,310
Jeong Hwan came to Seoul from Sacheon.  Dong Ryong left work early too.

179
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,390
Oh, right! Seon Woo left early too.

180
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,470
Seon Woo never seems to come home because he's always studying.

181
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,510
He must be here for Taek's birthday.

182
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,530
I guess.

183
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,560
He's a good-looking boy. Why isn't he dating?

184
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,840
What are you saying, Mom? I've seen him a few times. Seon Woo is good at dating.

185
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,040
Really?

186
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,030
Then, is Jeong Hwan the problem?

187
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:25,650
I guess it may be hard to date while living over in Sacheon.

188
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,270
Mom, just worry about your own daughters.

189
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,660
Why is it, that neither of my sisters ever bring home a single guy?

190
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,760
No one even dials the wrong number by accident.

191
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,010
Do you want to die?

192
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,820
The men in this country all have such good taste. They're so smart.

193
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,230
It's been a while, right? You must have a death wish.

194
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,310
Hey!

195
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,180
You're just asking for a beating.

196
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,370
Now this house feels alive again.

197
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,790
Hey, I'm really popular too!

198
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,180
I was supposed to meet him tomorrow for a movie. I'm the one who said no.

199
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,990
He was good-looking. Don't get dumped this time, Deok Seon.

200
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,450
Why would I get dumped? Who got dumped. I was always the one who did the dumping.

201
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,900
- Alright, alright. 
 - Sure, you dumped them.

202
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,280
This time, it was you who did the dumping.

203
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,680
Only then she has a fit of rage.

204
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,270
Geez. But when did you guys seem him?

205
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,090
Earlier, when he dropped you off.

206
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,380
We all saw him together.

207
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,890
Hey, he seemed normal.

208
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,260
Of course, he's normal. Why wouldn't he be?

209
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,090
The top unni?

210
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,990
Are you talking about the guy that your sunbae (senior at work)  introduced you to?

211
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,310
You're still waiting well. You haven't been dumped.

212
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,010
Seriously,

213
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,970
I don't get dumped! I was always the one who did the dumping!

214
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,210
- Okay! 
 - Why are you getting so worked up?

215
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,210
We got it.  Yeah, you're always the one who dumps.  You dumped him.

216
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,690
I'm being really serious.

217
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,290
Was I dumped?  I said I dumped them.  Me!  I dumped them!

218
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,930
We said, okay!

219
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,870
Deok Seon said she dumped them.

220
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,130
I dumped them! I did it!

221
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,610
Okay, but Deok Seon? You got dumped, right?

222
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,890
I was the one!

223
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,410
I dumped him. Seriously, I did.

224
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,450
Don't you think that I dance better than those people?

225
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,010
Do you even have to ask?

226
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,440
Hey, we're here!

227
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,830
What are you doing? Why is the door open? It's cold.

228
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,960
Because we knew you were coming!

229
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,490
This place is quiet too.

230
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,220
Yeah, without the kids around, it sure is quiet.

231
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,910
I called you to come over for some soju,

232
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,340
but the line was continuously busy. Did you leave the phone off the hook?

233
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,890
Oh, about that...

234
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,060
- It's him. 
 - Huh? What?

235
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,620
   

236
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,590
  James Bond: 1. Commonality Quiz

245
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,380
Aigoo. You haven't dealt yet.

246
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,320
Aren't you playing a round of Go Stop?

247
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,600
Teacher Ryoo said something came up in school.

248
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,870
I heard Section Chief Seong isn't home too.

249
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,830
If we don't have those two, it won't be any fun.

250
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,410
There was an article published about Taek earlier today, right?

251
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,390
Yes, did you see it already?

252
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,950
A famous actress said

253
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,930
Taek was her ideal type of guy.

254
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,460
We saw that too.

255
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,930
This isn't really news. It'll die down eventually.

256
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,990
If you can find someone good, just marry him off.

257
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,870
Oh, no, no. I don't like celebrities.

258
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,270
I would like it if he met a normal person.

259
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,470
I'd like that too.

260
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,210
And Taek will figure it out on his own.

261
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,500
I think he goes on a lot of blind dates, and even meetings for arranged marriages,

262
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,650
but the relationships don't last long.

263
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:33,050
Oh my, I thought Taek was just a naive boy, but he goes on meetings and dates?

264
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,120
He is at that age now!

265
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,500
Also, it doesn't help that he can't say no to people.

266
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,260
What happened if a president of something, or a senior, asks him?

267
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,080
He'll just go out, eat his meal, and come home.

268
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm sure that if he keeps that up, something is bound to happen.

269
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,840
I'm sure the kids are teasing him about this article, as we speak.

270
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,860
Hey, is Sim So Yeong crazy?

271
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,300
Why does she like him? Does she know that you can't tie your own shoelaces?

272
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,910
I'm disappointed in Sim So Yeong.

273
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,360
I was a  big fan of hers.

274
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,040
Hey, you go out on the most blind dates out of all of us.

275
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,990
So why are you so bad at dating?

276
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,930
Are you setting you sights too high?

277
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,770
Ah, you guys must not know him very well.

278
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,400
You be quiet.

279
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,120
He keeps getting dumped.

280
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,450
Why?

281
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,380
At first, they meet him, and they're amazed.

282
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,600
But after a while, they get frustrated.

283
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,910
He doesn't talk!

284
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,240
Oh, you punk.

285
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,200
I tried very hard.

286
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,510
- Hey, try harder! 
 - You have to try harder!

287
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,730
- Deok Seon? 
 - Yeah.

288
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,390
Why don't you set something up for us?

289
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,930
Forget it. I don't want to get cursed because of you guys.

290
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,450
What's wrong with us? A four-way date, including Taekâ€” what do you think?

291
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,230
you're okay with it, right?

292
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,490
If I have time.

293
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,560
Jeong Pal, you said you're training in Seoul for a bit. You join in too.

294
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,460
I don't want to. What for? It's going to go downhill once I go to Sacheon anyway.

295
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,010
Sacheon, Sacheon, Sacheon!

296
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,610
You have no romantic sense.

297
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,910
Hey, Jeong Pal, turn some music on. Is there some CD?

298
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,190
What CD? As if Taek would have some CDs.

299
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,410
Then put on anything then.

300
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,340
Ohhh! Jeong Pal, good! I'm sleeping.

301
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,180
Deok Seon, sleep here. Okay?

302
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,800
It's not like I'm seeking for things to stop me from getting married. I will go after this song.

303

 Episode 18
Goodbye First Love 

315
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,780
What about Bo Ra's father? He still goes to work even if it's Sunday?

316
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,140
He goes right away when there's an accident in the bank.

317
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,290
My husband is working for money until his bones break.

318
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,510
I need to feed him some tonics.

319
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,080
Ah! There's this thing, Hyungnim.

320
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,290
I don't feel it's a waste to spend money on my kids,

321
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:04,120
but strangely I feel so if it's for my husband.

322
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,110
Everyone is like that.

323
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,540
When Jeong Bong and Jeong Hwan comes late at night and ask me to make them food,

324
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,940
I just throw off the blanket

325
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,810
and I even make some food that I don't even make on my mother-in-law's memorial rites.

326
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,790
But when Jeong Bong's dad asks in the middle of the night for ramyun,

327
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:29,100
I justâ€” Suddenlyâ€” The rage is justâ€” It rises up!

328
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,920
I just kick him right there.

329
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,050
But then,

330
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,830
even if I kick him like that,

331
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,140
my husband is pitiful.

332
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,880
He works hard to earn money and I can't even make him that ramyun.

333
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,350
Right, even if I say that I should just understand and endure

334
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,840
when he asks to make something in the middle of the night,

335
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,890
the rage is justâ€”

336
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,230
It's justâ€” It's so hot!

337
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,820
Hyungnim, it's cold. Wear your jacket and stop getting mad.

338
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,880
Jeong Hwan is coming home in a while.

339
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,170
Did you look at your youngest son as much as your heart's content?

340
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,440
Yeah.

341
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,550
The back of his head only.

342
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:23,880
But he's in Seoul after a while so he has a lot of appointments and has a lot to buy.

343
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,890
I can't see his face that much.

344
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,150
Why won't he?

345
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,170
At such a young age, he's always seeing soldiers at Sacheon.

346
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,700
How good would it feel to come to Seoul?

347
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,300
And he also likes his friends so much.

348
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,170
Did you look at Taek and Seon Woo's face a lot?

349
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,050
Among them, those two are the busiest.

350
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:48,290
I have seen them a lot. I have seen them while their eyes were closed.

351
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,070
Taek.

352
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,040
Taek, let's eat breakfast.

353
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,590
It seems like he lost weight.

354
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,840
Seems like his cheeks are sunken.

355
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,830
And he's lost weight on his nose.

356
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,880
Is that so?

357
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,120
Oppa. He's not dead, right?

358
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,360
He's not. He's breathing.

359
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,060
I think he's dead.

360
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,840
In our house, there's also one who's always sleeping.

361
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,510
Oh! I know.

362
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,290
Our Deok Seon is so diligent so there's no way it's her.

363
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,480
It's Bo Ra, right? Bo Ra?

364
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,830
But then, is Bo Ra going to be a prosecutor?

365
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,780
Judge? Lawyer?

366
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,260
Her dream is to be a prosecutor.

367
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,060
Doesn't she have a record from doing this?

368
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,260
The administration has changed so it's okay.

369
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,720
Anything is fine. I am okay with anything.  Anything.

370
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,450
Congratulations.

371
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,700
When would my Jeong Bong... Aigoo.

372
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,620
Aigoo, Hyungnim. You would fly with that sigh.

373
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,660
Will you get drunk by drinking that?

374
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:22,200
 Judicial Research And Training Institute 

375
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,840
What's that?

376
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,540
Wedding invitation. It's the 6th couple I have made.

377
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,960
You are really talented.

378
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,140
I must have talent for this thing and not law.

379
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,710
You know the blind date on Sunday, right?

380
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,750
It's just this once. I really don't like things like this.

381
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,330
Alright, alright.

382
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,860
But then, Bo Ra.

383
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,080
It's a younger man.

384
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,100
What?

385
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,700
You hit the jackpot. Yonsei University 3rd year Med student, three years younger.

386
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:07,080
It's my Oppa's cherished student. He's a genius. A genius.

387
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,010
I am introducing him to you because it's you.

388
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,320
But then... His nickname is...

389
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,630
Trash.

390
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,680
What?

391
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,860
It's okay. It's Trash, but a genius. A genius trash.

392
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,680
Hey, it's better for a guy to be like that.

393
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,890
If a person is so proper and clean, then it would be tiring for you.

394
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:38,110
First, meet him once. Okay?

395
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,430
Okay, for now.

396
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,110
Hey, Michael, did you get the copies of previous exams in hemotology?

397
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,490
This bastard, can you sleep at this time?

398
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:11,240
Seon Woo, the most important thing in life is not studying.

399
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,360
It's connection. Greeting them properly.

400
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,390
Don't you know?

401
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:22,020
Okay. So did you get it? I heard you two are close.

402
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,010
It's about time he came.

403
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,500
Aigoo! President Kim!

404
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,430
Aigoo! President Kim!

405
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,270
Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you!

406
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,760
Did you bring the thing?

407
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,560
Give me the money, 30 trillion 610 million.

408
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,800
Okay. I will deposit it in your account.

409
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,790
Here. 
  9013 Kim Jae Joon 

410
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,260
Thank you. I will repay your kindness.

411
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,620
Are you making it obvious you're a Seoulite. What kindness to repay?

412
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,860
Hey! What's your pager number?

413
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,450
You have a coupon to pay me. You have to pay me.

414
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,920
Okay. 015-273-0917.

415
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,740
- 0917? 
 - Yeah.

416
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,350
Okay.

417
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,470
Michael, I'm going. Professor is calling me.

418
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,260
Work hard.

419
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,490
Thank you!

420
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,230
It was nice meeting you. It was nice meeting you.

I... Wake me up early in the morning.

428
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,010
I have important documents to prepare at the bank.

â™¬   That it's better being  alone feeling tranquil  â™¬

439

Jeong Hwan said he's going to be late today.

440
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,850
After training, he's stopping by Dong Ryong's shop to have a drink.

441
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,620
Aiyoo, I made his favorite braised cutlass fish.

442
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,320
I'll just make him eat it tomorrow for breakfast.

443
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,870
Jeong Bong, are you done?

444
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,440
Wash all those that are beside the end of the sink.

445
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:54,280
Mother, do you have anything you would ask me to do?

446
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,670
Yes, there is one.

447
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,990
Yes, what?

448
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,760
Study.

449
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,180
- Then.
- Go.

450
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,440
 Gam Po Myun Ok 

451
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,570
Let's go.

452
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,840
We ate well.

453
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,200
Only when we're paying.

454
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,900
How much is it?

455
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,040
Let's see. Fresh kalbi for 5, 3 bottles of soju.

456
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,930
We also had 3 bottles of cola.

457
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,540
We will give you the 3 bottles of cola for free.

458
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:45,640
Here, then. 60,500 won plus 6,000 won.

459
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,920
Then it would be 71,000 won. I'll just get 70,000 won.

460
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,440
70,000... 4, 5, 6...

461
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,880
Here it is.

462
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,060
Yes, thank you.

463
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,520
- May you sell a lot.
- Yes.

464
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,540
Hyung! I will finish things up so you can go ahead.

465
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,540
Okay, I will go first. Jeong Hwan,

466
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,720
drink all the alcohol in our store today, okay?

467
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,790
Yes, Hyungnim. Thank you.

468
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,030
What about the others?

469
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,510
They'll be here soon.

470
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,840
Is that so?

471
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,590
Aigoo. These punks, when did you grow up to drink alcohol?

472
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,090
Ooohh!

473
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,690
Hey, you also bought Park Jin Young's first album?

474
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,280
Yes. I bought it together with Moon Sae Hyungnim's book.

475
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,010
Park Jin Young's songs are so good.

476
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,070
Do they have audio system on the combat plane, too.

477
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:51,240
You could use it in battle.

478
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,410
Crazy bastard.

479
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,820
Hey, do you remember meeting Park Jin Young in Teco back in high school?

480
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,780
Number two.

481
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,490
Whoa. Your brain seriously.

482
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:06,340
Now that I think about it, I went against someone really great, right?

483
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,710
What do you mean went against? You ran away.

484
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,100
I can't act cool with you guys.

485
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,040
What are you reading? What are you looking at? Are you taking the college entrance exams?

486
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,500
Seriously.

487
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,660
It was here.

488
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,060
What is happy in this?

489
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,850
Seriously.

490
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,560
The book that you should not read is this book.
 Book's title: "Nice to meet you, Logic" 

491
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,400
You are very unromantic.

492
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,740
But why are you not dating?

493
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,770
Why? I do.

494
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,740
What the heck. Going on a blind date once or twice

495
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,050
and meeting one or two months, you call that dating?

496
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,900
You don't even go on blind dates.

497
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,570
Don't make being in Sacheon an excuse.

498
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:54,760
All those who are in Sacheon meet and date well.

499
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,980
What's with you?

500
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,430
You still have the ring that you got from the graduation, right?

501
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,950
What? The Fiancee ring?

502
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,410
Whoa! The name is a work of art. Give it to me.

503
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,090
That graduation ring, it's been year and you still have it.

504
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,700
Give it to just anyone.

505
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,590
I don't even have a girlfriend, so who do I give it to?

506
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,390
Should I just give it to a girl I just met? So embarrassing.

507
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:28,290
It's more embarrassing that you're still holding on to it.

508
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:33,600
Who is that? Her. The one I saw last time. You should have given it to her. She's alright.

509
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,850
Bastard who won't be able to confess until he dies. A punk with no romance.

510
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,520
I will give it to you. You can have it.

511
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,600
Oh! Really? You're giving it to me?

512
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:51,180
I will give it to my next girlfriend. We should get married, have kids... I'm doomed.

513
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,420
Thank you for taking care of it.

514
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,640
Hey, hey. Let's drink together, Lieutenant Kim. Wait. Lieutenant Kim. Let's have a drink together.

515
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,220
I... think I know.

516
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,210
I think I know the reason why you can't date.

517
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,500
Wait. The reason why you can't date is...

518
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,560
What's that? Let's see.

519
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,230
Where are you Jeong Hwan? Where are you?

520
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,630
What on earth are you doing?

521
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,460
This punk is a wacko.

522
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,250
You're the last again today. Let's go out together.

523
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,980
Should I give you a ride?

524
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,160
Thank you, but no thanks.

525
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,540
And also, my girlfriend is waiting downstairs.

526
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,300
Oh, is the top flight attendant here? It'll be far, all the way to Hongik-dong.

527
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,670
Hello, Choi Taek 9-dan. We're seeing each other again.

528
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,620
Hello.

529
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,020
Ah, I thought you're meeting up with Deok Seon today.

530
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,360
Yes, we are going to see the rest of the guys.

531
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,510
I really should buy Ms. Deok Seon a meal sometime.

532
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,520
It's okay. I introduced her to my college junior.

533
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,300
Ah, I think those two are going on  a date these days.

534
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,860
Anyway she said they watched  a movie last week together.

535
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,990
I am pushing them together. I even gave them Lee Seung Hwan concert tickets today.

536
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,830
Ah. The concert is on Sunday this week. Would you like to go?

537
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,460
I'm close with someone who organizes the concert so I can get tickets.

538
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,470
I will treat you with concert tickets.

539
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,310
No. I'm good.

540
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,090
You need to drag him to go.

541
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,710
Then, do well on your date.

542
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,850
Please send my regards to Ms. Deok Seon.

543
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,520
Yes.

544
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,330
Should we go, too?

545
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,790
Yes.

546
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,380
Master Choi.

547
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,040
It's nice since Jeong Pal is in Seoul, we get to see each other's faces.

548
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,520
Hey, but then I brought my car.

549
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,820
You can let Deok Seon drive. Deok Seon quit drinking.

550
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,750
Why? Did something happen?

551
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:20,640
- I don't think she'll last.
- I think it's a lie.
- I know, right?

552
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,530
She used to not be able to drink a drop of alcohol. Now she's all grown up and drinking.

553
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,620
Our Soo Yeon.

554
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,170
Soo Yeon?

555
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,700
I haven't heard that in a long time. Seong Soo Yeon. How did you remember that?

556
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,140
Hey, I don't know if that fortune teller is doing well,

557
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,490
but she got all the fortunes right.

558
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,060
Guys, hello! I'm here.

559
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,640
Soo Yeon, it's been a long time.

560
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,630
Seong Soo Yeon!

561
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,110
Seong Soo Yeon!

562
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,020
Hurry. Why are you here only now?

563
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,910
- Seong Soo Yeon 
 -Those... I ought to kill them.

564
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,480
I should move to another neighborhood. You guys have nothing you don't know about me.

565
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,320
Hey! How do you change identities?

566
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,860
Damn it.

567
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:05,020
Why are you drinking cola? Did you really quit drinking?

568
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,210
I'm taking tonics these days.

569
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:11,190
To be healthier? You are healthy enough now and you still want to be healthier?

570
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,210
Then what happens?

571
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,430
It seems like everything is going well recently with that person that you're dating.

572
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,810
It's obvious. They're only for a month.

573
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,550
What's with you? I might be cold rice here, but I'm popular in other places.

574
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,000
- Where?
 - Hey!

575
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,640
Hey, humanely, let's not lie to each other.

576
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,640
These guys, seriously!

577
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,610
This week on Sunday, I'm going to watch a concert with that person.

578
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,880
You're lying!

579
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,070
That's true. I heard from Section Chief Yoo earlier.

580
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:43,630
You see that? See? What do you take Seong Deok Seon for?

581
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:47,030
What's wrong with you? I'm a woman who's busy on the weekends.

582
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,910
I am not in the position to be watching a movie with my childhood friends.

583
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,560
- Hey, but it's Sunday?
- Yeah.

584
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,680
You want to go too?

585
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,260
We were going to watch a movie together after a while, Forrest Gump!

586
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,630
I saw that already.

587
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,810
Hey! Seriously! No loyalty!

588
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:06,130
I watched with that person. Why would I watch it with you? Such a waste of time.

589
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,060
- I also saw it.
- Hey!

590
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,010
Hey!

591
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:16,220
I forgot. I'm sorry. The people from the association asked to watch.

592
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,330
Hey, I haven't seen it. What about you, Jeong Pal?

593
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,200
Me too.

594
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,460
Hey, it's not right for three men to watch a movie together.

595
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,070
What picture would that be?

596
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,370
What is this? You see me as a woman now?

597
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:40,490
Okay then. I will cancel the Lee Seung Hwan concert and go to the movies with you guys.

598
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,810
I can't do anything about it.

599
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:47,160
Hey! Get out!

600
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,960
- Go now! 
  - Just go. I will go with No Eul.

601
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,920
I will go with my dad then.

602
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,170
- Don't go. 
I should just go with Hyung Jeong Bong.

603
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,890
Is Hyung Jeong Bong well?

604
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:58,630
- Aren't you leaving?
- Stop saying 'that person.'

605
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,620
Hey, give me alcohol.

606
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,450
No. You need to drive.

607
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,120
What's with that hat? Just draw a painting.

608
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,570
I don't want to go home. I really don't want to...

609
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:18,820
My dad... My dad is home.

610
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,690
I'm going.

611
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,030
Wow.

612
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,030
It's been so long since it was like this. Makes you think of the past, right?

613
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,070
In the past, it was fun even though we were ignorant.

614
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,270
Right, Deok Seon? Rank 989th, that time was better, right?

615
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,090
He's so wasted. He's blabbering nonsense.

616
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,410
Hurry and go in. They'll wake up.

617
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:59,410
I'm going. I will be going and waking up my dad.

618
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,740
Take care. Goodbye my friend.

619
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,060
It's friends not friend. It's plural you stupid.

620
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,690
Okay! Goodbye! Goodbye my friends.

621
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,990
Dad!

622
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,650
Go.

623
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,960
Mom, I'm here.

624
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,010
Now, regularly

625
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:03,140
my daughter comes home. So good.

626
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:09,070
Aigoo. My mom is good too. Taking medications regularly.

627
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,590
Of course. Who gave it after all. I should take it diligently.

628
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:20,600
What's with Dad these days? He looks so bad.

629
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,370
These days, he's busy. There is someone running away with money every day.

630
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:28,980
Aigoo. It's hectic.

631
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,410
Isn't it about time for him to stop working?

632
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:35,640
Unni is earning and I am too. He doesn't look so good.

633
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,710
You're saying all sorts of things.

634
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:44,420
Your dad, if he quits work then he would get sick.

635
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:50,270
It's okay. Anyway I will feed him some tonics tomorrow.

636
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,230
Okay.

637
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,350
 Freshmint 

638
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,280
 Lee Seung Hwan Concert 

639
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,940
Is that Jeong Hwan?

640
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:33,220
Yes. Good night.

641
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,140
Okay.

642
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,950
Sleep well, my son.

643
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,620
Yes.

644
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,510
You're coming home now.

645
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:04,120
Yes. You're not asleep yet?

646
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,900
I'm going to sleep now. Did you drink?

647
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,100
Yes, a bit.

648
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,050
Then, don't take sleeping pills before you go to bed, okay?

649
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:18,180
And alcohol is better than sleeping pills. Okay?

650
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,250
Yes. Hurry and sleep.

651
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,010
Okay.

652
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:54,980
â™«   It rained yesterday, you knew it too    â™«
â™«   Behind You - Park Jin Young    â™«

653
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:05,480
â™«   I cried when I turned at the side street    â™«

654
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:14,600
â™«   It's always hard when I'm looking at you    â™«

655
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:24,800
â™«   Now already  the feeling of separation is here    â™«

656
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:35,410
â™«   For you, it's never enough, I know it's because of me    â™«

657
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:43,230
â™«   You are leaving now, I can't hold on to you    â™«

 Bong Hwang Dang 

677
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:36,940
Principal, you should sleep in. Today is a Sunday.

678
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,510
Look who's talking.  It's Sunday and if you close the doors, will something be taken?

679
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,660
There's no customers so why bother opening the store?

680
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,450
If I don't do this, I think I would grow old right away.

681
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,580
Yes.

682
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:02,260
You would get sick like this. You work even on Sunday.

683
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:07,130
Aigoo. This person. It's just for a bit. I'll be gone just for a bit after I eat.

684
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,070
Aigoo. I can't live.

685
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:14,920
That... Wife...

686
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:20,220
Just... I'm just saying this.

687
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:25,210
You might have heard about it too.

688
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,250
What? What about?

689
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,690
It's called voluntary early retirement.

690
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:37,720
There's only about four years before my retirement.

691
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:42,300
If I get early retirement they would give double the retirement pay.

692
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,830
No. You can never do that.

693
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:50,910
That... Of course I can't. That's why I didn't mention it.

694
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:53,360
I was just saying.

695
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,180
We still haven't had one of our daughters married off.

696
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,160
What would the in-laws think. Would you say that they have an unemployed in-law?

697
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,130
You can never do that. There's No Eul, too.

698
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:08,140
Before the kids get married you should hang in there no matter what.  Get that?

699
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,910
Aigoo. Okay. I will hang in there no matter what.

700
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,690
I was just saying it.

701
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:20,410
Oh my, look at the time.

702
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,450
Why? Eat more.

703
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,040
No, I will be right back.

704
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,290
I will be going. I will be going to the gathering then watching movie with the guys.

705
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:42,280
Oh. Be careful of cars.

706
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,220
Drive carefully.

707
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,560
Slowly, okay? Drive slowly.

708
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,180
Okay. Am I a kid?

709
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,190
 Lee Seung Hwan Concert 

710
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,640
 The first message. 

711
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,300
 I'm really sorry. I think I can't watch the concert today. 

712
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,280
 Because my personal circumstance have caused you trouble, 

713
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,030
 I really have nothing to say. 

714
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:59,070
 I'm really sorry. 

715
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,720
Deok Seon. Go and buy some bean sprouts.

716
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,520
Oh right, you were going somewhere, right?

717
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,390
No. I will go buy bean sprouts. Do you have anything else that you need?

718
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:27,120
Then on the way, can you buy some pork. Wait, I will give you money.

719
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,320
No, no. I have money.

720
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,110
Bean sprouts, pork, right?

721
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,860
Hey stop blabbering and go. Don't be late later.

722
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,330
Okay. There's still a lot of time.

723
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:42,590
Taek, hurry and go.

724
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,380
Yeah.

725
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,420
Hey! What's with you?

726
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,850
You said you were going to a concert!

727
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,990
Why do you still look like that?

728
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:14,410
Ahhh! You got dumped again.

729
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:19,130
You did come home alone yesterday.

730
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,730
You got dumped. You did.

731
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,890
That's not true. I'm going to the concert right now.

732
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:26,450
That's a great outfit for a concert.

733
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,110
I have to run along with Oppa Seung Hwan.

734
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:31,230
Is that it?

735
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,250
Get in. I'll drive you there.

736
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:36,610
- Deal.
- Get in.

737
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:41,290
Open it gently.

738
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:44,350
Shut it gently, seriously.

739
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:48,770
Let's go. Deok Seon, my Ferrari can be a little rough, so you hold on tight.

740
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:51,980
Alright, let's go!

741
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,660
See you later, Jeong Pal.

742
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,900
Okay.

743
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,310
Yeah, let's go!

744
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,240
Oh, hey... it's raining outside.

745
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,130
What are you talking about? The sun was just shining.

746
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:32,820
I suppose a tiger is getting married today. When is Seon Woo getting here anyway?

747
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,840
He said he would work only in the morning.

748
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,410
Hold on a minute.

749
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,380
 I gave him your number, so he'll beep you when he arrives. 

750
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:11,410
 Kim Jae Joon, 012-387-0527 

751
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:24,940
 â™« Dear, are you trying to come back to my side?â™« 

752
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:35,280
 â™« Are you wandering about cause you're unsure whether I love you?â™« 

753
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:46,700
 â™« Though it can't be the same as it was in the beginningâ™« 

754
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:57,750
 â™« But just like how winter melts and turns to spring, you just may come to me â™« 

755
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:08,410
 â™« Our time of separation, think of it as a long night â™« 

756
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:12,350
 â™« My feeling for you... â™« 

757
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,870
Is it showering this afternoon?

758
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,830
What about 9-dan Choi Taek?

759
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:18,870
He's in the bathroom.

760
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,810
What?

761
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,350
Isn't that two-timing?

762
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:43,690
It's not really two-timing.

763
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:48,460
I didn't know either that he had a long-time girlfriend.

764
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:53,820
He got into a big fight with her and went on the blind date out of anger.

765
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,890
Geez, I feel so bad for Deok Seon.

766
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:59,690
Then, is Deok Seon waiting by herself right now? Did he contact her?

767
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:03,290
Of course, he's not that awful.

768
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:06,610
He left her a voice mail on the beeper, saying that he couldn't go to the concert.

769
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,850
Aigoo, that's a relief.

770
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:13,940
But Deok Seon is behaving quite pitifully. She went to watch it on her own.

771
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:18,280
- What?
- She said the tickets would go to waste. If it were me, I would never go.

772
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,440
Why would you introduce her to a junior like that?

773
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:36,880
Who was it?

774
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,920
Seon Woo. He can't come.

775
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,420
What? Why?

776
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,860
An appointment came up.

777
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,780
What appointment, all of a sudden?

778
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:46,170
Isn't it obvious?

779
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:53,550
Do... Do I really have to watch this with you?

780
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:04,620
Oh! Isn't that the guy that Deok Seon was set up with?

781
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,320
Why is that jerk here right now?

782
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,260
That punk...

783
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:22,550
Ah! Deok Seon got dumped again. Geez, that idiot.

784
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:33,810
Jeong Pal, don't you think I look a little bit like Tom Hanks?

785
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,770
Hey, Jeong Pal, give me the pamphlet.

786
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:49,360
 You did come home alone yesterday. You got dumped. You did. 

787
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,540
 That's not true. I'm going to the concert right now. 

788
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,080
 That's a great outfit for a concert! 

789
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,560
 I have to run along with Oppa Seung Hwan. 

790
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,390
 Forrest Gump 

791
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:10,330
Wow, Jeong Pal! That's all CG.

792
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:13,960
Hollywood's technology is just, wow...

793
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,050
Hey!

794
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,490
Where?

795
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,150
Sorry.

796
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:08,470
 Press one to page, press two to leave a message... 

797
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:11,610
Hey, Joey Wong. This is a rare opportunity.

798
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:14,480
These are free tickets... Free tickets! Run over here!

799
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,530
And bring some clothes and shoes when you come here, okay?

800
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:21,210
Hurry up and come, okay? You have to come!

801
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:23,390
 â™« Our time of separation, think of it as a long night â™« 

802
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:32,850
 â™« My feeling for you lingers like this â™« 

803
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:43,690
 â™« Why are you hesitating? Don't look back â™« 

804
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:59,080
 â™« Compared to the days we were apart, we have more  days to be together â™« 

805
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:11,270
 â™« Dear, are you trying to come back to my side? â™« 

806
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:22,680
 â™« Just as you are now, you may come to me â™« 

807
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,810
Excuse me. The show is going to start soon.

808
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,890
Your boyfriend must not be here yet.

809
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:13,550
â™¬  Just now I knew  that your eyes were cold  â™¬

810
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,960
Are you 'Trash?'

811
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:06,130
What are you?

812
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:11,710
How come are you here?

813
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,910
 Fate does not find you on your own will 

814
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:33,400
 if you are going to use the term 'fate' it has to be a rare moment that comes to you. 

815
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,780
 That way it is fate. 

816
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:41,560
 That is why another name for fate is timing. 

817
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:54,350
 If ever, today I wasn't caught by the many traffic lights, 

818
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:58,990
 if that damned red light helped just once, 

819
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:03,480
 I might be standing if front of her just like fate. 

820
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:11,060
 My first love has always been grabbed by that beggar-like timing. 

821
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,340
 That damned timing. 

822
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,340
Are you 'Trash?'

823
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,570
What are you?

824
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:53,230
Why are you here, Noona?

825
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:55,610
You answer me.

826
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,780
 Hey, what is your beeper number? 

827
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:07,340
 You have a coupon to give me. You need to repay me. 

828
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,600
 Okay. 

829
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,740
 015-273-0017 

830
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:14,520
 0917? 

831
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,300
 Okay. 

832
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:23,520
 Michael, I'm going. Professor is calling me. 

833
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,580
 You get that? 

834
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:36,880
 I especially cherish you so I'm getting you a blind date. 

835
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,640
 Yes. 

836
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:44,220
 Aish! Seriously! 

837
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:53,880
 Ouch! 

838
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,410
 Mom! 

839
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,880
 Are you very hurt? 

840
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,420
 In front of Twins' Supermarket, you said? 

841
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,220
 I will be going there now. 

842
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:32,210
 You have one message. 

843
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:37,390
 Hey! It's me, 'Trash' Kim Jae Joon. Let me use your coupon today. 

844
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:40,070
 Can you go to the blind date in my place. 

845
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,570
 Today, at Myeongdong at 5. 

846
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:45,530
 I will buy you a meal next time. Help me, classmate. 

847
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:49,720
 Something important happened. I ask this of you. 

848
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,100
 Twin's Supermarket 

849
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,980
 Jeong. 

850
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,870
 Twin's Supermarket 

851
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,120
 Next is Baduk News. 

852
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:35,550
 On May 16 , at the Original Special Baduk Club in Hongik Dong, 

853
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:38,850
 at the opening of the  five final matches for the Bacchus Cup for the first time in Korea 

854
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:44,570
 the top Korean Baduk player Choi Taek 9-dan has forfeited. 

855
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:48,970
 This is the first forfeit in Choi Taek's professional career. 

856
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:55,090
 The Association explained the situation and they asked the understanding of the opponent, Im Ji Won. 

857
01:15:55,090 --> 01:16:00,400
 The reason was said to be personal and was not explained further. 

858
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,680
 The managers of Choi Taek who is usually self-disciplined declined to comment ...  

859
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:10,590
 But then, fate and timing are not coincidences that find you. 

860
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:16,330
 They are miraculous moments made by desperate decisions. 

861
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:23,680
 Giving up and making a decision without hesitation makes timing. 

862
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:28,640
 That punk was more desperate and I should have mustered up more courage. 

863
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:35,230
 The bad one was not the traffic light... Not timing... 

864
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,840
 But it was my countless hesitations. 

865
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,570
You are really great.

866
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:07,900
How could you... a person with the same school, major as me

867
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:11,500
and a classmate at that, how could you go on a blind date with him?

868
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:17,070
I guess I must not bother you at all.

869
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,210
In the 1% probability that you would be the one to come.

870
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:34,190
But then they said that the nickname was 'Trash.'

871
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:38,800
'Ah, so the 1% is gone.'

872
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:48,240
But then I thought again. Then I should bet on another 1%.

873
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:54,690
I hope you hear about it.

874
01:17:54,690 --> 01:18:00,760
Since you are from the same school and same major classmates. I hope you hear about it.

875
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:07,080
I hope you hear about it and it may just be a 1% probability.

876
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,790
Perhaps if you still like me,

877
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,720
I thought we could maybe start over again.

878
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,670
I came with that hope.

879
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:36,320
Seon Woo... I know it may sound crazy, but

880
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,070
I missed you.

881
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:14,810
 1994 Lee Seung Hwan Live Concert 

882
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:18,900
Hey! But I really wasn't stood up.

883
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,080
Yeah I know.

884
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:24,550
He was supposed to come but then he was in an accident on the way here. A big accident.

885
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:31,340
I'm not cold.

886
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:34,470
I feel hot, that's why. Wear it.

887
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:37,550
I really was not stood up.

888
01:19:55,570 --> 01:20:02,570
 â™« The days I waited and the days that will be erased. They were all hours that were for you â™« 

889
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:06,280
 Life is like a box of chocolates. 

890
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:10,140
 Before you open it, you don't know what you'll get. 

891
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:16,630
 Even if you get a bitter chocolate, you have no choice. 

892
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:20,690
 That is the fate that I have chosen. 

893
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:30,990
 There is no regretting, whining and heart aches. 

894
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:39,130
 â™« Why can't I say those words that I love you? In front of you whom I desired â™« 

895
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:46,840
 â™« When the saved time is now gone too â™« 

896
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:52,740
Uh?
 â™« I still canâ€™t get enough of â™« 

897
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,640
Lee Seung Hwan.

898
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,130
They play really old songs here.

899
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:04,590
I went to really a lot of Lee Seung Hwan's concerts.

900
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:07,570
These days, I listen to him too.

901
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:14,140
But then, aren't there too many interviews?

902
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:17,680
Anyway, I feel sorry to my husband.

903
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:21,700
It's okay for you to keep on asking me,

904
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:24,100
but my husband hates having interviews,

905
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:30,340
and he's just doing this because my sister asked a favor.

906
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:33,690
I am fine with it.

907
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:37,750
I'm working as a ground crew now, so I have time.

908
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:40,610
Oh, you're here.

909
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,520
Say hello.

910
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,260
 â™« Your face, your name â™« 

911
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,360
Oh, you're here again.

912
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,230
 â™« Your stories, all the fond days of the past â™« 

913
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:54,330
Please do a good job.

914
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:59,040
 â™« It seemed like love came true â™« 

915
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:03,930
 â™« But the only thing remaining is the break up that waits for me â™« 

916
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:10,070
You can head home first.

917
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:12,330
I won't bother you today. You can go work.

918
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:14,680
It's not a bother. I like interviews.

919
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,470
It's fine. You can go.

920
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:20,090
- I'll go now.
- Okay.

921
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:22,200
Hey!

922
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:25,280
Honey, can you throw out the garbage in the food waste bin?

923
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,260
I did that already.

924
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,280
I did that on the way to the comic book store.

925
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:34,980
Hey, stop reading comic books.

926
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:38,120
You didn't borrow those weird comics again, did you?

927
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,890
Stop reading comic books. Think of your image.

928
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:46,100
Okay.

929
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:47,580
Work hard.

930
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,190
I'm going.

931
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:57,050
 â™« The words that were late and that confession has already been left behind â™« 

932
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:13,610
What is this? Why are you doing this? It's so scary.

933
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:19,300
Taek is sleeping and you are too. Did you come here to sleep?

934
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:23,480
Oppa, if you're only going to sleep, why do you bother coming home?

935
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:29,190
It's because I'm so tired. I sleep best at home.

936
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:30,910
Let me sleep for just a bit.

937
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:35,630
If not now, when would I be able to sleep in?

938
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,560
Mom! I'm hungry!

939
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,800
Give me food!

940
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,460
I think I'm hungry!

941
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:09,670
That startled me. What are you doing here?

942
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:13,070
Son, eat breakfast. It's all ready.

943
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:14,830
You should have just woke me up.

944
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:18,690
We didn't wake you up on purpose, so you could sleep in.

945
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:24,800
But why are you standing there? You could just wake me up.

946
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,060
I will be out.

947
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,260
Hurry out.

948
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:35,290
Mom, made braised silver hairtail that my son likes.

949
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,680
That startled me!

950
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:57,520
Hey, when did you come in?

951
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,860
Then you, when did you come in?

952
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:01,690
You?

953
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:04,570
Should I warm up my body in a long while?

954
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:08,050
What's wrong with you? We're growing old already.

955
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,060
You're asking for it. You want to die.

956
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:14,810
Why are you hitting me?

957
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,130
Why hit you? Because you did something wrong, that's why!

958
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:19,070
Why are you hitting me so early in the morning?

959
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:21,670
There's nothing you can't say to your sister! Am I your friend?

960
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:25,730
Hey! Unni!

961
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:31,320
Seriously! You're making a fuss even when you're old! Hurry and eat!

962
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:38,040
But then, it seems like a house where people live.

963
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:42,400
But Noona Deok Seon , I think she's doing that on purpose to get hit.

964
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,700
When you think about it, it happens every time.

965
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:49,540
But why is Bo Ra's voice like that?

966
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:52,770
Her voice sounds weak.

967
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:56,330
I think her voice sounds weaker than before.

968
01:25:56,330 --> 01:26:00,660
Aigoo. These days, it seems like her stamina has weakened.

969
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:05,460
This person, if her stamina doubles then she would eat up her sister.

970
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,300
Dad! Nosebleed.

971
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:13,490
Aigoo! Nosebleed.

972
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:15,880
Oh my.

973
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,120
Tilt your head back.

974
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:22,080
I must have picked my nose too much.

975
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,850
Hurry and eat!

976
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:25,850
No, no.

977
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:34,650
Is Jeong Hwan already heading back?

978
01:26:34,650 --> 01:26:38,620
Yes, training is over. He's going back to Sacheon tomorrow morning.

979
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:41,740
Anyway, we're going to have drinks with the guys later.

980
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,440
Can you come?

981
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:47,800
I have a competition, but I think it will end early. I think I can go.

982
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,740
Why are you the only one having so many competitions? Cut it down.

983
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,570
Yes. I get it.

984
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:55,110
Just your luck.

985
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:59,680
Oppa, if you're just going to sleep at home, then don't bother coming home.

986
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:00,920
Hey.

987
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,700
Are you the only one studying?

988
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:06,820
Eat and sleep again, understand?

989
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:11,570
Don't laugh. Just you date Sim So Yeong, I ought to!

990
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:13,850
Yeah. Don't worry.

991
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:18,930
Whoa. She speaks this well these days? They say how grade school kids are the scariest.

992
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:20,350
Please give me more soup.

993
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:24,770
Okay. That's something I like to hear.

994
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:30,550
Seon Woo, let's play catch ball later. You need to exercise.

995
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:32,350
No, I won't.

996
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:35,410
Or you could throw lightly. I won't.

997
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:38,950
You need to exercise. You need to be fit to study.

998
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:42,470
No thanks. I want to sleep.

999
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:45,500
Oppa!

1000
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:48,980
Okay. Okay. I will.

1001
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:09,120
Lower the volume! Before I kick you out in your underwear!

1002
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:13,530
No, such harsh words.

1003
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:20,430
Honey. There's not much time left before your mother's death anniversary.

1004
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:24,560
No, such happy meaning?

1005
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:30,400
Why? It's still about three weeks to go, you can slowly prepare for it.

1006
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:33,120
My mother doesn't expect much.

1007
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:40,230
 Yes that was a hot news, but some of you might have missed this scene. 

1008
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:41,590
 And... 

1009
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:02,200
 July 

1010
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,360
I'm going to meet up with the guys!

1011
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:25,320
I'm going to to meet the guys. I will be back soon.

1012
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,240
Let's go together in my car.

1013
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,340
Okay. Let's go.

1014
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,690
Let's go.

1015
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:41,820
Put your seatbelt on.

1016
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:52,510
Hey, put your seatbelt on.

1017
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:54,450
Okay.

1018
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:01,170
Jeong Pal, you're going to drink, is it alright to bring your car?

1019
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:02,650
You drive on the way back.

1020
01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:04,590
Sheesh.

1021
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,520
Let's listen to music at least.

1022
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,480
Should we?

1023
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,410
There's nothing but Lee Moon Sae.

1024
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:19,730
That's right. Put in anything.

1025
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:39,210
Orabeoni Moon Sae's songs are so nice. It's nice even listening to it now.

1026
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:44,520
Why do you waste energy on making such an obvious statement?

1027
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,500
Can't you say things prettily?

1028
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,720
Okay.

1029
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,160
Which album was this? Was it the 3rd?

1030
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:57,130
It's 4th you, dummy! 87!

1031
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:59,590
I could forget. Who are you calling dummy?

1032
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:03,230
You have such bad memory so how do you ride planes?

1033
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:05,330
What nonsense is that?

1034
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:07,960
Hey! As a fellow person who pilots a plane, I feel ashamed.

1035
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,830
Ashamed?

1036
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:14,790
- Hey! Victory!
- Victory!

1037
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,820
Where do you find a person who cheers with 'Victory?'

1038
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:25,520
Anyway, Second Lieutenant Kim, when will you be back, once you leave this time?

1039
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,040
- Am I emigrating?
- But come at least every two weeks.

1040
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,500
It's tiring.

1041
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,130
You can come on your fighter jet. You'll get here really fast.

1042
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:39,980
Deok Seon, I really like your unchanging image.

1043
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:42,540
It's a joke. A joke.

1044
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,580
Taek? Will he be able to come?

1045
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:50,100
Yeah. He said he was coming. I called the Association earlier and they said the competition ended already and he left.

1046
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:53,390
- He's about to come. 
- Perhaps he's lost somewhere?

1047
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:57,430
Does it make sense for someone who plays Baduk to lose his way?

1048
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:58,830
That punk.

1049
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:03,520
A person who plays Baduk gets lost, I don't get it.

1050
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:09,080
Jeong Pal, you brought the ring, right?

1051
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,980
What ring?

1052
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:13,270
You're talking about the fiancÃ©e right?

1053
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:16,250
What's a fiancÃ©e ring?

1054
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:21,000
There's a graduation ring from the Air Force. A fiancÃ©e ring. This bastard still has it.

1055
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,240
I brought it.

1056
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,860
You're giving it to me, right?

1057
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:28,730
I'm thinking about it. I suddenly think it's a waste to give it to you.

1058
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:32,310
Then who are you going to give it to?

1059
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:37,100
Aigoo! The bastard who would die before getting to propose.

1060
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:40,260
Our Jeong Pal isn't very romantic.

1061
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:47,530
Hey you fool. It's my wish to see you confess before I die.

1062
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:51,820
Are you going to live alone forever? Frustrating bastard.

1063
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,420
Deok Seon.

1064
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:17,380
I was going to give it to you when I graduated, but I'm giving it to you now.

1065
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,210
I like you.

1066
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,820
I like you, I said.

1067
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:51,110
Hey, do you know what things I did because of you?

1068
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:58,520
I waited in front of the gate for an hour just to go to school with you.

1069
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:05,400
Until you got home from the study room... I wasn't able to sleep because I was worried.

1070
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:08,790
'Why is she so late?'

1071
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,870
'Did she fall asleep again?'

1072
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:17,160
Hey, my concern was only you. You.

1073
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:22,820
â™«   As I sit by the window at sunset    â™«

1074
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:24,180
He must be for real.

1075
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:28,580
Stay still.
â™«   I see the clouds floating far away    â™«

1076
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,590
When we met coincidentally in the bus,

1077
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:37,570
when we went to the concert, and on my birthday when you gave me a shirt as a gift,

1078
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:38,790
I was really...

1079
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:42,270
â™¬  I draw in the sky  â™¬

1080
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:45,240
I was so happy that I thought I would go crazy.

1081
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:49,980
It must be true.

1082
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:52,910
â™«   In the blowing, cold wind    â™«

1083
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:55,630
I want to see you more than a dozen times a day.

1084
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:58,010
â™«    You are lonely and crying   â™«

1085
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,770
I just liked it when we met.

1086
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:06,660
â™«   I will always be by your side    â™«

1087
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:10,340
I wanted to tell you this a long time ago.

1088
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,160
â™«    I won't leave you   â™«

1089
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,040
I really like you.

1090
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,060
I love you.

1091
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,950
Will that do, you moron?

1092
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:42,090
What does?

1093
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:44,470
You said this was your wish.

1094
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:46,340
What wish?

1095
01:35:50,230 --> 01:35:51,540
Hey! I was startled!

1096
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:54,110
I thought you were for real! You crazy bastard!

1097
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:57,270
Hey! Hey! What was that?

1098
01:35:57,270 --> 01:36:00,850
Hey, you were fooled, right?

1099
01:36:00,850 --> 01:36:02,780
This bastard is such a player!

1100
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:05,800
I was really almost fooled!

1101
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:12,130
Whoa! What on earth! Jeong Pal, my heart is fluttering. I think I have fallen for you.

1102
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:15,970
Date me. I love you. I waited for you in the bus stop, and waited for you in the study room.

1103
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:18,720
Crazy bastard get away.

1104
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,540
Whoa, I was really fooled.

1105
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,900
Hey, Deok Seon give me the menu. Jeong Pal is treating tonight.

1106
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,840
What is this?

1107
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,630
Look at my hand shaking.

1108
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:37,310
Whoa! What!

1109
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:41,240
Between friends... What! So unbelievable.

1110
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,250
Wow. This is really...

1111
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:47,200
I love you!

1112
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:54,630
 Are you a ghost? 

1113
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:57,120
 What? Is it your first time seeing a woman in hanbok? 

1114
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,770
 You're doing all sorts of things.
â™«    A Hollow Heart - Lee Seung Hwan   â™« 

1115
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:04,270
We changed it to hanbok. How is it? This is better, right?â™«   Without any lingering attachment I let you go     â™«

1116
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:07,540
Just don't do anything. That's the best.
â™«   But in my heart    â™«

1117
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:16,090
â™«   Why do I feel this void today?    â™«

1118
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:21,570
â™«   I don't know why    â™«

1119
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:23,730
 What the! 

1120
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:28,310
 What's that? Did you change into hanbok?
â™«     In the morning all at once  â™« 

1121
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:29,630
 Yeah. Isn't it pretty? 

1122
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:31,790
 So not pretty. 

1123
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:40,500
â™«   And when I realize the bygone memories    â™«

1124
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:44,320
 Jeong Pal. What are you doing?
â™«    Are asleep next to me   â™« 

1125
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,740
 Knock, you bastard.
â™«   I feel so empty    â™« 

1126
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:55,220
â™«   That smile of yours and that heart at that time     â™«

1127
01:37:55,220 --> 01:38:00,900
â™«   They all come back alive and call out to me    â™«

1128
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:08,120
â™«    My little heart that goes pit-a-pat   â™«

1129
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,440
â™«   But I can't get hold of them    â™«

1130
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:14,200
 Go home early.
â™«    But I can't get hold of them   â™« 

1131
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:40,000
 Mom said to say if it's lacking. 

1132
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:44,810
â™«   In the morning all at once    â™«

1133
01:38:44,810 --> 01:38:46,600
 Hey, No Eul.
â™«   I open my eyes to see    â™« 

1134
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:52,300
 Yes?
â™«    The blinding sunshine   â™« 

1135
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:53,640
 Is your small noona at home? 

1136
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:55,480
 - Yes.
- She's there? 

1137
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:58,500
 Yes.
â™«    And when I realize the bygone memories   â™« 

1138
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,440
 Okay. 

1139
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,560
 Hey. Give this to your sister.
â™«    I feel so empty   â™« 

1140
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:07,930
 What is this?
â™«   That smile of yours    â™« 

1141
01:39:07,930 --> 01:39:09,430
 A gift. 

1142
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:11,210
 Huh?
â™«   And that heart at that time    â™« 

1143
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,940
 A gift. Can't you tell? 

1144
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:18,740
 Christmas gift.
â™«  They all come back alive and call out to me     â™« 

1145
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,180
 Huh? 

1146
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:23,620
 Go and give that Christmas gift to your sister. 

1147
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:25,340
 Go. 

1148
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:29,840
 Go and give it! 

1149
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,740
 Go!
â™«   That smile of yours    â™« 

1150
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:36,970
 Give it to her.
â™«   And that heart at that time    â™« 

1151
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:42,140
 Are you crazy?
â™«   Come back alive and call out to me    â™« 

1152
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:44,280
 Go and give it! Come here! 

1153
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:47,640
 I will give it. 

1154
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,200
That time, Hyung Jeong Bong...

1155
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,520
What?
- I didn't know it was the cube in his pocket...

1156
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,930
- I thought it's weird
- Hey you crazy bastard!

1157
01:39:55,930 --> 01:39:57,500
I thought so for a while

1158
01:39:57,510 --> 01:40:01,070
because the mood wasn't good.

1159
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:03,550
But Mom

1160
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:08,160
You know what Mom did?

1161
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,360
One week before.

1162
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:14,220
I carried him on my back...

1163
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:18,320
Hey, Seon Woo. Page Taek and tell him to come to round two.

1164
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,310
- Okay.
- Jeong Pal, we ate well.

1165
01:40:22,730 --> 01:40:27,810
That bastard is a player. Everyone would melt.

1166
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:43,870


1167
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:51,240
 â™« When the snowy, lonely night passes â™« 

1168
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:58,640
 â™« I can hear the morning bell chime from far away â™« 

1169
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:06,180
 â™« The feeling of missing you belongs to me alone â™« 

1170
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:12,640
 â™« Even if my heart aches because of loneliness â™« 

1171
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:20,270
 â™« I have even loved that pain â™«
