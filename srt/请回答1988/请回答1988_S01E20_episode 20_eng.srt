00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,620
What are you? Are you a stalker?

5
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,920
Yeah. Did you only find that out now?

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,890
How did you really know?

7
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,960
I just came just in case, since you said you were coming earlier.

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,060
It's called interest. Interest.

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,350
Let's go.

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,210
What were you going to do if I didn't come out?

11
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,140
I would have just run.

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,740
Aigoo.

13
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,670
Are Ahjumma and Ahjussi doing well?

14
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,990
They are great.

15
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,830
What is?

16
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,190
Mom, Ahjussi and Jin Joo

17
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,350
even if I'm not here, they can enjoy being without me so it's good.

18
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,210
Are you going somewhere?

19
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,230
When we get married, I have to get out of our house.

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,520
Are you getting married?

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,880
Yes, didn't you know?

22
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,430
I want to do it soon before my girlfriend ages more.

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,360
Hey!

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,420
What's wrong? Why are you in a huff? Did someone say something?

25
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,830
You wanna die! I'm not marrying you.

26
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,590
Dream on!

27
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,680
It's because I'm in a hurry. I am.

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,560
When I become an intern it will be so hectic. I don't want to get married when we're both so busy.

29
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,320
If you were okay with it, I would want to get married tomorrow.

30
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,760
Don't worry. I'm not in a hurry.

31
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,980
We... You know we have a lot of mountains to overcome, right?

32
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,700
I know.

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,330
I know that and I will handle it.

34
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,650
Don't think of running away, but just stay next to me.

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,800
Like this.

36
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,340
Noona!

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,640
Why?

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,790
Didn't you eat too many tangerines?

39
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,120
It suits her because it's Lee Yeong Ae. What's with the orange color?

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,740
I just tried it on for today. You can't even hold it in for a day?

41
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,100
Please, please don't follow the actresses on TV. You should have a conscience.

42
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,720
No, I was told I looked pretty?

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,580
Lead the way! Lead the way! Which crazy bastard has gone completely crazy!

44
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,720
You look pretty!

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,220
Is it really okay?

46
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,100
This is Lee Yeong Ae's lipstick.

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,690
You look prettier than Lee Young Ae.

48
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,300
Do you know who Lee Young Ae is?

49
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,810
But you really look pretty.

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,420
You remember we are seeing a movie tomorrow, right. Don't cancel it.

51
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,860
You should be the one not to cancel like last time.

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,590
Okay.

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,760
Jin Joo, hi. Are you coming from school?

54
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,990
Unni, hi.

55
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,840
What are you doing with Oppa?

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,690
What do you mean? We were just talking.

57
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,540
Jin Joo, Oppa will tell you everything later.

58
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,460
What are you telling, what? Be quiet.

59
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,640
Oh my. Unni, your lips!

60
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,530
The color is super weird!

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,540
It's not strange.

62
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,090
Seong Deok Seon, you came home early.

63
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,070
Is it raining outside?

64
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,140
Where did you get an umbrella? You're so talented.

65
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,290
Oh my, what is this? Remove the lipstick.

66
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,230
It's super weird.

67
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,790
Where are Mom and Dad?

68
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,320
They're upstairs.

69
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,960
Why? Are they having a meeting again?

70
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Yes, it's a very important meeting.

71
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,180
What is it?

72
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,780
They are discussing where to move with Ahjussi.

73
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,210
Ahjussi is moving too?

74
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,160
Yes, he is.

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,740
What the heck.

76
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,960
Well, it would be so boring so how could they live apart?

77
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,200
Where are we moving?

78
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,550
I don't know. Dad will probably decide.

79
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,090
The retirement money is just one blow.

80
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,220
You just need to buy a secure house.

81
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,290
Gangnam. Gangnam for me, that's for sure.

82
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,420
I want to try to live in Gangnam before I die.

83
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,910
For me, Gangnam. We're going to Gangnam. Wife, pack our things.

84
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,850
You can't move to Gangnam.

85
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,220
Why not?

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,180
In Gangnam, with 200 million won you'll barely get a 20 pyeong apartment.

87
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,550
And not even a new apartment at that but a really old one.

88
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,340
We don't even have 200 million.

89
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,370
For Bo Ra and Deok Seon to get married, we need to set aside some money.

90
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,370
If it's about 100, 005,000

91
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,460
then, aigoo, we won't even have money to go to Gangnam.

92
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,050
Then come with us.

93
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,360
Yes. Move there with us.

94
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,630
We also can't live with loneliness.

95
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:22,250
We can depend on each other like now. How nice would that be?

96
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,850
Where did you say that was? I heard it already but I already forgot.

97
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,900
No matter how I think of it, even if you say that it's 1 million per pyeong,

98
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,810
it's too far. If you come to Seoul it would be better to set off from Daejeon.

99
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,080
Come on, Bo Ra's father!

100
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,470
What's there to be busy about at our age?

101
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,830
We'll just get 100 pyeong each,

102
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,600
lay out some grass,

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,490
then have some barbecue or whatnot. Let's live like that.

104
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,170
I-It's the last chance of my life for a reversal.

105
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,930
It's not like that grass or barbecue would get to me.

106
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,890
But then, this is a worry.

107
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,200
With just 100, 005,000 won how would you have a reversal. Maybe in the 80's.

108
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,280
Let's just live quietly.

109
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,840
For us, for this person, we are going for the fresh air where there is a good mountain and water.

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,590
Who know's if that place might be developed too.

111
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,490
Let's go, huh? Let's go together, Bo Ra's dad.

112
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,020
That, I have been asking since earlier. Where is that place?

113
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,300
Where that place is. If you ride the express bus

114
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,770
there's that place you always see when you come up from Busan.

115
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,030
Before the tollgate.

116
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,830
Pangyo.

117
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,940
Pangyo!

118
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,240
Think about it. There is still time.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,960
You are the naturally the cautious type.

120
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,030
For me, I just decided right away like a man.

121
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,920
Well, there are differences between people.

122
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,070
I have finished thinking about it.

123
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,190
What? I approve of it, do you too?

124
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,500
Yes!

125
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,860
I have decided!

126
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,830
Episode 20: 
 Goodbye my youth 
 Goodbye Ssangmundong

127
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,540
Please shake my hand.

128
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,330
 Thanks Choi Taek 

129
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,010
One two three ...

130
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,570
Thank you.

131
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,000
I rode the bus and there was traffic just before I arrived.

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,940
Did you wait long?

133
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,940
You should have just taken your time. I just got here.

134
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,620
It hasn't started yet, right?

135
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,320
It probably just started.

136
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,450
You should have said so sooner. Let's hurry inside.

137
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,270
Hey.

138
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,590
Ms. Man Ok, you know the late night snacks tonight, right?

139
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,420
 How delicious is that kimbab? 

140
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,560
It maybe just a kimbab sold on the street but the taste is better than the level of a top hotel.

141
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,360
 Yes. Then let's see each other in front of Hoehyeon Station. 

142
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,630
Ms. Man Ok, we could be confused so...

143
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,800
Let's meet in front of Shinsegae  Department Store.

144
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,990
 Okay. Then see you. 

145
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,140
Yes, see you.

146
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,860
Dad, where's Mom?

147
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,900
She's still not here. She went out and said she would drop by the market and is still not back.

148
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,840
She must have bought a lot.

149
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,950
Jeong Hwan, can you give me the persimmon punch.

150
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,010
Son ...

151
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,370
This, on top of the persimmon punch...

152
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,650
is this confidence (sounds like pine nuts).

153
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,560
Is this the book that you are reading?
(He is making puns -- responsibility and "book you are reading" sound similar)

154
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,060
Jeong Hwan, where are you?

155
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,860
Jeong Hwan! Jeong Hwan! I still havent gone to anxiety, liveliness

156
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,270
There is "Wanting to cut into the stomach" and  "Baekje, Shilla, Goguryeo" (Successive Korean dynasties). 

157
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,280
Jeong Hwan!

158
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,310
Seon Woo, what are you up to?

159
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,290
 Yes, I'm going to meet Bo Ra for a while. 

160
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,740
 Why don't we meet later tonight? 

161
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,010
Bo Ra. I really can't get used to this.

162
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,050
 Let's see each other later in Taek's room. Loyalty! 

163
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,820
It's 'Victory', bastard. Victory.

164
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,790
Where are they meeting? The ahjummas would be coming soon.

165
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,400
I dunno. He'll probably handle it himself.

166
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,280
Jeong Hwan came here?

167
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,590
Yeah. We are going to have a drink in Taek's room. Let's go together.

168
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,630
Never mind. Seong Deok Seon would also be there.

169
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,200
Of course. Deok Seon is my friend.

170
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,210
But then, Seong Deok Seon is holding it in pretty well.

171
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,160
She hasn't mentioned anything about it.

172
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,250
Deok Seon has another side of her.

173
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,650
Even if she's careless, she's kind.

174
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,950
How could you know my sister better than me?

175
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,810
Sheesh.

176
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,170
Hurry and go. The elders might see us at this rate.

Seon Woo's family and Bo Ra's mom almost lost their minds.

197
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,180
It's not like they are going to get married already.

198
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,700
And these days, aren't marrying with the same family name alright?

199
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,600
Your uncle also had the same family name and he got married.

200
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,040
But they are Kim.

201
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,960
If you throw three stones at least one will hit a Kim.

202
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,000
But then... those two families are Seong.

203
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,340
But if you look at the degree of kinship, they would be strangers.

204
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,270
I know.

205

206
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,620
You should have been careful.

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,290
How's Noona Bo Ra?

208
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,300
Tell her to come to my place.

209
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,210
She's going to stay in the room. If it was me, I would run to my friend's house.

210
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,530
Even though Seon Woo told her to come out for a while she said she will stay at home.

211
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,590
Seong Bo Ra is strong.

212
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,380
You got caught?

213
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,890
Why are you so serious?

214
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,220
Wasn't it something they were going to find out anyway? They just knew in advance what they are bound to know.

215
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,500
That's right. Do Ryong Nyong is right. You were going to tell them anyway.

216
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,400
This time, you just need to tell both parties and start dating officially.

217
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,080
You're not even in high school. And these days a lot get married with the same family names.

218
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,580
There's talk that the law would change soon.

219

Deok Seon, what do you think of Seon Woo as your brother-in-law? Is  it good right?

220
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,720
Hey, you are going to marry Seong Bo Ra?

221
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,370
Woah! Hey! Seong Seon Woo!

222
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,190
Wow! Your charisma! But then how are you going to convince your mother?

223
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,040
Especially since you have never tried rebelling against her.

224
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,780
Right. I'm more worried about you than Seong Bora.

225
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,940
Our Seon Woo has a lot of worries.

226
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,800
He will handle it well himself.

227

I will take care of my life well, so you guys just worry about your own.

But then, does the kimbap place open at this hour too?

250
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,910
Yes, they open at night and close up at dawn.

251
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,680
It's a place where people who do business order their food.

252
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,620
Kid kimbap that's this size and savory dried radish soup.

253
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,740
It is a perfect combination.

254
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,340
I... because you live in such a big house

255
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,350
I thought you won't like places like this.

256
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,100
No, my taste buds are really good.

257
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,510
I grew up eating a lot of food from the market.

258
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,530
I will tell you slowly later.

259
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,740
Yes.

260
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,740
That...

261
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,730
 Excuse me, that... 

262
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,530
 I heard you sell a lot here. 

263
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,250
I will go with this one.

264
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,470
Do you need anything else?

265
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,590
No.

266
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,190
Yes?

267
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,120
Boss, do you know Burberry? Burberry?

268
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,460
Yes.

269
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,280
This one has the same material as what is used in Burberry.

270
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:56,210
Mi Ran, do you want to walk around the neighborhood?

271
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,720
Let's go out for some fresh air.

272
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,090
It's nice getting a breath of fresh air, right?

273
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Honey, I think Jeong Bong has given up

274
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,000
I wasn't even expecting anything from the beginning.

275
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,690
But still, it's good that he got into college even after seven tries.

276
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,680
I don't wish for anything else.

277
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,500
Jeong Bong is a bit slower than everyone else

278
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,550
but I'm sure that he'll find his way.

279
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,380
I do think that too but,

280
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,410
it's just that he's too slow!

281
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,990
But our kids are so kind, right?

282
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,490
Do you remember?

283
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,390
When you used to deliver black bean noodles,

284
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,600
you used to avoid Jeong Bong and Jeong Hwan when they were playing with their friends,

285
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,370
because you thought they would be embarrassed.

286
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:24,160
Jeong Bong would grab Jeong Hwan and scream, "Appa!" and come running to hug you.

287
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,890
Yes, I remember.

288
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,850
You came home that night and cried

289
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:37,190
then laughed multiple times.

290
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,050
Did you like it that much?

291
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:48,160
Of course. When I still think about that moment, I start tearing up.

292
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:54,860
If your dad carries around a black bean noodle case, you should be embarrassed.

293
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,160
But they were screaming "Appa!" and running to hug me.

294
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,210
Why wouldn't I like it?

295
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,520
That was the best day of my life.

296
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,870
Who would be embarrassed of their parents? If they were, they wouldn't be their children.

297
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,450
Right?

298
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,480
But, some people are not like that.

299
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,470
It turns out we have a lot of luck.

300
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,220
While renting that storage room of Teacher Ryoo's house,

301
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,210
Jeong Bong would cry all night because he was in pain

302
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,980
and we were running out of rice to eat.

303
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,800
I even thought of just killing the four of us by turning on the gas.

304
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,290
I had a lot of nasty thoughts.

305
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,960
But, I think we survived each day by looking at our kids' kind faces.

306
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,770
We lived because of the kids.

307
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,950
I didn't raise the kids, I think the kids raised me.

308
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,340
I raised you.

309
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,540
I raised you!

310
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,260
Then, we must have raised each other. Good.

311
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,730
Good  job.

312
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,710
Yeah, we did.

313
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,140
We did well. We did well, indeed.

314
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,420
That was my inspiration.

315
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,740
What?

316
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,880
Then, come back in 1 hour.

317
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
Okay. I'll.

318
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,740
Good bye.

319
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,050
♫  That's what it means.   ♫

320
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,810
Dad...

321
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:48,260
♬ Let's sing a song together  ♬

322
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,170
your daughter is here.

323
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:54,390
♬ Tell me you dream without regret    ♬

324
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,060
Did my bad daughter come?

325
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,180
What bad?

326
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,660
Dad, this is my boyfriend.

327
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,280
Oh.

328
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,970
My dad raised this store without any help and with his own hands.

329
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,880
He has two more stores in Dongdaemun.

330
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,630
When he first came to Seoul, he only brought only 30000 won. ( About $30US )

331
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,880
Now, the fabric market of Korea wouldn't operate without my dad.

332
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,260
Wow, that is amazing.

333
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,290
The way I see it, you are Korea's Bill Gates.

334
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:42,260
You are really a self-made man, you are amazing.

335
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,720
I'm a little better than Bill Gates.

336
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,280
Bill Gates was good in English. After I was born, well,

337
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,400
I haven't learned English or Japanese but look at me now.

338
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,000
I do business with American people and even to the Japanese.

339
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,700
So, I'm definitely better.

340
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,560
And Bill Gates... did he come out of elementary school too?

341
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,540
He graduated from Harvard.

342
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,040
He's a smart guy.

343
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,750
That is why you're far greater.

344
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,430
You're really the best!

345
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,490
Really?

346
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,620
You guys must be cold. I'll order some food for you.

347
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,970
There's a place that sells really good kimbap.

348
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,420
Their dried radish soup is a work of art.

349
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,610
Thank you, Father!

350
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,080
Wait a second.

351
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,160
Your voice sounds familiar.

352
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,770
Have we talked on the phone before?

353
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,200
Isn't he the guy you dated during high school?

354
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,010
It sounds exactly like the voice from back then.

355
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,920
Dad, it's cold. Let's go in.

356
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,150
I'll go in.

357
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,390
Wow, it's so cold.

358
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,060
He's the guy.

359
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,970
It's you, Punk, right?

360
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,920
What? You're going to work a part-time job?

361
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,550
Yes.

362
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,290
Did you completely give up on the Bar Exam?

363
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,790
I don't think it's the path for me.

364
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,960
It's important that you have something you want to do.

365
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,960
I'm okay with it!

366
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,080
While working at a part-time job, I can gain experience

367
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,250
and I want to earn money without relying on my parent's allowance from now on.

368
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:52,760
There's something I really want to do but I'll tell you guys later when things settle down.

369
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,920
He's quitting the Bar Exam?

370
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,730
Yeah.

371
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,730
He's completely giving up.

372
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,310
He's going to work a part-time job at the pub nearby.

373
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,010
Oh god. All that time he used for studying was a waste.

374
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,130
I thought that even if it took a long time,

375
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,290
Jeong Bong could do it.

376
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,560
If he would just be tenacious and patient.

377
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,590
Aigoo. It's not like anyone could go for the Bar Exam.

378
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,460
Bo Ra is amazing.

379
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,600
How about Go Stop after a while?

380
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,590
Yes, let's. That's good.

381
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,730
I'm too lazy to make dinner anyway.

382
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,870
Let's ask Jeong Bong to make kimchi fried rice

383
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,120
and the three of us should loosen our hands tonight.

384
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,420
Aigoo. Really. Hyungnim.

385
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,630
I'm not in the position to play cards with Seon Young.

386
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,820
Bo Ra's mom, marrying with the same family name is just nothing.

387
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,390
That... what did they say it was...Unnecessary?  Unenforced.

388
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,170
Well, anyway, the law is changing.

389
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,360
Marrying with the same family name, you can't even register the marriage.

390
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,450
And if they have a child they can't put it on the family registry. I don't like that.

391
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,000
They said that the law is changing! The law.

392
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,950
Is it because you don't like Seon Woo?

393
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,960
No, of course not. There's no one like Seon Woo.

394
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,900
Then, just coolly say okay!

395
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,080
It's so uncomfortable being in the middle of this.

396
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,830
I was about to relieve the pain of menopause with Go Stop. But what is this?

397
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,050
What is this? It's so annoying!

398
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,040
All the others are okay with it.

399
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,760
My aunt who's over 70 is okay with it.

400
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,560
How are you more conservative than a 70-year old grandma?

401
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,600
Take more medications.

402
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,490
   

403
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,090
How about dinner? With who?

404
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,500
It's the one who introduced "Trash" to you right?

405
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,680
Tell her that I'll treat her to dinner next time.

406
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,790
I'm very thankful to that person.

407
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,450
I'm planning to tell them today.

408
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,160
You can't back out again, okay?

409
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,110
I'll be the one who's telling them, so trust me and just follow.

410
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,700
I'll tell Ahjusshi and Ahjumma.

411
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,100
 Hey, just focus on yours. I'll handle my own family. 

412
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,280
I'll talk to my parents and convince them so

413
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,390
just worry about yourself.

414
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,810
Taek said  that he's going to be late, right?

415
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,150
Today, tomorrow and the day after, he has competitions.

416
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,090
I'm here.

417
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,180
Seon Woo, what brings you here today?

418
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,410
I have something to tell you.

419
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,660
Mom, please give your consent.

420
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,390
I want to marry Bo Ra. Please allow us.

421
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,770
Seon Woo,

422
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:14,500
don't rush things too much.

423
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,260
I'm not completely against it.

424
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,460
You haven't finished your studies.

425
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,390
You have to graduate too. There're lots of things to do.

426
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,970
And also, you and Bo Ra as of now

427
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,650
even if you might like each other to death,

428
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,630
you can never know about the future.

429
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,260
So, let's do it slowly.

430
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,250
And let's give it a little bit more time.

431
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,180
Mom.

432
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,380
I have been seeing Bo Ra for 6 years.

433
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,650
My feelings isn't just a fleeting one.

434
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,050
And, I'm not planning to marry her right away.

435
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,130
I'm not talking like this to you for that.

436
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:22,390
I want to date her with the intention of getting married. But, I want to get your permission first

437
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:25,080
and I want to date her with confidence.

438
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:32,330
Mom, up to now I've never once done something you told me not to do.

439
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:38,250
College and even my major. I did all the things you wanted.

440
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,850
I'm not regretting it but

441
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,700
I want to marry someone I love.

442
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:56,450
Can you just let this one go?

443
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:02,480

Jeong Hwan!

452
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,410
What about the car key? Be careful when you drive.

453
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,170
If you get sleepy, stop at the rest stop, okay?

454
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,380
You guys always do this whenever I come.

455
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,590
I often come here. Am I a guest?

456
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,930
Children usually become guests when they get old.

457
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,900
Is your car maintained well? What about gas?

458
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,920
The car runs very smooth. The gas is full.

459
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,010
The guest is going so the owner Ahjummoni should just take care of herself.

460
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,460
Don't worry about Mom. Take a good care of yourself.

If you stay any longer, you'll probably arrive at dawn. Hurry!

Hurry up! You're going to arrive at dawn!

465
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,090

00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,100
The car broke down. I'm going to ride the bus.

476
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,250
I'll just drink then sleep on the way.

477
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:41,540
♫   The love we share together made me like that    ♫

478
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:52,860
♫  Because isn’t that what life is about?     ♫

479
00:37:52,860 --> 00:38:00,680
♫   It’s about breathing together    ♫

480
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:07,240
♫  There’s no sturdier wall than that     ♫

481
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:14,130
♫   So we can overcome all the countless hardships    ♫

482
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,290
Honey.

483
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:45,120
I'm not saying this just because he's not my biological son, so

484
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,810
don't misunderstand me, but hear me out.

485
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:55,440
Taek... when Taek first said he wanted to play Baduk

486
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,790
you remember how much I opposed it, right?

487
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,480
I remember...

488
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,000
Bo Ra's dad goes to the Association

489
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,480
he was going to bring Deok Seon originally.

490
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,150
But Deok Seon, that girl,

491
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,190
was so crazy chasing the fumigator truck.

492
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,320
Our Taekie was the one who clumsily went instead.

493
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,780
Now that you think about it, you can never know a person's life.

494
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,910
You can never know.

495
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:40,260
Bo Ra's dad wanted to make him the second Cho Hyeon Yeon (South Korean 9-dan professional Baduk player. Considered one of the greatest players of all-time)

496
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,620
At first, I just made him do it.

497
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,570
But then... this child

498
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:50,010
was living only looking at the Baduk board.

499
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,750
So that day, the Baduk board and the stones

500
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,790
I threw them all away.

501
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,670
But then, was it the next day...

502
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,900
I thought he was asleep. I opened the door

503
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,190
and he was looking at the Baduk manual alone in his room.

504
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:18,670
I threw it away but it seemed like he brought it back secretly.

505
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,820
He was scared that I would scold him.

506
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,200
He was looking at me with eyes of a startled rabbit.

507
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,590
He strained so much just so he won't have it taken away.

508
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,630
How could I win against that?

509
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,260
After that day, I just forced my eyes shut

510
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,020
and made him play Baduk.

511
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,180
I... alone

512
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,310
had no confidence to back him up.

513
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:55,750
My child, I wanted him to live ordinarily but it was just my greed.

514
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:00,670
A child... doesn't do what I plan  for him to do.

515
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,190
Do you think you can win against Seon Woo?

516
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,200
Even if you do win, that's not winning.

517
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,910
They say there is no parent who can win over a child.

518
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:25,580
Those words... they are not wrong. Entirely not wrong.

519
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,330
Here.

520
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,050
 Mom, I'm home. 

521
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,570
What brings her here at night?

522
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,800
Mom, Dad.

523
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,880
I want to get married to Seon Woo.

524
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,140
I wish you would approve of it.

525
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,760
You can't.

526
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,410
You have the same family names.

527
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,160
If you get married, in your family registry

528
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,440
it would not say 'spouse' but 'cohabitant.' It would be registered as 'cohabitant.'

529
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,660
Aigoo. If your grandmother was alive she would collapse.

530
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,850
You can never do it.

531
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,260
What about you, Dad? Do you think the same?

532
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,290
Is it because you don't like Seon Woo?

533
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:59,370
Seon Woo is not the problem here. Do you think I'm like this because of him?

534
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,090
Then is it because he is younger than me?

535
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,970
Your parents are not that conservative.

536
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,760
Is it really because of the law?

537
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,900
Then, if there's no problem with the law,

538
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,820
you will be giving approval for our marriage, right?

539
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:27,820
Next year, same family name and family origin marriages will be temporarily acceptable.

540
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,160
The National Assembly is preparing a bill now.

541
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,910
Yes, then will you live together only for 1 year?

542
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,530
when you have kids later ...

543
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:45,100
You can't even register his birth, what are you going to do about that?

544
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,230
Next year they would temporarily allow it but after that the court

545
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:54,690
will abandon the prohibition of same family name same family origin marriage.

546
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,860
It's for sure they say.

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,700
Anyway, for Seon Woo or I... getting married right away would be hard.

550
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,270
After I'm done with judicial training

551
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:19,340
and when Seon Woo finishes the 4th year of Med School.

552
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,910
We will get married then.
♫   To be with you    ♫

Aigoo. Hyungnim, it's middle of winter.

567
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,610
Why did you leave the door wide open?

568
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,430
It's summertime inside me.

569
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:50,240
It looks delicious!

570
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,250
Where's your partner?

571
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,270
Hmmm. It's good. He'll come soon.

572
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,680
Hyungnim, where is kimchi?

573
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,830
Kimchi? The sauce is over there.

574
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:06,970
But still! You need kimchi to make the noodles delicious.

575
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,380
Aigoo! Hyungnim! The smell is a killer already.

576
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,920
You came?

577
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,860
Aigoo. How did you know to cut and bring kimchi?

578
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,600
If you have this with noodles it's delicious.

579
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,080
What are you doing and not getting the noodles?

580
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,200
Put the chives.

581
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:00,910
But then, are Cha In Pyo and Shin Ae Ra getting married? Isn't Cha In Pyo going for his military service?

582
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,170
I heard if Oppa In Pyo would be out for vacation then they will have the wedding.

583
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,210
Those two, I knew it since I saw Love Is In Your Embrace (MBC drama).

584
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:12,490
Those stares were not acting.

585
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,280
Why is he IOppa In Pyo?

586
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,980
Because he's handsome.

587
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,340
Do you want lots of kimchi in your gooksoo (noodle soup)?

588
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,680
Yes, give me a lot.

589
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,910
That's enough. It'll get salty.

590
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,400
Aigoo. Why isn't the errand boy coming?

591
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,610
Servant son?

592
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,940
There's this thing. Boo Hwan Dang's servant.

593
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,100
Hanil Bank's errand boy, President Kim's errand boy.

594
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,340
And here I thought someone gave birth.

595
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:58,500
That errand boy really doesn't listen well.

596
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,200
If he's told to come then he should come quickly.

597
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,620
What about you, Seon Yeong? Should I put a lot of pepper?

598
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,170
No thanks for me. Put a lot on my Oppa's.

599
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:11,730
Aigoo! Stop feeding him. Why? He can't use his strength that much?

600
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,260
Why are you feeding him a lot of peppers? He's just eating peppers these days.

601
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,530
Stop taking care of him.

602
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,660
How did you know it's good for a man's body?

603
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,360
Give me that.

604
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,720
You would catch a person soon.

605
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,150
Give me a lot of peppers. Give my Oppa a lot too.

606
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,420
- Here. Stop feeding him. 
 - Why, won't he use the strength well?

607
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,600
The neighborhood is quiet.

608
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,510
It's because the kids grew and all left.

609
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,940
Where's Jin Joo?

610
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,270
She went to school.

611
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:48,220
If not for Jin Joo, this neighborhood would be all old couples.

612
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:54,370
Oh then, I haven't seen Taek today and yesterday. Does he have a big competition?

613
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,650
The Championship Series (guksoo jeon) has started.

614
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,650
This?
 (guksoo = noodles)

615
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,890
Right. Noodles (guksoo) and pancake (jeon).

616
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,890
You should eat a lot and try winning.

617
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:10,970
But then, I think Taek's face has shrunk to half it's size.

618
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,570
Aigoo, so why did you blow air on the child.

619
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,430
What? What wind did I blow?

620
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,250
Bo Ra's dad, are you on menopause too? You're forgetting things.

621
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,620
Mom! Dad! There's news that Taek is dating!

622
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,730
On the front page.

623
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,600
With whom?

624
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,550
Is it a celebrity again?

625
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:36,440
Don't be surprised.

626
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,800
 9-dan Choi Taek in a Passionate Relationship 

627
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,560
Isn't it the best? Isn't it shocking?

628
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,940
It's wrong.

629
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,430
It's all fake.

630
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,770
These two hold hands all the time.

631
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,160
Deok Seon looks good on this picture.

632
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,290
They often watch a movie together.

633
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,390
Wow, my daughter looks good.

634
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,590
They went to the public bath together when they were kids.

635
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,990
What to do about that reporter? He guessed wrong.

636
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,600
It's bull sh*t, right?

637
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,900
Who is this? Miss Deok Seon?

638
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,260
Hi.

639
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,670
Taek is almost done. It went on for 13 hours straight.

640
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,190
for 13 hours?

641
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:42,670
He's almost dead. I feel pity for him.

642
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:48,180
But he still won. He flipped the panel at the very end.

643
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,620
Our Taek suffered so much but at least there's a reward.

644
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,540
Pardon?

645
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,360
His girlfriend comes and waits for him like this.

646
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:04,370
Taek already told me and Mr. Yoo.

647
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,210
Thank you.

648
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,870
For what,  Manager?

649
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:16,710
Just because. Thank you.

650
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:22,250
By the way, you two should've been more careful.

651
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,620
What are you going to do with the newspaper article today?

652
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,000
Is Taek aware of it too?

653
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,200
He heard it from reporters right after the competition today.

654
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,160
You know his personality right?

655
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,580
Just coolly acknowledge it. It's the truth.

656
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,410
Anyhow, since you're here ...

657
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:46,230
Here .. I'll go home.

658
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,770
Drop him off safely.

659
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,940
Yes. Good bye.

660
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,130
Is this a dream, or not?

661
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,390
How can you play Baduk for 13 hours?

662
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,820
Right.

663
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,950
You worked hard.

664
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,580
Yes, so did you.

665
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,740
Just do as I said, okay?

666
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:49,220
Both families are having a hard time because of Seon Woo and Bo Ra.

667
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:56,590
But if they find out about our relationship, it will be too traumatic.

668
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:08,090
So tell them that the article about us today is not true.

669
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,880
No, I won't lie.

670
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,890
We lied for six years. I don't want to lie anymore.

671
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:29,660
After time passes,

672
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,200
we can tell them then.

673
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,220
Both your parents and my parents ...

674
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,580
are always willing to listen to us.

675
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,740
But now ...

676
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,160
Now is not the time.

677
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,560
I am confident I will not change.

678
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,320
Are you not?

679
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,610
When is Taek coming home?

680
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,800
It's about time for him to arrive.

681
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,220
Still, we should ask him.

682
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,830
No, it can't be.

683
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:24,500
No, I'm right! There's something between them two.

684
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,020
Damn it you punk! What are you saying! Stop speaking nonsense!

685
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,980
Do you want to see your mom collapse?

686
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:37,580
Just be quiet. Same family name is already hard to handle as it is.

687
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:41,580
Aigoo. What double in-laws.
 (For traditional Koreans, double in-laws was similar to incest.) 

688
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,020
Aigoo. If you want to send your mother to the other world then continue on.

689
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,140
Honey?

690
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,200
Hon--

691
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,760
I'm right.

692
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,750
Go on.

693
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,280
We're leaving.

694
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,360
It won't be it so don't worry too much.

695
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,810
See! There's something between them two.

696
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,140
Why do you come together?

697
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:19,850
You two... The article is not true, right?

698
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,330
Taek, is it true? It's not right?

699
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,050
The reporter got it wrong, right?

700
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:31,580
-It's not correct, right? 
 -The article is not true, right?

701
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,750
No. You know the relationship between us.

702
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:56,270
See. I told you.

703
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:59,680
Does it look like our relationship will change?

704
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,060
There are all kinds of relationships.

705
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,990
In a day or two, where  is the relationship. Where?

706
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,640
 Taek. 

707
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,590
 I trust you. 

708
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:15,010
 Do we look like we're going to change easily? 

709
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,880
 I won't change. 

710
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:27,580
 So, let's tell them slowly. 

711
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,240
 Okay? 

712
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:40,460
 In exchange, I will give you a gift. 

713
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,950

That time, more than same family name, being double in-laws was more opposed.

720
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,390
I matured quickly. But he only played baduk,

721
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:42,140
so I had to convince him and pushed off the announcement.

722

Yes, your noona ...

853
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,510
purchased a pair of shoes for me so I can wear them at the wedding tomorrow.

854
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:31,030
It's cheap so you can wear it however.

855
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:33,640
You must be tired. Go in and take a rest.

856

It's not even 9 pm yet.

857
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:42,650
This bastard. Turn the TV off or turn the volume down!

858
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:45,260
So your noona can have a good sleep!

859

- This punk.
- Okay.

860
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:23,190
There's probably no one left out in the invitation list, right?

861
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:28,920
Mom. The wedding is the day after tomorrow.

862

Isn't he probably with Unni Bora?

866
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:49,540
They have been dating for several years. Seems they still like each other so much.

Yes, I did.

Aren't you busy? You must have a lot to prepare for the wedding.

875
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:30,230
I have all prepared. You know that I'm pretty meticulous.

If you are still like that even after marriage Bo Ra would be hard on you.

877
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:43,310
Do things in moderation

878
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:47,120
you need to live like that for the household to be peaceful. Understand?

879
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,980
Yes.

880
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:52,570
And ... since Bo Ra  is also working ..

881
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:56,580
so .. you should do your own laundry and cooking.

882

Yes, I will do well.

there are things I learned from watching you, so

885
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:10,400
I plan on following even just half of you.

886
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,860
It's not like I have done something.

943
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:44,050
Whenever they see me, they say to me 'go to bed or take a rest'.

944
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,960
Seon Woo, I think I become a real stranger to them.

945
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,230
 Why don't you change the atmosphere? 

946
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:53,950
 Or take about old times with your family. 

947
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,400
 Use this chance. 

948
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:59,370
You're talking immaturely.

949
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:03,030
If I say that to my family, It's going to be a sea of tears.

950
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:05,400
 Oh, is that right? 

951
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:11,990
 I won't ask you to meet me today. Spend the last day with your family. I will give in. 

952
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:17,070
I also want to do that, but everybody here is busy.

953
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:21,900
Mom went to the department store, and No Eul went out to see a friend...

954
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:27,460
Deok Seon is on a flight. There's only Dad and I in the house.

955
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:30,950
 Oh! Then chat with your father after a long while. 

956
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:35,960
 You two are both the same blunt ... so 

957
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,480
 or why don't you come out for lunch with me? 

958
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:43,400
Hey, is it already time for lunch?

959
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,390
Let's hang up. Dad should be hungry.

960
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:48,920
Dad, are you hungry, aren't you?

961
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,080
I made some fried rice that ...

962
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,890
you like.

963
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:28,460
Well...

964
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:32,670
Are the preparations done?

965
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:34,410
Yes.

966
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:47,820
It's a bit dry, should I go and get some soup?

967
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:50,170
It's okay. Hurry and eat.

968
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:51,870
Okay.

969
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:11,160
Do the shoes fit well?

970
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:15,020
Yeah. It fits just right.

971
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:19,380
How did you know Dad's shoe size?

972
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:31,500
Eat.

973
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,190
You should eat a lot.

974
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:00,390

My son, wow you look handsome!

Hey, I said I would be the MC.

993
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:56,950
For a person who just came from Sacheon. Look at Dong Ryong, don't worry.

994
01:21:56,950 --> 01:22:00,110
Right. Did you see Seon Woo?

995
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:03,730
He's like a crazy bastard. It's like he can't control his facial expression.

996
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:07,770
The next is today's star, the bridegroom will be entering.

His mouth is about to rip.
- That crazy bastard.

Wow, Seon Woo!

1001
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:55,060
Do I look okay?

1002
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,910
Dad, are you nervous?

1003
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:04,340
You should match your steps and don't trip.

1004
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:16,120
Dad, aren't your shoes too big? What are you going to do if it falls off?

1005
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,070
It's okay, girl. It fits just right.

Yes, we have a truly  beautiful and moving moment.

Yes, it is happening now.

1022
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:26,800
It is a really warm moment.

1023
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,210
Really.

1024
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,960

01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:21,410
Oh wait! What are you doing? Come on here!

1029
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:22,430

Hurry up!

1033
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:29,600
Wow!

1034
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,940
One, two...

1035
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:33,250
Three.

1036
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:40,570
Yes. Now before we wrap up the picture session,

1037
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:43,860
we will continue with the 'Seon Woo-ya, let's take a picture together' corner will proceed.

1038
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:46,770
Seon Woo, let's take a picture together.

1039
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,450
Everyone come out. What are you all doing? Where's Deok Seon?

1040
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,870
What happened to your eyes, Deok Seon? Are you a  panda?

1041
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:02,200
Shut up!

1042
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,860
Okay.

1043
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:07,490
I ask you to take a good picture of us, please.

1044
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:09,010
Are they your friends?

1045
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:12,410
Yes. They are my neighborhood friends. Please take a good one.

1046
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:15,490
Maybe that's why? You all look alike.

1047
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,080
Now, I'm taking the picture.

1048
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:32,520
One, two, three! If I say that .. smile a big smile okay?

1049
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,490
Okay. One Two Three!

1050
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:45,720
Bye!

1051
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,950
Your unni hasn't left yet, right?

1052
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:51,640
Of course. How can she leave without you? Hurry up! The car is parked right up front.

1053
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,950
Wait. I need to go to the ladies room. Dad, this.

1054
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:57,660
This is Unni's bag to take to the honeymoon. Be careful!

1055
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:59,800
She didn't take this ...

1056
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:13,780
I really hate this kind of stuff.

1057
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:16,710
Hurry and go.

1058
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,590
I'll have a good trip.

1059
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:23,500
Yes. Yes.

1060
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:26,380
Please go in.

1061
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:33,340
Mom, am I going somewhere far?

1062
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:36,840
My in-law's place is located right around the corner. Why are you crying so much?

1063
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:47,150
I love you Mom. I'll live a good life.

1064
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:51,870
Thank you for raising me.

1065
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:00,020
Hyungnim, I'll be good.

1066
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,580
Don't worry.

1067
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,280
Right.

1068
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:36,350


1069
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,870
Now, let's go home too.

1070
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:50,520
We should have a drink together among neighbors.

1071
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,350
Yes, let's do that.

1072
01:30:54,140 --> 01:31:00,400
Oh my.  Hey. Where's your dad? He was right here just a few seconds ago.

1073
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:04,570
Oh right. He was here.

1074
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:21,960
I didn't know my Bo Ra had so much tears.

1075
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,580
Right? I didn't know either.

1076
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:37,090
 To the daughter that I love 

1077
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:01,780
 To my Dad that I love, 

1078
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:05,350
 I thought I couldn't say it so I'm writing a letter. 

1079
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:08,660
 Why can't I say it? 

1080
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:11,850
 Probably I'm so much like Dad. 

1081
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,720
 I may not know all of your heart 

1082
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:27,250
 But you calling "Bo Ra-ya" I know it is you asking me to look at you. 

1083
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,110
 When you place side dishes on my plate 

1084
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:33,160
 I know that it is your way of saying 'I love you.' 

1085
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,060
 Why did I pretend not to know? 

1086
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:37,200
Damn it.

1087
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:41,150
 That makes my heart hurt the most and am sorry. 

1088
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:46,360
 Dad, before I got married 

1089
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:50,850
 there is something I wanted to tell you while looking at your face. 

1090
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:53,630
 In the end, I'm writing a letter. 

1091
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:57,280
 Since I am such a bad daughter with a lot of things to be sorry about. 

1092
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,970
 Because I think I would tear up just by calling out your name. 

1093
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:07,370
 Dad, I love you and thank you. 

1094
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:12,740
 Seon Woo and I will live a happy life so you and Mom won't worry about us. 

1095
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:19,810
 Although it's just a single-room half basement, I received so much love. 

1096
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:23,260
 And even if I am reborn, I want to be born as your daughter again. 

1097
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:30,030
 Dad, I'm sorry and I love you. 

1098
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:33,200
Oh, thank you.

1099
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,290
Thank you for growing up well.

1100
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,580
 To the daughter that I love 

1101
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:07,960
 Bo Ra-ya, 27 years ago I think this was how it felt. 

1102
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:13,780
 When I heard your mom's scream then soon I heard the sound of your cry. 

1103
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:17,190
 It is still vivid in the ears of this dad of yours. 

1104
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:19,610
 You who were so small 

1105
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:23,770
 when did you grow up to be marrying now? 

1106
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:29,880
 Bo Ra-ya, since the moment you were born without a single moment left out ... 

1107
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:34,490
 don't forget that you have been the most precious jewel of your dad. 

1108
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:39,330
 My daughter, I love you. 

1109
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:42,320
 I thank you so much ... 

1110
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,720
 for being born as my daughter. 

1111
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:15,580
Can this be edited with something like Photoshop?

1112
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:18,270
Why? It's all memories.

1113
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:22,510
Right. Why did you cry so much at other people's wedding?

1114
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:26,110
Talking about yourself.

1115
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:28,840
Did I cry as much as you did?

1116
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:37,100
   

1117
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,280
Yes, honey.

1118
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,670
 Where are you? 

1119
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:40,850
Deok Seon's place.

1120
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:41,970
 Again? 

1121
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:43,900
What do you mean 'again?'

1122
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:45,580
I stopped by to have a cup of coffee.

1123
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:50,060
 It will be my father-in-law's birthday. Did you decide what kind of gift we should buy? 

1124
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:51,400
Not yet.

1125
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,970
I'll decide on my own. Aren't you busy?

1126
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:57,480
 I'm busy. I'm hanging up. 

1127
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:01,410
The team must be bothering you a lot, right?

1128
01:36:01,410 --> 01:36:03,790
They said they'd do only 1 interview.

1129
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:05,620
   

1130
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:14,530
Yes, Honey.

1131
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:17,960
 How about sneakers? He looks good with sports. 

1132
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:20,020
Sure. Sneakers sound good.

1133
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:24,530
But, Honey, I will buy it myself. So go back to work, okay?

1134
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:26,370
 Okay. Okay. 

1135
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,110
But what is the theme?

1136
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:31,890
Yes, right.

1137
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:35,530
'Youth?' I think they said it was 'Youth'.

1138
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:47,250
Hello.

1139
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:50,650
 Honey, should we buy slip-on? It's okay, right? 

1140
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:55,740
 Is that a bit overboard? Honey, when you buy get a wide one. These days-- 

1141
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:58,530
I said I will buy myself!

1142
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:02,160
Hey, how many times did you call me?

1143
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,350
We can talk at home.

1144
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:08,350
You! If you call once again I ought to WHACK! Get it?

1145
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:11,380
 Okay, ma'am. I will hang up now. 

1146
01:37:14,770 --> 01:37:16,810
What were we talking about?

1147
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:20,340
Nothing.

1148
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:25,180
I think sneakers will be good for Dad's birthday gift.

1149
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:28,310
Should I buy them? Is Dad's shoe size 270mm?

1150
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:31,370
275 mm for sneakers, and 270 mm for shoes.

1151
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:34,880
But then he has wide feet so it's different for every maker.

1152
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,920
I'll buy.

1153
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:46,000
 Are you angry? I'm sorry. But when will you be home? 

1154
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,800
What the heck?

1155
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:50,930
This...

1156
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:53,690
Deok Seon. I'm going.

1157
01:37:53,690 --> 01:37:57,400
Today is your friend's memorial!

1158
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:03,020
People don't change.

1159
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:08,340
The best star from our alley is not him anymore.

1160
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:11,080
It's Kim Jeong Bong, isn't he?

1161
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:13,030
Jeong Bong really became big, right?

1162
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:16,500
These days, that Home Meal Master Bong. You know Master Bong, right?

1163
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,270
I was watching Master Bong.

1164
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:23,090
But then, seeing him cook, it was the same.

1165
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:25,490
Back then, he liked sugar so much too.

1166
01:38:25,490 --> 01:38:27,240
Right.

1167
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,500
I still think...

1168
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:33,360
the ramyun that Oppa Jeong Bong cooked was the best tasting.

1169
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:37,380
Mi Ok must be lucky. Right? Her husband is a good cook.

1170
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:41,450
I'll cook ramyun for you tonight.

1171
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:44,570
Don't bother.

1172
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,730
What do you mean 'thanks?'

1173
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:51,630
We are more grateful.

1174
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:55,130
We had a good time talking about the past.

1175
01:38:55,130 --> 01:39:00,440
Now that we talked about it, we really played well in Ssangmundong.

1176
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,080
Right?

1177
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,470
Back then, why didn't we know?

1178
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:07,110
If we knew that then we would be adults then.

1179
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:12,950
Ah! Do you remember when we moved out family by family? Your family moved out first.

1180
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:16,960
My mom was crying so much in the neighborhood.

1181
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:21,990
I think she cried more compared to when Grandma passed away.

1182
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:23,590
That's right.

1183
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:30,440
Here you go.

1184
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,020
It's all ready. Hurry and get on.

1185
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:40,740
Yes, we're coming.

1186
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:53,760
♫  Today, from a forgotten friend, I got a call  ♫

1187
01:39:53,850 --> 01:40:01,550
Why don't you go first? I'll go after  taking care of those ladies.
♫  that he will be leaving far away tomorrow  ♫

1188
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:07,920
♫  He wants to meet in the alley  ♫

1189
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:13,510
♫   where we used to run and play together when we were young  ♫

1190
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:19,610
Oh, man! 
 ♫  He said tomorrow he is going far far away.  ♫

1191
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:24,430
Why? Well ... aren't we seeing each other again?

1192
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:30,030
Am I going to the United States? 
 ♫  Riding a bumpy subway  ♫

1193
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:34,110
Why why? 
 ♫  and finding his way back  ♫

1194
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:41,250
♫  so many things we have forgotten, as we live  ♫

1195
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:44,220
I'll call you often.

1196
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,980
Oh, Jeez.

1197
01:40:56,810 --> 01:41:00,460
Go. Don't cry. He's waiting.

1198
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:06,440
Hyungnim... right here...

1199
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:12,200
with really good people...

1200
01:41:13,230 --> 01:41:16,790
I spent really good times here...

1201
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:27,150
 It was Ahjussi Gil Dong's family who moved out of Ssangmoon-dong first. 

1202
01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:33,470
 Ahjussi Gil Dong wanted Ahjumma to live in a new apartment before they grew older, 

1203
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:37,080
 so they were the first to leave this alley. 

1204
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:41,530
 And the next, Do Ryong Nyong's family. 

1205
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:47,040
 After that, forever Ssangmundong's Madame Cheetah left this alley. 

1206
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:52,500
♫  Let us meet again with a wide smile  ♫

1207
01:41:52,500 --> 01:42:01,140
♫  He said tomorrow, he will go far, far away  ♫

1208
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:09,390
♫  riding a bumpy subway  ♫

1209
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:13,150
♫  and finding my way back  ♫

1210
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:17,390
♫  So many things  ♫

1211
01:42:17,390 --> 01:42:22,970
♫  we have forgotten, as we live  ♫

1212
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:29,800
 The last family that moved from this alley, was ours. 

1213
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:32,930
What takes you so long, Small Noona? Hurry up!

1214
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:42,820
 After the last family moved, our family, the whole alley became empty. 

1215
01:42:52,550 --> 01:43:02,520
♫  So many things we have forgotten, as we live  ♫

1216
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:05,100
Hurry up, Noona!

1217
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:08,300
Okay. I got it.

1218
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:16,420
Where did you say  you're moving to?

1219
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:20,890
A little far from here...

1220
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:22,930
Pankyo. We're moving to Pankyo.

1221
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:29,110
Yes. Aigoo. You really are going far. You must be going there to farm.

1222
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:32,050
- What?
- Isn't there nothing over there?

1223
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:42,050
♬ We have forgotten so many things. ♬

1224
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:49,420
You're asking if we want to go back to that time?

1225
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:55,350
I don't want to go back.

1226
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:58,950
I like now. Back then I was too sensitive.

1227
01:43:58,950 --> 01:44:04,330
And I also think that the sunlight is good now and I could hear the sound of the rain.

1228
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:06,860
I like it now.

1229
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:12,140
Still, if I can go back, there is something I want to do.

1230
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:16,870
What? Hanging out with friends all night in my room.

1231
01:44:16,870 --> 01:44:21,520
Play Blue Marble, cook and eat ramyun, watch A Better Tomorrow.

1232
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,630
If not playing with the guys, I don't like to go back to that time.

1233
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:33,150
I want to go back. 
 - Why?

1234
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:39,250
Because I have someone I want to meet.

1235
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:41,740
Who?

1236
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:47,710
They were young and like a big mountain... my parents.

1237
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:57,560
I miss my young and big like a mountain parents.

1238
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:04,150
Didn't they grow too old?

1239
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:08,940
Hey. What could we do about the time that's flowing?

1240
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:18,640
Seriously... The song ... Kim Chang Wan's song 'Youth'?

1241
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:22,750
When I heard it before it didn't really get to my heart.

1242
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:25,290
It just gets to you, right?
- Yeah.

1243
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:29,740
I feel like the song is all about my life.

1244
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:32,200
A day like this comes to me too.

1245
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:36,600
- That means you're old. 
 - That's right.

1246
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:43,460
Shall we go to Ssangmoon-dong this weekend?

1247
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:47,190
Hey. That place has been completely changed.

1248
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:50,180
It's all commercial and residential complexes.

1249
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:51,990
It can't possibly change that much.

1250
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:56,210
Aigoo. If you go, you would be shocked.

1251
01:45:56,210 --> 01:46:01,660
I went there about 10 years ago and it was different even then.

1252
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:04,180
- Wow.
- It would be better not to go.

1253
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:15,400
 When I went back again to Bong Hwang Dang alley, 

1254
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:21,390
 as much as the time has passed, the alley also grew old. 

1255
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:27,250
  Both my youth and this alley are the same, 

1256
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:33,950
  things I cannot go back to. 
♬    Will it leave someday, this green youth?  ♬ 

1257
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:39,750
 In the end time flows.   Everything and everyone passes, 
 ♬ Like a flower which wilts and blooms again ♬ 

1258
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:43,640
  and  everything and everyone  grows old. 
 ♬  With the bright moonlight♬ 

1259
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:46,600
 The reason why youth is beautiful 
 ♬ streaming through the window ♬ 

1260
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:50,140
 is probably because it was this at the time. 
♬ The love song of my youth is sad ♬ 

1261
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:55,040
 It was a brief moment which glistened brilliantly 
♬ I grasp at, grasp at ♬ 

1262
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:58,950
 to which I can never return. 
♬  the days which are gone♬ 

1263
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:05,000
♬  In an empty gesture when I am saddened ♬

1264
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,820
♬  Is it better to turn away and let it go?  ♬

1265
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:16,290
 The time where I poured out my tears, I also... 
♬  That is how time passes. ♬ 

1266
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:21,980
 had that youth.  
 ♬  Will it leave someday, this green youth?♬

1267
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:26,820
Special Forces, won't you hurry up.

1268
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:29,830
You're here.
- Deok Seon, why are you only here now?

1269
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:32,520
 Deok Seon, come quickly. 

1270
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:43,370
Why are you guys here?

1271
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:50,060
Why? Where else would we be? Hurry we borrowed A Better Tomorrow.

1272
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:55,890
What's wrong, Deok Seon? Did Bora noona beat you up again?

1273
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,640
I'm  playing the movie.

1274
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,440
Come here.

1275
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:19,190
 My wife said our baby girl is really beautiful, her eyes look a lot like mine. 

1276
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:21,440
 I can tell just by the handsome face of her father. 

1277
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:33,350
♫  Don't ask me about my sad experiences.

1278
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:38,980
♫  Don't need to know, don't ask about the purpose

1279
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:45,080
♬ How do we judge purpose or purposeless

1280
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:47,210
♬ Don't want, don't remember, don't know

1281
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:51,320
Wait a second! Did you fart again?

1282
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:54,900
When did I fart?

1283
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:59,710
Seon Woo, do you see me as a person who always farts in front of you guys?

1284
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,200
Take it easy! Take it easy!

1285
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:08,570
Oh man. It stinks.

1286
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:16,210
Hey. Be quiet. Isn't that my mom's voice?

1287
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:20,400
Kim Jeong Hwan! I said come eat!

1288
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,720
Kim Jeong Hwan! I said eat!

1289
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:38,620
♫   Somewhere the wind is blowing    ♫

1290
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:43,830
Seon Woo, let's eat.
♫   I am going there    ♫

1291
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:51,740
Deok Seon. Come eat!
♫   Under the tree that looks like your hair    ♫

1292
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:56,850
I have to go.
♫   Leaning on the bumpy train    ♫

1293
01:49:56,850 --> 01:50:01,840
So do I.
- I'm going, Master Choi. 
♫   I'm writing a letter    ♫

1294
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:10,840
♫   I'm standing in the road that I've seen in my dreams    ♫

1295
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:15,030
Son. Let's eat too.

1296
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:24,390
♫   Although it's an uncertain happiness with excitement and fear    ♫

1297
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:30,710
 Ssangmundong's 88 story is only until here. 

1298
01:50:30,710 --> 01:50:35,490
 Missing that time, missing that alley 

1299
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:40,000
 is not because I miss my younger self. 

1300
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,080
 In that place, my dad's youth, my mom's youth 

1301
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:52,850
 my friend's youth and the youth everything that I love is there. 

1302
01:50:53,610 --> 01:50:58,010
 Those youthful scenes that can't be gathered once again 

1303
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:03,680
 it's because it was regretful that a final farewell was not said. 

1304
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:07,370
 Now... those that have disappeared 

1305
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:13,310
 the time that can't be brought back, I say my late greetings. 

1306
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:20,850
 Goodbye, my youth. Goodbye, Ssangmoondong. 

1307

1320
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:29,710
 The hot and innocent, that's why we chillingly miss it. 

1321
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:33,970
 Do you hear? If you hear, then reply... 

1322
01:52:33,970 --> 01:52:39,490
 my 1988, the days of my youth.
