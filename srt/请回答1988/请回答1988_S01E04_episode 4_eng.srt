 Deok Seon, you're going to be late for school. Hurry up and come out. 
 November 1988, Seoul Dobong-gu, Ssangmun-dong 

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,820
 I understand. 

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,710
 I'm leaving. 

6
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,620
    

7
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,590
I'm going to leave!

8
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,310
- I'm leaving. 
 - Should I give you a ride?

9
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,680
Forget it. I have a car too.

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,440
Car?

11
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,470
Hi, Air Jordan.

12
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,190
I'm going—

13
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,980
I'm going—

14
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,010
No one's home, right? I know.

15
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,330
Right, my school bag.

16
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,730
Ahjussi, hurry up and let's go!

17
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,010
Hurry up and go!

18
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,830
Ahjussi!

19
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,790
Here. Take it, take it!

20
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,170
What is this, really?

21
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,700
Dong Ryong... Hey, hey! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

22
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,770
What is this?

23
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,760
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,260
Ahjussi, leave!

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,250
Should I just go home?

00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,110

 Episode 4: Can't help~ing 

28
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,650
I want to go to college.

29
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,710
Are you sick, you crazy girl? But it sounds nice to hear.

30
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,040
I will study starting today. Get me a tutor, too.

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,010
W-What tutoring?

32
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,410
You have an older sister who goes to Seoul National University.

33
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,450
You can learn from your sister. Why uselessly spend money?

34
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,300
Learn from your older sister.

35
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,380
 Let's do math. 

36
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,730
 Subtract X and move the rest to the right side. 

37
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,330
 Ah. 

38
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,950
 2X is 

39
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,650
 Six minus eight. 

40
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,420
 Really. 

41
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,260
 Are you sure? 

42
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,900
 Hey, idiot! 

43
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,170
 Did I tell you to put the minus sign when moving to the other side or not? 

44
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,170
 You did... 

45
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,310
 How many times do I have to say it? How many times? Are you a chicken? Do you have a chicken head? 

46
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,860
 This is a 7th grade problem, and even a first semester problem, at that. 

47
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,770
 Even if you're a rock head, how can you not solve such an easy problem? 

48
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,140
 You've had the wrong mindset, from the start. 

49
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,970
 Everything is a joke. You are not serious about anything. 

50
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,870
 You always have hazy eyes. 

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,430
 Always doing bullsh*t. Concentrate on everything all the time. 

52
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,920
 If you're stupid, you should at least try! 

53
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,150
 Is life so easy? Do you think living is easy? 

54
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,020
 The thing that is stuck to your neck, your head—why are you carrying that around? 

55
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,900
 Don't use that only for blow drying your hair, but also use it for studying. 

56
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,330
 Use your head! Use your head! 

57
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,380
 Even if you're a rock head, you can still memorize. 

58
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,090
 Don't bother trying to understand, but just memorize! Got it? 

59
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,220
 Oh, you chicken head! Really. 

60
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,400
 My heart hurts. 

61
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,230
Even if I die, I won't learn from Unni.

62
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,970
I will start going to the study room.

63
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,570
Mom, her concentration is the problem.

64
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,690
She can't sit down at a desk for more than ten minutes.

65
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,290
I've never seen Little Noona sitting at a desk.

66
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,670
Ah, you know, from what I've heard at the bank,

67
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,640
theres a thing that really helps you concentrate.

68
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,410
What is that?

69
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,720
Girl, you should feel lucky having me for a father.

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,010
And you will know how blessed you are to live in this alley.

71
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,190
I'm sorry for coming when you're busy.

72
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,600
Do you know how to play baduk?

73
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,380
Go first.

74
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,010
 (The stone should be placed on an intersection of the grid lines.)  

75
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,850
Do you want to eat ramyun?

76
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,550
Should I make it?

77
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,120
Oh my. Where did you get such expensive yellow corvina?

78
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,450
I bought it because it was on sale. I just bought one box.

79
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,370
Hurry up and eat it, Bo Ra's father.

80
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,440
I've never eaten this at home.

81
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,030
How do I eat this?

82
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,160
You just have to eat it holding it with your hand.

83
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,940
It hasn't been long since we started eating this, either.

84
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,780
Jeong Bong's mother is really a great man. Great man.

85
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,220
How did you think of sharing such an expensive thing?

86
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,740
It's almost too precious to share with even your own family.

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Oh my, oh my.

88
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,850
Oh my. It's so plump. Look at its body.

89
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,470
Oh my.

90
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,910
I'm going to die.

91
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,850
It tastes so good.

92
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,010
I heard that Deok Seon is learning to play baduk.

93
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,110
They do say that baduk is good for concentration.

94
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,750
Baduk is probably hard.

95
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,800
Deok Seon will probably not last long.

96
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,150
This person, why are you saying such upsetting words?

97
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,830
What do you mean she won't last long? She lasted one day and already quit.

98
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,790
It's not nice to say this about my own daughter, but

99
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,140
she doesn't have the brain for studying.

100
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,110
But these days she's doing these little movements with her hands.

101
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,520
They say that is good for concentrating.

102
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,860
What are you doing not eating?

103
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,250
I'm going to take your rice, go get more for yourself.

104
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,650
Really.

105
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,810
What are you doing not eating?

106
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,430
Do you want to switch? I'll take the lid off for you. You do this.

107
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,260
Here.

108
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,840
Here, work on it. I'm going to the restroom.

109
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,730
Hyung-nim, is Jeong Bong studying well these days?

110
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,950
There are less than fifty days left until the achievement test, right?

111
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,120
Three, two, one. Start!

112
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,010
Hurry, hurry!

113
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:42,810


114
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,480
I have to spoon the fermented beans.

115
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,950
Aigoo. Where did you go early in the morning?

116
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,560
It's my wife's birthday today. I'm going to make her some seaweed soup.

117
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,650
I'm going to go in.

118
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,890
Hey, you boy!

119
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,650
I'm going to kill you.

120
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,050
I'm sorry.

121
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,830
I'm going to leave.

122
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,210
You know that we're going to eat out tonight, right? Come home early.

123
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,190
We're having late night study.

124
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,820
Today is Saturday.

125
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,510
Do you want to die?

126
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,840
I have to come by five o'clock, right?

127
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,430
What is that shoe?

128
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,510
What? Why? What?

129
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,090
Can't you see? It's Air Jordan. Why?

130
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,160
You're going to get caught for wearing those. Basketball shoes are automatically caught, you idiot.

131
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,580
But Seon Woo is the school leader starting last week, you idiot.

132
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,400
How nice for you that your friend is the school leader, you idiot.

133
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,200
You must feel great because you don't have to bring your lunch today.

134
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,380
That, that, you can eat the thing stuck on your chin, idiot.

135
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,390
I'm leaving.

136
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,890
 Banghak-dong via Ssangmun-dong to Toegye-ro
 Toegye-ro via Seoul Station to Banghak-dong 

137
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,930
 Ssangmun-dong -Seoul Station 

138
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,010
Where are we? Did we arrive at the school? Do we get off?

139
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,240
We still have a long way to go. Do you think I'll leave without you?

140
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,590
Deok Seon, where are you? Do you hear me? Answer me, Deok Seon. Deok Seon!

141
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,090
Don't call my name.

142
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,110
Ahjussi!

143
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,050
Ah, really!

144
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,100
What's wrong? Did an accident happen?

145
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,140
Do we get off? What do I do?

146
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,980
 Do I get off? What do I do? What happened? 

147
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,830
  GoldStar is an electronics brand. It later became LG Electronics 

148
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,350
Honey, time is up.

149
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,530
Stop putting on makeup. You look beautiful without it.

150
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,140
What time is it right now?

151
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,960
4:33 PM. It's almost time.

152
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,470
Jeong Hwan, Jeong Bong, hurry up and come out, too.

153
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,350
You guys are really dressing up because we're going out to eat after a long time.

154
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,930
What is this? Is this really my son?

155
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,720
Aren't you an actor? You really dressed up. Is it new?

156
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,430
I wore it yesterday, too.

157
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,920
What about Hyung? Tell him to hurry up and come out.

158
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,810
Hyung, hurry up and let's go out. Today's Mom's birthday. We're eating out.

159
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,990
Until I finish this, I will not leave or step out of this room.

160
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,930
It's a fight with myself.

161
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,450
We're going to eat pork cutlet.

162
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,470
I think I'll get carsick if I do this in the car.

163
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:18,500
What is your mother doing that she isn't coming out? Honey! Ra Mi Ran! Ra Mi—

164
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,030
Honey, why did you stuff so much in your shoulders?

165
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,160
Can't I stay home?

166
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,570
No. We have to eat all together.

167
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,260
Hurry up and get in. Since there's stuff in the front seat, all three of you ride in the back.

168
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,480
Let's go, Kit.

169
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,010
 GoldStar Electronics Retail Store 

170
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,450
Wife, did we eat all the cockles? (cockles = small clams)

171
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,950
Yes, there are none left.

172
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,010
Then it's good to buy it ahead of time, before we run out.

173
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,210
You know that I'm only able to eat rice with cockles.

174
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,950
Stop eating that already. Do you know how annoying it is to make marinated cockles?

175
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,900
It takes a long time to wash them and boil them. Then I have to open up each one and marinate them.

176
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,080
Do you think it just appears if you ask for it?

177
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,200
This person, did I ask you to steam ribs or fry corvina?

178
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,490
It's just one thing, cockles, that I love. You can't even make that?

179
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,710
And just because I said that, why do you glare at me like you're going to kill me?

180
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,440
And now you can see that Socrates didn't ever say anything wrong.

181
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,420
"An evil wife is still a wife."

182
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,470
Because it's me, I am able to live with you.

183
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,860
You are talking bullsh*t.

184
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,630
Because it's me, I'm able to live with you.

185
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,970
Do you have any mood or manners?

186
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,060
It's because I have mood that we were able to have three children.

187
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,600
Turn off the television!

188
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,640
Do you have something stuck in your ear? I'm going to throw that TV away!

189
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,520
Turn down the volume, you punk!

190
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,500
 Weekend. The first week of this story. Always a fresh enjoyment, this show is shining... 

191
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,100
Is this the time for you to watch "Enjoy Saturday?" Did you stop studying? Next year you're a junior in high school.

192
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,980
Who do you take after that you're like this?

193
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,110
Oh my! Why is that my fault? Why is that my fault?!

194
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,840
If he resembled me, he would be first place in the nation! He takes after you!

195
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,600
What did you say? Say it again.

196
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,460
What about my brain? What about my brain?!

197
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,410
Truthfully, you didn't even graduate high school.

198
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,130
We decided not to say that in front of the kids!

199
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,760
You said it first to me!

200
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,330
Get out, you!

201
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,540
 - Get out, you punk!
 - Why are you doing that to this kid? 

202
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:23,730
Will you order? We have delicious beef cutlet.

203
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,630
Give us four pork cutlets.

204
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,350
Father, I will order beef cutlet.

205
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,480
I will order hamburger steak.

206
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,130
But this place has delicious pork cutlets.

207
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,500
- Beef.
 - Hamburger.

208
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,270
Give us two pork cutlet, one beef cutlet, one hamburger  skate... 

209
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,770
...one hamburger  state , I mean, one hamburger  steak .

210
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,100
Will you have rice or bread?

211
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,040
Rice.

212
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,810
I'll have the same thing.

213
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,960
As a family we are having a sweet dinner out.

214
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,160
There's probably no family that is more harmonious than ours in the world.

215
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,890
Isn't that so, Jeong Bong?

216
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,520
Yes, Father, eat a lot too.

217
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,160
I am full just seeing

218
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,810
my kids and my Mi Ran eating deliciously.

219
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,060
Jeong Hwan, do you want to eat more hamburger steak? Do you want me to order one more?

220
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,350
I already ordered more.

221
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,910
Why do you talk so much? You're spitting saliva. Be quiet.

222
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,710
I understand.

223
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,350
Why, why? Why?

224
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,320
I'll take a picture.

225
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,620
- Ah, yes. Thank you. 
 - No, it's okay.

226
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,310
Take it. Let's take one together. Hurry up and take it, please.

227
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,540
I don't want to.

228
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,680
Jeong Hwan, let's take one photo. Jeong Bong, eat after we take one.

229
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,050
When will we come here again? Jeong Hwan, you can eat after taking a picture.

230
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,650
Let go of the fork.

231
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,650
Honey, you're extremely pretty today. Hurry up and look there. He's waiting.

232
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,880
Today is a good day so let's take one picture. He's waiting. Look there. Smile. Smile.

233
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,840
Smile. Smile! Let's smile! Pork cutlet.

234
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,940
 One, two, three! 

235
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:06,650
♫  Every day with you   ♫

236
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,170
 Don't Sleep Study Room 

237
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,790
Study, you bastard.

238
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:02,350
 The only thing I can give you is candy. 
 (Sa-rang = love, she changed it to Sa-tang = candy)

239
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,660
♫  Why do the birds fly?  ♫ (Song: "The Only Thing I can Give You is Love" by Byun Jin Seob)

240
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,300
♫  Why does the wind blow?  ♫

241
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:30,290
♫   Love is still the only thing   ♫

242
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:36,750
♫   which is everything my heart can carry  ♫

243
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:49,050
♫  It's still only love. It's still only love. ♫

244
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:55,230
Jeong Hwan, I bought Italiano.

245
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,890
The luxurious ice cream, Italiano. Hurry up and let's eat it together.

246
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,490
Hey, Kim Jeong Hwan.

247
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,770
Then I'll put it on top of the table. Come out and eat it.

248
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,860
Big Son, let's eat ice cream with Dad.

249
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,790
Hey, Oldest Son, you don't want to eat ice cream with dad?

250
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,460
Then, I'll leave it in the kitchen. Come out and eat it.

251
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,670
 Today, at the finals of the 7th Professional Baduk Players' Championship 

252
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,230
 Choi Taek 6-dan was taken over by rookie Park Joon Hyeong. 

253
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,460
 From the first phase of the finals, rookie Park went against Choi Taek 6-dan, and 

254
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,880
 scored a decisive victory after only 123 moves when Choi conceded his loss. 

255
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,940
 Choi Taek 6-dan, from the beginning of the finals to the end 

256
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,700
 was led around the game, and finally gave up exhausted. ,

257
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,480
 Choi Taek has exhibited weakness against new players in the past, and he 

258
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,970
 again bowed his head to his jinx. 

259
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,180
 People are worried that Choi Taek 6-dan may fall into a slump. 

260
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,700
Hey, Dong Ryong, today, Taek...

261
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,310
Where are you going, Mom?

262
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,840
Yeah, I'm going to take some kimchi pancakes to Taek's house.

263
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,000
They said that he lost today. Don't say anything to him. I feel sorry for him.

264
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,880
What again? Where are you going again?

265
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,240
Well, to the front over here for a moment.

266
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,940
- Aren't you hungry? 
 - I'm okay.

267
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,150
What time is it right now?

268
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,510
You didn't give Haeng Kook (their dog) food today, right?

269
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,240
Hurry up and feed him.

270
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,330
Should I do it at my age? (imitating the comedy he just saw on TV)

271
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,670
Then at this age, should I do it?

272
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,900
Aigoo, I'm embarrassed.

273
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,130
Aigoo, President Kim!

274
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,750
Where are you going?

275
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,200
To the restroom.

276
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,170
- Give Haeng Kook food. 
 - Yes.

277
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,320
Haeng Kook. Ah, you scared me.

278
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,090
Make some noise when you walk.

279
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,210
Why don't you?

280
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,780
Where are you coming from?

281
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,620
From the study room, so I can study.

282
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,780
You're lying. You weren't digging a grave?

283
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,360
Was it a frozen corpse?

284
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,820
Aigoo, how old are you.

285
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,700
At this time of night, you eat ice cream.

286
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Ah! You scared me!

287
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,770
What's wrong with him?

288
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,690
Deok Seon, do you have pencil lead?

289
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,990
Follow me, Seon Woo.

290
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,480
Are you sleeping?

291
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,560
It's kimchi pancake. Kimchi pancake.

292
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,230
Is Taek sleeping?

293
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,410
Let's just act like we don't know.

294
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,530
He's having a harder time than before.

295
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:01,250
You should not worry about it either. It would burden the child if he knows.

296
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,680
Act like you don't know. Like you don't know. I'm leaving.

297
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,140
Eat the kimchi pancake. Kimchi pancake.

298
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,500
 Italiano 

299
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,020
Jin Joo, eat.

300
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,640
Mom, we start today, right?

301
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,140
Yes, Jeong Bong's mom is being very generous.

302
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,160
I don't want to! I said I don't to get tutoring from Unni!

303
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,280
Wife, are there no cockles?

304
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,710
Be quiet. Just eat it.

305
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,020
Girl, just do it knowing you're lucky. At least do it for your Unni's sake.

306
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,600
I don't want to, really!

307
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,490
She's going to tutor Hyung Jeong Hwan, but she's including you as a bonus.

308
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,050
You, be quiet.

309
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,060
Don't you understand, girl?

310
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,900
Isn't Jeong Bong's mother paying your unni for tutoring so she can have some money?

311
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,950
Does Jeong Hwan even need tutoring? The only person who needs tutoring in this neighborhood is you!

312
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,210
There's also Hyung Dong Ryong, too.

313
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,950
Dong Ryong's father is a teacher so why does he need tutoring?

314
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,500
Anyway, we start today so don't say anything and just study.

315
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,470
Don't think her as an older sister, but as a teacher!

316
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,710
I'm not going to do it. I'm really not going to do it.

317
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,340
You crazy... If you don't, it's your loss, girl.

318
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,120
I heard that the second and first place in class, Jeong Hwan and Seon Woo are going to do it too.

319
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,000
Why are you still being stubborn about being tutored?

320
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,980
Why are you uselessly being stubborn? Just do as  you are told.

321
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,350
If your mom tells you to do it, just do it.

322
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,400
 I heard that Seon Woo is also coming... Seon Woo is also coming... 

323
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,060
♫  When the phone rings  ♫
 (Song: Yoo Jae Ha's "Our Love")

324
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,510
♫  and I pick up the phone  ♫

325
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:14,490
♫  I hear your voice  ♫

326
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,620
♫  I cannot control  ♫

327
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,130
♫  my desire to see you  ♫

328
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:29,910
♫  so I bravely called you  ♫

329
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,100
♫  Mr. Sun smiles  ♫

330
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,740
♫  Mr. Moon smiles  ♫

331
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:45,890
♫  I feel like they are watching over our love  ♫

332
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,470
♫  With your heart, try feeling it  ♫

333
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,010
Hyung.

334
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,680
♫  How much of me is in your heart  ♫

335
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:07,070
♫  Tell me with those lips  ♫

336
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:13,260
♫  That you loved me since a long time ago  ♫

337
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,110
♫  With your heart  ♫

338
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,760
It's cold! 
 ♫  Try feeling it  ♫

339
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,540
♫  How much of me is in your heart  ♫

340
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,580
♫  Listen to what I'm saying  ♫

341
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,520
Do you want to have juice?

342
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,170
You drink it.

343
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:45,240
You hurry up and get dressed, too. The kids are coming to be tutored.

344
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,470
Don't bother them and let's go out.

345
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,170
I said let's go out.

346
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,060
Go out alone. I want to stay here.

347
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,830
What about Jeong Bong's father? He usually isn't able to leave you alone.

348
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,510
I don't know. He's mad about something.

349
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,200
I am married to a child.

350
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,620
Hurry up and come here. Let's have a drink.

351
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,510
Aigoo, why are we drinking in the daytime? I'm scared that a stranger might see.

352
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,630
Where is a stranger? We all know everyone.

353
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,880
What about Bo Ra's father?

354
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,940
You both should have come out so we can have a daytime drink.

355
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,800
I don't know. He left since the morning to meet his friends.

356
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,490
Aigoo. On this kind of day, how nice would it be

357
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,800
if he were to go to the spa with No Eul and help out at home. He only thinks about himself.

358
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,020
How nice it is that he doesn't bother his wife.

359
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,330
Aigoo, Hyung-nim, you're speaking like a pampered lady.

360
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,610
If Bo Ra's father is as half as good as Jeong Bong's father, I would carry him on my back all the time.

361
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,380
I would serve him like my lord.

362
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,270
It's only appealing for one or two days.

363
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,500
It would be nice if he met his friends and went out on the weekends.

364
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,170
He always follows me around in the house. It's so sickening.

365
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,110
You two really don't have manners.

366
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,590
Are you teasing me because I'm a widow?

367
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,710
Are you bragging that you have a husband?

368
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,300
Your destiny is the best.

369
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,620
Aigoo. You almost deceived me.

370
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,550
I almost believed you.

371
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,570
- Then marry Taek's father. It's fate that you two live in the same alley.

372
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,470
What are you saying? Are you crazy, really?

373
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,530
What's wrong with that?

374
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,340
Oh my. It must be destiny. It's Taek's dad.

375
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,600
Anyway, I might as well live with a rock than with that guy.

376
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,140
But he has a lot of money.

377
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,350
We should fix Seon Yeong's fortune (help her remarry well) at a late age.

378
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,360
What if he has a lot of money? He doesn't speak two words a day.

379
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,170
Must I serve religious or scholarly penance throughout my twilight years?

380
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,270
Even though I can live with a person without money, I can't live with a boring person.

381
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,700
Then how about my husband?

382
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,710
Forget it. You can keep him.

383
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,380
I was going to fetch the plate from your home.

384
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,370
It was not far.

385
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,610
Is Taek alright?

386
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,320
Well, he is.

387
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,770
Just act like you don't know. That's the best.

388
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,820
Yes.

389
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,110
Is there a law that Taek has to win in every baduk competition? There are times he can lose.

390
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,180
We won't say anything to him when we see him.

391
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,630
But the alley is so quiet even though it's Sunday. Where are the kids?

392
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,690
Ah... The kids are getting tutored today by Bo Ra.

393
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:36,670
- What? 
 -The kids are seniors in high school now, so they're going to get tutoring from Bo Ra.

394
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,850
Our Big Hyung-nim was quite generous this time.

395
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,950
Isn't that tutoring illegal?

396
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,550
Why is it illegal when we're doing it among ourselves? Who is there to report?

397
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,690
Are you going to report us?

398
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,240
Aigoo, have a drink.

399
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,270
- No, no. you drink it. 
 - No, no!

400
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,390
A drink! One drink!

401
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,610
Are you here, too?

402
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,780
Yes.

403
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,300
But your father is a teacher.

404
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,260
What if he reports us to the Education Office? Did you tell your dad?

405
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,570
My dad is busy. My mom signed me up for this.

406
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,190
Why is your dad busy when it's Sunday?

407
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,820
My dad

408
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,850
is tutoring.

409
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,900
You think I'm a chemistry teacher, right? That's bullsh*t!

410
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,560
I am

411
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,790
not a chemistry teacher but what?

412
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,450
Music teacher!

413
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,590
Okay buddy, bingo! So then let's have some music.

414
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,470
Your Highnesses, shall we hear it?

415
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,270
We'll start with the periodic elements table.

416
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,940
One, two, one, two, three, four!

417
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:08,560
The Dean of Students— I mean your father

418
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,430
is a chemistry teacher, but he's also teaching math?

419
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,800
His original major is math. It's a twist, right?

420
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,650
Wow.

421
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,730
Quadratic equation. One, two! One! Two! Three! Four!

422
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,340
E A E  for minus

423
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,930
B plus minus root

424
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,510
B squared minus

425
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,670
----------the radical equation.

426
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,650
It's all memorized!

427
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,730
You bastards.

428
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,720
Did you bring your math books?

429
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,760
What is this?

430
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,340
She only looked at the set theory.

431
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,750
For sets I'm the best in my class.

432
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,330
Eyy -- you must be proud.

433
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,910
Why is this book like this? Why is it so wrinkly?

434
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,190
Don't touch that. It's Dong Ryong's saliva.

435
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,840
Let's give up math.

436
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,090
Physics. Let's test your physics.

437
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:50,460
With very easy problems. Seventh grade problems.

438
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,730
You know that F=ma, right?

439
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,000
Jeong Hwan's mass is 70 kg.

440
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,930
Hits Seon Woo with Newton's force of 20.  How much is the acceleration?

441
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,220
How did you bear that?

442
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,570
It must have hurt.

443
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,570
You endured it well.

444
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,190
It's fine that you didn't get hurt.

445
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,000
Juice.

446
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,900
Enjoy.

447
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,930
Thanks, Oppa.

448
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,620
You are welcome. My pleasure.

449
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,220
Hyung. Where are you going?

450
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,120
To Taek's.

451
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,850
I need to ask him about this.

452
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:03,060
Taek isn't here. He went to the baduk academy. We're not able to see him these days either.

453
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,480
Why are you here on Sunday?

454
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,090
Taek, you're 6-dan now.  (Professonal rank in baduk)  Shouldn't you relax on a Sunday?

455
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,430
To him this is resting.

456
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,220
How can you win every day? You could lose sometimes.

457
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,850
Losing is also experience, they say.

458
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:52,480
Master Choi, think of it as a good experience and forget it.

459
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:59,290
Still, he's still in first place for his winning rate.

460
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,400
It's okay, it's okay. You don't need to worry about it.

461
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,880
Other people lose twenty or thirty  times a year.

462
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,360
If you win 70% of the time,

463
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,710
aigoo, that is great too.

464
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,530
Hey! What's with you? You never come on Sundays.

465
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,440
I came here to comfort our Taek.

466
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,660
You're okay, right?

467
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,810
Of course. How can the great Taek win all the time?

468
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:37,480
And there's still the big competition left. It's okay.

469
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,890
I'm worried about Taek.

470
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:48,770
That's right.

471
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,950
I worry more about your lives!

472
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:55,790
I thought that at least you were good at English.

473
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,090
Kids, English is memorization. Just memorize it.

474
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,700
Just think of them all as idiomatic expressions and memorize it. Understand?

475
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:09,580
Do you even have any words you know? Do you even have any idiomatic expressions you memorized?

476
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,310
- We do. Who do you see me as? 
 - What?

477
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,480
I, my, me, mine.

478
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,910
You, you, your, you're.

479
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:20,240
- That's what you learned in seventh grade. 
 - He, his, him, he's.

480
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,750
I'm going crazy.

481
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,670
She, her, her, her's!

482
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,130
We, our, us, ours.

483
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,270
Noona, we also know how to do this in German.

484
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,600
Der, des, dem, dem, die, der, der, die, das, dem, das, die, der, dem, die.  (T/N: Definite articles in German) 

485
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,490
You didn't forget that you have to go to Deok Seon's school tomorrow, right?

486
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:43,620
I don't even know when I'm going to finish working at the bank. You go alone.

487
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,160
They said both of us have to come. It's the first college counseling. How can I go alone?

488
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,610
I understand. Just say one verse. I'm going.

489
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,870
- Good bye.
 - Yes.

490
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:58,080
Don't gossip with people after work

491
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,580
and call home when you finish work. Why don't you call more often?

492
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,540
Look at Jeong Bong's father. He calls from his work once every hour.

493
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:08,120
- Other husbands— 
 - I understand. Just say one verse, I said.

494
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,980
Am I your child? Whenever you talk you try to chew me up.

495
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,500
Just quietly— Oh my.

496
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,440
Oh, Taek ...

497
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,190
He's having a difficult time right now.

498
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,260
Don't uselessly talk about the competition. Be careful of your trap.

499
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,430
To your heaven-like husband, what's with the trap?  A trap.  I ought to ...

500
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,280
Master Choi, hello.

501
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,070
Well, here, drink this.

502
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,910
Drink this.

503
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:46,120
And bring your father and eat dinner with us.

504
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,280
Today I made beef and seaweed soup.  Do you like seaweed soup?

505
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,850
I'm okay. Then...

506
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:59,020
Okay...

507
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,200
Good bye. Go in.

508
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,570
He looks really tired.

509
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,500
Did you give your common sense to the neighbor's dog, Haeng Gook?

510
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,020
Did you just tell a child who lost a competition to eat seaweed soup?  (Because seaweed is slippery, it's like letting success slip away.) 

511
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:19,940
Oh my. Right. What should I do? I forgot. What should I do?

512
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,680
Hurry up and apologize.

513
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,300
Are you coming now?

514
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,900
What about dinner?

515
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,390
I ate.

516
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,700
Taek,

517
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,370
cheer up. Okay?

518
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,760
Yes.

519
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,840
What about Dad?

520
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,340
He said that he's not going to eat.

521
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,400
Wait.

522
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,820
Eat.

523
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,510
The soup is getting cold.

524
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,620
What is he mad about again?

525
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,540
Where are you going? You're not going to eat dinner?

526
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,630
To Taek's room. I'm going to eat with the kids.

527
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:46,090
Don't bother Taek and hurry back home!

528
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,490
Yes!

529
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,800
Eat.

530
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,420
Hey! Eat.

531
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,620
Yeah.

532
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:08,300
Hey, she is Kim Hye Soo, right?

533
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,410
Wow, she is beautiful. She is beautiful.

534
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,250
Is she about twenty-two or twenty-three years old?

535
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,620
Nineteen. She's nineteen years old. She's younger than Bo Ra Noona.

536
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,880
Oh my. Nineteen?

537
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,550
Oh my. But what kind of nineteen year old is so good at acting?

538
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:30,360
Just look at that face.  It looks like  a high class person.

539
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,720
Aigoo. Are there people that don't look like that at age nineteen?

540
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,800
I was that pretty when I was nineteen years old.

541
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,380
What nonsense are you saying?

542
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,370
I met you when you were eighteen years old. That time you were really

543
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:47,680
healthy.

544
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,190
Then was the person I met not Il Hwa   (one flower)  but Ihwa   (plum blossum)? 

545
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,950
Aigoo, do you know how you were then?

546
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,620
Your face was filled with acne.

547
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:59,410
Aigoo, I met you because I was me.

548
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:05,560
Oh my. What is 'you' to your husband? To your heaven-like husband?

549
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,120
Anyway this unlearned speck of dust.

550
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,730
Are you sitting and sound heaven-like.  More like you farted.

551
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:21,050
Farted?  Just where do you come off talking like that?

552
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,300
You girl, where are you going now not eating dinner?

553
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,190
To Taek's room.

554
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:28,050
- Don't go! 
 - Don't go!

555
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,700
Do you know how chaotic it is because Taek has fallen into a slump?

556
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,000
Don't bother him and stay in the house.

557
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,730
Even the adults are being careful about Taek's feelings.

558
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,620
Mom, I'm going out!

559
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,120
Dinner is ready. Where are you going?

560
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,220
I'm going to eat with the kids in Taek's room!

561
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,870
Seon Woo! Seon Woo!

562
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,950
Don't say anything to Taek.

563
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:53,580
He... He's going to do it...

564
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,400
 Taek. Tae— 

565
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,980
 I'm washing up. 

566
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,430
Okay.

567
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,790
Ahjussi, is Taek here?

568
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:34,050
Yeah, he came. But these days Taek's condition—

569
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,530
Taek! Hyung-nim is here!

570
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,330
- Go Gil Dong Ahjussi! 
 - Hello!

571
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,700
Is Hee Dong here?

572
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,290
Yeah. But these days—

573
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,150
You don't need an explanation.

574
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:48,960
- Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
 - If your just taste it yourself

575
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,620
I don't know, I don't know.

576
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:55,670
- You have to know what you need to know. 
 -I don't know. 
 - I don't know either.

577
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,090
Hello, Ahjussi.

578
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,160
- Taek— 
 - He's here.

579
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,000
He's been here since a while ago.

580
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,950
Yes. Taek!

581
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,680
Aiyoo. I heard that you totally lost.

582
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,390
You did well, bastard. Do you think you'll be able to go around the neighborhood because of embarrassment?

583
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,100
Taek, hi.

584
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,260
I heard that Taek lost. Geez!

585
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,100
Aigoo.

586
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,590
Hey, I heard that you lost.

587
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,030
That's right. The time came for you to lose.

588
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,470
The timing was right to lose.

589
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,280
It was a mistake.

590
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,980
Mistake, my butt. How can a genius baduk player make a mistake?

591
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,850
Then do I have to always win?

592
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,150
You always have to win.

593
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,440
You can't lose, you can't have a jinx, you can't have a slump. You can't poop—

594
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,260
No, you can poop. Instead it must not stink.

595
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,160
Hey, is it the time to laugh?

596
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,680
Curse. Rather curse. Try it. Try doing it like this.

597
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,000
Like f***, it's f***ed up.

598
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,150
Seon Woo.

599
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,290
Like f***, it's f***ed up.

600
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,510
Hey, wow...

601
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:33,280
- Try it.
 - Hurry up and try it.

602
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,460
Like f***, it's f***ed up.

603
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,780
Ah, really. Idiot, if your going to curse, do it properly.

604
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,880
Like f***, it's f***ed up.

605
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,610
It is. It is! It is!

606
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,920
Like f***, it's f***ed up.

607
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,920
Like f***, it's f***ed up.

608
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,220
Like f***, it's f***ed up.

609
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,290
Like f***, it's f***ed up.

610
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,190
Like f***, it's f***ed up.

611
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,860
 Deok Seon's personality is very bright. 

612
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:47,960
She tries hard and she has great relationships with her friends.

613
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,850
She has great relationships with her friends and has a great personality, but

614
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,590
her grades this time are a bit...

615
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:18,330
What are you doing? Hurry up and come!

616
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:21,520
The rain is...

617
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:30,310
Aigoo.

618
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:30,910
Oh my.

619
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,200
What are you doing not coming in?

620
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,680
You could have helped me.

621
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:39,010
Why is the rain so...

622
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,980
Give us two kalguksu (knife noodles)!

623
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,820
I'm going to eat soojaebee (dough soup).

624
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:46,720
Ask me before ordering.

625
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,280
What, ah. Yes, let's get  soojaebee. Soojaebee.

626
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,000
Give us one soojaebee and one kalguksu.

627
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:59,010
I told you that we should take care of Deok Seon's study beforehand.

628
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:02,490
I said that even though we can't give her a tutor we should send her to an academy.

629
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,910
Wife, we can slowly do it.

630
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:10,170
There's still one year left, and

631
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:16,170
I also am having a hard time. It's so hard living this white collar life.  Do you have any idea how hard it is?

632
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:19,820
And I see that wives take care of children's academics themselves in other families.

633
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:24,330
If you took care of it, would Deok Seon be in that state?

634
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:25,910
Oh my.

635
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:30,350
Is it my fault? Is it my fault that Deok Seon is 999th place in the school?

636
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:34,740
Do you think it's easy raising three on a pittance?

637
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:39,070
If I had money, do you think I'd leave my child like that?

638
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:44,030
Aigoo... Really, my fate...

639
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:48,810
Oh my... What is wrong with your fate?

640
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:51,620
Am I some kind of crazy who gambles away the house?

641
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:56,660
Did I cheat on you and give you a hard time? Did I always drink alcohol and beat you up?

642
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,400
Forget it. Stop it. So noisy.

643
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,390
Let's just eat kalguksu.

644
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,250
She married a Chinese person.

645
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:18,200
Jiao Jumin.

646
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,380
Oh, something is stuck in my teeth again.

647
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,740
So dirty.

648
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,880
Why is it raining so much?

649
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,460
 Please make sure you do not switch your umbrella with someone else's 

650
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:34,660
Aigoo, even if I can't change my husband, should I change my umbrella?

651
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:43,600
Oh my. Where did my umbrella go?

652
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:49,110
Aigoo, how can they take someone else's umbrella?

653
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,690
Excuse me. Is there no owner for this umbrella?

654
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,720
Whose is this?

655
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:13,380
Aigoo, I think this umbrella's owner took the wrong one. It can't be helped.

656
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,660
It's cold.

657
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,840
That's right. My luck...

658
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:40,640
What are you doing not coming?

659
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,070
No matter how much other's stuff seems better,

660
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:08,270
it's all in vain.

661
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,920
What are you doing not holding my arm?

662
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,630
Follow.

663
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:38,230
Jeong Bong! Jeong Hwan! Eat some kimchi pancakes!

664
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,950
 Yes! 

665
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,610
Father, kimchi pancakes...

666
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:18,590
Hey, Dong Ryong, for a few days my dad hasn't said anything.

667
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:20,680
What do you think is the matter?

668
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,390
It's probably because of you, or your brother, or your mom.

669
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:31,120
What should I do?

670
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:37,900
Your dad is the easiest person for whom you can relieve anger.

671
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,410
Accept it.

672
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:42,100
What?

673
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:19,800
Is it Deok Seon? Deok Seon, I'm in the kitchen.

674
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:24,720
Aigoo, President Seong!

675
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,060
Aigoo, President Kim!

676
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:44,360
This is very

677
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,590
nice to meet you.

678
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,600
Nice to meet you!

679
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:53,590
Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you!

680
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:17,720
I came here to get juice. I'm going to eat dinner with the kids.

681
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:42,550
♫  The place where I can feel your breath  ♫  

682
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:48,670
♫  Catches and stays with my heart  ♫

683
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,750
Aigoo, lower the volume of the television. Do you like the television that much?

684
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:13,530
♬   Oh everything which I have beside me   ♬

685
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:18,150
♬   really gives me joy.   ♬

686
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:22,750
It tastes so good. The flavor is perfect.

687
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:29,270
 There is nothing more dull and pathetic as my room. 

688
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:31,390
Does it taste good?

689
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:39,950
♬   Stay endlessly.   ♬

690
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:48,450
♬  I have scraped along each moment over the years  ♬

691
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:58,250
♬    to the extent you were by my side.   ♬

692
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:06,490
♬  My dreaming will not end.   ♬

693
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:12,040
♬   Love will always be next to me.  ♬

694
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,940
Since it's raining, should we drink some soju?

695
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:23,610
♫  The places where your feet dwell  ♫

696
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:29,880
 There is nothing more dull and pathetic as my things. 

697
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:37,840
 But another word for 'dull' and 'pathetic' can be 'familiar' and 'comfortable.' 

698
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:43,210
 My familiar and comfortable things and people that were created through the passage of time 

699
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:48,840
 sincerely know me, hug me, and comfort me. 

700
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,540
 Although sometimes we don't want to see them because they are pathetic and dull, 

701
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:57,760
 still those who can protect me are my people. 

702
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:03,630
That is why we cannot help loving

703
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:07,310
our comfortable and familiar people.

704
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,540
We cannot help loving back.

705
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,190
We cannot not love them.

706
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,370
That jerk.

707
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,680
Seon Woo, it's raining outside.

708
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,500
I am raining.

709
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,540
It's raining.

710
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,120
Ah.

711
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:40,270
Hey Taek, my hyung had that for one week.

712
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:43,200
Try it and tell me so I can tell my hyung.

713
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,990
Okay.

714
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:47,560
Open the door!

715
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,070
Spread something! Spread something!

716
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,280
Hey!

717
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:03,450
Hey! That. Over there!

718
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,150
Is studying going well?

719
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:19,640
Hey, do you think it'll go well? It's her first time studying in eighteen years.

720
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,970
You be quiet.

721
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:25,020
Deok Seon and I decided to just not do math.

722
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:30,070
Eat with the spoon. Really...

723
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:32,780
Still, English is worth trying.

724
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,020
Me too. I'm good at idiomatic expressions.

725
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:36,860
Cannot help, -ing.

726
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:41,850
I can't not not do something. I can't help laughing. I cannot not laugh.

727
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:45,200
You don't know these things, right?

728
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:52,820
Hey, even if Taek starts studying from today, he would be way better than you both.

729
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,910
Hey, Taek, tell me again how to do it.

730
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:57,370
Kids! Come for a moment!

731
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,940
Move some luggage for me!

732
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,640
- Yes! Hey, Jeong Hwan, clean this up for us. 
 - Okay.

733
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,240
Hey, hey!

734
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:14,340
- Hey, hey, hey! Cramp, cramp, cramp! 
 - Are you alright?

735
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,950
Are you alright? What should I do?

736
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,380
I got a cramp in my leg!

737
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,580
I understand.

738
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:24,370
Ow! Don't touch it!

739
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,380
Do something.

740
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:30,160
Meow. 
("Cramps", gee in Korean, sounds like "mouse," so she is making the sound of a cat.]

741
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,110
Meow.

742
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,130
W-What are you doing?

743
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:41,350
Isn't this right?

744
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,900
Meow.

745
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,990
Hey, don't meow.

746
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:47,160
Okay.

747
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,620
Don't touch it.

748
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:51,530
Then what should I do? Then meow.

749
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:53,090
I said don't do it.

750
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,970
- Should I stop? Meow. 
 - Don't do it. I have a cramp.

751
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:58,770
- Let go. Let me see.
 - Let go.

752
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:01,200
- I got a cramp. 
 - Meow, meow.

753
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,710
Don't do meow!

754
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,750
♬  Sometime it wasn't a big deal.  ♬

755
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,810
Ah, so let me see. Look.

756
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:07,900
Gently. Gently.

757
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:11,510
♬   I think about when I was annoyed and irritated.  ♬

758
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:16,450
♬  The years I had in  our neighborhood, the first time it rained.  ♬

759
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:18,640
I'm leaving!

760
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,920
Right. My lunch box.

761
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,960
♬  Not quite twenty I went overboard  ♬

762
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,550
♬  Covering for all of my mistakes  ♬

763
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:38,450
♬  The years I had in  our neighborhood, the first time it rained.  ♬

764
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:45,760
♬  I  was covered the whole distance we walked.♬    

765
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,320
♬  Oh I must trust the people who trusted me, the people , the people, the people who did♬    

766
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,820
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

767
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,010
Were you waiting for me?

768
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:56,950
No. Seon Woo.

769
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:58,650
Ah. Seon Woo.

770
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:05,350
♫  And for me the unforgettable  ♫  

771
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:09,990
♫   time I first met the girl  ♫  

772
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:17,700
♫  Together we might not have said anything  ♫  

773
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:22,250
♫  Throughout  the day where we wandered  ♫

774
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,980
Ahjumma, what about Seon Woo?

775
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:30,120
Seon Woo? He already left for school!

776
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:32,850
Aish!

777
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:09,650
- Ah, Ahjussi!
 - Really!

778
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,890
Ahjussi!

779
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:19,660
Ahjussi!

780
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:35,770
 I will be leaving for about two days. 

781
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:39,190
 If you want to live, listen to carefully to what I say. 

782
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,260
 Don't worry. 

783
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,400
 Won't I get caught? 

784
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,560
 I will be using this for a moment and return it! 

785
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,820
 And this! 

786
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:56,360
 She said that she just got off at the terminal. 

787
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,110
 Terminal? It's an emergency! 

788
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:03,040
 Change your clothes and wash up.  Don't eat. 

789
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:12,380
 Have you gone crazy and determined to ruined your life? 

790
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:15,030
 Should I fall at your feet and foam at the mouth?  Get your head on straight! 

791
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:16,630
 What should we do if my sister becomes a criminal? 

792
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:20,130
 Bo Ra is the problem. I'm scared of her. 

793
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:23,420
 Hey, hey, hey. 

794
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:26,020
 Don't you take care of your kids? 

795
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,540
 Seon Woo, have you seen our Bo Ra? 

796
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,860
 Please stop coming here! 

797
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,300
 Bo Ra!
