00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,290
 If there is anything to iron, hurry up and bring it! 

4
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,860
Soong goori dang dang, soong dang dang.

5
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,720
Soogu soogu dang dang, soong dang dang.

6
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,790
Soong goori dang dang, soong dang dang.

7
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,130
Soogu soogu dang dang, soong dang dang.

8
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,430
Oh, I got it now. Soong goori dang dang, soong dang dang.

9
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,250
Soogu soogu dang, dang soong dang...

10
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,210
Please...

11
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,280
What? What, what, what?

12
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,070
If it's break today, you should exercise or go to the public bath. Don't just watch television!

13
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,230
Why are you like this to only me?

14
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,620
I understand. I won't do it.

15
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,940
Mi Ran, Mi Ran!

16
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,270
Are you going to throw that away?

17
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,030
You shouldn't throw it away. You could you use it for ten more years.

18
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,700
- Hey, is it Dad or Mom? Choose.
- What?

19
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,660
Mom and Dad are going to divorce because of the iron. Who are you going to follow?

20
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,490
Dad.

21
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,340
I'm going to follow Mother.

22
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,890
I will follow you, Mother.

23
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,550
Yes!

24
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,440
Dad, I'll deliver it.

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,980
Do you want to?

26
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,390
I will go to Seon Woo's house. So you'll have to go to Jeong Hwan and Soo Yeon's house.

27
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,690
- Yes.
- And also Do Ryong Nyong's house.

28
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,860
There's no need.

29
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,270
I came here myself because it might be hard for Master Choi.

30
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,910
How did you know and come here?

31
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,730
Taek, God is fair.

32
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,480
He gave you the talent of playing baduk, but to me

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,910
he gave the superpower to be able to hear the difference between

34
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,990
Jeong Hwan Dad's car, Noona Bo Ra's car, and the car the academy drops you off in.

35
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,190
While I was studying in my room, I heard your car from far away

36
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,470
and heard a

37
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,130
crunching noise,

38
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,910
and thought that you got an expensive fruit basket,

39
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,750
and that fruit basket would be delivered to my house soon.

40
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,570
Your dad is waiting. Hurry up and go.

41
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,670
He's at school working the night shift tonight, so he's not home.

42
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,060
Anyway, I'll eat well.

43
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,850
Taek, you know that it's Jeong Hwan's birthday this week, right?

44
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,690
Happy Birthday to you.

45
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,790
Go. Go!

46
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,080
What do I have to take?

47
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,460
Give a bag each.

48
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,010
What about this banana?

49
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,690
Oh. I'm going to give it to Jin Joo.

50
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,660
Jin Joo likes bananas.

51
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,590
Ah...

52
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,900
Can you give me one of these?

53
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,770
Why can't you? You brought it.

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,440
Ahjumma!

55
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,760
Aigoo, President Choi!

56
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,080
Hello.

57
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,920
Hey, you have to say, "Aigoo President Kim!"

58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,530
How? I can't do it.

59
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,090
Here. Put your arm right next to your ear.

60
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,840
"Aigoo!"

61
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,590
Taek, are you here?

62
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,170
What is this?

63
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,600
Fruits. Dad told me to bring them.

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,910
Aigoo. Tell him we'll eat it well. There's oranges, right?

65
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,900
Yes. I saw it.

66
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,570
Jeong Hwan, Taek is here!

67
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,720
Taek, eat before you go.

68
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,810
- Oh. You're here?
 - Yeah.

69
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,580
It's okay. I have to go to Deok Seon's house.

70
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,730
I'll leave. Good bye.

71
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,050
See you on your birthday.

72
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,230
- Do you have time?
 - Yeah. I do have time.

73
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,700
A friend is good.

74
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,570
He probably has no time to sleep but he takes care of your birthdays.

75
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,830
Is it that good?

76
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,710
Deok Seon.

77
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,080
Deok Seon.

78
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,730
It's Soo Yeon, you fool!

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,140
Soo Yeon, give me a minute.

80
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,940
You could have just come in before. It's cold so come in quickly.

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,050
Oh, yay yay!

82
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,670
Banana! Oh my god!

83
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,210
Oh my god.

84
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,380
Oh... Your pronunciation got better.

85
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,460
Hey, you're barefooted?

86
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,060
Aigoo. Human...

87
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,090
Did everyone go somewhere?

88
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,880
Mom went to the market. Dad and No Eul went to meet friends.

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,190
Seong Bo Ra has been gone to the library since early morning.

90
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,390
Hey, Seong Bo Ra must be possessed by a ghost who died wanting to study. She's studying so hard.

91
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,870
Noona Bo Ra was probably you in her previous life.

92
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,860
Do you want to die? Only learn good things. Only good things.

93
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,970
Do you want to have some?

94
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,530
No. You eat it.

95
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,520
- You didn't sleep yesterday either, right?
 - Is it obvious?

96
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,130
It's totally obvious. You didn't take sleeping pills?

97
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,130
I didn't them because you told me not to.

98
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,480
Good job. What about pain killers?

99
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,240
- Only one pill.
 - You did well, Hee Dong.

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,590
Hyung Taek.

101
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,130
What's up? You don't have a competition today?

102
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,250
Hyung, can you give me ten autographs?

103
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,410
My teacher asked me too.

104
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,030
Okay.

105
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,140
Hey. First grade or second grade teacher?

106
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,360
Oh. What's with the banana?

107
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,660
Hyung, you brought it right?

108
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,480
I'll eat it well.

109
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,640
Of course it's the freshman teacher.

110
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,620
I don't know my junior year teacher yet. I'll know when I start school tomorrow.

111
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,300
But what about Big Noona? To the library?

112
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,750
I don't know. She went to part-time work but I don't know why she's working so hard.

113
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,960
It's really tough.

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,070
You're psoriasis! Put on some lotion.

115
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,140
How can you grow old faster than Dad?

116
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,220
It's okay. Usually this kind of face looks young later.

117
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:11,360
♫  Your face like a purple glow  ♫

118
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,580
♫   Slowly came toward me  ♫  

119
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,760
You're being too much.

120
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,930
Noona, today's a red day (holiday). Rest on these kinds of days.

121
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,780
No.

122
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,530
I start work next week.

123
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,270
I don't want to be confused there.

124
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,350
Aigoo.

125
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,600
What are you doing?

126
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,120
♬ We  made beautiful stories  ♬

127
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,200
Let's go.

128
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,440
♬   in which we were always smiling.♬ 

129
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,510
Hey, how can you hand be so warm?

130
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,860
What did you do to your hand?

131
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,430
What do you mean what did I do? It's usually warm.

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,010
Noona, see you tonight at the outdoor food shop.

133
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,900
I need to study.

134
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,330
Noona.

135
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,020
Okay. I'll go.

136
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,350
♬   My constricted heart hurt more. ♬

137
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,470
♫   In the midst of the many people we encounter walking on the street  ♫

138
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,370
Jin Joo, eat slowly. No one is going to take it away.

139
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,190
What about Seon Woo? Did he go to the library?

140
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,660
He went out for a moment to meet someone.

141
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,740
Right, Oppa. If the kids start school tomorrow, you'll have to babysit Jin Joo again.

142
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,310
I decided to clean the public bath again.

143
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,160
You don't have to worry about Jin Joo.

144
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,720
Seon Young.

145
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,600
Seon Woo knows.

146
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,870
What?

147
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,770
Seon Woo knows that you work.

148
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,470
How did he know? How did he know?

149
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,090
Well, he just found out somehow.

150
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,710
Don't worry. Seon Woo has a deep heart.

151
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,380
Mom.

152
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,870
- Ahjussi, did you come? 
 - Yes, I did.

153
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,890
Seon Woo did you come?

154
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,970
Eat some fruit. Ahjussi brought some.

155
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,570
Oh... Banana.

156
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,320
Jin Joo, eat a lot.

157
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,780
Okay.

158
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,090
Taek arrived, Ahjussi?

159
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,110
Yeah. He came last night.

160
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,280
He usually doesn't bring presents

161
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,860
but he constantly brings fruits.

162
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,480
Jin Joo, it's delicious, right?

163
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,300
Aigoo, Jin Joo is excited.

164
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,220
 Episdoe 14: Don't Worry 

165
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,420
 That's not right. 

166
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,990
 Why? 

167
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,780
 You have to stick the wings on with liquid glue. 

168
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,410
 Here. 

169
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,500
 Really? Isn't it the same thing? 

170
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,760
 If the rice dries, it'll fall off quickly. It becomes firm if you stick it with liquid glue. 

171
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,060
 Don't forget it tie it well with rubber. Okay? 

172
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,790
 Yes. This defeats everything. 

173
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,350
Seon Woo, let's eat dinner! Come out!

174
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,390
Okay!

175
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,300
Soo Yeon, place the spoons.

176
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,420
Okay!

177
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,020
Mom, what about Dad?

178
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,850
It's time he should be coming. Who is he meeting that he still doesn't come?

179
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,130
Mom. Dad probably isn't lending money to his friends, right?

180
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,590
Hey. What money do we have to lend them? Don't worry.

181
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,560
Stop talking nonsense and just eat.

182
00:12:52,420 --> 00:13:00,060
♫   This short moment in my life   ♫

183
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,270
Bad bastard.

184
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:08,400
♫   We miss each other so much   ♫

185
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,510
♫   When I look back   ♫

186
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,620
Really? Is they're really my shoes?

187
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,970
Didn't I say that I'd buy you new shoes if you become a senior?

188
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,160
Mom, then I can throw away those Artis?

189
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,990
Of course. Didn't you wear them for a long time?

190
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,360
I'll just burn them.

191
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,530
Nice!

192
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,120
Are you that happy even though they're not Nike or Adidas?

193
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,910
What's with Tiger? Everyone  in my class except Man Ok wears these.

194
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,230
Mom. What about me?

195
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,370
My sneakers are almost all worn out.

196
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,490
I'll buy you some when you become a senior next year.

197
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,840
Oh my!

198
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,750
 Don't show a sad expression. 

199
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,920
Mom, buy me a pair of sneakers too!

200
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,370
The soles are all torn up. When it rains, the water seeps in.

201
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,780
Hey! She said that she'll buy you some next year.

202
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,310
I'll buy you some if you get into 100th place in school.

203
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,110
100th place in school?

204
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,670
Forget it. If you don't want to buy it, just say it.

205
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,100
Stop saying nonsense.

206
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,710
No Eul, don't be sad. I have Tiger!

207
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,970
I'm so excited!

208
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,260
Mom, but why isn't Dad coming? He didn't even eat dinner.

209
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,270
Aigoo. Wife!

210
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,480
Why are you coming out here when it's cold?

211
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,420
Oh my... You were waiting for your husband.

212
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,190
What time is it right now? What did you do that you're coming now?

213
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,750
Were you meeting the friend all this time?

214
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,130
Aigoo, this person... We already left.

215
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,450
Did you buy meat?

216
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,070
I can't live. I really can't live.

217
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,020
What money do we have to buy meat? We used up all our living expenses this month.

218
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,650
This meat...

219
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,240
Hong Shik bought it for me.

220
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,020
Hong Sh—

221
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,610
Hong Shik! Did you meet him?

222
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,400
Was it that friend you said you were going to meet?

223
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,480
Aigoo. I guess he was alive.

224
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,020
With what conscience does he show up after making a family like this?

225
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,730
Where is he? I'll catch him right now and bring him to the police station.

226
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,920
Where is he? Let's go! Let's go!

227
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,940
This person ... It's all over.

228
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,920
It's over.

229
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,700
Hong Shik repaid all his debt.

230
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,550
He said that he repaid all his debt to the bank.

231
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,760
He said that he doesn't have the courage to talk to you

232
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,060
and told me he committed a sin worthy of death.

233
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,890
Now... If he can't repay his debt to us in this life...

234
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:57,110
He'll repay all our family's debt even if he dies.

235
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,690
You've worked hard up till now.

236
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,160
You've been through a lot.

237
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,230
Now although we can't live proudly in front of others,

238
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,990
since this husband receives a regular monthly income,

239
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:27,800
now, my wife doesn't have to go here and there

240
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,090
and borrow 10,000 won and pay back 10,000...

241
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:39,590
From now on, you'll never have to say pitiful things to other in order to live.

242
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,380
You suffered a lot all this time.

243
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,120
I'm sorry.

244
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,780
I didn't suffer. My babies did.

245
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:04,350
♫  Tell them that you loved them without regrets  ♫

246
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:11,930
  ♫ Leaving the past as the past  ♫  

247
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,240
♫  There is such meaning  ♫  

248
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:52,100
Seon Woo, I was originally going to do it till this month and quit.

249
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,370
I did it because I was bored staying home.

250
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,170
I didn't do it because of money.

251
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,650
Jin Joo grew up and it was frustrating to only stay at home.

252
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,670
I'm not going to go anymore so don't worry.

253
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,790
It's okay, Mom.

254
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,080
I'm fine, Mom.

255
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,830
You can continue to work.

256
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,570
Instead, if it's hard,

257
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,460
if your arm hurts, quit immediately. Understand?

258
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,960
 Language Arts 

259
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,810
 Seong Deok Seon 

260
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,900
- Oh... 
 - It's finished.

261
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,220
Hey, hey. Don't touch it yet. It'll smudge.

262
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,730
They need me for the first time in a long time.

263
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,370
Oh... Dad, you're the best.

264
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,590
Dad, write mine too.

265
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:16,070
Okay, okay! Hurry up and bring your book too. I'll draw it nicely with Chinese brush.

266
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,030
Good going, putting covers on your textbooks the day before the school starts.

267
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,780
Mind your business.

268
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,840
The table is coming in. Clean up.

269
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,040
Okay!

270
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,030
Let's eat. Let's eat this and die.

271
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,970
Mom, what's wrong?

272
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,150
Are we bankrupt? Are we completely bankrupted now?

273
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,260
Are we perhaps going to eat all this and escape in the night?

274
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,430
You stupid idiot. Escape in the night?

275
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,560
Wife, are you that happy?

276
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,100
I'm happy.

277
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,050
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

278
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,050
What? Really?

279
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,880
Yeah. Really.

280
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,660
Dad's income is going to come out regularly from now on.

281
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,540
Did you pay back everything? No more garnishment of wages?

282
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,290
Of course. It's over now.

283
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,840
It's all over. Then are we becoming rich now?

284
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,550
It's not that.

285
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,710
We're just living like other people.

286
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,280
Then, Dad, please buy me sneakers.

287
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,310
Dad, money. Allowance. I have to buy Jeong Pal's birthday present.

288
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,770
Okay.

289
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,390
For our No Eul.

290
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,840
Here. With this, buy sneakers.

291
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,470
I can really buy Nikes?

292
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,480
Whether you buy Nikes or a rickshaw, buy whatever you want.

293
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,160
Nice! Nike! Nike!

294
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,990
Dad, me too. Give me allowance too.

295
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,840
Give me too.

296
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,540
Okay. Deok— No. Our Soo Yeon's allowance.

297
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,690
Nice!

298
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,490
Dad, I love you! I love you, Dad!

299
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,210
What is this?

300
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,130
What about you? Do you want anything?

301
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,830
I'm fine.

302
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,290
Oh... Seong Bo Ra has become mature.

303
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:29,200
Since she's the first child she became mature and has a deep heart.

304
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,640
Anyway, Bo Ra. For you

305
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,550
I have something I've thought of for you.

306
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,190
What are they saying? Can you not hear them?

307
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,640
I can't hear anything.

308
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,240
By chance, are they giving 100,000 won to Seong Bo Ra?

309
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,910
I won't stay still if that's the case.

310
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,030
Ah, be quiet, Noona!

311
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,760
But isn't your school starting to require uniforms this year?

312
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,610
Only freshmen. What can you do with it after one year? What a waste of money.

313
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,790
What are they saying? Can you still not hear anything?

314
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:21,580
Yeah, I can't hear anything. But it seems really serious.

315
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,380
Hello everybody!

316
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,220
Hey! Hey. Come here quickly.

317
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,220
What is this? Why is up with the atmosphere?

318
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,350
We're juniors.

319
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,410
- Are Big Ji Young and Small Ji Young both in our class? 
 - Yeah.

320
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,660
Fat Mi Young and Skinny Mi Young are also in our class.

321
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,250
Since when has Namgoong Never been sleeping?

322
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,170
I don't know. She was sleeping when I arrived, too.

323
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,160
The rumors were right that she sleeps a lot.

324
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,110
That's why she's Namgoong Never.

325
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,250
Is the class president here?

326
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,360
Yeah. She came way earlier.

327
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,460
Crazy, she's been studying math from early this morning. She went to wash her face.

328
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,640
So annoying.

329
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,150
You're going to be really tired from now on.

330
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,690
Why do we sit like this? Can't we sit where we like?

331
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,250
I want to see Man Ok.

332
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,470
She said she's coming later to eat lunch.

333
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,660
The boys in my neighborhood said they all ended up being in the same class, though.

334
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,510
Hey, but there are rumors that the homeroom teacher is still the same—

335
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,630
- Wow! 
 - Good Morning!
 - Woo!!!!

336
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:37,220
  So pretty!  

337
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:56,060
Stop shaking your legs. Why is he like this in the morning?

338
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,190
Hey, Jeong Pal. Do you have any mechanical pencils?

339
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,730
I don't.

340
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,230
Hey, Do Ryong Nyong. Do you have any mechanical pencils?

341
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,650
No, I don't grow things like that.

342
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,470
Hey. Did you hear who our homeroom teacher is?

343
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,810
He should be coming. Who is it?

344
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,310
This can't be true. This really isn't it.

345
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,980
Why, who is it?

346
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,860
Hey, no way. Ah, seriously.

347
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,010
It can't be... this guy's father?

348
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,760
Good morning, my boys. You're all dead now.

349
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,940
What are you going to do now?

350
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,920
Hey, are you okay?

351
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,740
What the? Who? Who fainted?

352
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,870
Teacher, it's Dong Ryong.

353
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,570
Ah, is it?

354
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,270
Then just leave it. He's putting on a show, a show.

355
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,160
Cover him with his clothes.

356
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,770
The floor is cold. Tell him to stay still. That boy.

357
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:22,370
Here. I'll introduce myself. My name is Ryoo Jae Myeong.

358
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,100
We know.

359
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,150
I'll be the homeroom teacher for class 3-13.

360
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,380
Take care of me well!

361
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,120
Ah...

362
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,640
You boys. You just love it, huh?

363
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,990
Stop it.

364
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,430
You know we start the evening study session right away tonight, right? Not one of you should run away from it.

365
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,280
If you get caught, you'll die immediately, got it?

366
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,720
- Yes. 
 - Do you understand?

367
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,440
Yes!

368
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,840
End of morning meeting. Temporary class head will be Seon Woo.

369
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,460
Attention.

370
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,120
- Salute. 
- Thank you!

371
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,050
What is he going to do?

372
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,340
Are you crying?

373
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,690
He's crying.

374
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,190
Hey, shouldn't we wake up Namgoong Never?

375
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,770
Hey, wake up and eat.

376
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,360
Namgoong Never, eat. It's lunchtime.

377
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,650
I'm going to sleep. Don't wake me. I already ate.

378
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,980
Fine, sleep. Sleep.

379
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,890
Let's eat together.

380
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,200
Okay.

381
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,330
Wow. You live well, don't you?

382
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,340
I'm eating one.

383
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,260
You know, later, teach me some math during the evening study session.

384
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,650
- Got it? 
 - If I have the time.

385
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,130
Hey!

386
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,230
Alright.

387
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,320
You have an older sister. You have an older sister who goes to Seoul National University. Why are you worried?

388
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,090
Learn from Seong Bo Ra? I'd rather flunk three, even ten times.

389
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,850
And lately that human is busy. Once she starts, she studies like crazy.

390
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,900
She's so annoying.

391
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,850
Hey.

392
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,370
Hey, does that go in after eating lunch?

393
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,060
Whats wrong with this girl? Did you hurt your head?

394
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,550
Since when didn't you eat?

395
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,710
Hey, you go crazy over fried bread. Jo Hyeon bought them for you.

396
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,510
I'm doing a diet.

397
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,310
- Why? 
 - Are you crazy?

398
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,090
I have a date this Saturday.

399
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,120
Really? What the?

400
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,360
Wow! Cool! You succeeded!

401
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,940
You decided to date Kim Jeong Bong?

402
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,930
Yeah, I got a letter to see him on Saturday.

403
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,570
No way! Really? Where?

404
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,840
Seven pm, at the Jongro Banjul.

405
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,260
- No way! 
- Wow!

406
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,610
Hey, would you two use knives (eat steak) together?

407
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,960
Hey, Seong Soo Yeon. Pretend like you don't know, okay?

408
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,100
Don't pretend to know that person. It's embarrassing.

409
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,380
How do I pretend to not know him? We live in one house together.

410
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,370
Still, pretend not to know. What happens if it doesn't work out?

411
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,680
Alright, I'll try.

412
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,170
Man Ok. Phew!

413
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,550
Hey, where are you going at this time?

414
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,410
To my room.

415
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,110
Aigoo! President Seong!

416
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,680
Aigoo! President Kim!

417
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,720
It's really nice seeing you!

418
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,680
It's really nice to see you! It's really nice seeing you!

419
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,560
Our Soo Hyeon, did you come to see me?

420
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,540
No. I didn't come to see you. I came to see Oppa Jeong Bong.

421
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,660
Why Hyung? Did something come up?

422
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,020
What? Date? With your friend?

423
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,510
Drives me crazy, crazy.

424
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,160
Who's your friend. Are you talking about those uglies?

425
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,210
They're better than your friends.

426
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,390
Ah, my brother needs to go to college.

427
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:46,210
My friend needs to go to college too.

428
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:51,290
Ah, right. So tomorrow we're going to celebrate your birthday in Taek's room, right?

429
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,720
Tomorrow's my birthday?

430
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,300
Do you not even know your own birthday?

431
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,080
It's fine. What's the point of celebrating birthdays?

432
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,760
Taek said that he has a tournament tomorrow too. It's fine, we'll do it later.

433
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,890
I don't want to. I'm going to do it.

434
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,560
Ahjumma said she would order sweet and sour pork for us.

435
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,650
- So where is Hyung's date? 
- Jongro Banjul.

436
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,930
The coffee shop?

437
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,550
Wasn't it a restaurant?

438
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,340
It's a cafe, on the first floor.

439
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,150
What are you saying? It's a restaurant from the first to fourth floor.

440
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,220
It's so pretty.

441
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,270
Aigoo, do you like it that much?

442
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:14,110
After getting a call from Bo Ra's dad, I brought you the best one I had in my store.

443
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,270
I cut the price in half too.

444
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,940
Turn it on.

445
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,200
Gosh, I'm going to throw away that stove.

446
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,240
What? Give it to me if you're going to trash it.

447
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,140
You surprised me.

448
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,850
You can die.

449
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,730
Yes, Oppa! 150,000 won was spent!

450
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,610
She paid 150,000 won for it, seriously!

451
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:02,360
Those scammers! They pulled such a scam on an old country grandma.

452
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,700
I feel a little better if I think of it that way.

453
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,360
You're right.

454
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,670
I'll think of it that way.

455
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,340
Okay. I won't make a fuss to Mom.

456
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,830
Okay. Good night.

457
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,910
Oh my, how did it get this late already?

458
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,230
Jin Joo, let's go wash up and get ready to sleep.

459
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,280
They must have met, right?

460
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,820
That's right. Look at the time.

461
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,280
If she didn't meet him, she would have called me by now.

462
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,220
I'm nervous...

463
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:40,150
♫   Like this, we have to break up.     ♫

464
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:46,690
♫   We weren't able to talk to each other.   ♫

465
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:54,090
♫   Our last cup of tea, we become each other's scent   ♫

466
00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:02,640
♫   We want to leave an unforgettable memory   ♫

467
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:10,330
♫   Let's not shed tears.    ♫

468
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:16,710
♫   Even though we said the same thing.    ♫

469
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:24,270
♫   I'm not going to regret it. But your appearance then,   ♫

470
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:31,060
♫   made my heart hurt.   ♫

471
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:40,120
♫   You couldn't tell me in so many words   ♫

472
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:47,120
♫   The last words you wrote with the water on the table   ♫

473
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:56,470
♫   So sad, only the tears flow...   ♫

474
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:05,860
♫   My dear, goodbye now...   ♫

475
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,110
Ten minutes will be enough. Let's meet each other at the snack cart.

476
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,760
It's because I have something to give you.

477
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,010
Alright. But what? What is it?

478
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:21,790
You'll know when you meet me. It's what I treasure the most in the world.

479
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,500
What is it? Alright.

480
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,130
I'm going out now.

481
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,010
Hey, what would we have done without a phone?

482
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,970
That's true. I wonder how they all met for dates without phones.

483
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,360
 They must have written letters. 

484
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,600
 Everyone still met and dated well. 

485
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,180
Still, it must have been really inconvenient.

486
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,470
Noona. I'll go out now too.

487
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,260
 Do I really give it to her? I can really give it to her, right? 

488
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,460
 Of course. So many years have passed since then. 

489
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,570
 It's fine. 

490
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,120
 You like Bo Ra that much? 

491
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,270
Jeong Pal! Oppa still hasn't come, right?

492
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,030
They must have met, seeing how he hasn't come home yet.

493
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,950
Have you tried calling your friend?

494
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,700
Her dad is really scary. We've never called her house before.

495
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,150
Still, she said she would call me after the date ended.

496
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,420
Go in. It's cold.

497
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,720
I'll call you when Hyung gets home.

498
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,750
Alright. See you tomorrow, Jeong Pal.

499
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,290
Okay.

500
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,220
It's for me. It's for me.

501
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,930
Here.

502
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,080
Here.

503
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,820
Hello? Is it Mi Ok?

504
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,360
Oppa, what are you saying?

505
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,740
You still haven't met her? Do you know how late it is?

506
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,160
Hello. I'm sorry for calling you so late at night.

507
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,060
I'm Mi Ok's friend, Seong Soo Hyun.

508
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,240
I'm calling because of an urgent matter. Could you please put Mi Ok on the phone?

509
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,350
Hey! Why are you at home?

510
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,690
Deok Seon, I got stood up.

511
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,970
Stood up? He's still there waiting for you!

512
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,270
-  What?  
 - He said he's still waiting for you at Banjul!

513
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,820
What have you two been doing?

514
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,960
 What to do? What to do, Deok Seon? What do I do? 

515
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,120
What do you mean, what to do? Go quickly.

516
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,460
Are you crazy? Go fast.

517
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,110
Ahjussi, Banjul in Jongro please.

518
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,560
Banjul? The store would be closed by now.

519
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,260
I know, please go quickly.

520
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:51,430
Is it not? Is the first floor cafe still open?

521
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:55,080
The second floor restaurant would have been closed by now.

522
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,510
  Hey. Oppa isn't feeling well either. I'm going to go crazy.  

523
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,020
 Because he was going to meet you, he wore a coat and even bought roses.  

524
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,590
  I thought it would spoil your fun if I told you in advance, so I didn't tell you.  

525
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,780
  Ah really, you fools.  

526
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,400
  Go quickly. He can't get a cold. He has to watch his body.  

527
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,670
  Ah, really.  

528
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,500
  Banjul 

529
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,530
How long have you been here?

530
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,770
It hasn't been that long.

531
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,550
I also just got here.

532
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,780
Uh...

533
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,070
Here.

534
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,580
Y-You must be cold.

535
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,220
Would you like to go s-somewhere and at least get some soup...

536
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:52,200
 The late winter of 1989. If my crazily beating heart right now is 

537
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,870
  because of my disease, or because of her, 

538
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:01,990
  I wanted to make sure. 

539
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,850
Confirmation.

540
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,340
They did it because they don't want to make you worry. You're being sad about nothing.

541
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,490
But before, she told me everything.

542
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,010
Now it seems like she tells everything to Ahjussi.

543
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,320
Even today regarding my grandmother...

544
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,650
In the past, we would have cursed out that swindler all night.

545
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,950
Why don't you like Ahjussi?

546
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:06,900
Me? I do like Ahjussi.

547
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,450
It's true! I do like him.

548
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:17,640
It's just, my mood isn't so happy. I do like Ahjussi.

549
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,140
Ah, but didn't you say you were going to give something to me?

550
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,730
Ah, let's go Noona. What if someone comes in again?

551
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:34,360
Just give it to me here. What is it?

552
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,930
Ah, I can't. What if Ahjussi comes in again?

553
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,240
Hurry up. Hurry.

554
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,830
Hurry, let's go.

555
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:53,470
Hey. I don't wear necklaces. You know it, too.

556
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,920
You don't have to wear it. Just keep it. I'm giving it to you.

557
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,290
This is what your late father gave you though.

558
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,550
  SW ♥ PURPLE   ("Bo Ra" = Purple in Koren) 

559
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:17,220
It's just a necklace, a necklace. Don't be overwhelmed.

560
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,110
How is this 'just' a necklace?

561
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:24,640
Ah, I'm really overwhelmed though.

562
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,060
Noona, the hyungs are telling you to come quickly, that the birthday party is starting.

563
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,220
No Eul, when does Noona look the worst?

564
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,000
Be honest. Then I'll just leave that and wear everything else.

565
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,580
You look the worst when you try too hard to look good.

566
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,070
You told me to be honest.

567
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,320
I'm such an idiot for asking you.

568
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,740
What about Jeong Hwan's present? Didn't you buy him something?

569
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,740
I already gave it to him, already!

570
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,400
- Younger brother. 
 - Yeah.

571
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,870
Happy Birthday.

572
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,380
Thanks, Hyung.

573
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,890
But what is this shirt? Did you buy clothes?

574
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,580
Yeah.

575
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:35,180
It's pink. That's Hyung's favorite color.

576
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,150
I'm leaving. I'm was going to meet the others in Taek's room.

577
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,710
Happy Birthday again, younger brother!

578
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,260
Alright, thank you!

579
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:54,160
Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you!

580
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,780
To our dear Jung Hwan, Happy Birthday to you!

581
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,770
- Happy Birthday to you! 
 - Whoo! 
 - Whee!

582
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,480
It's my birthday present. You should have at least wrapped it or something.

583
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,530
How do you wrap that? We went through a lot trying to buy that, too.

584
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,700
Right, we worried so much.

585
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,160
We saved up money little by little, even though we're broke, to give it to you.

586
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,420
We each bought ate our own odeng (fishcake), and bought it with Taek's money.

587
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,670
Thanks.

588
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,500
No, these guys chipped in, too.

589
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,370
Wow... I'm so touched by you, Master Choi.

590
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:32,880
You're such a perfect human being and so bad at using chopsticks. Who is defeated by you, huh?

591
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,530
Hey, that's enough.

592
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:39,750
Turn on Top Gun. I want to watch Oppa Cruise.

593
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:44,130
Jung Pal and I saw this twice already.

594
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,920
- Let's watch something else! 
 - I didn't watch it though.

595
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,030
- Me either. 
 - Me either.

596
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,820
Jung Pal, can we not see this?

597
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,020
We can. Let's watch it.

598
00:51:55,310 --> 00:52:00,470
Deok Seon, if it weren't for you then we wouldn't be watching something so pure in the middle of the night.

599
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:03,990
Why? Let's see it together. Why can't we? I'm okay.

600
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,380
We're not okay.

601
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:11,910
Hey, Choi Hee Dong. You like those things, too?

602
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,350
No. I don't like them.

603
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:18,520
Seriously...

604
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:22,620
Hey! It's you! You taught him that, right? Geez, you moron!

605
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,520
Of all things, you teach him that?

606
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,000
Hey, what did I teach him? What?

607
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,920
Hello, what do you know about Taek?

608
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,320
What? What do I not know? What is it that I don't know about him, huh?

609
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,980
You tainted an innocent guy...

610
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,240
Taek, I'm—

611
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:51,150
Taek. I'm trying to write down the hotel you're going to tomorrow. Give me the business card.

612
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,800
Okay.

613
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,460
Here you go, Dad.

614
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,010
I have to leave now, right?

615
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,910
Yeah, you're late.

616
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,940
You're going to leave at this time?

617
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,850
Taek has a match at 9 a.m. in Busan tomorrow.

618
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,260
Hey, then you should have gone during the day.

619
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,270
It's fine. I can sleep while I go there.

620
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,590
- I'm washing up. 
 - Yeah.

621
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:18,580
  SW ♥ PURPLE 

622
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:32,670
  I'm sorry I get to say this to you now, Bo Ra.  

623
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,040
  Anyway, it's not too late even now. 

624
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,720
  Your mom and I can support you.  

625
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,910
  The study you want to pursue... Prepare for the bar.  

626
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:59,350
Being a parent, and not being able to back up their child's dreams,

627
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:02,430
I'm very sorry.

628
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:10,430
  Your mom and I... When we think about that, we're too ashamed to look at you.  

629
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,040
So, don't worry,

630
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:22,970
  I paid off our debt. So, be at peace and study for the bar. 

631
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:27,610
Even if it takes a few years, I'm going to back you up.

632
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:34,640
Okay? 
♫   My dear, be my strength   ♫

633
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,260
♫   For me...   ♫

634
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:41,720
I'll... think about it.

635
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,440
Of course. Of course.

636
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,000
Sure, think about it slowly.

637
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,170
♫   My path that has been split in two   ♫

638
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:05,100
Ah, really. We should move to a house with a bathroom inside. It's so cold. I can't do this anymore.

639
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:11,030
Anyway, did Bo Ra say anything?

640
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,940
She needs time to think too.

641
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,440
She said she would start her part-time job tomorrow. I don't think she's canceled it.

642
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,190
It's not her time to work a part-time job.

643
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,510
I'm so upset she wasted her smart brain all this time.

644
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:27,580
What's there to contemplate for so long? She'll only come up with the wrong answer at the end.

645
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:31,350
Honey, be quiet. It's not an easy decision.

646
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:38,690
She had given it all up. But now that we told her to start over, I'm sure she's got her fears.

647
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:45,250
I trust our Bo Ra. She'll make the right decision on her own.

648
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:05,280
Aigoo. You two just shot a movie together.

649
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,990
Both of them are fools.

650
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,570
It was right in front of you. How could you not find it?

651
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,780
So, what did you two do when you met up?

652
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:21,780
Oh my god. Perhaps?

653
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,900
Did you hold hands?

654
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,760
Hey, hey, Oppa Jeong Bong isn't like that. He's totally naive.

655
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,190
It would have been a relief if he looked at Man Ok's face.

656
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:34,780
Right? Kim Jeong Bong's face got red, and he couldn't say anything, right?

657
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,390
Our Soo Yeon doesn't know anything about men, right?

658
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:47,930
No way. Perhaps, did you two hug?

659
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,100
I don't know.

660
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,050
They must've!

661
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:58,510
Soo Yeon. Did you give him the present? It was pretty.

662
00:57:58,510 --> 00:57:59,990
What present?

663
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:05,720
I bought a shirt for Jeong Pal's birthday. It was a light pink shirt. Man Ok chose it for me.

664
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,710
Did he wear it?

665
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:12,000
No. I thought he would wear it for his birthday yesterday, but he didn't wear it.

666
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,290
No way.

667
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:17,790
Hey, he's probably just embarrassed to wear it right away.

668
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:21,570
I must've guessed wrong again this time. Jumping to a conclusion...

669
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,810
Soo Yeon. A lady is looking for you. Over there.

670
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:32,400
Who's that lady?

671
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,940
She says she's the class president's mom.

672
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,570
What?

673
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,930
Let's go.

674
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:58,300
 Ssangmun Girls High School  

675
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,080
  Please be quiet! Sleep less than 4 hours to pass, sleep 5 hours to fail! 

676
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:16,100
Hey! Be quiet!

677
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,450
Aren't you guys going to go to college?

678
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:22,550
Hey. You're louder.

679
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,440
Is it everything if you can study?

680
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,490
We're juniors.

681
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,940
I know.

682
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,260
Hello, Ahjussi.

683
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,280
Oh, you're coming now?

684
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,020
Did Jin Joo play well?

685
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:52,830
Yeah, she plays well with me. We're on a similar level.

686
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,930
Thank you, Ahjussi.

687
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:58,420
No, no. It's cold. Go in quickly. Your mom's waiting.

688
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,310
Yes. Good night.

689
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:24,550
 Wow, I received this from the baseball player Park Cheul Soon when OB won the 1982 series. 

690
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,830
 Do you remember? 

691
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:29,970
 Of course. I got it and gave it to you. 

692
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:35,640
 I still remember how you jumped around because you liked it so much. 

693
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,840
 My friends only like soccer. I like baseball better though. 

694
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:45,270
 It's been a really long time since I've played catch. 

695
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:48,600
 Right. Do Ryong and Jeong Hwan are doing well, right? 

696
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,270
 Yes. They're doing well. 

697
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:54,150
 They are always complaining about this and that. Still the same. 

698
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:59,090
Seon Woo! I made some squash pancakes! Come out!

699
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,220
Okay!

700
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:37,210
Dongseng, have a plate of apples.

701
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,700
Are you planning to not wear that shirt?

702
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:48,340
It's because it's a color that you don't like.

703
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,870
It's a color that I like.

704
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,230
Perhaps, can you give it to me?

705
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,480
Forget it. Our class president's like that too.

706
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,530
Anyway, all class presidents are annoying. Is being good at studying everything?

707
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,710
Hey, I'm going.

708
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:14,040
You're coming over to eat lunch, right?

709
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,340
Yeah.

710
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,430
Oh, my goodness. Do something!

711
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,990
What to do? What to do?

712
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,930
Do something! What to do?

713
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:31,280
Get out of the way!

714
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,450
Go away. Don't look and go away!

715
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,190
Door. Hey, the door!

716
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:10,110
 Infirmary.  

717
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,460
You're awake?

718
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:34,940
Are you okay?

719
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:46,500
I fainted, right?

720
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:54,130
All the kids must have seen.

721
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:58,930
It's okay. They're all kids from your class.

722
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:00,870
It can happen.

723
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:11,830
It's okay. It's okay.

724
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:14,980
I'm telling you it's okay.

725
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,740
Oh.

726
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:39,350
- Class president. It's cold. Close the door. 
 - Yeah.

727
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,050
Hey, why are you coming now? Come quickly.

728
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:55,950
Hey, come quickly and open your lunchbox. Let's eat some sausages.

729
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,500
- Looks good. 
- Wow...

730
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,940
Wow. Wow.

731
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,500
It's way better than mine. That's awesome.

732
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,980
Kimchi.

733
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,810
- Chwinamul. 
- What's under it?

734
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,680
- Tada. 
- What the heck?

735
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,550
I didn't bring my spoon. What do I do?

736
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,020
Oh yeah. Thank you.

737
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:50,740
Hey, it's tastes really good.

738
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,730
I want the bulgogi.

739
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:56,630
Oh, bulgogi.

740
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:59,740
Hey, it's good.

741
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:02,340
- Ooo... 
- Hey!

742
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:05,350
You guys, seriously!

743
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:08,050
Hey, the class president is acting strange.

744
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:11,490
- This doesn't taste good. 
- Hey! The kimchi is too sour!

745
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:16,890
You came early today, my son. I just got home now too.

746
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:19,900
I only stayed until second period of the evening study session. There's some construction going on at school.

747
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,330
Mom, where's Jin Joo?

748
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:24,310
She's at Ahjussi's house. She wouldn't sleep and since she played well, I left her alone.

749
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,930
They're best friends these days.

750
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:28,570
Yeah.

751
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,390
Aren't you hungry?

752
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,800
Yeah.

753
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,020
Mom, I'm going to out for a bit. I'll be back soon.

754
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,290
Okay.

755
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,090
Hello, Ahjussi.

756
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,360
Aigoo, is Jin Joo asleep? Give her to me.

757
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,660
No, it's okay. Open the bedroom door.

758
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:56,330
I'll put her down. Your wrist bothers you.

759
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:23,600
You're here.

760
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:27,850
What are you thinking so hard about that you didn't notice someone arrived?

761
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:30,460
I was thinking of you.

762
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,250
Hey! As if I would be deceived.

763
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:35,690
Don't I know you? As if.

764
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:46,910
Noona, this... Can you give me just one cup?

765
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,140
Ahjussi went to your house?

766
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,370
Did you find it?

767
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,130
What?

768
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:26,040
The reason why you don't like Ahjussi. Did you find it already?

769
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,410
I told you it's not that I don't like him.

770
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:32,600
Fine. Let's just say so.

771
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,310
It's true. I don't dislike him.

772
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,850
We're here. I will go first.

773
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:05,590
- Sleep well. 
- Yeah.

774
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,190
But then... Noona, there's really nothing going on these days, right?

775
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,700
There's nothing.

776
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,090
- Why am I so anxious? 
 - About what?

777
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,400
Just.

778
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,950
What are you going to do if someone sees you?

779
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,460
Noona, hello.

780
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:36,660
Yeah. Why does he go around without making a noise?

781
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,830
You take care of it.

782
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:44,600
Hey! Choi Hee Dong!

783
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,180
Yes.

784
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:49,080
I trust you.

785
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,010
I'm going to sleep in Taek's room.

786
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:07,440
Okay. But did Taek come home just now?

787
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,720
We met on the street.

788
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,820
Ask him if he took a lot of medicine.

789
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:14,140
It's not good if you take a lot of pain killers.

790
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,950
Wait.

791
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:18,770
How many pain killers did you take today?

792
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,770
He didn't take a lot. Hurry and sleep, Mom.

793
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:31,250
Okay. Tell Taek, sleep well.

794
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:42,950
Aigoo. So warm. This punks body is so warm. Why are you so warm?

795
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:44,510
Don't do that.

796
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:48,160
Really, what's with you!

797
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,100
Don't! Seon Woo!

798
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,480
It's warm.

799
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,490
Seon Woo.

800
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,280
Is everything going well with Noona Bo Ra?

801
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:06,410
Yeah. It's nice.

802
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,360
- But then, Taek.
 - Huh?

803
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:14,920
Why is it Deok Seon for you?

804
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:22,810
There are a lot of people who like you, but why is it Deok Seon?

805
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:27,420
What's the reason? Why is it so?

806
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:32,980
I just like her.

807
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:40,050
If I'm with her, I just like it.

808
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,880
If she's not there

809
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,830
I feel like I could die.

810
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:57,580
Hey! You're totally crazy.

811
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:01,140
Get yourself together, Choi Taek!

812
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:04,650
You need to take some medicine. I noticed you don't take much.

813
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:07,420
- Take some!
- Let's take some together.

814
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,330
Why would I?

815
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:15,350
Hey, let's go to Brazil today. Your treat after a while.

816
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:18,190
Hey, I already used up my allowance for this month.

817
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:23,030
And also, I have a date tomorrow.

818
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:26,410
Oooohhh! This girl!

819
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:31,620
Oh right, Seong Soo Yeon. You were really the best today.

820
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,120
That's nothing.

821
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,950
Why? Did something happen?

822
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,520
Nothing. You don't need to know.

823
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,610
What is it?

824
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:40,940
It's a secret.

825
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:52,060
- We'll be going first.
 - Go on.

826
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:02,160
Seong Hee went already.

827
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:08,010
Can I... hug you?

828
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,830
Thank you, Deok Seon.

829
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:27,210
I... am very very grateful.

830
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:32,000
It's nothing. I think I left some out.

831
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,770
No. No, you did great.

832
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:39,580
Thank you. Thank you very much.

833
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:43,120
Thank you.

834
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,110
How could you be so pretty.

835
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:56,410
♫    Days where we had to accept it   ♫

836
01:13:56,410 --> 01:14:00,640
 I'm sorry, student but I ask you this favor.
♫   The more we did that, the more we put love first    ♫ 

837
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,880
 It's not hard. If she collapses, you just need to clear the dangerous things around her. 

838
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,040
 And also, you just need to bring her to the clinic.
♫  It was hard but we were walking together     ♫ 

839
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,220
 Yes. 

840
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:17,900
 She might vomit so you just need to turn her head to the side.
♫  You can’t change that with any other happiness     ♫ 

841
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:22,850
 I ask this of you. I am very sorry.
♫    Even if we can’t solve this complicated world   ♫ 

842
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:30,890
♫  Some day, good days will come again     ♫

843
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:33,800
Yes, Teacher.
♫   Because isn’t that what life is about?    ♫

844
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,960
What is it at this hour?

845
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,480
Perhaps did our Deok Seon cause trouble again?

846
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:50,170
 No, Mother. When Deok Seon comes home later give her lots of compliments. 

847
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:54,780
 Honestly, in our class there is an epileptic patient. 

848
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,880
 The child's mother was very worried. 

849
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,330
Aigoo. Is that so?

850
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,910
 - Yes.  
- Oh my how worried would she be.

851
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:08,110
 Yes. Yes. 

852
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:12,800
Is that so?
♫   I had to hold it in when I saw you   ♫

853
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,420
Yes. Aigoo.
♫  So I was able to see a stronger me     ♫

854
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,530
Okay.

855
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:23,370
 Aigoo. I had no idea, Ma'am. 

856
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:27,530
 Her homeroom teacher, Ms. Park did not say anything either. 

857
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:33,650
 That class's kids also have tight lips. I really did not know. 

858
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:36,550
 I... have a lot of debts to pay. 

859
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:39,200
 Don't worry about it. 

860
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:43,860
 In our class, there is a kind and pretty student named Deok Seon. 

861
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:49,230
 If it's her, you don't have anything to worry about if something happens. 

862
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:51,990
 She's so smart. 

863
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,440
 Thank you, Teacher. Thank you. 

864
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,400
 You don't have to. 

865
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,480
 But that student must be good in her studies. 

866
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,880
 No. She totally can't study. 

867
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,160
 But she's smart. 

868
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:17,820
Wow! Our Soo Yeon is kind, so kind. She did well.

869
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,780
That... Is she sleeping?

870
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:24,810
No. She's studying in her room. She's a senior now.

871
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:28,270
Wow, so pretty.

872
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:33,240
This is not the time to be doing this. I should compliment her.

873
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,470
I should pay her a visit to encourage her.

874
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,540
As expected, our Deok Seon.

875
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:02,290
As expected, our Deok Seon.

876
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,940
Oh my! He's so funny. He's going to be a really famous comedian.

877
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:21,160
Mom, that's for sure. Out of all the ones who are on the college festival, he's the funniest.

878
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:26,540
Aigoo. You're saying that as if our Deok, no Soo Yeon got into Seoul National University.

879
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:30,950
No, do you think anyone could be a comedian?

880
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:35,670
The way I look at it, he's just up to there.

881
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:38,560
- He looks like a grasshopper.
 - Do you want to bet?

882
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:44,200
Let's bet!
 (Yoo Jae Suk is still one of the most famous current  MCs and comedian ;  his nickname is Grasshopper)

883
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:53,530
No Eul, step out for a moment. I have something to say to Mom and Dad.

884
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,320
Hello.

885
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,350
Okay, Noona. I'll head out now.

886
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:19,040
Mom, I will go out for a while. Bye Jin Joo.

887
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,940
I cooked some dumpling soup so come home early!

888
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,840
Yeah.

889
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:44,720
Oh my! Aigoo!

890
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,160
Jin Joo, did you hurt your head?

891
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,590
Aigoo! What to do?

892
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,710
Something's up, right? Were you not able to get the part time job?

893
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,590
No.

894
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,620
Then what is it? Why aren't you telling me?

895
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:02,450
I'm going to tell you.

896
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:04,870
Seon Woo, I—

897
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:07,870
Seon Woo, come quickly. Jin Joo is being taken to the hospital.

898
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,380
Hey, let's go together!

899
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:13,230
Don't come, I'll call you later.

900
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,570
Noona, are you going somewhere?

901
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:32,070
Yeah, Taek's room. Taek said that he would buy pizza for dinner later.

902
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:34,800
Hyung Hee Dong ... He's such a buddha...

903
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,490
Dooly's gang is so mean.

904
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,450
Who are you calling Dooly's gang? Who? Who?

905
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:43,200
Who?

906
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,400
What time is it? Isn't it time for Knight Rider?

907
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:55,350
I'll be back later.

908
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,090
Oh, hi, Soo Yeon.

909
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:13,850
I'm going on a date. Wish me luck!

910
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:18,260
Oh, is Taek already here? You can go first. I'll meet you there—

911
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:29,440
I'll get going first then.

912
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,410
Hey—

913
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:51,390
Ah, really! Aish!

914
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:00,570
  Seoul Do Bong Hospital  

915
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,390
Jin Joo, are you okay?

916
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:28,180
Jin Joo is okay. You don't have to worry.

917
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:31,050
She must have been really surprised.

918
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:33,440
Your head is okay, right?

919
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,320
We took the X-ray. They say she's fine.

920
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,770
Don't worry.

921
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:43,960
She was very frightened. She took some medicine and is sleeping. She's okay.

922
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,960
You were really frightened, right?

923
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,770
Just a little bit. It's okay.

924
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:57,740
You were really frightened, right?

925
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:02,000
Yeah. You were probably more frightened than me.

926
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,980
No, it's okay now.

927
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:08,690
Didn't you say you were meeting someone? I'm fine, so you can go see them.

928
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:12,510
No, it's okay, I'll stay here.

929
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,540
- Then I'm going to get a cup of coffee. 
 - Okay.

930
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:29,950
Did our Jin Joo wake up?

931
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,960
It must've hurt a lot. You were really frightened, right?

932
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,090
- Ahjussi. 
 - What?

933
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:39,410
Where is Ahjussi?

934
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:44,340
Do you want to see Ahjussi?

935
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,280
Yeah.

936
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:51,210
Alright. Stay here, I'll bring him in.

937
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:06,820
  My Jin Joo... I was afraid she might die.  

938
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,990
  I thought I'd die last few hours. I was so scared. 

939
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:17,470
She won't get worse, will she?

940
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:22,450
Should I go to a bigger hospital?

941
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:26,320
No, it's not anything serious.

942
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,470
It's okay, it's okay.

943
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:35,050
Don't cry. It's nothing to cry about.

944
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:41,400
While I was hanging up laundry to dry for a moment, she fell.

945
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:45,630
I was constantly watching her. What an idiot I am...

946
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:49,290
How can you watch a kid for 24 hours?

947
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:53,490
It's okay, it's okay.

948
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:55,830
It can happen.

949
01:23:55,830 --> 01:24:01,410
What an idiot I am... So annoying...

950
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:04,920
It's okay. Don't worry. Don't cry.

951
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,100
 Dobong Clinic 

952
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:13,880
Why did you come?

953
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,710
Yeah. Is Jin Joo okay?

954
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:19,670
Yes, she's okay.

955
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:21,830
That's good.

956
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,980
Is there something wrong?

957
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:50,340
Noona, I think I know now.

958
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,300
What?

959
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:57,350
Why I don't like Ahjussi.

960
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:13,320
Why I don't like Ahjussi.

961
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,130
I think I know now.

962
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:27,690
I feel sorry for my dad.

963
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,030
I feel so sorry...

964
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:40,380
towards my dad.

965
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:58,960
Towards my dad...

966
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:27,690
 I think my mom makes the best dumpling soup in the world. 

967
01:26:27,690 --> 01:26:32,240
 Dad thinks everything Mom makes is delicious. 

968
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,570
 Dad. 

969
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:52,050
 Today, Jin Joo got hurt. 

970
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,230
 Yeah. 

971
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:06,020
 Mom was really frightened, but she told me she was okay. 

972
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:16,400
 But she told Taek's dad that she was scared, and cried. 

973
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:26,060
 I feel like she thinks Ahjussi is more comfortable than me. 

974
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:33,780
 She's doing that because you might worry. Dad understands. 

975
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,990
 Dad. 

976
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,030
 Aren't you sad? 

977
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:46,020
 Dad is not sad at all, Seon Woo. 

978
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:51,950
 Seon Woo, Dad 

979
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:58,980
  can do nothing for Mom. 

980
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:06,600
 I should just be next to Mom, 

981
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:13,420
 but I can't even do that anymore. 

982
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:19,360
 Seon Woo. Dad 

983
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,730
 hopes that Mom will be happy. 

984
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:29,370
 That's all. 

985
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,400
 Dad. 

986
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:38,190
 I'm sorry. 

987
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:44,860
 I'm really sorry. 

988
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:25,180
What's wrong? Are you shooting a movie?

989
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:31,570
Master, I have a question.

990
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:34,180
Tell me.

991
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:38,060
Why doesn't anyone like me?

992
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,380
Oh, it's Taek!

993
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,960
Geez, I saw wrong.

994
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,960
I'm being serious.

995
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,500
Yeah, I'm being serious, too.

996
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:59,540
Why isn't there anyone that likes me? Hm?

997
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:03,340
I guess I'm a woman who doesn't deserve to be loved.

998
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:08,340
Deok Seon, do you like wet sweet potato or dry sweet potato?

999
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:11,410
- Wet sweet potato. 
- Do you like Lee Moon Se or Park Nam Jung?

1000
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:12,580
Lee Moon Se.

1001
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:14,330
-Do you like me or Taek? 
 -Taek.

1002
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:16,310
Aish, so annoying.

1003
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:18,250
Do you not like me?

1004
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,120
I like Taek more.

1005
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:26,260
Then, do you like Jeong Pal, or Seon Woo more?

1006
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:30,560
Why would you ask me things like that.

1007
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:36,230
Deok Seon.

1008
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:40,020
What do  you  feel?

1009
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:46,980
Not what other people feel,   you.   Who do  you   like?

1010
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:52,930
You have such a clear taste in sweet potatoes. How about your taste in what type of person you like?

1011
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,970
Deok Seon, no Soo Yeon.

1012
01:30:56,970 --> 01:31:03,480
It's not about whether someone else likes you or not. You can like someone, right?

1013
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,600
Kids these days only know about math equations. They know nothing about life.

1014
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:15,810
But you don't know anything about math equations  or  life. What do you know?

1015
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:20,800
What are you? Ah. Jeez.

1016
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,880
Get up quickly.

1017
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,930
Are we going somewhere?

1018
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:27,940
Pizza's here.

1019
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,590
How many boxes of pizza did you buy?

1020
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:45,340
Five boxes.

1021
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:46,860
As expected of a rich man.

1022
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:50,290
My match ended late and I didn't think I could eat with you guys.

1023
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:53,120
So they told us to eat at home.

1024
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:57,330
Hee Dong, let's get married.

1025
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:59,310
I'm good.

1026
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:01,170
Haha, go in quickly. He has to sleep.

1027
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:07,080
Okay, bye. I'm going to eat it all by myself. I won't give it to the Dean.

1028
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,320
I'm going, too.

1029
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:14,560
Go a little bit later.

1030
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:31,090
  To my love, Choi Taek  

1031
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,230
Aren't you going to sleep?

1032
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:41,100
Do you even reply to them?

1033
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:47,640
You must be happy. You have no interest other than baduk.

1034
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,480
You've never liked someone, right?

1035
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:05,640
You don't have interest in anything but baduk, right?

1036
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,200
I do.

1037
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,690
What do you mean? Don't lie. Who do you think you're lying to?

1038
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,310
You are in the inside of my hand.

1039
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:18,320
What do I not know about you?

1040
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:27,930
You don't know anything about me.

1041
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:35,510
I have someone I like.

1042
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:43,380
And, I'm going to confess. Soon.

1043
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:48,710
♫  Only stay by my side, don't leave me  ♫

1044
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:59,390
♫  I can’t leave behind the longing and go on a long journey  ♫

1045
01:33:59,390 --> 01:34:07,800
♫  To find and bring back your rainbow  ♫

1046
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:14,200
♫  When I sit by the window during sunset  ♫

1047
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:22,810
♫  And look at the clouds floating far away  ♫

1048
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:35,810
♫  I draw the memories that I want to find on the sky  ♫

1049
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:45,050
♫  In the blowing, cold wind  ♫

1050
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:51,500
♫  You are lonely and crying  ♫

1051
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:56,750
 Are you not planning to wear this? 
♫ But I will always be  ♫

1052
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:00,220
 It's because it's a color you don't like, right? 
♫ by your side  ♫

1053
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:02,920
 It's a color Hyung likes. 
 ♫ I won't leave you  ♫

1054
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:07,070
 Do you think you can give it to me? 

1055
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,260
 I can't. 

1056
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:22,270
 Not this one. 

1057
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:28,860
♫  Only stay by my side  ♫

1058
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:36,670
♫  Don't leave me  ♫

1059
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:44,300
But, how did you know my size?

1060
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:47,710
It fits my body exactly.

1061
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:51,040
It's something that I wanted, too.

1062
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,600
When did you receive it?

1063
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:55,570
In the morning, by package.

1064
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:59,240
Don't tell Soo Yeon.

1065
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:03,380
If she finds out I bought the same thing, she'll never stop making fun of me.

1066
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:06,930
It's a secret between us.

1067
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:12,850
Then, good night.

1068
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:51,430


1069
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,620
Soo Yeon!

1070
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:59,480
Oppa, what's wrong? Are you out of your mind?

1071
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:04,490
Everyone likes Deok Seon. How can that be possible?

1072
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:07,140
Did something happen?

1073
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:12,390
What?! Ah, crazy bastard.

1074
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:14,740
Somebody got hurt.

1075
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:18,520
I heard he got into an accident at the Gwangsan Supermarket around the corner or something.

1076
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:22,340
What should I do... should I move him to another hospital or something?

1077
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:31,730
So are you going to confess to Deok Seon soon?

1078
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:35,740
Taek.

1079
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,870
If you want to find out if someone likes you back, they say to look into their eyes.

1080
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:47,610
Eyes don't lie.

1081
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:56,060
If I confess, will Deok Seon believe me?
