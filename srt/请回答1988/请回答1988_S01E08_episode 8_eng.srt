8
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,280
Taek's father, where did you get such pretty gloves?

9
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,590
Oh! Did you get a woman?

10
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,030
Right? It's not only me that sees that glove as pink.

11
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,430
Where did you get the gloves?

12
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,020
Taek gave them to me as a birthday present.

13
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,550
Wow, Taek is cool.

14
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,580
He gave something pink to his dad.

15
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,580
 Episode 8: One Warm Word 

16
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,150
Do you see me as a fool!

17
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,940
It's not. This time is real.

18
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,810
Hey, can't you see? He really likes you.

19
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,530
Of course. Hey, then did he go crazy and go to McDonald's from Ssangmoondong to Apgudong?

20
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,520
He really likes you.

21
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,600
Congratulations, Deok Seon. You got a boyfriend again.

22
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,880
Shut up! Be quiet!

23
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,680
If I think of getting embarrassed from you guys.

24
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,230
Hey. And what do you guys know about guys?

25
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,890
If you make me get excited again I'll just—

26
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,020
I understand.

27
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,940
But Wang Jo Hyeon, your hair color is pretty. What did you do it with?

28
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,740
This? Hydrogen peroxide.

29
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,770
Wow. Are you disinfecting your hair? Just do it in the beauty salon.

30
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,310
Hey. Rich daughter should stay out of it.

31
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,980
Poor children are in the midst of talking.

32
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,230
Wow, Seong Deok Seon, you know 'talking' too?

33
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,980
Are you joking?

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Should I try dying my hair since it's break? I have hydrogen peroxide at home too.

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,260
Don't do it. Don't do it. It feels like my head is going to crack. It smells so much.

36
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,950
Really? Then what should I do it with?

37
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,920
What do you mean?

38
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,950
Deok Seon, where did you go in the morning?

39
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,150
To meet my friends.

40
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,470
What did you eat?

41
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,970
Spicy rice cakes.

42
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,870
Why? Is something going on?

43
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,220
Forget it.

44
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,320
Why is Mom like that? Did something happen?

45
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,030
30,000 won are gone from Mom's wallet.

46
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,440
So what?

47
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,090
It isn't you?

48
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,880
Who do you see me as?

49
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,740
Why are you looking through someone else's wallet?

50
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,220
Are you an older sister? How can you suspect a younger sibling?

51
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,100
Here. See? Are you fine?

52
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,130
If not, then never mind.

53
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,540
It's not me, Mom! It's really not me, Mom!

54
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:41,720
I didn't steal it! I don't even know where your wallet is! Why do you suspect people!

55
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,050
I really didn't take it! Really!

56
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,140
Okay, Deok Seon. I understand. I'm sorry.

57
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,010
Do you want to eat sweet potato?

58
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,490
Aigoo... Does it taste good?

59
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,190
But Mom,

60
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,670
could it be No Eul?

61
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,420
There's only No Eul. Aren't I right?

62
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,240
If No Eul did it,

63
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,310
don't say anything to No Eul. He may go astray

64
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,230
for being suspicious of him.

65
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,780
It's the time he would be rebelling. Okay?

66
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,110
- Okay? 
 - What about me?

67
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,420
Then I don't rebel?

68
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,320
Bo Ra, eat sweet potato.

69
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,080
What about me? I'm only one year older than No Eul! I get hurt too!

70
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,070
Right. Isn't today Jeong Bong's announcement?

71
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,440
Probably.

72
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,790
What happened?

73
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,170
We probably heard it wrong. I'll call again.

74
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,560
 Sorry. You're disqualified. 

75
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm sorry. I don't have anything to say.

76
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,990
It's okay. You can just take it again.

77
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,130
The floor will cave in.

78
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,560
What's with you? Are you giving up?

79
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,490
Jeong Bong, hurry up and go to your room and rest. You have to hospitalize tomorrow.

80
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,110
It's not good if you stress. Hurry up and go in.

81
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,710
It's okay. Straighten your shoulders.

82
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,860
Kim Jeong Bong, you can be disqualified.

83
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,940
It's a test because you qualify. Is it a test if everyone qualifies?

84
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,580
It's okay! Okay?

85
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,300
If it weren't for the surgery.

86
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,780
Look how he grew up healthy. I'm so grateful for that reason alone.

87
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,760
You have a lot of greed. You have a lot of greed.

88
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,410
Did you forget everything?

89
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,670
I didn't forget.

90
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,710
Honey, go out for two hours. Go to Bongwongdang or something.

91
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,760
What are you going to do?

92
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,050
Amore lady will come by today. Just go out for two hours.

93
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,220
Are you going to buy cosmetics again?

94
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,340
Just go out.

95
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,950
Okay, okay. But why two hours? Weren't you going to do it for one hour?

96
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,450
Jyudanhak lady will come, too.

97
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,830
Okay.

98
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,400
I did eat it.

99
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,500
Go where this weekend?

100
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,610
I don't want to. I said that I'm not going to go.

101
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,330
Hyung is going too?

102
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,200
No use then.

103
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,550
We can meet next week. What do you mean I didn't hang onto you?

104
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,680
You said you had to go. You go ahead.

105
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,720
I'm okay.    What? 

106
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,720
Finish up quickly. I'm waiting for a call too.

107
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,060
Okay. See you next week.

108
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,580
Okay.

109
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,950
When does anyone ever call you?

110
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,440
Do Ryong Nyong. We're supposed to watch "K-Pop 100" together today.

111
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,430
Since when have you guys called before meeting up with each other?

112
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,080
Hello?

113
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,420
Hwang Yi Soo, what's up?

114
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,530
Right now?

115
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,270
Noona, hi. (informal)

116
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,910
Hello. (formal)

117
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,170
Hello.

118
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,790
Noona, are you going somewhere?

119
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm going to see my boyfriend

120
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,900
Hey there, hello there.

121
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,890
Are you not going to greet me properly?

122
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,230
I'm sorry, ma'am

123
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,160
Be careful

124
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,720
I will be careful.

125
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,280
You like her like that?

126
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,600
No, I don't like that.

127
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,920
Right? You are a person anyway.

128
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,410
But, what are you going to do? She's going to meet her boyfriend.

129
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,590
No, she's not going to meet her boyfriend.

130
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,360
When she sees her boyfriend, she wears a skirt. But she's wearing pants.

131
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,120
Because I could hear, she lied.

132
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,470
This bastard, scary kid...

133
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,500
She's not a person.

134
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,010
Then what is she?

135
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,180
- Daffodil. 
 - Crazy bastard.

136
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,750
Did you switch from Um Joo Hyun?

137
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,350
Yeah, Ji Yeon Noona is the best.

138
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,790
I don't really like that style.

139
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,440
Of course.

140
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,690
That dork likes the strong type.

141
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,290
Let's say... Some strong woman?

142
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,580
Like Noona Bo Ra.

143
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,590
Well I guess that's possible.

144
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,170
But it's possible Noona Bo Ra wouldn't be like that in front of her boyfriend.

145
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,110
What are you talking about?

146
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,070
Wow, you guys really don't know anything.

147
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,430
You only know how to study, but don't know anything about girls.

148
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,590
No matter how hard a girl plays doing the doggie dance at home,

149
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,660
in front of a guy a woman likes, she stays still.

150
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,430
If...  IF  in front of you a woman is dancing and acting foolish,

151
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,790
then, she doesn't see you as a man.

152
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,660
If she sees you as a man, she can't do that.

153
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,520
 Who is it? 

154
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,710
I'm from Amore.

155
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,650
Oh I love this.

156
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,120
Aigoo, we're enjoying ourselves thanks to you, Hyungnim.

157
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,400
This feels great.

158
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,530
Yeah she does this well.

159
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,660
If feels so great...

160
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,290
- Don't laugh. You'll get wrinkles. 
- Right, right...

161
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,320
This lady's skin is so great.

162
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,990
Is it because you're a rich madam?

163
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,950
- Hyungnim has always had good complexion. 
- Still, she took very good care of herself.

164
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,890
It looks like you don't have any stress.

165
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,330
Of course living in a huge house like this, what kind of worries would you have?

166
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,630
Do I really seem like that?

167
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,530
Of course.

168
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:32,580
You look like you've never suffered a day in your life—total rich madam.

169
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,960
I'm so jealous.

170
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,520
Really?

171
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,990
Do you really think Hyungnim never suffered a day in her life?

172
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,890
Yes!

173
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,020
My hyungnim, you've succeeded.

174
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,480
I guess so.

175
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,530
Why?

176
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,760
Oh nothing, nothing.

177
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,460
Also, you're going to give us a lot of samples right?

178
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:58,030
Of course! You bought so much makeup!

179
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,520
Just give us 300 samples.

180
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,560
Rock, paper, scissors!

181
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,320
YES!

182
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,920
I don't make ramen that well.

183
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,890
  La Bamba  

184
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,260
Yeah right, because of Jeong Bong, you make ramen all the time. Go already!

185
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,400
I'm hungry, go quickly.

186
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,030
Hey it's been a long time since we've seen Taek, what's with ramen?

187
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,900
Let's order food.

188
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,110
I want to eat ramen though.

189
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,610
Don't turn it on without me, okay? I haven't watched it.

190
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,850
Hey just go already!

191
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,530
♫   I'll never be the same, 'cause I love my girl  ♫

192

193
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,730
 ♫ Where can you be ? ♫ 

194
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,600
Oh yeah, you haven't forgotten about tomorrow, right?

195
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,050
Wow. You only remember what you want to remember. You've forgotten already haven't you?

196
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,270
We agreed on going to the movies together tomorrow!

197
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,840
I went all the way to the Jongro Theater to buy the tickets. I was in line for an hour!

198
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,930
Oh yeah, I remember. But I have a competition tomorrow. And when it ends, it'll be night time.

199
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,800
That's why we said we'd meet at night because you told us it'll end late. Have you forgotten everything?

200
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,020
Oh, you're right.

201
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,150
Oh, by the way, do you know where it is?

202
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,600
Yeah, I just have to go to Jongro. Dansungsa, right?

203
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,570
Yes, you're right, but you can just wait for us. We will pick you up.

204
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,800
It's fine. You guys think I can't find it on my own?

205
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah, you can't find it.

206
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,220
Anyway, it's on the way. We'll meet you in front of the center.

207
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,960
Don't take a taxi alone, get off at the wrong stop and get lost, okay?

208
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,310
Don't go anywhere and wait for me okay?

209
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,890
It's really been a long time since you went to a theater, right? Since you graduated from junior high, right?

210
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,960
No, we went a little while ago.

211
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,950
Really?

212
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,350
Was it fun? What'd you watch?

213
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,210
He wouldn't know. He slept through the whole thing.

214
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,840
He had pulled an all-nighter two nights in a row.

215
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,730
 Jyudanhak   

216
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,280
 Who is it? 

217
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm from Jyudanhak.

218

♫   Para bailar la bamba  ♫

219

♫   Para bailar la bamba se necesita una poca de gracia  ♫

220
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,550
♫  Una poca de gracia   ♫

221
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,230
What is this?

222
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,350
I just put in everything from the refrigerator.

223
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,560
It's my family's style.

224
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,980
This is how my hyung eats it.

225
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,030
It's good though.

226
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,180
Thanks.

227
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,990
When is Jeong Bong's surgery?

228
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,580
This weekend. He'll be hospitalized tomorrow.

229
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,480
We have to visit, where's the hospital?

230
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,290
Why visit? It's only an hour long. You don't have to come.

231
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,490
One hour? It's only one hour?

232
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,990
Last time didn't it last ten hours?

233
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:33,440
They had to change the valve that time. This time, they just have to switch the battery.

234
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,470
What about his exam? Did he pass?

235
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,900
He failed.

236
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,640
Hey, nosebleed.

237
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,140
The winter must be here already.

238
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,400
Are you hurt anywhere?

239
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,640
What are you talking about?

240
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,970
He went to the hospital to get examined and they found nothing wrong.

241
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,310
They're just born that way. The two brothers are both weak.

242
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,940
How many perverted things you'd have to see...

243
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,050
It's my immune system!

244
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,280
Lucky you!

245
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,690
But your mother is probably still upset, even if it's a simple surgery.

246
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,890
Who? My mom?

247
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,910
Ra Mi Ran?

248
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,960
Oh my!

249
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,460
- So moisturized... 
- Your face is so shiny.

250
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,370
Look at my face! How does it look?

251
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,010
Unni, you look so pretty.

252
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,640
 Thanks, you should go out today. You look really pretty today. 

253
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,010
 Looking like this? 

254
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,770
So funny. You look like a rich madam.

255
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,310
Wow, look at your hands. You have such pretty hands.

256
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:42,480
This lady must live like a queen.

257
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,360
Why?

258
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,610
Your hands are so soft as if you've never touched cold water before.

259
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,070
Right ma'am?

260
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,440
Your face doesn't even have any worry lines.

261
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,870
Really, I'm so jealous.

262
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,450
Even if they're just words, it makes me feel good.

263
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,680
What do you mean just words, that's what it looks like!

264
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,620
But, in a little while, you're going to give us a lot of samples, right?

265
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,440
The Amore lady gave us a ton earlier.

266
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,580
Yes, I will give you a lot!

267
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,220
You bought so much!

268
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,510
Just give us 300.

269
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,320
  Coffee creamer  

270
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,180
Let's see. Let's see your face again.

271
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,650
Wow, really, sophistication drips off of you now.

272
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,240
No matter how hard I look at you,

273
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,020
you don't look a bit like the woman who used to eat soojaebi ( clear soup with dough dumplings ) all the time.

274
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,620
There's no one like you who has suffered so much.

275
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,850
Let's see someone else who's suffered more than you here in Ssangmundong.

276
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,200
We can't even begin to talk about how much you suffered, Hyungnim.

277
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,090
I know. Only time will tell.

278
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,810
Who knew I'd hear that I look like someone who's never touched water in my lifetime?

279
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,310
When Jeong Bong was diagnosed, you suffered so much.

280
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,650
You were so strong then, Hyungnim.

281
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,250
You locked up sick Jeong Bong in the room and went to work.

282
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,600
You went to put up wallpapers, right?

283
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,730
Put up wallpapers, deliver newspapers, work at restaurants...

284
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,250
Amazing, really.

285
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,180
I would've fainted right away if I found out my baby had heart disease.

286
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,160
I mean what else could I have done? He needed surgery and we had no money.

287
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,210
I had to save money somehow.

288
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,250
There were days when Jeong Bong's father and I starved for two days.

289
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,770
Really, you didn't even tell us. You're so tough.

290
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,130
Was I the only one with a hard time? You two were no different.

291
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,260
True...

292
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,630
Oh yeah, what's this surgery for?

293
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,540
Didn't he switch out the valve last year?

294
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,520
I know. You had to switch the valve since it's been ten years since his first surgery.

295
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,040
What do they have to do?

296
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,110
Ah, this time it's simple.

297
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,750
There's a battery they have to change.

298
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,410
It should take an hour? Maybe two?

299
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,860
Oh, it'll be over quick!

300
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,430
Of course.

301
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:02,030
But, still if my kid was getting a surgery, no matter how simple,

302
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,920
if my baby was going into surgery, I would choke up and not be able to swallow anything.

303
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,600
What's to worry about?

304
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,370
We have money and getting the surgery at the best hospital in Korea.

305
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,780
There's nothing to worry about.

306
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,240
You are  really  strong!

307
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,690
That's how she was able to endure those rough years.

308
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,190
If not, she would've gone crazy already. Right, Hyungnim?

309
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,820
But where has Jeong Bong gone?

327
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,080
Hey, we already heard the entire album.

328
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,060
Quickly, tell me.

329
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,670
What's the problem? What can't you tell to a friend?

330
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,340
Bo Ra...

331
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,390
The thing is... Oppa Jong Hoon ...

332
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,260
Oppa Jong Hoon?

333
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,620
Sunbae Jong Hoon. (upperclassman)

334
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,510
What is this? Why is my boyfriend your Oppa?

335
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,390
There's really nothing between us.

336
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,160
What is? Did something happen between you two?

337
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,180
No matter what, I felt that I had to tell you.

338
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,550
The day you couldn't go to the retreat because of family reasons,

339
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,810
that night I had a lot to drink.

340
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,980
I drank a lot and he also got drunk.

341
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,660
So?

342
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,250
I went outside to get some fresh air.

343
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,380
Jong Hoon Sunbae got a headache and followed me out.

344
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,310
Did you guys kiss?

345
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,950
I'm sorry Bo Ra.

346
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:20,750
It was an accident, honestly! We were so drunk and weren't in our right minds!

347
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,140
I'm really sorry, Bo Ra.

348
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,790
I felt so bad towards you.

349
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,630
I couldn't even look at you properly.

350
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,410
But still, you're my friend.

351
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,330
My best friend... I couldn't let it go and stay quiet

352
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,620
Bo Ra...

353
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,380
I'm sorry, really.

354
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,010
It's fine.

355
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,150
I'm not going to see Jong Hoon any more, so don't cry.

356
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,920
And I'm not going to see you any more.

357
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,630
Friend? As if.

358
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:22,750
  Sticky rice cake! Buckwheat jello! 

359
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,300
No Eul what time is it?

360
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,470
Your father is probably having a drink...

361
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,190
Aigoo, my life...

362
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,800
Il Hwa, I'm here!

363
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,030
Honey, your husband's here.

364
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,600
Again, again!

365
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,690
You went drinking right?

366
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,290
Hey, how can you talk to your husband like that?

367
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,940
I did mean to come home early, but something really important came up at the bank today, so..

368
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,430
I couldn't do anything about it and I just had one drink.

369
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,290
Work my ass! How come you work overtime every day!

370
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,310
What is that?

371
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,740
This is a liquid that can erase ink.

372
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,500
This is the first time you've ever seen this right?

373
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,890
I was getting on the subway

374
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,520
and there was a kid around No Eul's age selling these.

375
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,550
Oh my...

376
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,750
You also know that I don't usually buy this kind of stuff.

377
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:43,260
But... This... This liquid erases ink!

378
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,220
I know I would regret it if I didn't buy it, so I bought one.

379
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,650
And, another one.

380
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,710
And, also...

381
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,430
Just three.

382
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,050
Just wait, where's the ink?

383
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,280
Okay, let's see

384
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,830
Mom!

385
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,620
It's okay, it's okay!

386
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,750
I can just erase it with this!

387
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,480
Geez...

388
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,780
Just watch lady, see if I'm lying.

389
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,910
I just do this, take this here...

390
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,900
And just like this, gently sprinkle it like this and...

391
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,840
Rub, rub, rub, rub...

392
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,800
Rub, rub, rub, rub...

393
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,310
Oh my god that's so weird. On the subway demonstration it erased so well.

394
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,120
Aigoo, not worth a damn, not worth a damn!

395
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,540
How can you call your husband  not worth a damn?

396
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,940
What else then? You dummy?

397
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,730
What's that mean?

398
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,250
An idiot!

399
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,610
How can you call your husband an idiot?

400
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,420
Ugh! We have Buddha in the midst of our poor finances.

401
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,230
Do you know how many years you've been an assistant manager?

402
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,860
Why are you talking about that now?

403
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,980
What connection is there between me being an assistant manager and this ink remover?

404
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,710
To put it bluntly, if you had been more supportive at home,

405
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,490
I would've become much more successful!

406
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,080
Aigoo, you fell over blabbering on about success?

407
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,480
I fell over blabbering on? How dare you say that to your husband?

408
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,410
Right, you fell over blabbering on! Only if you hadn't cosigned!

409
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,410
Would we be living in an underground room like this all this time?

410
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,240
Again, again... Why bring up that cosigning incident now?

411
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,800
Say that one more time, I'll just kill you! If you bring up cosigning again!

412
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,400
What did you say? You'll just kill what? What?

413
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,080
- Kill me! Kill me! 
 - Oh, my!

414
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,390
- Kill me! 
 - Oh, my!

415
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,180
Look at you...

416
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,900
Kill me!

417
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,760
Are you alright? What do I do?

418
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,280
Can you see me? How many fingers?

419
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,200
I'll kill you...

420
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,270
What is this, Hyung?

421
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,840
My collections.

422
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,370
These are Rubik's Cubes.

423
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,190
This is...

424
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,890
My stamp collection.

425
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,450
These are... College Music Festival LPs.

426
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:13,370
And these are the movie posters that I have gathered all this time.

427
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,710
And this...

428
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,460
My diary.

429
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,710
I will give these all to you. I don't need them any more.

430
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,260
Don't go overboard!

431
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,640
What are you doing just because of a surgery that lasts for only an hour?

432
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,380
But still, a surgery is a surgery.

433
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,650
Hyung, the probability of that surgery going wrong is less than 3%.

434
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,860
I already looked it up.

435
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,220
The probability of getting a heart disease when you're young

436
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,020
is not even 2%. That's why...

437
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,550
I am really scared of that 3%.

438
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,320
Don't go overboard please!

439
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,270
Hyung! That surgery can be performed with the doctor's eyes closed.

440
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,040
Don't say such nonsense and go to bed.

441
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,800
Little brother, should Hyung sleep with you tonight?

442
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,790
That's a bit...

443
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,570
I know. Me too, that's a bit.

444
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,270
♫   I'm about to leave   ♫

445
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:51,800
♫   There are so many stars out tonight   ♫

446
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,750
♫   The faces I see by the window   ♫

447
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:02,710
♫   Everything is right here   ♫

448
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,640
I'm back.

449
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,700
You're here. Hurry wash up and go to sleep. Aren't you hungry?

450
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,940
I'm good.

451
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,010
I am hungry.

452
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,180
DO you want to eat bean porridge? 
 - Yes.

453
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,570
Honey. Would you like to have some bean porridge?

454
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,210
I would love to.

455
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,080
Wife, you've been so busy,

456
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,600
so when did you have time to make a bean porridge?

457
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,160
Dad, what happened to your eyes? Did you get hit?

458
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,960
It's nothing much.

459
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,310
Mom threw a rock.

460
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,610
No Eul, do you want some bean porridge too?

461
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,760
Nevermind for me... Ma'am.

462
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,430
- Okay. 
 - Honey.

463
00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:00,120
While you're in the kitchen, would it be alright for you to get me a glass of water?

464
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,920
Of course, I should get you one.

465
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,450
Do you need anything else?

466
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,370
Oh, nothing else.

467
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,810
Oh, right. I will be the one to change the coal briquette for tonight.

468
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,760
Oh my! I'm so thankful.

469
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,000
Then, I ask that favor from you.

470
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,710
You don't make the pillow stand like that!

471
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,770
Please wait.

472
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,290
What's wrong with both of them?

473
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:34,320
- Starting today they've decided to talk to each other formally. 
 - Huh?

474
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,430
Why?

475
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:38,200
They keep fighting because they just speak recklessly.

476
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,420
They said they're embarrassed to have us see that.

477
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,680
This is more embarrassing.

478
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,460
I know, ma'am.

479
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,510
Food is ready! Come and eat!

480
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,100
You all just won't come out after being called once!

481
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,800
What are you doing? Come and eat.

482
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,660
But still, this time there's not many things to pack.

483
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,200
Last year, when we got admitted to the hospital my car was so full of things.

484
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,030
Why are you emoting so early in the morning! Hurry come out and eat!

485
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
Bong, let's eat breakfast.

486
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,040
I won't eat.

487
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,700
Hurry! Get up! Hurry!

488
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,240
Let's eat together instead of telling me to set up the table for you later, separately!

489
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,740
I don't think I could swallow.

490
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,720
 What can't you swallow! Hurry and eat! 

491
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,290
Mom, there's no pork cutlet? The side dishes are always the same.

492
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,040
Just eat. You can't complain of the side dishes, too.

493
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,520
Honey, let's eat. The soup is getting cold.

494
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,900
The two of them decided to talk formally. Isn't it funny?

495
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,830
Honey!

496
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,060
You must have waited for me, you should have eaten first.

497
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,620
But we should still wait for the head of the family.

498
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,700
Mom, until when are you going to be like that? You'll be an embarrassment in the neighborhood.

499
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,170
Don't spill food as you eat!

500
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,610
Who do you take after that you're so reckless?

501
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,760
Those words... Are you saying those directed to me?

502
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,090
Oh, no. That's not it.

503
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,870
Go ahead and eat.

504
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,610
Yes, hello?

505
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,910
He's asking for Noona.

506
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,900
Tell him I'm not here.

507
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,330
She said she's not here.

508
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,420
Yes, I understand.

509
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,310
He's going to call again.

510
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,580
Our No Eul...

511
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,400
Who does he take after that he's so slow witted?

512
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,270
Perhaps, are you saying he takes after me?

513
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,960
That's why he's a bit lacking?

514
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,660
No way.

515
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,260
- Please eat. 
 - Yes.

516
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,840
Are you finished? Eat more.

517
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,510
Never mind. I'm going to sleep.

518
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,210
Don't wake me up.

519
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,100
Jeong Bong.

520
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,070
You already got that difficult surgery twice so what's there to worry about?

521
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,640
You shouldn't worry a bit.

522
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,730
Yes.

523
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,310
Jeong Hwan, hurry and come.

524
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,880
I'll enjoy the food.

525
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,300
You had another nosebleed?

526
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,650
Yes. It's not like it's the first time. It always happens when I wash with warm water.

527
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,160
Hyung, it's this afternoon, right? You get admitted.

528
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,320
You don't need to come.

529
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,390
That's right. Even if you come there's no place for you to sleep, so just stay at home.

530
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,320
It's not like it's a big surgery for the whole family to be in the hospital.

531
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,700
That's right. Jeong Hwan, you can come tomorrow.

532
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,850
Since the surgery is the day after tomorrow, you can just come tomorrow.

533
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,560
Yes.

534
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,200
Taekie is probably done, right?

535
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,350
He's probably done. What time is it already.

536
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,490
Did Taekie win? Isn't his match a big one today?

537
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,590
He probably won. He's confident that he would win, isn't that why he said we'll watch a movie?

538
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,400
We're almost there. I can see it up front. What time is the movie?

539
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,770
Fish cake soup for me.

540
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,400
Deok Seon, go and bring Taekie.

541
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,300
Hey, you should hold his hand so that you don't lose him.

542
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,990
Want me to go with you?

543
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,680
Never mind.

544
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,750
Master Choi.

545
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,040
You worked hard. Congratulations.

546
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,190
Thank you.

547
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,660
It's an honor.

548
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,460
Congratulations!

549
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,200
You worked hard! Congratulations!

550
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,700
You worked hard!

551
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,400
You worked hard!

552
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,830
What about your bag? You had it with you this morning.

553
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:57,100
- Oh, right.
 - Here you go again! Where do you place your senses at!

554
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,660
Go get it.

555
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,780
I'll get it for you!

556
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,360
No, it's okay. He needs to exercise.

557
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,720
I will be at the street stall so meet me over there, okay?

558
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,300
- Don't wander around. Go right there! 
 - Okay.

559
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,400
Then... Goodbye.

560
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:49,150
Jeong Bong, let's eat

561
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,010
There was a pork cutlet place out front so I got some.

562
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,220
That's good. Since he starts fasting tomorrow he should eat as much as he wants today.

563
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,760
I don't like to eat.

564
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,530
Don't say anything that doesn't make sense and come.

565
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,920
Mr. Kim Jeong Bong.

566
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,710
- The surgery is the day after tomorrow, right? 
 - Yes, doctor.

567
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,930
This is a pacemaker change surgery.

568
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,520
The pacemaker that was placed last year during the valve change surgery,

569
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,870
you can just think of it as changing the battery.

570
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,100
Usually it's after five to ten years,

571
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,970
but sometimes in cases like this, where the location isn't that good, then we do the surgery.

572
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,810
It's a simple surgery, right Doctor?

573
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,220
There's no such thing as a simple surgery. We would only know once we open him up.

574
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,160
But still, I heard it usually is finished within an hour.

575
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,030
How could you know what a doctor isn't even sure about? We would know when we do the surgery.

576
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,600
Goodbye.

577
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,180
He should have said it nicely. If he says it scarily then we can't ask anything.

578
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,730
That doctor is usually like that. He was like that last year, too.

579
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,870
And doctors usually say things rigidly. It's not like it's the first time.

580
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,850
Jeong Bong, let's eat...

581
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,520
Hello.

582
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,810
Yeah. Are you looking for our Bo Ra?

583
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,980
Student, who are you?

584
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,990
Okay. Wait a moment.

585
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:34,310
Bo Ra, get the phone. He says he's your friend Park Jong Hoon.

586
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:38,460
But then, with Bo Ra what—

587
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,180
Don't answer Mom, he's crazy.

588
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,210
I find Noona Bo Ra really uncomfortable. I almost peed my pants when I saw her yesterday.

589
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,180
She had a fit with her boyfriend.

590
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,030
What the heck? She has a boyfriend?

591
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,950
Yeah. But I think they're breaking up soon.

592
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,000
Well, a person who likes Seong Bo Ra wouldn't be in his right mind.

593
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,950
He would be a psycho.

594
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,000
Jeong pal, sit over here.

595
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,570
Never mind. We're almost there.

596
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,680
- Where are you going? 
 - To the lounge. I'm going to watch TV, go ahead and sleep first.

597
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,100
Okay. Our Mi Ran...

598
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,480
You've become stronger.

599
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,690
In the past you couldn't even sleep, now you're even watching TV.

600
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:34,310
It's not like it's the same as in the past. This isn't even considered a surgery. I will just watch the acting awards.

601
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,720
Did Hyung Jeong Bong get admitted? Don't you need to go?

602
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,470
They told me to go tomorrow.

603
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,510
Now that I think about it, it's been so long since we played soccer with Hyung Jeong Bong.

604
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:28,050
In the past, before his first surgery, we played soccer a lot of times.

605
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,340
Jeongpal, wasn't your dream in grade school to become a soccer player?

606
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:38,130
That time you were so crazy about Maradona. This punk used to be good at soccer befo—

607
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,880
He sleeps so well.

608
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:48,480
I'm going to sleep.

609
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,400
The smell.

610
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,210
When did you fart!

611
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:57,430
- Ten minutes ago. 
 - What did you eat!

612
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,400
Does it stink?

613
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,800
- It doesn't. 
 - What do you mean it doesn't?

614
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,820
Wait.

615
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,470
Seriously!

616
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,570
Hey! Stinks!!

617
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:28,080
 NOTHING BY MOUTH 

618
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,040
Isn't it time for Jeong Hwan to arrive? I asked him to bring my razor.

619
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,640
- Hyung! 
 - You're here.

620
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,460
- My razor? 
 - Here.

621
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,590
You're alright?

622
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:49,260
What's wrong? A person who was fine after some surgeries.

623
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,080
What is this? Precious pineapple and banana?

624
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:58,940
- Did you buy them? 
 - Taekie gave them. He got them form the company president yesterday and gave them for Hyung to eat.

625
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,550
What's this? Hyung is already fasting?

626
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:07,030
It was placed a while ago. Wait, I will go and ask the doctor.

627
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,630
Hurry and go.

628
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,050
Excuse me, where is Doctor Choi Hyung Sang?

629
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,680
What is it about? You can tell me.

630
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,530
That is... I have something to ask him.

631
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,110
Oh, there he is.

632
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,770
Hello, Doctor.

633
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,530
That... My child's friend, Choi Taek,

634
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:39,300
a really famous Go player, you know him, right?

635
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,710
He sent some pineapple and banana because his hyung got admitted.

636
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,640
Can't he eat those?

637
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,770
He was just placed on fasting just a little while ago. After he eats, he'll be fasting.

638
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,930
- Do as you wish. 
 - Pardon?

639
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:00,530
You do as you see fit.

640
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,020
Did your nose bleed this morning again?

641
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,880
What's this? When did this happen?

642
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,990
That's so strange. Why did you take after me on that? My nose bled a lot back in the day, too.

643
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:30,970
You passed on such good things to your son.

644
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,500
This is for your hyung.

645
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,690
Never mind for me.

646
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,090
Jeong Hwan, you eat a lot.

647
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:45,990
That's strange, you giving up on food. You must be scared of the surgery indeed.

648
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:52,510
- This time it doesn't feel right. 
 - You're saying bad things again!

649
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:58,460
It's not a difficult surgery! Just eat a banana instead of talking nonsense!

650
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:14,450
I have to call my friend. Hurry and hang up.

651
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,750
Yeah, okay. I got it.

652
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,610
You're coming to my neighborhood?

653
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:23,220
No, I will just meet you at the bus stop.

654
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,550
Okay.

655
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,140
Yeah.

656
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:43,110
You have a girlfriend? What school? What year?

657
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,140
A student should be studying!

658
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,010
Is this the time to have a girlfriend?

659
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,510
I'm going to tell Mom!

660
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,090
I just met her a couple times.

661
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,400
And she's not my girlfriend.

662
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,620
I'm breaking up with her today.

663
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,230
She's not even your girlfriend, why would you break up with her?

664
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,060
It's one-sided love, she just likes me.

665
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,980
You? Why? How?

666
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,440
You expect met to believe that?

667
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,850
It's true. Just give me a break today.

668
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,740
I'll end it.

669
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,880
Hey, you better clean up this mess today! Got it?

670
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,380
You see, Soo Gyeong, we should stop meeting—

671
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,580
Oh f*** ! That f****** scared me!

672
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:52,870
Hey, what did you just say?

673
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:54,690
Nothing, I didn't say anything

674
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:57,280
I thought I heard you say we should stop meeting.

675
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,240
Why? Do you not like me anymore?

676
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,070
- No, I like you. 
 - You little— You think I'm stupid?

677
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,240
Hey, we started out because you wanted to,

678
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,080
but you can't end it on your own terms.

679
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,680
Hey what did you do to your hair?

680
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,120
Wrinkle perm. Hey, this was expensive.

681
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:35,160
Hey, who cares if it was expensive? It doesn't look good at all.

682
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,250
Hey you guys' hair is even weirder, okay?

683
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,490
- What's with you? Did you color your hair again? 
 - Yeah.

684
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,580
- I used a little money. 
 - I knew you would.

685
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,650
- It looks nice. 
 - Right? I used up two boxes this time.

686
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,130
What the heck?

687
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:52,960
Good job.

688
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,040
Hey isn't that your younger brother?

689
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:10,260
Oh, No Eul you're already hanging out with girls?

690
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,320
Who are you girls? How do you know my No Eul?

691
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,220
Wow, you're quite capable, No Eul.

692
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,450
Pathetic... pathetic...

693
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,840
No Eul do you want to come with us? We'll buy you ddeokbokki.

694
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,400
No, Eul said he'd hang out with us.

695
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,770
You guys can go first.

696
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,840
  Noona...  

697
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,180
Hey, No Eul, are you crying?

698
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,790
HEY! You made my brother cry?

699
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,610
You're not letting go?! Did you make him cry?!

700
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,340
Get off her!

701
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,760
Hey!

702
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,180
My daughter is so happy. I have to make dinner.

703
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:10,150
- Where are you going, Mom? 
 -It's raining, I'm getting laundry.

704
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,710
No, I'll get it Mom. You stay here.

705
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,280
Jin Joo, just a minute, I'll be right back.

706
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,050
I'll do it.

707
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,430
Okay then.

708
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:29,560
Let's run! Let's run! Good, good!

709
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,560
Let's talk.

710
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,450
I don't have anything to say.

711
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:13,270
But still, you can hear me out.

712
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,030
Wow they're all like ice.

713
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:05,590
It was a mistake. I drank so much...

714
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,780
I wasn't in my right mind.

715
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,800
The strange thing is...

716
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,240
I remembered when I got sober.

717
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,040
It was a mistake.

718
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,300
It was a mistake, and I know I was at fault.

719
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,620
I was really crazy.

720
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,550
Crazy...

721
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,490
I'm sorry

722
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,320
Let me go this time...

723
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,340
If I do that again, I'll seriously...

724
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:41,060
I'm sorry, really.

725
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,250
Does saying your sorry change anything?

726
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,700
Mistake? When have you ever made a mistake because of drinking?

727
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,650
I haven't seen you make one—ever.

728
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,470
I don't understand and I don't forgive you.

729
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:03,780
I can't understand with my logic at all.

730
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,900
Are you a person?

731
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,030
How can you do that with my closest friend?

732
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:11,200
I said to let me off just this once!

733
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,670
I said I was sorry!

734
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:17,330
How many times do I have to say it?

735
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,800
What's so great about you, huh?

736
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,390
Are you perfect? Do you ever make mistakes?

737
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,710
Of course...

738
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,640
You're perfect.

739
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,690
You're smart.

740
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,430
You always have to be first.

741
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:36,020
You hate getting help from others.

742
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,210
You take off just because your boyfriend got drunk.

743
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:44,230
You treat me like a bug if I try to hold your hand. Look, look!

744
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,960
Do you even have feelings? Do you?

745
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,940
A girl who is so cold and ruthless like you—

746
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,310
It's the first time!

747
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,690
Whatever.

748
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:00,440
I thought I'd suffocate while seeing you, too.

749
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,520
When I was with you, I didn't have a girlfriend.

750
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,640
I felt like I was dating an ice sculpture.

751
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,710
You'll never date anyone unless you change your temper. Got it?

752
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,170
You really are the worst among women.

753
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:26,030
♫   A long day has passed and on the other side of the hill    ♫

754
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:34,940
♫   Red sunset is coloring the sky   ♫

755
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:43,880
♫   Kids playing who were playing without a care   ♫

756
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:51,550
♫   They have gone home one by one   ♫

757
00:58:51,550 --> 00:59:00,550
♫   But why am I standing here?   ♫

758
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:09,530
♫   That sunset is waking me up   ♫

759
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:13,550
♫   The night is   ♫

760
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:25,820
♫  You are coming toward me again  ♫  

761
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,750
That hyung doesn't really know you.

762
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:49,650
♬  I am thrilled that you are in front of me again.  ♬

763
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,340
Forget it.

764
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,610
You're a warm person.

765
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,840
You're a good person, Noona.

766
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:25,420
 Winter two years ago 

767
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,660
 Oh Bo Ra's coming. Bo Ra, has school ended? 

768
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,790
 Hello. 

769
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,520
 You should go in. Your mom is probably inside. 

770
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,630
 Okay. 

771
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,790
 Hey, you should just cry. 

772
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,510
 Don't hold it in, just cry. 

773
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:07,690
 Times like this, you just cry, Seon Woo. 

774
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:13,630
 It's okay, you can cry. 

775
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:50,600
 Hey, something is falling. 

776
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:00,580
 Seon Woo, it's raining. Let's go inside. 

777
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,210
 I really hate getting hit by rain. 

778
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:10,020
 Noona, why is your hand so cold? 

779
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,200
 Because my heart is warm. 

780
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,510
 When your heart is warm, your hands are cold. 

781
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,460
 Let's go. 

782
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:45,280
 German Bakery 

783
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,460
Coffee.

784
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,340
What about yours?

785
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,590
I only have 100 won.

786
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,920
Excuse me, Seon Woo...

787
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,330
I won't tell anyone else.

788
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,710
Do you do mind reading?

789
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,580
I have a lot of interest.

790
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:14,540
Hey. I'm not in the mood for that.

791
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,470
But why is your hand like that?

792
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:33,460
Ah. I fell.

793
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:37,950
Aigoo, you have big body but your actions are...

794
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,520
It doesn't hurt?

795
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,580
I'm going to go first.

796
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,880
Aigoo, you're working hard. My child...

797
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,630
Deok Seon!

798
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,120
Mom!

799
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,350
Yeah, yeah. Are you hurt anywhere?

800
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:50,630
Oh my, my child. What's with your face?

801
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:53,400
Aigoo, how much could it have hurt?

802
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,180
Who did it? Who is it?

803
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,920
Did you do it? Did you hit my daughter?

804
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,300
I got hit too, Ahjumma.

805
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,670
How dare you glare at an adult?

806
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,140
What are you doing there?

807
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,170
She's No Eul's girlfriend. He's crazy.

808
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,650
What? Seong No Eul!

809
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:20,480
Aigoo, look at that girl's hair.

810
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,950
Who would say that she's a high school student?

811
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:25,390
It's none of your business.

812
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:28,640
Aigoo, it's the end of the world! What's the world coming to?

813
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,650
How did you receive family education?

814
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:37,330
Excuse me, can't I go now? I have to feed my children.

815
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:39,550
- I'm hungry, Mom. 
 - You're hungry, right?

816
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:41,180
That's student's parent have to come.

817
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:45,610
You can take them when both children's parents come and sign here.

818
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,740
Oh my. Look at her mom's state.

819
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,460
I guess she's her stepmother. Her stepmother.

820
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,390
I'm sorry. I finished work right now.

821
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:02,260
I'm sorry. I'm Soo Gyeong's guardian.

822
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:05,770
What's you're relationship with her?

823
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:07,650
I'm Soo Gyeong's unni.

824
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,460
What about her parent?

825
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:15,170
Her parent died last year in a car accident. She lives with me.

826
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:21,450
Ah, yes... You don't need to worry too much because it's  just a fight with students.

827
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:23,440
Sign here and take her.

828
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,360
Yes.

829
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,970
I'm sorry.

830
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,460
Get up.

831
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:43,280
I'm really sorry. I should have taught her well. I'm really sorry.

832
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,820
No, no. We're sorry.

833
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:51,040
She's usually a kind kid but after her mom and dad died suddenly last year in a car accident,

834
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,350
she can't control her heart.

835
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:57,180
She's really a kind kid. She's not like this in the inside.

836
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,890
What are you saying? Stop.

837
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,990
Aren't you gong to be quiet? What did you do right? Hurry up and apologize.

838
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:05,440
- I don't want to. 
 - Hey!

839
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,590
Aigoo. It's okay. Our child did nothing right.

840
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:13,260
Aigoo, I didn't know anything and because your hair was red,

841
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,910
so I thought you played a lot.

842
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:20,010
My hair? I attend a beauty academy these days.

843
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:23,280
It's training period so my hair and make up are a bit flashy.

844
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,500
I'm sorry.

845
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,730
I should learn at least.

846
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,110
I didn't know anything.

847
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:34,160
I'm sorry.

848
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,880
Aigoo, really her unni is really nice.

849
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:43,220
Since she has a older sister, you two just need to live well.

850
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:50,090
Who is it? Who hit my precious daughter?! Who is it?!

851
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:55,560
Deok Seon, are you alright?

852
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,770
Oh my.

853
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,930
Seeing your two heads,

854
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:07,810
You two did it right? You two did it.

855
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:13,480
From seeing your state, you look like you won't listen to words well.

856
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,180
From where did two girls learn wrong things and hit someone else's daughters?

857
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,750
Huh? Are you gangsters? Are you a gang?

858
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,720
Did you parents teach you to act like that?

859
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:28,240
Or do your parents know that you do these things?

860
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,370
These kids...

861
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:35,210
Honey, when did you come here?

862
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:38,950
I guess these two parents didn't come yet.

863
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:44,050
I'm wondering why they're parents are doing nothing when their children are acting like this.

864
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,770
Hurry up and shut your mouth! It's so noisy!

865
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:50,350
End of formal speech.

866
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:53,830
Their parents died from a car accident last year.

867
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:57,630
She's the older sister and her hair is like that because she learns cosmetology.

868
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:59,770
They said that Deok Seon started the fight.

869
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:03,660
Why are you rambling on so much when you don't know anything?

870
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,600
What do you mean, rambling on?

871
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,850
What else? When you get excited, you just go crazy without deciphering the facts!

872
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,090
Oh, geez! What do you mean "rambling on" to your husband!

873
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:14,620
To embarrass your husband in front of other people,

874
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,250
will that make you happy, huh?

875
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,480
Should we have a second round in the police station?

876
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,620
Aigoo, really!

877
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,370
 Please be quiet there! 

878
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:25,440
What are you doing in front of kids?!

879
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,680
I understand.

880
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,060
I'm sorry.

881
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,150
Excuse me, Father. I'm really sorry.

882
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:33,630
I will teach her well from now on.

883
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:35,550
I'm really sorry.

884
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:44,220
No, no. No. I didn't know anything. I'm sorry.

885
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:49,040
You bastard! What did you do when your noona was fighting?

886
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,130
Who is this police station's chief?

887
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:58,910
Chief, come here!

888
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:01,820
I am the Ssangmoondong High School's head teacher.

889
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:07,070
I heard the news that the student Seong Deok Seon applied group violence on some strange kids.

890
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:11,170
I came here to make her an example of justice for our society.

891
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:14,840
What is this? Who called Do Ryong Nyong's father?

892
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,010
I was worried while coming from the bank,

893
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,480
so I asked Do Ryong Nyong's father because he knew some people in law.

894
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,240
I can't live.

895
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,550
I can already see that they're dressed inappropriately with inappropriate hairstyles. Beating and show of violence—

896
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:36,010
At this rate, we have more than enough to put them in juvenile detention.

897
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:37,970
 Don't do it. Don't do it. 

898
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:42,110
Student, your life is over now. Over.

899
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:43,220
 Please stop. 

900
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,540
You will be expelled from the school of course.

901
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,230
Deok Seon's father, you don't have to worry.

902
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:53,040
I brought a prosecutor.

903
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,620
He's my friend, Prosecutor Kim.

904
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,870
Hello.

905
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:00,600
Oh... Prosecutor...

906
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:06,240
Chief Police come out! I will talk one on one with the chief of police.

907
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,240
You two are dead today.

908
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:14,200
Please stop this nonsense! Please!

909
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,760
I'm sorry.

910
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,510
Please excuse me.

911
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:28,630
Then we will...

912
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:36,700
Wait, wait. Prosecutor, thank you for personally coming here.

913
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,320
He's not a prosecutor.

914
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,680
He's our drill teacher.

915
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,900
His name is Kim Kum Sa.
(Kum Sa means prosecutor in Korean)

916
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,570
Your younger brother is Kim Pan Sa, right?
(Pan Sa means judge in Korean)

917
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,260
What was your younger sister's name again?

918
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:56,050
Kim Jip Sa. 
 (Jip Sa means steward in Korea)

919
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:59,000
Then we will leave now.

920
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,280
Geez, everyone in the family has names relating to law.

921
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:13,660
I was wondering who Do Ryong Nyong took after—he takes after his father.

922
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:18,060
- I'm hungry. 
 - Me too.

923
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:22,380
You're hungry right? I made some fermented bean stew at home.

924
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:30,810
Then we will also leave...

925
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,850
Eat before you leave.

926
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:37,320
My house is near here. You should eat dinner with us and go.

927
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,220
Forget it. I'm not going to eat it.

928
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:42,350
Hey, stop acting haughty and follow.

929
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:44,770
I'm going to die of hunger.

930
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,050
Let's see.

931
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:51,040
There's not much side dishes, right?

932
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,690
No. It tastes really good.

933
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:57,220
It's been since I've had this kind of meal. I've just been eating ramyun.

934
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:11,440
Hey. What are you doing?

935
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,570
I understand.

936
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,150
Hey. What did you use for your hair?

937
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:20,540
This?

938
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,210
- I don't think it's beer. 
 - Hydrogen peroxide.

939
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:25,820
Hydrogen peroxide? If you use that it doesn't get that kind of color.

940
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:28,270
Three times. You have take it out and put back in three times.

941
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:31,490
And one hour in the sun.

942
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,550
Girl, you must be crazy.

943
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:38,030
Properly do something to your hair color!

944
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:41,400
Or else I'll just shave it all off and send you to a Buddhist temple.

945
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,410
Why are you only like this to me?

946
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:47,860
And you Soo Gyeong, what's with your hair?

947
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,440
You have your beautiful hair your parents gave you.

948
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,750
Why are you going crazy taking it in and out of chemicals?

949
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:58,310
And erase your make up. Ghost-like make up.

950
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:01,450
Wear clothes nicely like a student.

951
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:06,340
I'm going to check every week. Understand?

952
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,390
Yes.

953
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,760
I should wash up.

954
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,510
Excuse me. Please give me more rice.

955
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:22,320
Okay. I'll get it. 
 - No, I'll get it. 
 - No, no.

956
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,870
But, hey, why do you like No Eul?

957
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:35,090
- Noona! 
 - Stay still.

958
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:38,370
You can date a lot of good guys with your looks.

959
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,860
You have really low standards.

960
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,910
It's my first.

961
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,000
What? What is your first?

962
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,750
Person telling me to not smoke.

963
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:57,210
He's the first person to tell me not to smoke.

964
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:08,540
After my parents passed away yesterday, people kept on telling positive things to me.

965
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:13,900
Saying, "It's okay.", "All is good.", "I did everything well."

966
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:20,470
But No Eul was the first person to sincerely get mad and angry at me.

967
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:26,040
I was really thankful.

968

970
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:51,690
Honey. Go sign the surgery consent form.

971
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,820
Let's go together.

972
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:57,340
Why should two go? Go alone.

973
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,650
I understand.

974
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,840
Hurry up and sleep. Tomorrow morning is surgery.

975
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,830
I can't fall asleep.

976
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,170
Why can't you fall asleep?

977
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:18,590
Are you scared?

978
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:22,020
A little.

979
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:30,260
Jeong Bong. I asked all the nurses here today

980
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:34,480
if there is a chance that it might fail.

981
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,870
They said that there's none. It's true.

982
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:39,860
Did you ever see me lie?

983
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:47,710
And I ate marinated ribs for dinner outside.

984
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:51,850
Do you think I would eat out with Dad if I was worried?

985
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:56,820
Dad and I aren't worried a single bit.

986
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,490
So don't worry.

987
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:09,420
Hurry up and sleep. Okay?

988
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,220
Why is my son like this?

989
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:18,030
You got over the big surgery well.

990
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:27,160
Mom is a strong person.

991
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:35,040
Mom is a strong person, but

992
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:39,240
your son has a weak body

993
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:42,210
and a weak heart.

Do you know how strong you are because you resemble me?

997
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:58,750
Do you think anyone wins that hard surgery?

998
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:05,040
Jeong Bong, that is something great.

999
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:12,150
You are a stronger and greater person than I.

01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:34,050
It's okay. Noona, hurry up and give me red ginseng.

1110
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:37,490
I just parked the car outside and came. Noona, where are you going?

1111
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,640
Who is it? Lead me.

1112
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:42,090
How can they make your foot like this?

1113
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,310
Please, Noona...

1114
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:47,480
Am I kid? Cool your temper.

1115
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,090
How can you become worse than Big Noona as time goes by?

1116
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:54,360
Are you really okay?

1117
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,960
Do we have to go to the hospital?

1118
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,970
Of course we have to go. He needs to have surgery.

1119
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:02,310
If it's this much, it'll heal in three hours.

1120
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:05,010
Do you still think I'm a seventeen year old high school student?

1121
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:07,550
I'm turning forty-four this year.

1122
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:12,150
In my eyes, you're always a high school student. Understand?

1123
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:15,810
Okay, Noona. How can you look old?

1124
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:18,040
You're just like you were before.

1125
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,860
How can you continue to look older?

1126
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:23,520
Now he looks his age.

1127
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,840
It took me ten years to talk informally to him.

1128
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,750
Shut up. Why are you being so sarcastic?

1129
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,920
What sarcasm? I'm telling the truth.

1130
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,560
Be quiet. The kid will hear.

1131
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,290
I heard it all.

1132
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:38,040
Don't listen to bad things.

1133
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:41,450
Only listen to good things.

1134
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:43,670
I don't hear it. I don't hear it.

1135
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:45,600
 I don't seen Jeong Bong these days. Did he go somewhere? 

1136
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,920
 To a temple? Why? Is he hurt again? 

1137
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:53,180
  Oh, my goodness... That girl has no fear.  

1138
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:56,730
 Noona will be okay, right? 

1139
01:28:56,730 --> 01:28:58,910
♫   Toward you   ♫

1140
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:01,670
 To whom are you speaking informally? Do you know me? 

1141
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,220
 Hello? Who is this? 

1142
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:09,470
 Noona, are you okay? 

1143
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:15,560
 Is there an order to dying? 

1144
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:20,280
 What is this? What should I do? What is this? 

1145
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:24,350
 The world is so unfair. 

1146
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:26,330
 She said she'd raise them. 

1147
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:29,390
 How will we live? 

1148
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:31,530
 Then eat with us at our house. 

1149
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:33,210
 Okay. Give it to me. 

1150
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,830
 Taek likes Deok Seon. 

1151
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:38,110
 It'll need to go well. 

1152
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:42,510
 Wow. So you're saying it's first love, right? 

1153
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:46,360
 How could you live without me? 

1154
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,970
 Taek! 

1155
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:56,950
♫  It's only life you can feel  ♫
