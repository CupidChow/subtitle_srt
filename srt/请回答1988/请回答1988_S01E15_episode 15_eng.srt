00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,920
Ahjussi, do you know how to play baseball?

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,030
Yeah. I can play a little bit.

5
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,580
Then, will you play a little while with me?

6
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,870
Okay.

7
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,600
I'll be at the vacant lot in the front.

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,370
Okay.

9
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,920
Hey.

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,620
- Bo Ra. Bring the younger kids over and have lunch today at my house. 
 - Excuse me?

11
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,010
We're sick of making meals, so moms are planning to protest.

12
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,920
It's been a while, so all the moms are planning to eat out.

13
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,570
So, gather all the kids and feed them lunch.

14
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,690
It's not like one or two kids... I think they can feed themselves.

15
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,340
Mother, don't worry.

16
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,250
What is there to worry about when you have your eldest son here?

17
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,820
Then, fine. You feed them. I'll leave some money.

18
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,930
Okay

19
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,050
Is there good news?

20
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,530
No.

21
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,710
You're dating someone aren't you?

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,300
No.

23
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,310
You can't lie.

24
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,740
Look directly at me and tell me.

25
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,640
You're dating someone, right?

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,580
I'm not. I'm definitely not.

27
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,220
It's all written all over your eyes.

28
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,420
Mr. Kim Jeong Bong. Do well.

29
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,640
Good luck, Oppa.

30
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,090
Oh my, oh my, Kim Jung Yeol.  
 (reference to comedian Kim Jung Yeol)

31
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,020
You're dating someone? Congratulations.

32
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,460
I'm going to the office.

33
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,640
I left you some money so go out to eat.

34
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,630
Yes.

35
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,230
If not, order black bean noodle for dinner.

36
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,490
Okay.

37
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,140
I ate black bean noodle yesterday though.

38
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,540
Hey, Dong Ryeong, did you perhaps hear everything?

39
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,300
Yes.

40
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,610
From, "Mother, don't worry," to the end. I heard everything.

41
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,950
I thought so from start and sure enough you have great hearing.

42
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,380
Of course, Hyungnim. Thank you.

43
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,420
I hear that occasionally, Hyungnim.

44
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,910
It's a secret.

45
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,210
Yes, it's a secret.

46
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,480
Hyungnim, I'll see you at your place for lunch.

47
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,810
Bo Ra, pass me dad's white shirt.

48
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,860
Mom, throw this away. The neck is all worn out.

49
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,920
I see. With dad's paycheck this month, I better buy him a white shirt.

50
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,660
Bo Ra, lift your butt.

51
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,950
Oh my. It turned out well, better than ironing it.

52
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,710
Bo Ra, your temp job, next week is your last week, right?

53
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,100
Did you speak to your sunbae?

54
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,990
Yeah, he said it's okay. He's a good friend.

55
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,510
Good.

56
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,490
For me lately, it's alright even if I have to beg on the street.

57
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,410
I feel like I'm flying.

58
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,200
 No Eul can you leave for a second? I have to tell Mom and Dad something. 

59
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,790
 I'll start studying for the bar exam. 

60
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,990
 Bo Ra, you made the right decision. 

61
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,210
 Still, I made a promise about the temp job, so I'm going to work for one month. 

62
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,050
 I have to give them some time to find someone else. 

63
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,990
 Of course you have to do that. 

64
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,290
 Then, you'll work temporarily for just one month, 

65
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:16,100
 and then you'll earnestly study and prepare for the bar exam, right? 

66
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,550
 Okay Bo Ra. From now on, don't worry about anything else. 

67
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,710
 After you're done with the temp job, then all you have to do is focus on your studies. 

68
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,720
 Don't worry aboaut money and don't be concerned about anything. 

69
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,150
 Your mom and dad can support you. 

70
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:35,140
 You can't worry about anything else, okay? 

71
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,700
 Also, can you keep it a secret for a while? 

72
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,410
 To my siblings and other people. It's burdensome. 

73
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,210
 Okay, okay 

74
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,560
 Until you're finished with the temp job and start studying , 

75
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,650
 we won't tell anyone. Our mouths are shut. Don't worry about that. 

76
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,190
 Yeah, don't worry. 

77
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,500
 Bo Ra, you really made the right decision. 

78
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,600
 You thought... That's right, you thought wisely. 

79
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,470
Yeah, you can just put it on like that.

80
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,650
You must really not exercise much.

81
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,360
It's not that, Seon Woo, but to be honest, I...

82
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,690
Okay, I'll throw it softly. I'll think you're Jin Joo.

83
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,480
It's okay here, right?

84
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,020
That's not it. We're a bit too close.

85
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,020
You can't close your eyes, sir.

86
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,080
Ahjussi, you seem to have some athletic ability.

87
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,620
Still, this is a bit of a short distance.

88
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,450
Still, can you throw the ball from there?

89
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,920
But you're too close.

90
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,940
This far?

91
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,550
A little more would be better.

92
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,680
Here? It's too far though.

93
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,420
- I'm throwing it. 
 - Yes.

94
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,100
Ahjussi, it looks like you've watched a lot of pro games.

95
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,420
Strike.

96
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,930
Jin Joo. Have fun playing with Ahjussi.

97
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,040
I'm going shopping. I'll bring you your favorite, Pul bread.

98
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,060
You're here?

99
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,710
- You're eating lunch now? 
- Yeah.

100
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,990
I was going to just eat light.

101
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,200
- But, you didn't go shopping yet? 
 - I'm going now.

102
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,120
Jin Joo already ate. You don't have to feed her.

103
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,250
Okay. Go buy some yummy stuff and have fun.

104
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,720
You didn't get to have any leisure time because you were working at the bath house.

105
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,180
What's this? You don't have soup?

106
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,350
I like Kimchee. Kimchee's good enough.

107
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,410
A patient can't eat like this.

108
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,080
Is there anything you want to eat? I can get it.

109
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,480
I'll buy it since I'm going to market.

110
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,970
Something I want to eat?

111
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,220
Lately, I really want that.

112
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,010
What?

113
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,720
Stuffed cucumber pickles.

114
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,140
Geez, your taste buds are countrified.

115
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,310
If there are good cucumbers to be had I'll buy some.

116
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,980
Okay.

117
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,790
Was it fun?

118
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,740
Yeah.

119
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,350
He's so different frow what I thought. I thought my arm was going to fall off.

120
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,140
How opposite.

121
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,730
Later, at the street vendor—

122
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,380
- Hey Dongg Ryong! 
- Be quiet.

123
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,170
Why don't you eat at home?

124
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,520
I don't want to eat.

125
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,000
Something smells good here.

126
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,130
From this house...

127
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,230
Sorry.

128
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,760
I'm going.

129
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,100
Let's go.

130
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,040
I said I don't want to eat!

131
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,860
Of course you're going to eat, why wouldn't you eat?

132
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,050
I'm not eating!

133
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,840
Hyung! Its not finished yet?

134
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,120
Do you need help?

135
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,550
Ten more seconds.

136
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,330
Weren't we going to eat black bean noodle?

137
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,390
Right?

138
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,220
I was tired of black bean noodle so I asked him for something else.

139
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,640
Who are you that he would do that?

140
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,060
Do you know what's most important in our modern time?

141
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,250
Information. You see, I have it.

142
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,010
Information can be seen as most important in the current liberalization era.

143
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,170
That has direct connection with money.

144
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,380
Hey.

145
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,730
You can't have it even if you have money, and have it without.

146
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,670
Hey!

147
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,170
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,320
Let's eat quietly. Got it?

149
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,210
Put something down. Put something down.

150
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,420
Wow, it looks delicious.

151
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,580
Its kimchi fried rice.

152
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,710
I thought it would be something better.

153
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,020
But is this enough? It looks like it's not enough.

154
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,050
Put something down. Put something down. Put something down.

155
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,850
Here. Now everyone, enjoy.

156
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,230
How are we going to eat all of this?

157
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,850
It looks good.

158
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,880
Hyung, you know how to make kimchi fried rice?

159
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,610
Of course

160
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,620
Everyone makes kimchi fried rice. This is the only thing even my father knows how to make.

161
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,270
Anyway, I'll eat well, Oppa.

162
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,680
Thank you.

163
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,380
Dong Ryeong, is there anything else you want to eat?

164
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,830
No ,there isn't.

165
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,690
I like everything if it's not ordered.

166
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,020
But, where did Jeong Pal go?

167
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,380
To borrow a video.

168
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,370
I told him to rent Amadeus.

169
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,660
I'm here.

170
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,100
Is today a holiday, too?

171
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,470
Come quickly and sit down. Your Hyung is Captain Cook. It's delicious.

172
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,450
- Hyung, hurry up and sit. It'll get cold. 
 - Brother, come sit.

173
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,940
Sit down.

174
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,320
Will you sit when the roof falls down? Quickly sit down.

175
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,810


176
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,970
Taek went to the club today, too?

177
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,890
The Tong Yang Cup started and next week is the Eung Ssi Cup play-off among three countries.

178
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,010
It's for a five-round so if he wins this time, he wins.

179
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,350
What's five-round?

180
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,420
Hey.

181
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,330
When you take that off I'll tell you.

182
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,390
What is that?

183
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,020
Master Choi's ardent fans.

184
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,390
People whose wish is to play one round of baduk with Master Choi.

185
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,910
Wow, Master Choi would never do it though.

186
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,170
Right?

187
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,910
It'll be good just to get a word out of him.

188
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,630
Hello?

189
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,640
PD Choi?

190
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,870
 Hey, what's with PD Choi? 

191
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,150
 Junior sir. 

192
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:15,170
 Please rescue this senior once.  I must interview 6-dan Choi Taek  this time. You know him well. 

193
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,920
Sunbae, I would ask him if I could.

194
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,570
Sunbae, 6-dan Choi Taek really doesn't do these kinds of things.

195
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,580
 But still ask him just this once! 

196
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,970
He hates asking and being asked.

197
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,920
He really only cares about baduk.

198
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,540
Yes, but don't get your hopes up.

199
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,890
Yes.

200
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,730
Okay.

201
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,590
PD Choi of UBS?

202
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,040
Yeah.

203
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,240
Yeah, but this Sunbae has helped the Baduk Club a lot.

204
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,640
Last year, the championship series was thanks to him too.

205
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,720
Ugh, I really need to help him though.

206
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,870
Six-dan Choi Taek  will never do it.

207
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,190
If I had put this stone over here, maybe I wouldn't have lost?

208
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,620
Yes.

209
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,440
How is the situation?

210
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,530
I think the black is more advantageous.

211
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,310
I thought I had the advantage.

212
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,360
 Market Noodle Shop 

213
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,600
Let's go.

214
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,910
Hello.

215
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,160
Three noodles for us.

216
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,220
♫   When we first fell in love   ♫

217
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,880
♫  He was a tough man  ♫

218
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,360
It's pretty.  It was good that you bought it.  But how did you get the idea of buying pajamas for Jeong Bong's dad?

219
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,690
I hate seeing him going around naked.

220
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,660
Oh that's enough! That's way too much.

221
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,730
That's enough! That's too much.

222
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,240
Oh, do you even have any left?

223
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,250
Give us some kimchi as well please.

224
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,610
That kid's a bother.

225
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,400
How are you going to go and put in the seasonings?

226
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,070
Bo Ra's father likes it and Bo Ra likes it too.

227
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,690
You do it once and it feeds them many days.

228
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,740
What about the chives?

229
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,660
Did you pick the chives?

230
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,150
It's a bother.  Hurts my arms.

231
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,100
It's going to take forever.

232
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,420
I'll just say we don't have it.

233
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,020
He believes it when I say that.

234
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,930
What about you, Seon Yeong?  Why did you buy so many cucumbers?

235
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,020
To make cucumber kimchi?

236
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,390
Yes, Hyungnim.  I miss eating it.

237
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,500
Halmoni, you made the anchovy broth well today.  It's delicious.

238
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Thank you

239
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,200
Today's broth flavor is to die for.

240
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,260
How much is it?

241
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,200
No, I'll pay for it,

242
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,820
I have some money now.

243
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,190
Then I'll buy the vending machine coffee as the youngest.

244
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,200
It's okay. Just do it later.

245
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,550
Keep the change.

246
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,150
No, you can't every single time.

247
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,670
Take the change.

248
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,040
No, we each ate a thousand won full.

249
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,980
We ate a lot.

250
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,800
This will do then, right?

251
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,040
Bye.

252
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,750
 - Episode 15 - 
 Between Love and Friendship 

253
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,970
Bo Ra, Soo Yeon, and No Eul! Remove the blankets. Meals are  ready.

254
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,330
What the heck? Why didn't you call my name?

255
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,100
Dong Il! Let's eat!

256
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,570
Yeah. Shit.

257
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,450
All of you come out!

258
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,390
Leap out on the count of three.  One.

259
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,040
I'm here.

260
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,690
I'm here.

261
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,530
Jeong Hwan, give out the spoons.

262
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,270
Mom, I want a younger sibling.

263
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,750
Shut up.

264
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,150
Let's do it.  It's Jeong Hwan's wish.

265
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,390
Chopsticks, quickly.

266
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,170
I need a younger sibling.

267
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,450
Kimchi stew is well cooked.

268
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,110
It looks good. Mom, you eat too.

269
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,950
Okay.

270
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,670
Didn't you say you'd make cucumber kimchi?

271
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,760
I washed them already.  I'll pickle them tomorrow.

272
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,860
You know,

273
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,670
we should ask Ahjussi to come. Taek is probably coming home late.

274
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,300
Why? Taek's dad is fine eating alone.

275
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,200
That many apartments are being built, why isn't there one for us?

276
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,540
Dad, when are we moving? I want to live in an apartment.

277
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,910
More than half of my friends live in apartment now.

278
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,680
Okay. Just wait a little.

279
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,620
Your dad is earning money diligently. I'm sorry.

280
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,830
Dad, it's okay. I'll make a lot of money later and buy you a house.

281
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,920
Believe in me. I'll buy it for you!

282
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,340
Hey, kid, just go to college.

283
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,900
If you fail to go to college even after changing your name, you will be dead by my hand.

284
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,350
Got it?

285
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,870
Gosh. What's big deal with just not going to college?

286
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:36,600
Our Soo Yeon is pretty, smart, and kind.

287
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:48,270
Ha. Tomorrow is our Soo Yeon's counselling for entering college.

288
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,490
What, are you having counseling already?

289
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,370
Usually they have it as soon as you enter senior year.

290
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,740
Don't fret about tomorrow, Mom. About her grades.

291
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,630
- Hey! 
- Hey?

292
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,150
This little...

293
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,570
Gosh. Don't say there won't be at least one college for our Soo Yeon.

294
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,620
For me, all  I wish for is one good place.

295
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,040
Don't expect any college at all, Mom.

296
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,490
Hey!

297
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,870
Thank you for the meal. I'm going outside for a while to get some fresh air.

298
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,570
That is Soo Yeon's biggest strength. Even if she is a bit short on common sense.

299
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:30,230
Even so as she lives life,  people always feel good around her. And she's charming.

300
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,840
I'm jealous.

301
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,910
People like Deok Seon.

302
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,000
She's cute and always smiling.

303
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,720
Her charm is making people feel good. Yeah?

304
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,630
I don't have anything like that.

305
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,430
She kisses and hugs Dad without any holding back.

306
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,740
How can she do that?

307
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,780
Noona, you're not like that with your dad?

308
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,740
Never. I can never do that.

309
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,240
Noona, seems like you're not that close with your dad.

310
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,980
Did something happen before?

311
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,050
No.

312
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:21,160
Nothing of the kind.

313
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,660
Just... Probably due to my personality.

314
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,270
That's how my personality is.

315
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,050
After you started seeing me, you have suffered a lot.

316
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,870
I like you, Noona.

317
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,630
I think your personality is also better than Soo Yeon's.

318
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,030
I am really crazy, huh?

319
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,590
Yes, did you drink?

320
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,220
Honey... I said it would be a few dollars out  of my salary   but since you started saving you can't stop studying it.

321
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,500
Savings are savings.

322
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,870
Why not? Isn't it great to be able to save money like this?

323
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,890
In my lifetime, I get to put away 80,000 won a month into an installment savings account.

324
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:21,950
Wow! My struggles are over now! Over!

325
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,060
Oh, yeah.. Honey, this one has the highest interest, right?

326
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,240
I told you yes. How many times do I have to tell you?

327
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,820
That one has the highest interest of 17% in our bank.

328
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,370
But Honey... You're okay with Bo Ra, right?

329
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,970
What are you talking about?

330
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,550
I see that you two aren't close at all.

331
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,040
I was wondering if you two had a huge fight I don't know about.

332
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,350
What bullshit! What's there to fight between a parent and child?

333
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:14,440
No, no... She's so different with you compared to how it is with Soo Yeon or No Eul.

334
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,790
Well, I guess... Bo Ra was always a little different since she's the oldest.

335
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,500
Hey, stop saying nonsense!

336
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,620
I'm very close and friendly with Bo Ra. She's my oldest daughter!

337
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,780
What nonsense you speak...

338
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,140
You'll ruin your ears, dork. Listen!

339
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,800
What nonsense...

340
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:45,880
Mochi! Buckwheat jelly!

341
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,270
Mochi!

342
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,730
Go home.

343
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,020
Noona, good night!

344
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,500
Seon Woo!

345
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,620
Should we go out next Sunday?

346
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,580
Maybe we should grab some Vienna coffee that's so popular these days.

347
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,960
Why are you doing this? You're making me nervous.

348
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,180
Forget it if you don't want to.

349
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,690
Keep your promise, okay?

350
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,300
Geez, who is it at this hour?

351
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,940
- Hello? 
 - What?

352
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,020
Crazy bastard. Okay.

353
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,500
It hurts.

354
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,020
Be quiet. Ahjussi will wake up.

355
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,710
Did you get beat up? Did a thug beat you up?

356
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,980
This bastard is now riding a motorcycle.

357
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,430
What? Are you crazy?

358
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,630
Be quiet!

359
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,670
I told you not to follow Michael.

360
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,020
He's an expert. He rode his motorcycle from his freshman year.

361
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,970
Why are you—

362
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,480
being rebellious as an older kid?

363
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,400
How are you going to go home?

364
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,070
Even if Taek comes home late tonight, he'll stay up all night because of his match.

365
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,260
You can't sleep here.

366
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,000
Like this, like this... Ouch...

367
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:56,240
I can go home like this.

368
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,810
Hey, don't you know my family? They're all sleeping right now.

369
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,580
As long as I don't get caught in the morning.

370
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,880
Hey, isn't your mom really scary when she gets mad?

371
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,550
Manager Jo is very busy. I think she'll go up to be a president. Isn't she amazing?

372
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:18,530
Wow, I'm thrilled... Wow, so great...

373
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,710


374
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,560
Hey, Jeong Pal!

375
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,010
Taek will be coming home, anyway,  so just leave the light on.

376
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,540
Did you come here dressed like that?

377
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,550
I live so close.

378
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,820
Let's go.

379
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,160
Soo Yeon, go to Taek's place.

380
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,830
Okay.

381
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,160
Good morning, Ahjussi. Clams.

382
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,910
Oh, okay. Thank you.

383
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,810
Ahjussi, where's Taek? He came home late yesterday, right?

384
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,500
Right. He came early in the morning.

385
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,090
Really? He can play soccer well too?

386
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,890
Yes! There's no sport Taek's father can't play.

387
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,960
He looks like a bear, but...

388
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,200
He plays basketball, wrestling, and baseball. He plays all of them very well.

389
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,980
Then what did I do?

390
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,550
Why didn't he tell me?

391
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,440
He probably wanted to tell you.

392
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,980
He probably couldn't quite get it out.

393
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,830
Seon Woo, don't you ever make a bet with Taek's father by any chance.

394
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,520
He's extremely competitive.

395
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,260
Who do you think Taek takes after?

396
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,420
He's just like his dad.

397
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:23,160
Mom, I think Ahjussi is a nice person.

398
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,060
What?

399
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,680
Just... I like Ahjussi.

400
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,810
What has it to do with me?

401
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,990
Why are you saying that?

402
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,040
Nothing, Mom.   I will get going.

403
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,090
Jin Joo. Oppa is leaving.

404
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,980
I'll go to school.

405
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,710
Soo Yeon, it's 2 p.m. today, right?

406
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:22,320
Ah, geez... The name "Soo Yeon" is lasting quite a while now.

407
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,610
If we keep going like this, we'll forget our daughter's name 'Deok Seon.'

408
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,210
I won't give up.

409
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:31,200
Soo Yeon, I should go to the career center, right?

410
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,410
Yes, Mother.

411
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,830
Then, I'll get going now..

412
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,140
I'll go too.

413
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,020
Okay.

414
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,880
Honey, today is your last day to wear that shirt.

415
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,060
The collar is all worn out.

416
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,450
What will other people say?

417
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,320
Who'd check out an old man like me? Besides, like this...

418
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,710
I can go around like this. Look.

419
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,570
Like this.

420
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,650
I'm leaving.

421
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,820
Hello?

422
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,550
Is anyone home?

423
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,780
Nobody's here, but I'll go to school.

424
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,200
Wang Ja Yeon. You're the next. Your parents are here.

425
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,440
Next, Yoo Hae Eun.

426
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,960
Seong Soo Yeon, it's your turn.

427
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,110
Oh, yeah! Math, Social Studies, Physics, English, Korean, Math, Social Studies, P.E.!

428
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,630
P.E., oh, yeah! Hey.

429
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,660
What're you doing? You're not changing?

430
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,560
  Study Session  

431
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,400
  103 Universities nationwide entrance guideline 1989  

432
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,870
Teacher, I...

433
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,470
I don't even want a good college.

434
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:17,040
Just a four year college, any college will be fine.

435
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,330
Me and Soo Yeon's father, too,

436
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,170
we're not aiming high.

437
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,710
With Soo Yeon's current grades...

438
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,320
Even a four year college will be difficult, too.

439
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,270
Aigoo...

440
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,580
With her current grades, a four year college would be risky and...

441
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:46,810
You shouldn't even expect a college in Seoul.

442
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,280
Y-Yes...

443
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,820
Soo Yeon's mother, we still have one year...

444
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,280
So still, from now on, if she studies very hard, there will be hope.

445
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,330
It depends on how she does from now on.

446
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,960
Wow, there are 400 students who are ranked below Soo Yeon.

447
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,500
I'll pay more attention to her.

448
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,210
Go in. I'm heading out.

449
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,280
Go in, and study.

Okay.

469
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,240
Master Choi!

470
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,970
Yes.

471
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,380
I wouldn't usually ask, but

472
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:53,480
there's PD Choi Dae Ho from UBS who helps us out quite a bit.

473
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,950
Master Choi, let's do simply one thirty minute interview.

474
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,780
Without a camera, just an interview.

475
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,950
He won't ask you about anything else but Go.

476
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,650
Please, huh?

477
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,530
The winner should.

478
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,800
I was a little late, wasn't I?

479
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,070
Did something happen?

480
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,280
Someone stole my purse on my way home.

481
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,890
You know the hill in front of the barber at the three way street?

482
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,110
I was walking up the hill,

483
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,290
and all of a sudden, a motorcycle came down.

484
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:41,170
He snatched the bag I was holding.

485
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:47,060
I thought my arm was going to fall off at first.

486
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,280
Did you get hurt? Is your arm okay?

487
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,860
I'm fine.

488
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,590
I'm just shocked, but I didn't get hurt.

489
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,080
I walk on that street all the time. How am I going to walk around being scared from now on?

490
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,090
Gosh, geez...

491
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,990
Where's JIn Joo? Is she sleeping?

492
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,560
I'll bring her.

493
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,610
No, I'll bring her.

494
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:15,190
No, no. I'll bring her. It's fine.

495
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,180
When you see it, looks like it'll melt.

496
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,320
You just be prepared, dork...

497
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,080
Noonim, hello.

498
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,200
Okay.

499
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,660
If you don't mind, can I ask where you're going this late at night?

500
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,840
Butt out!

501
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,300
We'll keep that in mind. Goodnight, Noonim.

502
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,660
You guys go first, I'll stop by Dooly.

503
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,340
Dooly is closed, isn't it?

504
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,330
Are you coming now?

505
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,970
Did you cause a problem again?

506
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,290
Mind your own business.

507
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,690
You...

508
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,570
Jeong Pal, I'll see Michael.

509
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,130
If the Dean or Manager Jo (his parents) look for me, tell them I'm at Taek's room.

510
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,940
I told you not to ride the motorcycle. You're not even good at it.

511
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,890
Do you even know the rough charm of riding the motorcycle, cutting the wind?

512
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,450
What are you saying? Wipe your runny nose.

513
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:34,880

514

♫   Will there be a season when you leave me again?   ♫

515

518

519

No.

520
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,920
Are you coming right now?

521
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,110
Do you have a headache again?

522
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,720
Did you lose today?

523
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,690
Why do you look so weak?

530
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,390
It's Saturday. She's leaving early.

531
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,220
Ahjussi, my mom said to eat this.

532
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,260
Okay.

533
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,350
Where's Taek? He's not sleeping, right?

534
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,600
Right. He's up.

535
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:39,030
- It's next week, right? The Eungssibae World Baduk Championship finals. 
- Yeah.

536
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,290
Is it over after you win three matches?

537
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,700
Then, is he going to confess to Deok Seon?

538
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,380
You're amazing.

539
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,260
Well, this is nothing.

540
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,820
Do you have time tomorrow?

541
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,280
Let's hang out with friends before you go to China. We haven't seen each other for a while.

542
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,120
How about at Blue Marble?

543
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,560
Okay ... Hey Seon Woo?

544
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,250
You don't go to school?

545
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:12,640
Oh right. I'm going.

546
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,910
  Dong Ah Prime English to Korean Dictionary  

547
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,870
What the heck? Is this really mine?

548
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:22,970
You don't want it?

549
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,430
Thank you, Noona.

550
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,190
Here is your allowance.

551
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:35,640
What the heck? Thanks.

552
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:42,500
Your sister got paid from her part-time job. Her first and last pay.

553
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,210
Why not? You're not going to work your part-time job?

554
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,900
You don't need to know.

555
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,260
This is for you.

556
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,380
Oh my. You bought something for me, too?

557
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,580
They are cheap.

558
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,980
Oh, we're late. Noona, we're late.

559
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,010
Okay.

560
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,630
I'll go to school.

561
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:09,980
- I'll go to school. 
 - Yes.

562
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,140
I too have to go. It's late. Bo Ra!

563
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:17,530
Dad is leaving, Dad...

564
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,350
See you later.

565
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,070
Today is Saturday. He can go to work late today.

566
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,330
- Mom? 
 - Yes, what?

567
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,250
I'm going to school.

568
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:41,270
Okay. Our Chan. You're working hard.

569
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,580
Don't you get up, don't you get up, don't you get up?

570
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,610
Please get out and do some exercise!

571
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:01,050
If you like this sofa so much, live with the sofa.

572
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,740
Okay, okay.

573
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,580


574
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,110
I should call Bo Ra's mother.

575
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,650
I heard Byeon Gang Shai (Korean Casanova) 3 came out...

576
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,530
 Mother, I am using the phone now. 

577
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,800
Okay.

578
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,970
  Ok 986-874 

579
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:54,570
  To Ok, the spring must be here already.  

580
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,430
  I see the haze afar  

581
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,910
  and frogs are singing in droves. 

582
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,490
 Miss Mi Ok, 

583
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:06,820
  if you have time, this Sunday at 2 p.m. at Banjul in Jongro,  

584
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,020
  at the cafe on the first floor,  

585
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,370
  I'd like to grab a cup of Vienna coffee with you.  

586
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,190
  Mi Ok, do you know this by chance?  

587
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,310
  Do you know this? Vienna is the capital of Austria,  

588
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:22,700
 but you are the capital of my heart.  

589
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,510
 Hello? 

590
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,330
Hello?

591
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,240
Who's this?

592
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,250
You should say something if you called. Hello?

593
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,360
Who the hell is making prank calls in the morning?

594
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,350
Oh man.

595
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,630
How old are you?

596
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,200
It's not me.

597
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,560
You think I'd do that?

598
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:20,290
So childish.

599
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,480
Why don't you grow up?

600
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,360
Do Ryong Nyong!

601
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,390
Stop it!

602
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,740
It's here.

603
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,660
Deok Seon! Deok Seon!

604
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,840
Oppa? What happened? Why are you running? Are you crazy?

605
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:48,760
Can you take this to your friend?

606
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,130
Okay. I'll do it. Oppa. Don't worry.

607
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,390
Ahjussi, wait a little please.

608
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,000
Ten seconds please.

609
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,030
I'll give it to her. So don't worry. Go home, Oppa.

610
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,870
Thank you.

611
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,350
Thank you, sir.

612
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:21,650
Soo Yeon, no Deok Seon! Now we can call you Deok Seon, right?

613
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,530
Do your legs hurt? Sit here.

614
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,520
Forget it. You sit down.

615
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,310
Okay. Thanks.

616
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,790
Have a seat here please.

617
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,880
No, no. Have a seat.

618
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,140
Student, give me your schoolbag.

619
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,750
You too.

620
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,970
Thank you.

621
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,230
It's Saturday today. Why are we going so early today?

622
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,090
Human rights of high school seniors! Give it back! Give it back!

623
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:10,360
Are we study machines? Are we?

624
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,230
Why don't you study first and say that?

625
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,720
You ruthless dork.

626
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,030
But still, it's nice and roomy. Better than about to explode with passengers.

627
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,360
Why don't you hold on?

628
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,180
Oh, okay.

629
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,750
Master Choi. He's here.

630
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,840
He's getting ready in the special competition room.

631
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,170
Stay here. When it's ready, I'll call you.

632
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:18,690
Just thirty minutes. I promise.

633
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:36,420
Jin Joo's here.

634
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,290
I rented "Young Goo and Ttang Chil 2."

635
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,990
You'll be late. Go!

636
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,290
Yes.

637
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:51,450
Why don't you not work on the weekends?

638
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:54,600
I get paid double on the weekends.

639
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,380
Besides, Seon Woo is now a senior student.

640
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,140
He's coming home late on Saturday, too.

641
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,070
Besides, there's a rumor that I'm a good worker.

642
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,800
People want me to come work for them here and there.

643
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,070
Working is good, but take care of your health.

644
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,550
Then, I'll get going, Oppa.

645
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,850
I thank you always.

646
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:20,050
Never mind.

647
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,230
Oh?

648
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:34,220
Hello.

649
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,070
What are you doing at night?

650
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,190
Exercising.

651
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,330
Aren't we at an age we should start exercising?

652
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,830
Taek's father, you should start exercising.

653
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,960
Your tummy is so soft.

654
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,950
Buy one of these. Do you how to use it?

655
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,630
I've never done it.

656
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,960
This may look easy...

657
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,210
But it's very hard.

658
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,720
You want to try?

659
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,080
Sure.

660
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,640
This...

661
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,270
Does this count as exercising?

662
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,990
Manager Lee, what happened?

663
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,330
They said they wouldn't take pictures.

664
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:02,740
Geez, why is he doing that?

665
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:06,870
From what I hear, you're very close to your father.

666
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,320
I heard your father cooks himself.

667
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,700
What is the best dish he makes? Huh?

668
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,400
What are you doing at night? Hurry up and come inside!

669
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:40,320
You'll get hurt! Do it when the sun comes up.

670
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,590
Geez...

671
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,430
Ouch, my back, my back!

672
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,790
- Honey! 
- My back!

673
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:54,630
Honey!

674
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,330
Give me some pencil lead.

675
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:17,660
How many times do I have to tell you I don't have such things,?

676
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:20,060
Seon Woo, give me some pencil lead.

677
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,450
You know we're meeting at Taek's room tomorrow, right?

678
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:27,540
Why?

679
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,720
We need to see Taek before he leaves for China.

680
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,610
Let's just play Blue Marble. (Monopoly)

681
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:45,580
Ahew, Taek must be lucky. He has so many people loving him.

682
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:53,500
Jeong Pal. I'm not going to be able to go to college anyway, should I just ask Taek for a good job somewhere?

683
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,420
There's a company that supports Taek.

684
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,240
If Taek says something in favor of me, I think I can get hired.

685
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:04,230
Taek hates favors. Even if the President calls him, he doesn't go.

686
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:07,290
Don't bother a sensitive kid and just study.

687
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,480
Wow, what do you guys not know about Taek?

688
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,540
But you guys don't know that I'm original, right?

689
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,300
  Saying I give up is only used when slicing cabbage (Double meaning of bowls refering to kimchi)   

690
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,790
Oh, so you're choosing this piece?

691
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,750
This one.

692
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,720
Hey there,

693
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,190
Why is X this?

694
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:11,800
Isn't this the quadratic formula?

695
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:22,560
X is negative B plus or minus the square root of B squared minus 4AC over 2A.

696
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,720
Hey, this is a first year's problem. This is factoring quadratic equations.

697
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:31,820
Alright. I was asking you because I didn't know. Don't get mad.

698
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:39,180
A is 1, B is 8, and C is 12, so—

699
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,720
Why is A equal to 1?

700
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,790
The coefficent of X squared is 1.

701
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:49,160
That's why A is 1. It's just like that.

702
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,490
Why is it like that?

703
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:58,240
Hey. Why are you Seong Deok Seon?

704
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:04,530
Didn't you say you gave up on math? Just give up.

705
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:08,350
But still, I want to try until I can't any more. I'm really sorry, but can you explain it to me one more time?

706
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,530
I'm really sorry.

707
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,470
- Remember this. 
 - Okay.

708
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:21,730
AX squared plus BX plus C equals 0. In this case,

709
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:30,980
X is negative B plus or minus the square root of B squared minus 4AC over 2A.

710
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,510
- Memorize this. 
 - Okay.

711
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,640
I'll be going!

712
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:30,750
♫   Do you remember that lonely alley my dear?    ♫

713
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:35,530
♫   Still, I remember it   ♫

714
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:41,570
♫   Again tonight, again tomorrow night, again the night after   ♫

715
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:49,500
♫   And forever and ever, I'll be waiting   ♫

716
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:05,260
- Ah, e-excuse me! Excuse me! 
- Yes.

717
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,380
Please look at this man! He's in so much pain!

718
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,470
- Kim Seong Gyoon? 
 -Yes.

719
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:12,300
I'm sorry, please wait a moment. There was an four-car accident in front of the Kwang Sang supermarket, so—

720
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:17,270
Emergency patients keep coming in. I'm sorry, it'll be just a moment!

721
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,400
- Ah! 
 - Oh... 
 - Leave!

722
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:26,180
Mi Ran... I really feel like I'm going to die.

723
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:29,920
Don't move. Don't move.

724
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,410
Ah!

725
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:36,370
Is he okay? Did he get hurt a lot?

726
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:38,340
I think his back is broken.

727
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:43,730
- What? 
 - He took an x-ray and a CT, but everything's so hectic here.

728
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:47,460
- Ahh! 
 - There was a accident at the Kwang Sang supermarket, or whatever, ah...

729
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,640
- Ah, do we have to move him to another hospital or something, what can we do? 
-  Ah!

730
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,950
Aigoo, why of all times, a car accident?

731
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:59,810
Taek's dad. It must be hectic over here.

732
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:02,040
Darling, I'm here.

733
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,960
Did they take a CT?

734
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:09,250
 Yes. They took a CT and x-ray, but the doctors here are so busy, 

735
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,020
 and he needs a surgery. 

736
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,750
You said it was the Korean University Hospital, right?

737
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,780
We'll be there too. Stay there, okay?

738
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:20,300
 Ah, no! There's no place for you to stay because everything is too hectic. 

739
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:24,280
 When he comes out of surgery, I think it'd be better to come then. 

740
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,840
 I'll monitor the situation and call you back. 

741
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,110
Uh, okay then. I'll be waiting for your call.

742
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:33,030
When he's able to go into surgery, please call me right away.

743
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:35,630
Yes, yes.

744
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,960
Did someone get hurt?

745
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,900
Yeah, Jeong Bong's dad hurt his back.

746
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,280
Oh, wow...

747
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,590
What are you doing, hurry and dress! We need to go there right now!

748
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:48,860
No, no, they said it was too hectic. He said to come later, and that he'd call back.

749
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:54,900
Aigoo, this neighborhood never has quiet days, ever.

750
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,240
Anyway, how did he get hurt?

751
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,480
While he was exercising, he fell down the stairs.

752
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,890
Haha, seriously.

753
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:07,540
For a person who has never exercised in his life, what kind of plague

754
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:11,320
did he catch that he hurt himself while exercising? Ah, wash this for me.

755
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,480
Aren't you hungry? I've cooked some sweet potatoes, should I give some to you?

756
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,810
This woman! Why would you put a perfectly fine shirt in the trash?

757
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:26,590
Aigoo, throw it away. You've worn it for a long time.

758
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:30,180
This one, this one. You have new ones.

759
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:47,030
Department Head Lee, you know that it's almost 11 right now?

760
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:50,130
How many hours have we done this?!

761
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:53,660
- Those people really... 
- Well, you worked hard.

762
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:58,160
I know a nearby tripe place. It's on me. Let's go.

763
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:03,200
It's over with Choi Taek and me now.

764
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,620
Excuse me, excuse me.

765
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,610
Where's the doctor? Please look at this person, quickly!

766
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:28,580
I'm sorry, the doctors are all in emergency patients' surgeries right now, so

767
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,280
just a little bit. Please wait just a little bit more.

768
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,730
This person is an emergency, too!

769
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:37,010
Oh! Omo, omo! Oh, what can we do! What can we do, really?

770
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,010
Omo, ah, omo.

771
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:41,370
We are nothing.

772
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:42,960
Who is Kim Seong Gyoon?

773
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,330
Professor, how did you come at this time?

774
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,030
Who is Kim Seong Gyoon?

775
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,850
It's me.

776
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:53,690
Oh, here! We are Kim Seong Gyoon.

777
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,510
Give me Kim Seong Gyoon's charts.

778
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,780
Vice Director, why are you here at this time?

779
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,240
I'll go into surgery right now, so get ready.

780
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,840
No professor, we will—

781
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:12,260
What do you mean no?! He said he'll do it.

782
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:15,170
Okay, okay. Don't mind this, and go work.

783
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,220
Many patients have been delayed, no? Now move quickly!

784
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,840
Yes.

785
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:25,350
Don't worry too much. We'll go into surgery right away.

786
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:30,750
Looking at the charts, it is broken, and fractured, but not shattered.

787
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:33,620
So the time of surgery will not be very long.

788
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:36,510
- Thank y-you. 
 - Then...

789
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:39,640
Thank you.

790
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:46,940
Excuse me. But, who is that person who showed up like a comet?

791
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:49,710
This hospital's vice director.

792
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:52,560
Someone of his level of experience usually does not come to the emergency room though...

793
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,110
Ah, then.

794
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,740
Aigoo, what did you do this morning that made you leave so quickly?

795
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:31,170
Bo Ra hid it under the dining table to give it to you.

796
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,230
 Mom. 

797
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:38,050
 Yeah, what? 

798
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:42,870
 This is Dad's. 

799
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:46,280
 - Wow, what's this? 
 - Dad's present. You give it to him. 

800
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,840
 Ah, why? Give it to him yourself. 

801
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:53,010
 Ah, it doesn't matter who gives it to him. You give it to him. 

802
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:59,690
Looking carefully, your personalities are really similar,

803
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:01,610
but you two aren't close.

804
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:05,390
Ah, this person! Why do you keep talking nonsense?!

805
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:08,990
I'm close with Bo Ra, now stop!

806
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,830
I'm here.

807
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:17,490
It's Saturday, what were you doing that you just came home? Aren't you done with your part-time job, too?

808
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:21,370
Yeah, Sunbae ordered a team dinner. I'm going to sleep.

809
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:26,060
Hey, Bo Ra.

810
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:30,390
This. Thanks.

811
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,540
I'll wear it well.

812
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,920
Yeah, okay.

813
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:40,600
  Operating Room 

814
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,100
Is Dad okay?

815
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:52,000
Yeah, he's okay, he went into surgery just now.

816
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,140
They said he will be okay. Don't worry.

817
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:58,020
Really.

818
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,390
Sit down.

819
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,790
Kim Seong Gyoon's guardian?

820
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,350
- Yes, yes, that's me. 
 - Ah, yes.

821
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:07,260
Some personal information was missing, so... Here.

822
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,770
- Here? 
 - Yes.

823
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:15,550
But how did the vice director do his surgery personally?

824
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,980
Ah, the hospital's director called him directly.

825
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,490
He requested that the vice director do the surgery.

826
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:24,650
Our hospital director loves baduk, and is a fan of Master Choi Taek.

827
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:28,150
But Player Choi Taek called him directly and

828
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:31,750
said that it's his relative, so he requested that he would take care of him.

829
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,550
 Is  he hurt a lot? 

830
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:46,510
 Yeah, I think his back is broken. 

831
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:53,750
 I'll call him right away. Please give me the home phone number. 

832
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:56,840
 Yes. 

833
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,680
 Yes. 

834
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:10,530
Excuse me but, when referring to baduk, it's not a player, the technical term is Korean go player.

835
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:13,130
Ah... Yes.

836
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:17,970
I don't know baduk that well. Then.

837
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:24,460
Taek's dad.

838
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:30,390
When did you call Taek, even though he's busy?

839
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,530
Just before.

840
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,870
Ahew. Thank you.

841
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:58,630
Excuse me, Master Choi I...

842
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:00,790
Ah, right.

843
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,200
Boss, this.

844
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:12,150
What is this?

845
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:16,790
You've all worked so hard, so everyone should get drinks.

846
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:20,900
- What?
 - I'm still a minor, so...

847
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,730
You please treat the broadcasting team.

848
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:33,090
Then, I'll be going home.

849
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:55,850
How did this kind of thing happen?

850
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:02,330
Jeong Hwan, go home. Go and study.

851
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,810
There's nowhere to sleep here.

852
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:05,710
It's okay.

853
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:11,660
It's not okay. It's not such a big surgery that the whole family sleeps in the hospital.

854
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:16,070
And the back surgery was because he was uncomfortable, he's still eating well and everything else is fine.

855
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:18,770
So go home, okay?

856
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:21,400
It makes me more at peace.

857
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,080
Hurry up!

858
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,160
Yes.

859
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:45,260
Jeong Pal.

860
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:48,690
What are you doing here?

861
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,090
- Are you coming just now? 
- Yeah.

862
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,800
Is Ahjussi okay?

863
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,900
Yeah. The surgery ended well.

864
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,100
It's a relief.

865
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,060
Were you not able to sleep?

866
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:09,010
Yea. I can sleep more today.

867
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,910
Taek.

868
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:27,010
Thank you for today.

869
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,960
It's fine.

870
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,880
Hey, your shoelace is untied.

871
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:49,300
Thank you. 
 ♫   Today, from a forgotten friend, I got a call    ♫

872
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:54,100
It's fine. 
 ♫   Today, from a forgotten friend, I got a call    ♫

873
01:15:54,100 --> 01:16:02,860
♫  That he will be leaving far away tomorrow  ♫

874
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:10,210
♫  When we were young, where we used to run and play together  ♫

875
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:21,180
Oh wow! That's great!

876
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,400
Now Deok Seon doesn't need tutoring.

877
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,300
She can just watch KBS3 TV and study.

878
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,820
That's great, right?

879
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,140
Alright.

880
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:35,310
The cockles are here.

881
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,290
Oh my gosh this person!

882
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:42,930
Are you going to exterminate the ark shell in BeolGyo?

883
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,380
They were cheap yesterday, so I bought a whole bunch of them.

884
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,050
Why? Don't you like them?

885
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:51,860
No, I like them so much. But you must have been working  hard to stack like this!

886
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:56,630
Ah, right.  Deok Seon and No Eul,

887
01:16:56,630 --> 01:17:00,160
in the kitchen, there's cockles and bean paste soup that I made. Hurry and give it to  the house upstairs.

888
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,500
There's probably no side dishes between two boys. Yeah?

889
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:21,140
Hey. Where are you going this morning?

890
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,370
Vroom vroom!

891
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:24,940
Are you crazy? Why are you riding it? It's dangerous.

892
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:28,240
I'm just riding for an hour. I'm riding behind Michael.

893
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,690
I'm riding behind Michael, so from afar, people think I'm Michael's girlfriend. Don't worry, haha!

894
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:35,450
Be quiet, what if your mom hears you?

895
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,850
My mom's not here.

896
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:42,930
Manager Jo has an athletic meeting this morning. I had breakfast by myself!

897
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:46,550
So if you get caught, you'll be beaten pretty hard! Your mom's super scary.

898
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:48,370
Manager Jo is busy, I said.

899
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:52,190
Hey, see you later at Taek's room. I can catch Taek's blue marble again.

900
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:53,440
See you later!

901
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,950
Woo hoo! Vroom vroom!

902
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:58,900
Hey.

903
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,990
Ah, Bo Ra. Where have you decided to study?

904
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:22,800
Definitely, the school area would be the best.

905
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,480
I haven't decided yet. Anyway, I can't do it at home.

906
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,100
Yeah, definitely.

907
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:34,470
Anyway, pick the most comfortable place.

908
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:36,590
Dad will go there, and make a contract—

909
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:40,600
Ah, I'll eat it. You eat it, Dad.

910
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:51,710
Okay, then just talk, then.

911
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,200
Hey, Jin Joo.

912
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,490
Look at Oppa.

913
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:05,370
Your hair is a mess.

914
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:08,560
Mom, I'm hungry.

915
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:13,560
Alright, our son is hungry, right?

916
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,100
What about the pickled cucumbers? You made them yesterday.

917
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,730
Right. Hold on, hold on.

918
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:31,820
Wow, Mom! Awesome.

919
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:37,040
- Is it good? 
 - Yeah. 
 - I do make some good pickled cucumbers.

920
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,120
Taek's dad!

921
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,960
Hello?

922
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,620
Taek's dad?

923
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:03,140
Oppa!

924
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:09,820
Yeah, why?

925
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:12,620
- Come here. 
 - What?

926
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:15,470
Come to eat pickled cucumbers.

927
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:16,920
Ah, okay. I'll be right there.

928
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,610
What about Taek? Tell Taek to come, too.

929
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:22,650
He's sleeping. I'll come first for now.

930
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:29,650
 Blue Marble Game 

931
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:35,480
Don't memorize. Just do it.

932
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,090
Yeah.

933
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,110
But Seon Woo.

934
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:43,760
What?

935
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:49,590
If I confess, will Deok Seon believe me?

936
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:52,040
What if she doesn't believe me?

937
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,980
How can she look into your eyes and not believe you?

938
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:00,940
You're always looking at Deok Seon even when we're all together.

939
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:07,080
And, the look is different when you look at Deok Seon than when you look at us.

940
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:12,100
Isn't that obvious? Would the look be the same looking at you guys?

941
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:16,500
Deok Seon is a little dull,

942
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,840
because when I listened to you, and saw what you were doing, I knew right away.

943
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:25,350
If you want to find out who likes who, they say to look in their eyes.

944
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:28,140
The eyes can't lie.

945
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,500
Especially for you, I can see it right away.

946
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:35,340
How do you play baduk with those looks? Everything shows.

947
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:45,050
Yes, this is Master Choi Taek's house.

948
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:47,500
This is Seon Woo.

949
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,800
What? Really?

950
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,640
 Yeah, they're at the police station. While riding the motorcycle with Michael, they didn't wear helmets and they slid on the ground. 

951
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,180
 It doesn't seem like they're injured much, but... 

952
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:01,340
 Ah, that rascal. I'm leaving right now, okay? 

953
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:04,290
Ahew, crazy bastard.

954
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:07,920
His guardian didn't come yet?

955
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,180
Hey, Salamander. Are you okay?

956
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,370
Hey, are you not hurt?

957
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:36,970
Kim Joon Gi. Are you okay?

958
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,450
I'm okay now, but I feel like I won't be later.

959
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:43,810
What? What are you talking about.

960
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:48,850
This officer called Manager Jo, so she will be here soon.

961
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:51,860
You know Manager Jo is very scary when she gets angry.

962
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,810
She still doesn't talk to my brother Soryong.

963
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:58,050
Ah, it would be better if the Dean came instead, but aish...

964
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,170
Ah, thank you for your hard work, but—

965
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:03,960
This bastard.

966
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,460
You are Student Ryoo Dong Ryong's guardian, right?

967
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:09,290
Yes, I am Student Ryoo Dong Ryong's father. Thank you for your hard work.

968
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:11,000
Joon Gi, you good?

969
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,950
Yes.

970
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,820
He's still a minor so he'll be having minor charges, but it could have been serious.

971
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:22,050
They didn't wear helmets, and when the car came at them from the side, they slipped at the corner—

972
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:25,710
Ah, yes, yes. I will caution him exceptionally,

973
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,650
I'm sorry.

974
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:31,450
- Do I sign here? 
 - Ah, yes.

975
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:45,150
I'm sorry.

976
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,070
Are you not hurt?

977
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:16,120
Yes.

978
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:22,020
If you're not hurt, then it's okay.

979
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,840
It's okay.

980
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,200
It's okay.

981
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,960
If you didn't get hurt, it's okay.

982
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,890
Hurry up and eat.

983
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:08,630
Yes.

984
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:13,140
Don't ride motorcycles anymore.

985
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:17,850
You know that I let you go the first time, but not the second, right?

986
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:19,760
Yes.

987
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,520
I'm going to night duty.

988
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:31,520
Hey, Salamander. Do it right, right.

989
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,910
Yes.

990
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:35,540
You're smiling

991
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:42,340
Darling, isn't it time for you to go to the English academy? I'm going!

992
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:46,630
Then eat.

993
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:49,430
Ah, I don't want to eat alone though...

994
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,160
Hurry and eat.

995
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,170
I'll leave after I see you finish eating.

996
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:15,400
♫   Every day with you   ♫

997
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,990
Mom. I don't need to call Deok Seon, Soo Yeon any more.

998
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:24,210
So I'm going to call her Deok Soo. Deok, Soo Yeon.

999
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:26,750
And Hyung Jeong Bong is dating.

1000
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:29,710
Ah, but the Cheetah Ahjumma can't know about this. Shh!

1001
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:32,870
Rules are rules.

1002
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:40,110
And last time dad went through the front door and told me to be quiet, and then went through the back door and told me to be quiet.

1003
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:47,700
I didn't know that our youngest son was this talkative.

1004
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:53,100
And, Bo Ra, I think will never get married and live single forever.

1005
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:59,580
And for No Eul, last time, my neighborhood friends thought he was my Hyung, so they greeted him.

1006
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,390
Mom, the seaweed soup is really delicious.

1007
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:06,480
Eat a lot.

1008
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:14,980
- Ahew! 
 - Ah, really! 
 - Hey, come here, come here!

1009
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,710
- Ahew! 
 -Hey! Hey!

1010
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:20,320
Hey, hey! I'm going to tell my mom for real!

1011
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,440
My mom is the queen of insurance for seven years, The  Great Manager Jo!

1012
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:28,120
- Tell on us, tell on us, tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her!
 - Aigoo.

1013
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,250
Tell her! Aish! Ahew!

1014
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:34,240
Ahew, you've been saying you don't like your mother since forever. What happened?

1015
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:36,860
When did I say I didn't like my mom?

1016
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:39,330
I said she was busy.

1017
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:40,660
You made up with your mom?

1018
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:43,940
What the heck, what the heck, Kim Jung Ryeol! I've never fought with my mom.

1019
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:45,960
I like my mom.

1020
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,290
- Ah, what the heck. 
 - What the heck.

1021
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,440
Guys, my mom works.

1022
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,980
You can say that she's in a different dimension than your moms.

1023
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,840
Ahew. What would you guys know?

1024
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,100
What do you know? Deok Seon, what do you know?

1025
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:05,010
- Ah, what the heck. 
 - I don't know, aish. 
 - We need to get him. Come here!

1026
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:07,130
Come here. Come here!

1027
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,960
How you're... in this situation

1028
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:29,550
Hey did you show him? I told you to just tell him the basics, but—

1029
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:35,610
He did it himself by looking at the manual. You can't beat him. He's crazy.

1030
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:43,610
Hey. But why isn't there a space travel card?

1031
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,510
What?

1032
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:48,100
There's one card right here.

1033
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:54,110
Isn't it two? We've went around once, but there's only one.

1034
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:58,060
Really. Where's the other one?

1035
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,970
The ordered Vienna coffee is here.

1036
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:41,800
Please enjoy.

1037
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,150
Yes, aigoo, thank you.

1038
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:53,190


1039
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,750
It's dirty.

1040
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:41,240
Hey, hey! It's here, it's here.

1041
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,800
Ah, why do I always cook the ramen?

1042
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,170
I'll cook it next time.

1043
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:47,390
Never mind!

1044
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:56,950
Hey Salamander, it's Na Mi Noonim.

1045
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,950
Where are you Deok Seon. Do you not hear the sound of the the song?

1046
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:05,270
Don't we need to match our compatibility?

1047
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,750
Forget it, you do it by yourself.

1048
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,560
Hey. I came from the police station today.

1049
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,710
Can't we match our compatibility for a friend who came from the police station?

1050
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:23,900
♫   When the darkness falls again    ♫

1051
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:28,590
♫    I don't like being alone   ♫

1052
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:33,420
♫   When I get exhausted from    ♫

1053
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:38,580
♫    Wandering around the lighted streets, I fall asleep   ♫

1054
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:43,270
♫   Just like a doll you left behind    ♫

1055
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:47,780
♫   You left me so easily, smiling just like that    ♫

1056
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:52,640
♫    I think, like an Indian doll   ♫

1057
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:58,340
♫    Whoa, my heart was burned to ashes by the loneliness   ♫

1058
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:01,710
♫    Oh my baby   ♫

1059
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,200
Ahew, I'm so tired.

1060
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:39,940
How are you so good at dancing.

1061
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:48,510
♫   Even if we never told each other our love will never change    ♫

1062
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:55,900
How are you so good at dancing? 
 ♫   These past days we had so much affection    ♫

1063
01:33:55,940 --> 01:34:05,550
♫   Even if you didn't have many desires for overwhelming happiness    ♫

1064
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:13,670
Are you not tired? 
 ♫   It still wasn't a farewell    ♫

1065
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:20,360
♫    Just like my appearance of being surrounded by strangers   ♫

1066
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,230
Why did you come so quickly, Noona?

1067
01:34:22,230 --> 01:34:25,510
I just came. What do you want to drink?

1068
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,080
Is this Vienna coffee?

1069
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,890
It's just milk with cream on top.

1070
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:37,980
Oh, it's delicious.

1071
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:44,260
Noona. You have something to say to me, right?

1072
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:48,030
Tell me quickly. I'm so curious.

1073
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,960
Here, a present.

1074
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,200
Why are you giving me a present?

1075
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,140
I got money from my part-time job.

1076
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:00,040
I didn't work a couple weeks, so I only got a little bit.

1077
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,600
When I earn more money next time, I'll buy you better things.

1078
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:07,850
Wow.

1079
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:10,240
I'll wear it next time right away.

1080
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:18,640
Noona. Is your part-time job not hard?

1081
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,630
I quit my part-time job.

1082
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:22,310
What? When?

1083
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:25,840
Last week. I'm not going anymore.

1084
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:35,930
But.. But, why am I so happy?

1085
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:40,200
Then, can we see each other more often?

1086
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,320
Seon Woo.

1087
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:51,600
I'm preparing for the bar exam.

1088
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,980
♬  My love you are leaving silently  ♬

1089
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:58,470
I was preparing for it, to be honest.

1090
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:03,080
♬  In the end there is only a feeling of regret  ♬

1091
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:11,700
♬ Even though you love me, now there will be a different life.  ♬

1092
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,190
Then, we

1093
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:21,670
aren't breaking up, right?

1094
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:27,900
Why are you saying such things?

1095
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,680
 Preview 

1096
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:53,180
Why was I like that then?

1097
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,950
  Yes, Just like that! Pop! 

1098
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:58,980
Whoa...

1099
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:01,240
Ahew, don't say things you don't know.

1100
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,460
Why are you like this, like amateurs?

1101
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:05,300
I have a wish.

1102
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,830
It's my wish, my wish.

1103
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:08,500
I'm going to win against your mom.

1104
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,160
My mom is Ra Mi Ran.

1105
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:13,920
Why are you guys like this?! I'm Ssangmun-dong's Park Nam Jung.

1106
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,450
♫   Ah, you will come back    ♫

1107
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:17,120
Do it as I said.

1108
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,760
Do you understand?

1109
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,180

Yes, what?

1111
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:24,960
It's nothing. Never mind.

1112
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:30,210
I wish that I had a good friend next to me, just like you.
