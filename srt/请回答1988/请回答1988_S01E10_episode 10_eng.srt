It's time for "Room Relay".

Oppa, eat dinner.

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,780
After you finish, don't wobble around trying to do the dishes. Just put them off to the side.

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,250
Later tonight, I'll come and do them.

Okay.

You guys look like you're going to go into the TV! Go into the TV why don't you?

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,450
I'm making the kids fried rice tomorrow. I'm getting stuff ready now.

22
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,490
Where did all the ham go?

23
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,800
I definitely bought it today and put it there.

24
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,790
What ham? It's probably in the refrigerator.

25
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,730
There's a different one, the kind Americans eat.

26
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,830
It's expensive so I only buy it once in a while.

27
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,060
Did you eat it?

28
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,780
I have to know what something is before I eat it!

The dean knows I'm here and my mom is out at a dinner. Did Jeong Bong leave the temple?

32
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,100
Yeah, he came back today.

33

Wow, that's amazing.

34
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,990
How did he last there for ten days?

35
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,080
He probably likes meat more than anyone else in the world.

36
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,800
My brother liked the food there.

I have to wake up early tomorrow. I'm sleeping at home.

Where are you going? Isn't tomorrow your birthday?

42
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah. Tomorrow morning, my mom said she'd make breakfast.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,980
Really? Your mom is going to make  a meal?

44
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,890
Yeah. Because it's my birthday, she said she'd make me beef and seaweed soup.

45
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,190
How many months has it been since I've eaten my mom's food?

- Let's go inside. 
 - Hey, there's no one in your house right?

55
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,490
My mom and dad went to a relative's wedding and my younger brother went with them.

56
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,670
My unni is leaving soon.

57
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,310
- Your unni? 
 -Your unni's home?

58
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,460
- No, bye... 
 - It's okay, she won't bite!

59
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,020
Just... We'll wait till she leaves. Then we'll go in.

60
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,170
I said it's okay! We'll be in the living room anyway.

61
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,050
If we run into her, just greet her properly. Ninety degrees.

62
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,340
It's cold.

63
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,350
Wait, isn't that Nureongi (yellow puppy)'s house?

64
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,200
Nureongi? Who's that?

65
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,240
Ah, not Nureongi, but Badugi (black and white spotted dog, meaning Go player).

66
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,410
That's the right place with the jewelry store. That's his house, right?

67
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,770
Hey, can't we ask him to come out? I want to see his face.

68
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,050
Yeah! We see him a lot on TV. Let's get a glimpse of him in real life!

69
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,510
- No. Never. 
 - Why?

70
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,890
You can't bother Taek.

71
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,970
You can bother all the other kids, but you can't touch Taek.

72
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,340
If he meets people like you, he'll be corrupted.

73
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,510
Taek is our block's treasure. We have to protect him. Also, he's at Baduk club now so he's not home.

74
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,200
It's cold, let's go in.

75
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,140
Oh, hi!

76
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,010
- Hi. 
 - Hello.

77
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,930
You guys came to hang out at Deok Seon's house?

78
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,370
Hey, let's hang out with him today. Can't we hang out with him?

79
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,930
Deok Seon, is Noona Bo Ra  home—

80
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,420
She's not here! Seong Bo Ra already left!

81
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,630
Wow, is this your house?

82
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,540
It's so big, it's huge.

83
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,510
Wow, it's as big as Man Ok's house.

84
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,220
It feels like the global village at the amusement park.

85
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,660
My house is... There.

86
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,290
It's embarrassing so I didn't want to bring you guys over before... But we're friends so there shouldn't be any secrets.

87
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,460
Hey,  I'm being really generous.

88
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,010
It's not a crime to be poor. Being ugly is a crime.

89
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,290
You're pretty.

90
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,950
Let's go, I'll make some ramen on the stove.

91
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,870
But you guys still use a gas stove?

92
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,000
Man Ok, you don't know the lifestyle of ordinary people, huh?

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,460
It's great! It boils quickly, too.

94
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,130
I can't stand rich girls like you.

95
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,320
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,760
Noona, I'm leaving.

97
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,130
Hello.

98
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,460
Hello.

99
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,050
Why are you coming out of my house?

100
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,600
Well, uh...

101
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,710
I have something to talk to you about.

102
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,360
- Me? 
 - Yeah.

103
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,270
Come see me for a bit.

104
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,470
Hello.

105
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,310
What are you doing? Sit.

106
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,980
Oh... Okay.

107
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,910
Come out already!

108
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,480
Hey!

109
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,510
Don't turn the house into a mess. Play quietly.

110
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,310
Why don't you clean up once and then say that?

111
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,560
What did you just say?

112
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,390
Okay, we'll hang out quietly.

113
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,460
Mom, tomorrow's Dad's birthday?

114
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,360
Yeah, Jung Hwan. Come out with me.

115
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,210
Where?

116
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,670
We bought a new car.

117
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,810
I gave your dad money for his birthday, 20-million won.

118
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,210
Twenty-million won?!

119
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,810
Yeah I caught that woman who owed me money and got my 20-million won back.

120
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,400
Oh, that 20-million won?

121
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,990
Your dad always gets depressed around his birthday so I just gave him a lot of money this time.

122
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,650
I told him to buy any car he wanted. It came today and he said to come out to see it.

123
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,710
What did he buy? Could it be—

124
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,960
Grandizer?

125
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,260
Aigoo. You think your cheap dad would buy that? I'm not even hoping for something nearly as good as a Grenadier.

126
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,540
It'll probably be a Sonata, or if not, a Capital or a Stella?

127
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,500
Even so, anything's better than that work car he drives around in.

128
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,360
No way. It was still 20-million won.

129
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,840
Right? Could he have bought a Grendizer?

130
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,850
Ta-da! The new car has arrived!

131
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,460
What is this?

132
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,460
What do you mean? It's a man's pride!

133
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,390
I got a Pride! It's looks like a new car, right?

134
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,740
Wow... It's also a used car.

135
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,140
Hurry get in. I'll take us around the whole neighborhood.

136
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,300
Drive it by yourself.

137
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,130
Meeting? Where?

138
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,210
With guys at Sun Deok High.

139
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,080
One of them is my classmates from elementary school. He's really good looking.

140
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,550
And he's bringing a friend, so there'll be two guys. Next week at Donamdong.

141
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,550
Do they care a lot about appearances?

142
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,600
No, they said they don't.

143
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,550
- You'll both come, right?
 - I'm not.

144
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,470
Why? Who knows? You could meet the man you're destined to be with.

145
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,140
Crazy, talking about destiny. There's no such thing as destiny in this world.

146
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,630
Hey, you could fall in love at first sight.

147
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,830
Yeah! How would you know when or where you would meet the man you're supposed to end up with?

148
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,330
Hey... You guys need to stop reading those romance novels.

149
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,400
Stuff like that doesn't happen in real life.

150
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,860
Whatever. I'll go by myself. Set up the blind date.

151
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,010
Okay I'll set up the date.

152
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,980
if it goes well, you have to let it multiply, Seong Deok Seon.

153
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,980
If it goes well.

154
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,390
Hey, but what did he want to talk to you about earlier?

155
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,160
- When? 
 - You know, the scary looking guy.

156
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,510
Oh Jung Pal? He wanted to go watch a movie.

157
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,820
This weekend, he wanted to go see a movie.

158
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,050
No, it's not like that. He's just a friend.

159
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,230
Yeah right, friend. I'm telling you, he likes you! Wanna bet?

160
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:36,560
Hey, I could tell just by looking at his eyes. Deok Seon, it's real this time!

161
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,670
You can just confirm it.

162
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,290
How?

163
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,670
Go tell him you're going on a blind date.

164
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,580
If he hears that and says, "Go ahead,"

165
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,900
then he only sees you as a friend.

166
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,400
"Do you want to die?", "Are you crazy?", "Don't do it."

167
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,030
If he says one of those three, then he likes you.

168
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,420
Hey, what about "Have you gone mad?" You can't count that?

169
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,940
Yeah, yeah it works! Is that what's important?

170
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,710
The point is that he objects to her going on the date.

171
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,760
But what do I do if he really opposes it?

172
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,380
What are you talking about, what would you do? Just date him.

173
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,980
Is the blind date that important if he likes you?

174
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,990
Well, it's not that...

175
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,250
But what do I do if he really likes me?

176
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,690
Why are you asking us that?

177
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,740
- It's your choice. 
 - Huh?

178
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,200
Do you like him?

179
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,050
I don't know.

180
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,440
Then date him first. Date him and then decide.

181
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,240
It's uncomfortable being like that with him.

182
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,890
If you want comfortable then live your whole life with us.

183
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,460
Just check first.

184
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,080
Don't mess around. Ask seriously. Do you understand?

185
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,890
Hey, I'm 100% sure. Have I ever been wrong?

186
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,710
That ... About Ssangmoon High's student president...

187
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,090
I'm sorry. He makes people confused.

188
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,530
But, who is the person he actually liked? Do you know her?

189
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,350
I don't know her! I don't!

190
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,090
Why are you screaming?

191
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,330
 Don't Sleep Study Room 

193
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,670
 Male Study Room 

194
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,730
 11665 Seon Woo 

195
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,370
 I can't go. Go with the kids. Seong Bo Ra. 

196
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,470
What are you looking at?

197
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,590
Gum, you see.

198
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,140
I'm going to the study room.

199
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,320
Should I give you a ride in the new car?

200
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,030
No thanks. It's just up front anyway.

201
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,630
But then, I haven't seen Jeong Bong the whole day. Do you know where he went?

202
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,650
What is your hyung obsessed with these days?

203
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,650
Arcade.

204
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,640
Again?

205
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
For a man, it's normal to be obsessed with arcades at least once.

206
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,180
What kind? Gallery? X Rio?

207
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,450
Shoot 'em up game? Double Dragon?

208
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,340
No... Boggle Boggle.

209
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,090
 Boggle Boggle 1 round 50 won. 

210
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,120
   1 round, 50 won. If you ignore your time limit, you'll be kicked off the machine.   

211
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,180
No. No. Shoes.  Don't eat the shoes.

212
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,810
Ah, I have to go faster.

213
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,660
Nice!

214
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,040
What, why are you so surprised?

215
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,100
No reason.

216
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,900
Are you going somewhere?

217
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,650
Study room.

218
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,170
Why are you going to the study room? You always study in your room.

219
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,450
Seon Woo lent me his seat.

220
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,900
Seon Woo is going to a concert tonight so he's just studying in his room.

221
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,070
Why?

222
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,810
Do you have something to say to me?

223
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,720
Nothing.

224
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,820
Seon Woo... What concert is he going? Lee Seon Hee?

225
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,810
Yeah. He was so excited before.

226
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,740
Are you sure you have nothing to say to me?

227
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,170
There isn't anything. Have fun.

228
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,410
What's with her? Why is she going back?

229
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:46,080
♫   Who is this person who is by my side   ♫

230
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,830
♫   Will you truly love me   ♫

231
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:59,600
♫   You promise that your love will be forever   ♫

232
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,300
♫   But the person in my memory said the same thing    ♫

233
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:13,200
♫   Your love came to be after my heartbreak   ♫

234
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:22,970
♫   Please understand why I can't open up to you, ah   ♫

235
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:30,330
♫   Finding love after the heartbreak, after the love finds me   ♫

236
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,980
♫   What awaits    ♫

237
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,270
♫   I will bury the memories of my past    ♫

238
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:47,860
♫   I believe in you and will follow you.    ♫

239
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,170
Noona, what are you doing here?

240
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:56,660
I came to see Deok Seon and I was curious.

241
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,350
But, are you alone?

242
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,870
What about Dong Ryong and Seon Woo?

243
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,030
Seon Woo didn't come to the study room.

244
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,550
He left early to go to the concert.

245
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,970
But wasn't he going with you?

246
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,650
Noona. Noona!

247
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,040
Seriously, so bothersome. Bothersome!

248
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,930
Oppa, eat dinner.

249
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,770
I heard high cholesterol meat isn't good for you. So, I fried delicious fish.

250
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,520
And also Taek said he will eat later,

251
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,680
so I prepared and set the table already. You just need to heat the soup.

252
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,140
Okay. Eat with—

253
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,970
Turn up the volume! Taek can't hear it from his room.

254
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,260
I can hear fine. It's okay.

255
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,370
Taek was wearing earphones.

256
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,030
It's okay to turn up the volume.

257
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,730
Really?

258
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,150
Eat it all and the dishes—

259
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,990
" Don't clean them and put them all to the side."

260
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,720
- I'm going.
 - Okay, bye.

261
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,480
She sings really well.

262
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,900
 Lee Seon Hee Live Concert '89
Olympic Stadium 

263
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,390
The concert is starting! Come on in!

264
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,310
Excuse me, you have to enter now.

265
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,640
Okay, just a minute.

266
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,110
Hey!

267
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,240
Hey! Why didn't you go the study room today?

268
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,930
I left a note on your desk today.

269
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,010
That I can't go and to go with the kids.

270
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,050
I even wrote a note.

271
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:32,790
So... The reason I came here... isn't because I wanted to come...

272
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,700
I went to the study room to leave the ticket,

273
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,330
but you didn't see it.

274
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,120
You really know how to burden someone.

275
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,780
Don't misunderstand this, okay?

276
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,630
You came, so it's okay.

277
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,010
What?

278
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,900
You came, so it's alright.

279
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,770
- Let's go. 
 - Hey! Hey! Wait! 
  Lee Seon Hee Live Concert '89 

280
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,160
Hey, come on wait.

281
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,410
What are you doing here?

282
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,920
I have something to ask you.

283
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,470
You see...

284
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,820
Let's talk in my room. It's cold.

285
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,420
Talk.

286
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,210
Okay...

287
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,720
What's wrong?

288
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,410
I'm going on a blind date this week.

289
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:16,310
11th grade in Seon Dook High School. His name is Choi Jae Young. Jo Hyun's elementary school classmate.

290
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,070
Should I go on the date?

291
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,760
I said, should I go on the date?

292
00:25:53,140 --> 00:26:03,750
♫   Every day with you, receive the sunshine in the morning   ♫

293
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:13,740
♫   Every day with you,  I want to open my eyes   ♫

294
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:24,580
♫   Both in the early morning streets in rain and under the red sunset evening sky   ♫

295
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:36,070
♫   I want to share everything with you   ♫

296
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,700
Good night

297
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:49,260
♫   Every day with you, receive the sunshine in the morning   ♫

298
00:26:49,260 --> 00:27:00,330
♫   Every day with you, I want to talk with you   ♫

299
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,870
♫   Every day with you   ♫

300
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:18,180
♫ Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday...

301
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,510
♫ Happy Birthday, our dear Father

302
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,850
♫ Happy Birthday!

303
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,520
Blow out the candles.

304
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,760
Father, a present.

305
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,930
Whoa, you guys know how to give presents?

306
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,180
What is it?

307
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,460
A couples tea set.

308
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,860
Couples tea set. Deok Seon picked it out, right?

309
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,650
Yes. It's not like we would buy things like that.

310
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,430
Open it so we can see it.

311
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,380
Later. I'll open it later.

312
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,530
Let's eat.

313
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,460
Okay.

314
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,080
I ate well.

315
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,380
Hello, President Kim!

316
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,400
Hello, President Seong!

317
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,410
It is nice to meet you.

318
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,830
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

319
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,700
Ahjussi, happy birthday.

320
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,910
Yeah, thanks.

321
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,930
It's weird.

322
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:37,550
Strangely I don't feel good on my birthday.

323
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,380
Were you beaten so bad on your birthday when you were young?

324
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,090
No.

325
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,850
You weren't like this before, but it's becoming often these years.

326
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,150
I know, right?

327
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,880
Is it because you want to see your mom who passed away?

328
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:03,270
No it's been over ten years since she died, I don't even remember what she looks like.

329
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,560
Then did you break up with a girlfriend on your birthday?

330
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,980
Why? You'd call her up?

331
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,080
Yeah. If only it could make you feel better. I could bring her any time.

332
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,740
I will lend you the master bedroom.

333
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,050
In my life, the only woman is none other than you.

334
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,440
The blanket, please.

335
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,240
Just throw these away!

336
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,940
Leave it. They all have a purpose.

337
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,520
Leave it.

338
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,380
Don't throw away a single one.  I won't stand for it.

339
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,850
Are you not going to eat the cream? Then give it to me...

340
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,820
No!

341
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,700
I really like cream.

342
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,530
I'm going to eat it in one bite.

343
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,670
Oppa then, can you eat this in one bite?

344
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,050
This time, eat without getting cream on your mouth.

345
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,900
Hey, hey, hey!

346
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,110
How old are you to be betting with food?

347
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,560
Follow me. I have something to give you.

348
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,990
Hyung, aren't you going to the arcade today?

349
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,010
You said you would get high score on Boggle Boggle.

350
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,890
Oppa, you're playing Boggle Boggle?

351
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,630
At the arcade up front I have the highest score for Boggle Boggle.

352
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,390
Hyung Jeong Bong can't play the arcade in this neighborhood anymore.

353
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,450
He had a fist fight with grade schoolers.

354
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,610
You go to Panghakdong, right?

355
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,180
Yeah.

356
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,650
Panghakdong? My friend lives there. Man Ok. Maggie Cheung.

357
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,360
They are the richest in Panghakdong.

358
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,670
Maggie Cheung my ass! Who is Maggie Cheung?

359
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,150
She's Maggie Cheung in my eyes!

360
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,320
Then Do Ryong Nyong is Leslie Cheung in my eyes.

361
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,560
Hey my friend! Happy birthday!

362
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,400
- Hello. 
 - Where's your dad?

363
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,050
You came?

364
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,210
You're here?

365
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,810
It seems like the celebration is already over.

366
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:20,100
I made some pancakes. Jeong Bong's dad  likes these very much.

367
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,700
He's in a bad mood today. Very depressed today.

368
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:29,680
No, why on his birthday? He's happy 360 days all year.

369
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,730
Hello? Yeah, Dong Ryong?

370
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,480
Only on his birthday,

371
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,640
strangely, he doesn't feel well.

372
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,410
I also don't know the reason.

373
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,710
What?! You ran away?

374
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,000
Where are you right now?

375
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,880
You crazy bastard.

376
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,590
Yeah, yeah...

377
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,030
Okay. Don't move.

378
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,500
I said okay!

379
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,870
Okay, I won't tell anyone.

380
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,770
Don't go anywhere, stay right there. I'm leaving right now.

381
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,550
Dong Ryong ran away?

382
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,820
Yeah, yesterday morning.

383
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,350
He's in Daecheon right now.

384
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,660
- Daecheon? 
 - Where is that?

385
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,320
West Sea.

386
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,750
He said he ran out of money and asked me to come to get him.

387
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,890
And he said to not tell his mom and dad.

388
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,950
If his mom and dad come, he said he'd run away again.

389
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,320
Dong Ryong is such a kind kid. He's usually not the one to do things like this.

390
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,810
I know. I don't know about my children though.

391
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,570
We can't do anything about other people's family.

392
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,620
You should go down and convince him and bring him back.

393
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,610
We will pretend not to know anything.

394
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,250
Okay, I'll take the guys with me.

395
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:03,090
But, still if you kids are going, you'll need to bring an adult.

396
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,650
Hey you're even going? You don't have a competition today?

397
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,400
Aren't you going to lower your head? I can't see anything at the back!

398
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,030
Why are you doing that to Taek?!

399
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,920
Don't do that to Taek...

400
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,770
You disgustingly cherish Taek too much.

401
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,910
Taek's competition in Japan got cancelled so he can rest after a long while.

402
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,540
We should hurry and go. We don't know where Dong Ryong will go again.

403
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,040
That bastard Dong Ryong... When I find him I'm going to rip him apart!

404
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,620
Let's go to catch Dong Ryong!

405
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,980
You brought tapes, right?

406
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,290
Music, ready... Start!

407
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,530
Let's music!

408
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,840
Hey... It's not "let's mus—"

409
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,720
Oh whatever.

410
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,140
Oh, Seon Woo good music choice.

411
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,690
Taek, you know this song, right?

412
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,460
Of course. Lee Moon Sae, right?

413
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,350
Wow, how'd you know? How about the title? Do you know the title?

414
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,260
The title?

415
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,730
Burning Sunset?

416
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,750
Hey! Burning Sunset?

417
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,690
Hey, aren't you going to be quiet?!

418
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,660
♫   I love you    ♫

419
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,160

Shut up!

Cheers!

424
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,390
 Jung Pal, where did Dong Ryong say he was? 

425
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,980
 - He said he's with Chao Yun Fat. 
 - Huh? Who? 

426
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,600
 Hyung Chao Yun Fat. He's with... I don't know. 

427
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,670
 He keeps on saying nonsense.  
 Welcome to Dae Cheon. Yook Jang Ocean

Would 1000 won be enough? Get 10,000 won.

434
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,770
I love you, Mother!

435
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,070
Since your father is not doing it, are you doing it instead?

436
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,100
Oh, my fate.

437
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,600
Why can't I do it? I'm good at this.

438

I love you, boiled sweet potato.

439
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,800
I guess you're feeling better now.

440
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,370
No... I'm more depressed after doing it.

441
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,280
Living is so empty.

442
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,000
What are you going to do with that money? Are you going to the arcade?

443
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,090
  1 round, 50 won. If you ignore your time limit, you'll be kicked off the machine.  

444
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,540
  Two people cannot rig the game. Be careful with your valuables, Owner  

445
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
Be prepared.

446
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,110
Here it goes.

447
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:39,410
Aigoo!

448
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,250
Front, front.

449
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,080
Here.

450
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,130
Let's rest first.

451
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,120
Here.

452
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,390
Wow... Whoa, the ball...

453
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:58,760
Ow, my leg.

454
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,610
The soju just dropped on the ground.

455
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,360
I'll pick it up.

456
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,720
Ahjussi! Save me! I'm just hungry!

457
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,900
Ahjussi! I'm sorry! Wait! Spare me!

458
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,050
No!

459
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,060
No...

460
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,660
Hey! Open the door! Open the door...

461
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,320
Open the door!

462
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,450
Open the door!

463
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,440
Hey! Aren't you going to be quiet?

464
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,530
Because of you, how many have suffered?!

465
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,250
What good did you do to make a fuss!

466
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,300
- You stay put and be quiet.  
 - Yes.

467
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,800
You make one more sound and I'll just...!

468
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,690
- Aren't we going? 
 - Noona, what do we do?

469
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,100
- What? 
 - There are six people

470
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,580
We all can't fit.

471
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,800
Then, why did you all come?!

472
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,430
Leave one.

473
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,440
Are you guys kids?

474
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,460
One can just take the bus.

475
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,150
Then, that's fine but one is too much so how about two people?

476
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,230
Who will be left?

477
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,270
Those... The one eating crackers...

478
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,350
And the one stealing them.

479
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:42,110
♫   I look back on it at times and smile   ♫

480
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,040
Do you want one?

481
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,740
Okay, okay, I'll give you one.

482
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,180
Don't do that...

483
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,310
What did you say Taek's IQ was?

484
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,670
139.

485
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,640
Wasn't it 99?

486
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,970
That's Deok Seon's IQ.

487
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,610
Don't do it.

488
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,720
Put that back where it belongs.

489
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,360
This one.

490
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,570
Ugh... I can't live like this.

491
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:18,100
No, he has Jeong Bong's notebook from grade school?

492
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,970
He even has Jeong Hwan's pacifier when he was a year old.

493
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,020
He can't bear seeing his belongings being thrown away.

494
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,610
It's because he's used to being poor.

495
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,990
I thought so too, but that's not it.

496
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,830
It's just his personality. His personality.

497
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,170
But isn't today Jeong Bong's dad's birthday?

498
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,800
Aren't you eating out?

499
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,720
Do you get to eat with a fork and knife (steak) tonight?

500
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,780
What knife (steak)?

501
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,730
He's not in the mood for that.

502
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,830
Wow, that's strange. What's the reason?

503
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,560
I don't know. I don't know. He doesn't know. Nobody knows.

504
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,650
What's wrong? He's a man who jokes all the time.

505
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,130
Why is he like that only on his birthday?

506
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,370
Why does he shut his mouth like a clam?

507
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,650
Hyungnim, isn't it because he thinks of something?

508
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,210
His first love... Something like that?

509
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,940
Then I would hurry and bring her here then.

510
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,320
I've lived with him for a long time so I should learn to give in.

511
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,470
But then, is the jeweler alright?

512
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,640
Yes. He's getting much better.

513
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,370
But for the time being he should be careful of what he eats.

514
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,260
So I cook the food and the soup a bit bland.

515
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,150
Aigoo. It's good to have a hometown dongseang.

516
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,580
At times like this, someone is there to take care of him.

517
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,160
Using this chance, why don't you get together.

518
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,840
What?

519
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,450
What's the problem?

520
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,480
Your kids are all grown up and you both know each other's circumstances.

521
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,460
Oh right, where did Jin Joo go?

522
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,120
In Gimhae.

523
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,570
Why make it complicated by living here and there. Just get together.

524
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,130
Don't say things like that!

525
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,080
I have been going in and out of his house lately

526
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,580
and I'm so cautious about what others might think. Even to Seon Woo.

527
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,230
What's there to be cautious. It's enough if you like each other.

528
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,410
What are you saying?

529
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:11,330
Look at her being aggressive. It's true.

530
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:14,660
- Seriously. 
 - Never mind.

531
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,780
Just open one more beer.

532
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,840
Let's drink and throw all those things.

533
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,860
Give me your wallet.

534
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,740
Do you want to eat meat? Rib eye.

535
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,010
My treat!

536
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,650
It's okay, you can eat it

537
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,270
Just eat it instead of burning it.

538
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,220
I'll just block you like this.

539
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,660
Then I will counter you again like this.

540
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,320
Return strike!

541
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,510
You're making this side stronger.

542
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:15,480
Wow... You really are different.

543
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,860
All my moves are dead.

544
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,580
I'm sorry Elder... I'm sorry.

545
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:25,220
Come here... I'm sorry.

546
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,960
Here...

547
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,210
Here.

548
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,000
It's not finished though.

549
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,900
Hey! Do you think you could play in the neighborhood?

550
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,320
But he asked me to...

551
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,650
Be quiet.

552
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,320
Hurry up.

553
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,060
 Milk 

554
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,710
 Black coffee 

555
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,710
Here!

556
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:13,840
Are you okay?

557
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,910
Aigoo.

558
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,900
This is good.

559
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,880
I made it myself.

560
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,160
Really?

561
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,200
No!

562
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,200
Hey, you're a big problem.

563
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,650
How will you survive in this harsh world?

564
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,470
The world is not to be belittled.

565
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:46,450
You should say clearly "No" to what you do not like.

566
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,890
Do you know how many scammers there are in this world?

567
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,100
You're just a pushover, a pushover!

568
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,060
At this rate you will be fooled ten times a day.

569
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,230
Don't smile!

570
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,080
You're already going?

571
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,520
There's some time before the bus comes.

572
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,680
We came all the way here, we can't just leave.

573
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,730
- Here. 
 - Hold up!

574
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,510
 This way! 

575
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,900
 Hey! 

576
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,590
It's cold!

577
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,070
It's not cold, take it off.

578
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,730
I don't want to, it's cold.

579
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,620
What are you talking about cold? I said take it off.

580
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,820
Aigoo. You call yourself a man.

581
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,670
Deok Seon!

582
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,210
I'm sorry!

583
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,730
I'm really sorry.

584
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,940
I drank so much... I'm sorry.

585
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,730
I'm sorry.

586
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,220
Wow, you're really a man.

587
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:46,030
Of course, I'm a man. What would I be, a girl?

588
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,730
Then take it off.

589
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,240
Wait... Just wait a minute!

590
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,670
Deok Seon!

591
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,710
Okay, okay!

592
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,120
Hold on.

593
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,050
Hey!

594
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,950
- It's cold! 
- Just stand up!

595
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,770
Deok Seon!

596
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,950
Okay, okay!

597
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,970
Deok Seon!

598
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,380
♫   At the beach   ♫

599
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,200
♫   Before I knew it   ♫

600
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,490
♫   From this point on, I   ♫

601
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,120
What is this?

602
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,430
♫   I'm singing a song, our short summer is gone  ♫

603
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,770
♫   My love is gone, too   ♫

604
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:36,800
♫   You disappear into the ocean   ♫

605
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,030
♫   You don't reply to my calling   ♫

606
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,440
♫   Now you have become part of my memory  ♫

607
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:51,630
♫   My summer days will never come back   ♫

608
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:05,880
Should we go out to eat for dinner? It looks like all the kids are coming in late.

609
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,510
Let's just eat at home. It's bothersome to go out.

610
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,830
Should we make sujaebi (hand torn noodle soup). It feels like it will rain.

611
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,340
That's good.

612
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:29,340
But isn't it about time Jeong Bong got home? Jeong Hwan would be late.

613
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:33,470
It's not like he'll come home early. He's properly crazy about the arcade.

614
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,900
I better make the dough.

615
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,240
Oh!

616
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:52,310
A hundred.

617
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,180
I broke the record.

618
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:59,730
As expected, effort won't betray.

619
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:04,140
I should start from the beginning.

620
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:08,690
Do it moderately.

621
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,780
Ah, what is this?

622
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,470
Hey!

623
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:35,390
Get him!

624
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,610
Go this way!

625
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,330
Hey, I think I'm going to be late.

626
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,640
 Hey! I just met my fated man. 

627
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,530
 When I saw him there was electricity all over my body. And he's younger than me. 

628
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,760
Fate, my ass.

629
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,290
Anyway, just wait ten minutes. I'll be right there.

630
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:23,680
Fate, my ass. I don't like younger men.

631
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,790
Ugh, where is he?!

632
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,850
Aigoo! Where did he go?

633
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,420
Haven't we seen each other before?

634
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,030
What?

635
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,580
Jung Eui Girls High School?

636
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,520
No.

637
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,050
Yeonggang Girl's High?

638
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,810
No. Ssangmun Girl's High.

639
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:13,100
I know someone from Ssangmun Girl's High.

640
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,560
Seong Deok Seon. She lives downstairs from our house.

641
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,880
Do you not know her?

642
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,570
She's my best friend.

643
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,410
So you know her?

644
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,320
How could there be such a coincidence?

645
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,990
No... This is...

646
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,810
Fate?

647
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,930
The rain stopped.

648
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,760
Hey Jeong Hwan. Watch him to make sure he goes into his house.

649
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,300
Yes.

650
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,750
But, why did you run away?

651
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,810
Wow. Aren't you asking a bit too fast?

652
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:31,060
Why did you run away? Because of the Dean?

653
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,560
Did you get hit?

654
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,650
Because of Department Head Jo.

655
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,930
Your mom?

656
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,860
Are you talking about your mother who is the insurance queen for five years in a row?

657
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,020
It's seven.

658
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,180
- Why your mom? 
 - My mom knows nothing but money.

659
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,970
She needs to know how precious her children are.

660
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,670
So out of the blue, as if it's the first time.

661
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,170
Yesterday was my birthday.

662
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,050
- Happy birthday... 
 - Happy Birthday.

663
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,060
Yeah, thanks... Anyway she said she'd make me breakfast.

664
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,460
Yeah, I know.

665
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,070
But she just left money.

666
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:05,520
Wow that's great. Shouldn't you thank her?

667
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,970
You don't know anything, idiot. Be quiet.

668
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:14,050
My mom... Her customers are more important than her children.

669
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,180
Guess what my wish is?

670
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,970
What is it?

671
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:25,240
There's a dish that my mom is good at.

672
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,590
Instant black bean noodles?

673
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:30,820
Does she even cook?

674
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:35,170
What is it? What does she make well?

675
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,290
Seaweed soup.

676
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:46,070
As you know, Department Head Jo and the Dean of the Students have been earning money since I was little.

677
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:52,370
So my brothers and I always had to buy food from outside or eat with your families.

678
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:58,330
But because it's my birthday, just for one day,

679
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:05,560
I wanted to have my mom's seaweed soup with big chunks of beef.

680
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:14,090
Ever since she became the insurance queen or whatever, I haven't been able to taste it.

681
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,210
This year, I thought I would be able to eat that seaweed soup at last.

682
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,390
It's just my fate.

683
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,850
Hey Jeong Pal... Can't I sleep at your house?

684
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,040
I just really don't like to go home, that's why.

685
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,800
But still, go home. They'll be worried.

686
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,080
That's right.

687
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,960
- Your mom and dad probably weren't able to sleep last night. 
 - Is that so?

688
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,160
Hey! Aren't you going to hurry and go in?

689
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,550
Are you at the age where you need your mom and dad?

690
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:53,050
What are you whining about? What shoes are you wearing?

691
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,020
LA Gear, right?

692
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,390
Hey, Seong Deok Seon has been wearing Arthis for three years.

693
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,150
And your jacket is Sergio Valente. By the looks of it, your pants are Jordache.

694
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:47,260
At your age, rather than considerate parents it's better to have parents who earn money. Do you know that?

695
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,610
That's why stop whining and go home.

696
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,050
Oh!

697
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:58,600
And next time, if you have some complaints, get mad.

698
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,590
Why are you holding it in? You should say it for them to know.

699
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:04,040
How would they know if you don't say it?

700
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:10,120
Hey, your mom and dad are busy as it is. How could they take care of your mental state, too?

701
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,920
First go home and beg for forgiveness.

702
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,600
But if the atmosphere is still not good then run away again.

703
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,250
Run away again?

704
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:28,390
Ay! The rain is falling again! Aren't you going to hurry home! I'm also going home!

705
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,690
Run away again?

706
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,830
Hurry and go in.

707
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,350
Jeong Pal, if you come in with me won't I be beat up less?

708
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:49,420
Hmm, I would get beaten with you. Go in.

709
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,490
Jeong Hwan, from this point I'm going alone.

710
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,090
Mom... I'm sor—

711
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:28,050
Come home early. What time is it already.

712
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:36,010
Director, how could you decide without telling me?

713
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,700
No, that's not what I mean.

714
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,320
Never mind. Let's talk in the office tomorrow.

715
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,470
Punk!

716
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,930
Why didn't you come home last night?

717
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:52,760
If you like your friend that much, just live there.

718
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,230
Huh? Dong Ryong.

719
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:00,240
Let's stop here.

720
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,770
Don't say anything.

721
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:24,560
Noona, I will eat dinner then go to the study room.

722
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:33,180
After going to the study room and studying until 1 AM, it will probably be 1:10 when I reach home.

723
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,700
What does that have to do with me?

724
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,260
I'm just saying.

725
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:49,090
And just in case, I will wait in front of your house for ten minutes.

726
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,890
Hey, are you crazy? Why would you wait?

727
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,160
It's up to me.

728
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,240
You don't have to worry, Noona.

729
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,490
Hey!

730
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:37,120
Come to my room. Let's eat chicken.

731
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,270
Chicken?

732
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,450
Because it's my dad's birthday, my mom ordered chicken.

733
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,970
Eat dinner before you go. Your mom has been told already.

734
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,590
What about Taek?

735
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,850
They arrived earlier.

736
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:52,040
Hey, does Noona Bo Ra  keep a turtle in her car?

737
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,460
What is this? You didn't go home?

738
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:59,260
- He said he ran away again. 
 - What?

739
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:04,250
It's a house where there's no answer. I'm going home after eating this.

740
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:07,040
Now that I think about it, they didn't even know I ran away.

741
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,680
So why would I run away?

742
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,180
Is it good?

743
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,840
We'll eat it well!

744
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,460
Ahjumma, have some with us

745
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,340
I bought ten and distributed it around so everyone is probably eating chicken now.

746
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,000
Whoa...

747
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,400
My dad as well?

748
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,550
Of course. " Mr. Dog Crap" ...

749
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,470
Jeweler...

750
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:29,610
Yeah, your dad is having some too. Seon Woo's mom is taking care of him.

751
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,790
Please tell your husband that I said Happy Birthday.

752
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,290
I will. Eat a lot.

753
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,340
Yes!

754
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:51,090
It's your birthday. Will chicken be enough?

755
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:54,580
I wish my birthday would be over already!

756
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:59,590
Maybe because I haven't eaten fried food in a while...

757
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:17,440
Jeong Bong carry this.

758
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:20,540
What?

759
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,080
Oh god...

760
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:33,380
No, a person should know to throw things out.

761
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,000
Jeong Bong, you... Just  try taking after your dad!

762
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,040
Aiyoo.

763
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:42,880
Mother what is that?

764
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,010
This was in here?

765
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,060
What? Are you crazy?

766
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,390
You threw Kidong in the sea?

767
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,900
Hey! I didn't throw him, only his feet got wet.

768
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,980
Hey, you shouldn't do that to Taek.

769
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:01,010
- You also did this to his forehead. 
 - Me?

770
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,230
Look at that. Feigning ignorance.

771
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,400
Was it 8 or 9 years old?

772
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,490
- Nine years old.
- Right, 9 years old.

773
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,690
You wanted to wrestle so you wrestled Taek to the cement.

774
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,840
I did? Impossible.

775
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,820
Such a thick skinned friend.

776
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:18,320
Hey, Taek did you get four stitches?

777
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,300
That's attempted murder!

778
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,000
He was normal but then he became strange after that.

779
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,060
What do you mean? Because of that he came to his senses and became good at baduk.

780
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,230
- It's because of me. 
 - Because of you, my ass.

781
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:34,650
He was already a baduk prodigy at 6 years old. If not for you he would have been a pro sooner.

782
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:36,120
Right, you should take responsibility.

783
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,900
You should take responsibility forever.

784
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,870
Fine! I will take responsibility.

785
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,410
It's good for me. Such luck.

786
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:45,770
Are you crazy? What sin did Taekie commit?

787
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:47,800
Look at this jerk laughing.

788
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,450
You like Deok Seon, right?

789
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,860
No.

790
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:55,280
Now that I look at it, you match well. Do well.

791
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,150
What's with you guys? You must be crazy.

792
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:01,810
Hey, Taek. It's better to meet a girl like her. You should also learn to suffer.

793
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,790
Hey!

794
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,180
I'm going to the bathroom.

795
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,540
You were eating so much.

796
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,940
Are you going to poop?

797
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,910
Is poop coming?

798
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:15,290
Hey, how do you find Deok Seon?

799
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,870
Not bad, right Taek?

800
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:22,900
Hey! Is Taek crazy? There are a lot of girls chasing after him.

801
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,950
I like her.

802
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:32,470
Deok... You like women?

803
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:34,470
Really?

804
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:36,080
Yeah.

805
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:41,640
I like Deok Seon.

806
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:53,540
Not as a friend, but as a woman, I like her.

807
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,490
Wow! What's with you? Are you for real?

808
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:03,130
What are you saying?

809
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,290
Hey, you! Were you badly hurt in the sea?

810
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:08,380
Seriously?

811
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:12,750
- What's with you all of a sudden? 
 - Deok Seon as a woman?

812
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,970
- Hey! 
 - He must be sick.

813
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:18,170
Seriously?

814
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:20,870
You're not kidding, right?

815
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,500
With our relationship? 
  - Deok Seon as a woman?

816
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,860
What are you?

817

Deok Seon as woman?

818
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,680
Crazy.

 Wow!

 Wow, our Jeong Bong is so good. 

822
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:54,500
 You are really good. Our Jeong Bong could be a singer.

 Oh my. 

824
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,640
 He will save the family someday. 

825

You don't remember, right?

826
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,880
I do. Still, it was when I was 9 years old.

827
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,050
 Our Jeong Hwan. Should our Jeong Hwan try? 

828
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:12,780
 - Jeong Hwan come.  
 - It was when Jeong Hwan was 3 years old.

829
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:15,240
 Jeong Hwan... Start.

01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:55,490
 So smart. How do you sing so well? 

839
01:08:55,490 --> 01:09:00,280
- Mom's voice. 
 -   You did it so well, son.

845

It true. It was a year before she passed away.

 - You sing. 
 - Such nonsense.

01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:47,010
 but you can't sing a song for your mother?

 Never mind. It's hard for me too to come forward.

Yeah.

 - What did he say? 
 - Huh?

01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,490
Noona.

956
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:14,830
What?

957
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:17,070
Can I kiss you?

958
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,410
No!

959
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,560
Noona, good night!

960
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,220
Noisy! Keep quiet!

961
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:31,400
Sleep well.

962
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:39,480
♫   Your pretty eyes are filled with fragrance     ♫

963
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:44,380
♫    I couldn't forget   ♫

964
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:53,940
♫   Let's weave together beautiful stories 
that will always make me smile    ♫

965
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:58,970
♫   Let's weave together beautiful stories 
that will always make me smile    ♫

966
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:02,250
 Soo Yeon, you're here. 

967
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,970
 Soo Yeon, if you have any laundry give it to me. 

968
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:06,370
 Soo Yeon. 

969
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:08,790
 Who is Soo Yeon? 

970
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:12,390
 According to rumors, Dong Ryong's dad could play. 

971
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,020
 You played with Teacher Ryu? 

972
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,910
 You need to be alert. 

973
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:17,300
 There will be a big fight tonight. 

974
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,520
 I will not stand still! 

975
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,110
 Let go! 

976
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:25,020
 It's not the end until it's completely over, right? 

977
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,500
 What? 

978
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:28,970
 What? 

979
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,590
 Seon Woo will make a fuss if he knows. 

980
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:34,820
 What should we do about Seon Woo? 

981
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,960
 Should I tell you even that? 

982
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,550
 That would be it, Hyungnim. 

983
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:47,920
 I was about to tempt my fate. Just as I thought, 

984
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,470
 we went there for nothing. 

985
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:54,820
 If only she didn't talk about that then we wouldn't keep our hopes up. 

986
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,950
 Why isn't small Noona coming? 

987
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:59,900
 She must be eating with Taek. 

988
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:04,960
 What about you, Jeong Hwan? 

989
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,580
 You're going to go, right? 

990
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:08,500
 I can't. 

991
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:15,510
 Noona. Can I kiss you? 

992
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:17,250
 Jeong Hwan. 

993
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:23,740
