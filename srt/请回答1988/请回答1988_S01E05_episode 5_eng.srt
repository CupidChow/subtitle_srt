 Bowing his head begging for forgiveness.  

3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:05,070
Deok Seon, is your dad not back from work? What time is it right now?

4
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,220
There's still time left. Mom, do we take them   all off?

5
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,010
 Yes! 

6
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,740
Noona, I think Dad will be late today.

7
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,950
Jongno is in chaos.

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,400
 After the police threw tear gas, 

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,720
 people split up to Sejongro or Seoul Station.  

10
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,760
Stand your ground! Stand your ground!

11
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,810
Stand your ground! Stand your ground!

12
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,700
Ah, really!

13
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,690
You know you're not allowed to do stuff like that, right?

14
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,980
You just have to study well.

15
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,750
Thank you.

16
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,590
Look here, Student.

17
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,700
Come here.

18
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,000
Take this and eat something tasty.

19
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,570
Why are you not taking it?

20
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,610
Also, go home, make sure to wash up before going home.

21
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,280
Go home.

22
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,080
 Deok Seon, set the table. I'm bringing the rice. 

23
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,440
Okay!

24
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,120
Oh, ouch.

25
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,830
Mom, are you okay?

26
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,300
Let me see.

27
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,090
Oh my!

28
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,260
Oh my, it's bleeding!

29
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,310
- It hurts a lot.
 - Bandage, bandage!

30
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,520
Aigoo, it's okay. It's okay.

31
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,330
It's no big deal, let's eat. You're hungry, right?

32
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,680
So why do you transfer at Jongno, that's the place where a lot of students protest.

33
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,690
Then what should I do? Other places are more dangerous.

34
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,570
Jongno, Euljiro, Daehakro all are full of protesting students.

35
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,890
What should I do? My suit got dirtied from the tear gas. It's hard to take it out.

36
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,640
Aigoo, even my eyes sting.

37
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,460
By the way, about Bo Ra. Is she not home yet?

38
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,050
Seong Bo Ra is busy these days.

39
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,920
Right, right.

40
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,630
Your sister must be working hard studying.

41
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,480
When you become a college student, you have to study hard.

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,700
And you two, be alert and study hard

43
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,560
like your sister, okay?

44
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,130
I'm back.

45
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,830
Our daughter is back!

46
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,720
Come eat, you haven't eaten yet right?

47
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,150
Come hurry and eat.

48
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,570
Aigoo, what's this smell?

49
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,520
Oh my. Hey, are you protesting?

50
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Hey, stop there, stop there! Come here, come here.

51
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,480
Oh my! This girl is protesting!

52
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,470
You wretch, are you in your right mind?

53
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,140
Do you want to see your father foam up and pass out?

54
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,600
Ah why are you like this? Why do you care, Dad?

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,500
Why do I care? How can I not care, you wench?

56
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,300
I mean, how can a person attending university do protesting?!

57
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,370
This wretch is out of her mind.

58
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,490
Do you think I work so hard to earn money

59
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,440
so that I can see you protest in university?

60
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,620
Bo Ra, hurry up and say sorry.

61
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,610
Are you crazy, why would I? What did I do wrong?

62
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,380
Oh my, look at how this girl is saying when she did nothing right.

63
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,990
- Dad, Dad!
 - I'll kill you!

64
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,910
Bo Ra say that you won't do it again. Hurry.

65
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,350
Ah, really! What do you know?!

66
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,200
Bo Ra, Bo Ra!

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,490
Bo Ra, what about dinner? Eat something before sleep, Bo Ra!

68
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,440
Mom will make your favorite fried egg.

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,000
Fried Egg? What bullsh*t are you saying? Are you crazy?

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,310
That wretch! Every single piece of rice that goes inside that wretch is wasteful!

71
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,470
How can a university student protest?

72
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,080
Oh my, oh my, Father, Mother, your granddaughter lost her mind

73
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,510
and is going to bankrupt the family by protesting!

74
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,620
You are studying so well.

75
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,380
What a celebration!

76
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll kill you.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,280
♫  In the two arms that embrace me  ♫ (Kim Kwang Suk's "At Gwang-Ya")

78
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,580
♫   There is a trail of blood in the white clothes    ♫

79
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,270
♫  The sun rising in the Pacific Ocean  ♫

80
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,910
♫  The vast fields of Manchuria.  ♫

81
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:50,570
♫    How are we so poor?   ♫

82
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:57,220
♫    What should we do?   ♫

83
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:03,990
♫   I stand in the field again      ♫

84
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:15,470
♫   while the warm earth is grasped   ♫

85
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,240
What? Bo Ra?

86
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,590
Wow, that girl has big liver (meaning she has nothing to fear)? What if she gets arrested?

87
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,300
Aigoo, I don't know who she resembles that she does that.

88
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,760
It's okay!

89
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,770
There's no college student who doesn't protest these days. They all do it.

90
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,430
It's okay as long as they don't stand in the front. Don't worry.

91
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,830
That's right, that's right, Hyung-nim. That thing they do in the front?

92
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,540
If she doesn't do that, then it's okay. Don't worry too much.

93
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,900
Don't you know how stubborn she is?

94
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,260
Her dad was in an uproar but she just wouldn't apologize.

95
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,280
She opened her eyes wide and talked back to her father.

96
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,360
Now that you say it, Bo Ra and her dad really aren't close. Isn't the eldest daughter normally close with her father?

97
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,370
What do you mean? They're extremely close!

98
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,340
They only look like that one the outside, but they're not.

99
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,840
Bo Ra is the problem, it's not her father.

100
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,620
Is Bo Ra gentle or does she have aegyo (acting cute)?

101
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,900
I like Deok Seon way better even if she's last place all the time.

102
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,260
I am afraid of Bo Ra myself.

103
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,670
Still, just wait. She'll become a big deal later. She's not normal. (average)

104
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,970
She's not normal. She definitely isn't.

105
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:27,300
Aigoo... I don't even wish for her to become a big deal.

106
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,060
I just wish she doesn't get expelled from school.

107
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,000
But, that guy is popular these days.

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,950
He's handsome, tall, and has a great body.

109
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,770
Who, who is it? (TV commercial for Reebok sneakers)

110
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,030
All of the kids will imitate him now.

111
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,950
All of the chairs will probably break.

112
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,470
Underwear.
 (It's kind of like a pajama underwear. You wear it underneath clothes when it's cold)

113
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,370
3, 2,1, START!

114
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,240
Seon Woo, show me one more time.

115
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,260
Hey, where are you going?

116
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,400
Yes, he just arrived.

117
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,770
Hey, hey!

118
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,840
Hey, hey, hey!

119
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
 Science 

120
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,290
Jin Joo, I'm okay. It doesn't hurt, not even a bit.

121
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,860
Give me a kiss, that way I will get better soon.

122
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,030
Jin Joo, "Run Hani" (TV show) has started.

123
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,100
That's right!

124
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,530
Mom, you can go out now. The ligament just stretched a little. It's okay. Go out and do what you need to do.

125
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,580
Isn't there anything you want to eat?

126
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,930
Am I a kid? There's nothing.

127
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm going to make beef broth.

128
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,140
Huh?

129
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,360
Beef broth.

130
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,400
Ah, Mom!

131
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,800
Is there something else you want? I will buy it for you.

132
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,380
I am okay, I don't want anything.

133
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,880
Please give me 300 won (30 cents) worth of bean sprouts and tofu.

134
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,150
 2,000 won (About 2 dollars) 

135
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,950
It's 700 won (about 70 cents) in total.

136
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,440
Buy a banana. I heard that Seon Woo got a cast.

137
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,850
How much is one?

138
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,720
₩ 2000.

139
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,270
Aigoo, you're buying it once because he's sick. It's not like you'll buy it again.

140
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,200
Jin Joo, I bought a banana!

141
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,280
Really?

142
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,150
Can I have some?

143
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,870
Is it that good?

144
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,940
What about Oppa? Did you give one to Oppa?

145
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,330
- Yes.
 - Good job.

146
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:20,030
Deok Seon, Deok Seon. Go home, it's getting late.

147
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,230
Are you worrying about me in your position?

148
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,080
He doesn't worry about you, but about himself.

149
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,720
He'll be able to sleep only if you leave.

150
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,010
Aren't you going home?

151
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,740
What are you two going to do if I leave?

152
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,450
Why do you care!?

153
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,580
Hey, hey, hey!

154
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,380
Stop fighting, and hurry up and go home . . . both of you.

155
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,180
I don't even have money.

156
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,500
Do I have to borrow from Hyung-nim again?

157
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,660
I always run out just when I need it.

158
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:32,860
When will I be able to live with 1,000 briquettes stacked to the ceiling?

159
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,300
 Episode 5: Preparing for Winter 

160
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,580
 Person who ordered briquettes! 

161
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,060
- WE! 
- YES!

162
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,670
Yes, yes, yes. We ordered it!

163
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,410
- Yes, yes welcome! 
- Yes!

164
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,050
- Yes, I am coming!!

165
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,230
Aigoo.

166
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,480
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

167
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,360
All right! All right, all right!

168
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,080
All right! All right, all right!

169
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,110
All right! All right!

170
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,780
All right! Okay, okay!

171
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,760
I should bring out some drinks for you guys.

172
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,790
Who knew I would ever see a day like this?

173
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,370
Hyung-nim, today is the day you receive the briquettes!

174
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,250
Wow!

175
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,130
How many are those?

176
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,100
One thousand.

177
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,800
Oh my. You really are rich.

178
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,930
If it's one thousand, how much money is that?

179
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,180
When will I be able to stack briquettes like this in my life?

180
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,480
Why are you like this? I was using firewood just three years ago.

181
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,660
You're right, you're right. You were also like that, right?

182
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,340
It hasn't been that long, but I've forgotten all about it.

183
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,290
Ah, by the way. Don't cook dinner today.

184
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,490
Why not?

185
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,730
I made abalone porridge. I heard that Seon Woo hurt his leg.

186
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,530
Why did you make abalone porridge?

187
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,460
Then please give me just a bit. Someone is coming to visit tonight.

188
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,870
Who?

189
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,070
The grandmother of the children.

190
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,300
What?!

191
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,190
Why would she come?

192
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,830
How much is she going to aggravate you this time?

193
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,310
Is she coming here to see me? She's coming to see her precious grandchildren.

194
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,190
I don't care anymore.

195
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,350
She treated you so terrible after Seon Woo's father died.

196
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,680
She kept saying that you "ate up" your husband.

197
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,690
How much did she vent at you, honestly?

198
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,100
Is it so great to be a mother-in-law? Did she earn that position?

199
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,020
Whenever I think about that day, my blood flows the opposite direction even while sleeping.

200
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,410
Is she the only one who lost someone? Does she not think of her daughter-in-law who became a widow at a young age?

201
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,930
She said that you guys should never see each other again because are unlucky.

202
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:11,050
So why does she comes all the time just to upset you?

203
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,030
It's okay, Hyung-nim. Why are you getting this upset?

204
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,670
I'm upset for you just from watching.

205
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,600
Aigoo, you can't even say a word, like fool. So frustrating.

206
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,620
What's the point of saying anything? It'll just hurt my own mouth.

207
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,180
I really don't care anymore. I'm just going to think of her as a stranger.

208
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,640
But are you going to dress like this?

209
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,290
Why, what's wrong with this?

210
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,820
You don't have anything new?

211
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,080
It's okay. Is looks important?

212
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,860
Even though I look like this, I'm not embarrassed at all.

213
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,000
As you can see, I really do not care.

214
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,140
Wear this.

215
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,420
- Ah, nice.
 - It won't suit you, it doesn't look right.

216
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,390
Give it to me, I'll wear it.

217
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,870
Try it, then.

218
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,200
Seon Woo.

219
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,550
If there's anything you need, call me immediately, okay?

220
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,860
Yes. Good bye.

221
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,470
Did you run out of rice?

222
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,760
I'm going to buy it today.

223
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,780
- Buy it beforehand-
- I'll take care of it myself.

224
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,760
Why is Seon Woo so skinny?

225
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,150
He lost more weight than before.

226
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,710
Do you not care about the children?

227
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,300
Also, do you have nothing but that to wear?

228
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,820
Look at how you look. So gloomy.

229
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,260
So pitiful. Any luck coming to you will run away.

230
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,860
And why is the house so cold?

231
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,530
Do you not light the briquettes?

232
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,580
What are you going to do if the children catch a cold?

233
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,950
Anyway, what do you do in the house?

234
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,520
Do you earn money, or do you work?

235
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,020
You 'ate' my son.

236
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,120
You live on my kid's pension and live in my house.

237
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,830
But can't you even raise the kids properly?

238
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,930
We're living well.

239
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,250
I will raise my children well, don't worry about it.

240
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,640
How could I not worry when you're living like this?

241
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,200
Are you doing this on purpose to show me?

242
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,890
Are you trying to prove that you have a strong fortune?

243
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,050
Why did he like this kind of girl?

244
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,560
This is an ill-fate among ill-fates.

245
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,300
What horrible sin did I do before that made me meet a girl like you?

246
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,210
Why do you have to put it like that?

247
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,100
I am also... my mother's precious daughter.

248
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,260
If my mom knew that I was hearing horrible words like this,

249
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,050
she would weep tears of blood.

250
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,750
I will no hear such horrible words

251
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,100
at least for my pitiful mother's sake.

252
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,370
Mother-in-law, don't visit us from now on.

253
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,530
I will make sure

254
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,500
my children go to college, even by shaving my head.

255
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,730
Even though I can't buy brand-name shoes for my children,

256
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,300
I don't starve them

257
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,650
and even buy them pretty clothes.

258
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,080
I will live so that they will not be embarrassed.

259
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,990
So, Mother, please!

260
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,510
Don't come here anymore!

261
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,010
So that the three of us can live comfortably,

262
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,320
please don't come here anymore!

263
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,170
From now on I won't see you anymore.

264
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,120
Even if you come, I won't open the door for you!

265
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,550
Do you understand, Mother-in-law?!

266
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,250
Buy the kids some clothes.

267
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,980
Forget it.

268
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,610
Did I say that I'm giving it to you? I'm giving it to my babies.

269
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,490
Where did such an item come from?

270
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't need it. I will buy my kids clothes.

271
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,900
Good bye.

287
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,990
Is it because you're lonely?

288
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,700
- Hello.
 -Yes.

289
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,070
Right. Is Taek home? Did he come home yesterday?

290
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,060
Yes. He came home yesterday.

291
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,780
Dad, warm water isn't coming out.

292
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,700
- Hello.
 -Yeah...

293
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,480
Taek, you didn't eat breakfast yet, right?

294
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,810
- Yes.
 - I made some abalone porridge so come and get it.

295
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,690
I set some aside for you.

296
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,950
Thank you.

297
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,660
You have a microwave at home, right?

298
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,120
Yes.

299
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,600
Keep it inside the refrigerator. Whenever you eat some, pour it in a different plate and put it in the microwave.

300
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,100
You have a small bowl at home, right? Not one that is glass but ceramic, right?

301
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,940
Put about two scoops in a small bowl and...

302
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,050
Forget it. I'll call your dad. Go on.

303
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,290
Good bye.

304
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,750
What are you doing in the morning, Hee Dong? Did you come home yesterday?

305
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,450
Yeah. But you didn't go to school?

306
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,810
Hey, today is Sunday.

307
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,090
- Ah...
 - I envy you.

308
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,230
Jeong Hwan, buy me one block of tofu.

309
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,050
Yes. Let's go.

310
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,390
- I'll eat it well.
 - Okay.

311
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,630
Special Forces, open your eyes.

312
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,170
Oh! It's Taek. Hi, Taek.

313
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,330
Oh, hi.

314
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,580
- You weren't able to sleep well?
 - Yeah.

315
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,730
Deok Seon!

316
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,100
Taek, when did you come back?

317
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,610
Last night.

318
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,620
What are you doing here when your leg is hurt?

319
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,080
Oh... Deok Seon, Lend me a Kor-Eng dictionary.

320
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,910
Mine? Did you come to borrow mine with that leg?

321
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,860
Don't you have a Kor-Eng dictionary?

322
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,470
Yeah, I don't.

323
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,450
Really?

324
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,920
Of course. Hers is totally new.

325
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,420
It's better to borrow it from 'Special Forces' than to buy a new book.

326
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,220
Shut up.

327
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,560
Is your leg okay?

328
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,530
My ligament is just slightly stretched. It's okay.

329
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,860
Seon Woo, then stay here for a moment. I'll bring it out.

330
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,740
No, no. I can walk this much.

331
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,710
Hey, hey!

332
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,490
It's okay.

333
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,470
It's okay.

334
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,060
No, no. Please do the opposite side.

335
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,030
I'm okay. Deok Seon, it's okay.

336
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,780
It's okay.

337
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,370
It's okay, it's okay. Be careful of the stairs.

338
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,100
It's cold.

339
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,630
Mother, the room is cold. Was the briquette turned off?

340
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,530
Your dad turned it off at midnight.

341
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:06,120
I turned it on a moment ago, so just wait a little bit. Jeong Bong, give me the bowl.

342
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,680
Go to your room.

343
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,240
Dear, the toilet is clogged again.

344
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,400
Honey, put the spoons on the table.

345
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,460
Lower the volume.

346
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,050
Yes. Mom, have you seen the newspaper?

347
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,700
- Mother!
- What is it?

348
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,000
I cut my finger.

349
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,870
Where, where?

350
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,430
Where, where?

351
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,990
Honey, Mi Ran! The steamed eggs are overflowing. Hurry up and come.

352
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,610
Turn off the stove then.

353
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,930
Mom, which newspaper is this?

354
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,260
I turned off the fire.

355
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,250
It's still overflowing. Hurry up and come!

356
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,900
Mom, what about today's newspaper? Where's today's newspaper?

357
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,140
The egg is going to explode! Hurry up and come!

358
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,400
You're not going to die!

359
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,950
Why are you like this to me only?

360
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,110
I should just-

361
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,140
Oh my, oh my. Did the sun rise in the west?

362
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,170
What are you talking about?

363
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:42,140
Our Deok Seon isn't sleeping late on Sunday and woke up early.  I'm seeing her eat like that.

364
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,480
Dad, I'm going to the library these days. I have to go right after I eat breakfast.

365
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,020
Oh my. Aigoo, it seems like our daughter is going to start studying.

366
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,420
When did you start going to the library without telling Dad?

367
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,920
Today is her first day. Second Noona didn't even spend  one day there

368
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,250
Don't you know that the making a start is going half way?

369
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,670
I ate well. I want to hurry up and go to the library.

370
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,900
Wow...

371
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,760
Dad, you don't know that Little Noona has a chronic illness, right?

372
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,690
Chronic illness? What are you talking about?

373
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,670
What chronic illness does our Deok Seon have?

374
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:59,390
♫ With your chin cupped in your hands  ♫

375
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,830
♫  What are you thinking about  ♫  

376
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:11,530
♫  Wearing a red shirt and jeans, you are thinking of going to the mountains  ♫  

377
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,720
♫  Siting down blinking your eyes  ♫  

378
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,030
♫  What are you thinking about  ♫  

379
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:27,820
♫  Wearing white shoes and a cap, you are thinking of going to the mountains  ♫  

380
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,170
Chronic illness?

381
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,550
What are you talking about? What kind of chronic illness does our Deok Seon have?

382
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,340
Drowsiness after eating.

383
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,000
It's been a long time since she got it.

384
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,820
♫  You shouldn't, you shouldn't  ♫  

385
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,860
♫ You shouldn't, you shouldn't  ♫  

386
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,400
♫   On the day after tomorrow     ♫

387
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,770
♫   It will be exam period. (It can't be!)♫ 

388
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,450
Anyway,

389
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,400
is Bo Ra still sleeping? I don't see her.

390
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,460
She went to school, to school. From tomorrow, it's final exam time.

391
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,590
She went out since early morning to get a seat at the library.

392
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,430
Did she go early in the morning to do protesting or whatever?

393
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,890
No. Why can't you believe a person's word?

394
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,220
She really left carrying a bag of books.

395
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,250
Oh my! That girl is really popular these days.

396
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,680
What was her name again?

397
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,970
Lee Mi Yeon. Wow.

398
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,260
How nice would it be if Lee Mi Yeon was our Noona?

399
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,150
She's the same age as Little Noona but how can they be so different?

400
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:41,390
Hey, she is

401
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,590
the same age as our Deok Seon?

402
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,110
Yeah. They're both eighteen years old. They're both the same age.

403
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,250
But someone looks like that but someone looks...

404
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,090
Hey you bastard? What's with our Deok Seon?

405
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,490
In my eyes, Deok Seon is a hundred, thousand times better.

406
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,630
That's right. In my eyes Deok Seon is better.

407
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,550
Father., right now the Cosby Family is on channel 7.

408
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,040
I'm going to play it again when Green Hou7se starts.

409
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,390
What is this?

410
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,780
Kim Jeong Bong, are you going to drop chips? Aren't you going to get rid of it?

411
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,650
Honey, move your feet. You'll smear it. Or wear socks.

412
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,910
Slip on some socks idiots.

413
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:02,250
Some ghost or something I don't know will have to clean  up and wipe off those footprints.

414
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,880
Hello? Is it Mi Sook?

415
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,210
Why did she go to the mountains again?

416
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,930
How much is it if she gathers chestnuts?

417
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,690
I understand. I'll go down immediately.

418
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,510
Why doesn't she go to the hospital? Wait, I'll take here there.

419
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,510
Hang up.

420
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,670
Maternal grandmother sprained her ankle.

421
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,890
Did she get hurt a lot?

422
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:36,380
I don't know. She said that she won't go to the hospital so I have to go down there immediately.

423
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,060
Let's go there. It's been a long time since I've been to my hometown.

424
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,780
Stay here. Do you want to starve the kids?

425
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,770
I'm going to be gone for about two days.

426
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,080
If you want to live, listen carefully to what I have to say.

427
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:10,960
Here are the underwears, undershirts, and socks. Understand?

428
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:17,170
Here. The briquette turned off. Then what should you do?

429
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,420
- Charcoal? 
 - Bingo!

430
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,890
Here. If it sticks together?

431
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,690
- Kitchen knife?
-That's right!

432
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,810
This is marinated beef. You just need to fry it in the fry pan.

433
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,060
If you don't eat vegetables today, they'll spoil. So make sure you eat them during lunch and dinner.

434
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,770
And pour the salad and beans in a separate bowl and eat them. Understand?

435
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,260
Question.

436
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,230
Can't we just order food?

437
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,500
I said to make it! I made all the side dishes!

438
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,600
Make sure you check the gas stove.

439
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,380
And drain the toilet water all the day or else it'll clog. Make sure you eat all the vegetables by today. Okay?

440
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,500
And Jeong Hwan, you know that when you make the rice about the water. Until the back of the hand.

441
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,660
I understand. I understand. Mother-in-Law will be waiting.

442
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,920
Good bye.
-Good bye.

443
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,460
My feet won't leave. My feet won't leave.

444
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,860
Right, Jeong Hwan, I ironed your uniform and  work out clothes and put them in your room.

445
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,280
Go, go. Hurry up and go. We'll take care of it. Leave the alley.

446
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,160
Go and play!

447
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,850
There, there.

448
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,270
 Don't Sleep Library 

449
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,020
Hey. Stop sleeping.

450
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,900
How many hours did you sleep?

451
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,650
If you're going to be like this, go home and sleep.

452
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,870
What time is it?

453
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,020
- The sun set already. 
- 7 o'clock.

454
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm going to my house for a moment.

455
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,740
Why? Did something happen at your house?

456
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,340
I have to eat dinner.

457
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,930
Why are college students like that these days?

458
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,280
What should they do...

459
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,290
Don't they know that if they do that they'll rip their parents' hearts?

460
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,720
Right, Deok Seon.

461
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,810
You studied hard in the library today, right?

462
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,650
Yeah, yeah.

463
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,640
That's right. This father

464
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,030
doesn't even wish for you to do well as your sister.

465
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,590
Just half.

466
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,540
Just do the half. Then I will

467
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,780
run two hundred times around the neighborhood carrying you.

468
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,790
Look at your sister.

469
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,230
Because she studied hard since she was young,

470
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,680
she goes to college and studies hard.

471
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,630
So you, too, please get a hold over yourself and study hard. Understand?

472
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,000
No Eul, you just be healthy.

473
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,550
What's wrong?

474
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,420
What should I do?

475
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,510
Oh my, what's going to happen to our Bo Ra?

476
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,900
I'm going to go out for a moment.

477
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,340
Where is my outerwear?

478
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,820
Wait. Wait for a moment. Where is my clothing?

479
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,240
Aigoo, aigoo. Bo Ra, it's okay.

480
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,340
It's okay if you come. It's okay.

481
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,280
You girl, come here! Let's do it with me today!

482
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,660
Let me go!

483
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,240
Hey, you crazy b*tch! Have you decided to ruin your life?

484
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:15,240
You bit**.   Do I need to fall down in front of you foaming at the mouth for you to get your head on straght?

485
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,500
You! If you get arrested for protesting,

486
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,460
you will get a red line on your life.

487
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,300
If you get a line on the family register, you'll ruin the house!

488
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:36,650
Not only does it ruin but what are you going to do about your mom?

489
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:42,700
What are you going to do about your mom who only believed in you her whole life? Will your mom

490
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,960
your mother,

491
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,100
will live in her right mind all her life?

492
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:55,340
Huh? Will she? Still you protest? Still you protest, you wretch!

493
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:00,260
No Eul, bring me the scissors. I will cut her hair so that she won't be able to go around.

494
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,160
Bring the scissors, you bastard!

495
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,700
Bo Ra, hurry up and say your sorry. Say sorry to your father.

496
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,140
Why should I? What did I do wrong?!

497
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,520
What did you do right that you speak? Do you want to die, you wretch?!

498
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,880
Bo Ra's father, she won't do it anymore. She won't do it anymore.

499
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,280
Did she ever listen to what we said?

500
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:26,320
From now on, you don't need school or anything. You will stay inside your room. Understand?!

501
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:32,580
Until you say that you'll never do protesting and beg for forgiveness,

502
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:37,820
don't come out of the room. And you,

503
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,300
don't give her a drop of water until she begs for forgiveness. Understand?

504
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,560
Hurry up and say you're sorry, Seong Bo Ra!

505
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,740
I didn't do anything wrong.

506
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,520
What? Come here, you wretch!

507
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,020
Bo Ra's father. Bo Ra's father.

508
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:58,260
Honey, listen carefully, if anyone gives her a drink of water,

509
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,320
I will turn over this whole family!

510
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,840
No one care if she lives or dies. Understand?

511
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,880
I understand.

512
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:16,320
No one care. No one care.

513
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,860
It's a plague year. How did we ever raise her?

514
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:30,440
Even though we trembled because what we ate and wore because we had nothing, still whatever went inside her mouth

515
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,940
wasn't wasteful so we fed and gave her clothes.

516
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,400
Outstanding daughter, smart daughter, she had a spirit which did not kill ohters and

517
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,700
We did our best for her,  Bloody hell bit**!

518
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:48,760
The girl who knows how to  hammer a nail in her parent's heart?

519
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,740
All her sunbaes got arrested. Is my sister going to get arrested too?

520
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,760
What if my sister becomes a ex-convict?

521
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,820
If you see it like that, then all our nation's college students are ex-convicts.

522
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:17,000
Don't worry. And even if she goes to the police, she'll come out quickly if she writes a confession statement.

523
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,280
What is a confession statement?

524
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,200
Con-, writing that you did wrong. There's something you write that you did wrong.

525
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,400
If she writes that, she'll be released quickly.

526
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,620
Failed, failed. Our unni is Seong Bo Ra.

527
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,920
She will never say that she did wrong. You know my unni's temper too.

528
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,660
I know, I know. But you said that Noona Bo Ra came home. Then it's okay.

529
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,700
You've come?
-Yeah.

530
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,780
What are you two talking about?

531
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,000
What?

532
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,320
What are you two doing?

533
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,500
What do you mean what, bastard? We're telling stories between friends. Story, story.

534
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,400
Why are you like this? I'm leaving.

535
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,520
Where are you going?

536
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,120
- To the library.
-What?

537
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,720
Deok Seon goes to the library.

538
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,800
Do you know what time it is? The sun already set.

539
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,160
I'll come before 12 o'clock. I'm person who does it if I say it.

540
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,360
Hey, even if your face is a weapon being out past 12 is dangerous.

541
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,280
Just give up college, like me.

542
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,880
The library is right in front. I'll come before 12. I'm leaving.

543
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,240
Okay, go, Friend.

544
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:42,720
Yes, this is Master Choi's house. Yes, yes, yes.

545
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,590
Who is it? Is it the academy?

546
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,680
Your dad. What?

547
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,470
He said that he's hungry. He told you to hurry up and come and make food.

548
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,590
What is this?

549
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,510
Younger Brother.

550
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,100
Grandpa said,

551
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,980
Doing every sport is contraction and expansion.

552
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,570
Pour cold water on top of warm water to achieve thermal equilibrium.

553
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,280
By the perfect migration of specific heat

554
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,750
the two will be separated.

555
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,280
Son,

556
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,000
is the rice finished? Should I help?

557
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,010
Dad, it's burning.

558
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,580
The fire doesn't go there. Come here and sleep.

559
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:39,020
Don't mind whether if I freeze to death or not. What if she goes out while I'm sleeping?

560
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:44,060
I'm going to be like this the whole night, so don't mind and hurry up and sleep.

561
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,040
And Deok Seon is not home yet? It's almost 12 o'clock.

562
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,480
A grown up girl should hurry up and come home.

563
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,850
Did she fall asleep?

564
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,780
 I'm here. 

565
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,060
 Okay. Come home early. 

566
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,360
 I understand. 

567
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,880
 Seon Woo, let's eat!
-Okay. 

568
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,540
Mom, you're going to eat here. It's okay. Eat outside.

569
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:03,580
The room is warm. It's better. Let's eat here.

570
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,760
Mom, why aren't you eating?

571
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:22,180
I'll eat. The side dishes are scarce. There's only vegetables.

572
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,540
I should feed some meat to my son.

573
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,340
Forget it. I don't really like meat.

574
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,820
It tastes good.

575
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,540
Who is it in the morning?

576
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,880
Yes. Mom, what's up?

577
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:51,820
Huh?  Is he hurt badly?  Tae Soo is so clumsy?  Which hospital, Mom?

578
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:57,240
Even if it have to go to Gimhae, I said I will do it.  I will go, truly, Mom.

579
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,960
Mom, Tae Su is an adult whom you should arrange a marriage for.

580
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:07,320
What? You're going to come to my house?

581
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,720
Terminal? You arrived in Seoul?

582
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:18,060
 I have something to give to you. So that I can see Seon Woo and Jin Joo, I'll visit you for a moment. 

583
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,600
 It'll take only thirty minutes if I take a bus from here. 

584
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,660
 You don't need to come out. I'll just take the taxi. 

585
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,660
 I'm going to visit for a moment. I'll only drink a cup of water and go. 

586
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,320
 You don't need to stress about it. 

587
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,000
 See you later. 

588
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,920
Dad, you're not going to work today?

589
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,080
Today is pay day.  But you're watching Big Noona.

590
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,560
We still need to feed her food. She didn't eat dinner yesterday.

591
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:03,980
I said no. Until she begs for forgiveness with her own month, we will never.

592
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:08,400
We worked hard to earn that money so that she can go to an expensive college, but she protests.

593
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,280
She'll come to her senses if we starve her. So don't try to give her anything. Understand?

594
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:31,880
Dad. Did the briquette fire get turned off?

595
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,140
I don't think so. I replaced it in the middle of the night.

596
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,940
It's so cold.

597
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,860
The fire is still alive. What's the problem?

598
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:57,560
Grandpa said, "There are two kinds of briquette boilers.

599
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,720
Some briquette smoke directly warms the floor or by means of the briquette water is warmed and

600
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,600
the water warms the room.  We have two choices.

601
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,420
If it's according to the latter, even if we change the briquette, has our house not gotten warmer?

602
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,060
In that kind of case, the problem is

603
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:21,850
exactly this.  The probability is 100% that the water to make hot water is all gone.

604
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:33,970
Younger Brother, what's for breakfast today?

605
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:37,540
Yeah. Something you like the most.

606
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,510
Perhaps, ramyun?

607
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,100
Spread something. spread something.

608
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,200
The best!

609
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,600
What about Dad?

610
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,460
Dad! Eat breakfast.

611
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,260
Kids, the toilet is clogged again.

612
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,140
I don't think I'll be able to eat.
-What should I do? It doesn't unclog with a toilet plunger.

613
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:24,740
Grandfather said this:  If the land is full of sh*t, you will enjoy  wealth..

614
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,780
The feeling is good today.

615
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,540
Stop talking bullsh*t and hurry up and come and do something about this.

616
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:59,060
Then, quickly finish the job, director of ssonteun.

617
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:11,760
Seon Woo! Jin Joo! Maternal grandma is coming! It's an emergency! Emergency!

618
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,840
Change your clothes. Don't eat and clean the table.

619
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,840
This, this. First wash up.

620
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,140
I have to go to school.

621
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,180
Right.

622
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,290
Come here.

623
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:03,520
I'll return it after using it for a moment!

624
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,960
And this too!

625
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,030
Jeong Bong, help me!

626
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,170
Aigoo. It's falling.

627
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,900
I did it all.

628
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,720
Jeong Bong, thank you very much. I'll return it to you later.

629
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,640
You can slowly give it.

630
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:53,980
Wow. This is perfect. I won't get caught, right?

631
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:04,260
This is sesame seed. And this cassia seed.

632
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,140
Boil it for Seon Woo. It's good for the eyes.

633
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,220
Mom, Seoul sells these things too. Why did you carry these heavy stuff?

634
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:16,040
Aigoo, really...
-And Mom, eat and go.

635
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:22,300
I talked to Tae Soo and he's fine.

636
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,120
Mom, you can go slowly.

637
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,120
No. I have to hurry up and go.

638
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,960
Jin Joo, I'm leaving.

639
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,260
Already?

640
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:53,060
Mom, it hasn't been ten minutes since you've arrived.

641
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,040
What can I do if I stay here longer?

642
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:11,670
It'll only stress you out more. I'm going to leave.

643
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:16,560
Mom, stay a little longer!

644
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,900
Grandma, you really don't listen.

645
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:26,200
Where is the bathroom? Since I drank juice...

646
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,290
There.

647
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,230
Go home! Hurry.

648
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:52,900
Grandma, you're really in a hurry.

649
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,470
Why has Seon Woo's maternal grandmother come?

650
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:59,760
Yes. Hello. You're doing well, right?

651
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,030
Yes. But are you leaving already?

652
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:08,060
Aigoo, my son hurt his leg so I have to hurry up and go to the hospital.

653
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,410
Then.

654
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,330
Yes. I'm leaving.

655
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,660
Mom is leaving!

656
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:17,030
Go safely.
-Yes.
-Bye, Mom.

657
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:21,150
Aigoo, she should sleep one night since it's been a long time since she met her daughter.

658
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,350
If she came because your younger brother got hurt, he must've got hurt badly.

659
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,650
It's because he is my kid brother.

660
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:28,730
She came here to spy on me.

661
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:33,090
She came to see how I live.

662
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:39,120
She's worried if I'm not able to earn food. You think I don't know?

663
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,240
Is that so?

664
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,540
Sungnim, look at me. I made a total show in the morning.

665
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:49,140
But I didn't get caught.

666
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,780
Right. Is Bo Ra okay?

667
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:58,130
No. Her dad didn't even go to work so he can spy on her.

668
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:03,290
That girl won't eat a bit of food. I'm so angry I could die.

669
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,320
Eat.

670
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:15,750
Bring it here.

671
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,140
Oh my. Is this all the side dishes?

672
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,750
It's all. Just eat it.

673
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:28,670
This person, you should give at least one fried egg.

674
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:31,430
Where is egg? We at all of it.

675
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:36,850
Anyway, what about you? Are you not going to eat together?

676
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,920
Do you think I'll be able to eat?

677
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,930
You're not a person.

678
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:54,060
Aigoo!
-Aigoo! Bo Ra's mother.

679
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,260
What are you doing outside when it's cold?

680
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:01,660
My heart feels cramped. Is Jeong Bong's mother not home yet?

681
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,430
Yes. She's coming tomorrow.

682
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,570
It's vacation for your family's boys.

683
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,830
It's chaotic, right?

684
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:10,490
No. We're living really well.

685
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:13,990
It's because we don't do it. If we do it, we're good at it.

686
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:20,470
Yes. Aigoo, he should wear socks. It's cold.

687
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,780
You're going to drink alcohol?

688
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,820
Yes. I should drink it while my wife is gone. Then when else should I be able to drink it?

689
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,650
Bo Ra's dad is home today.

690
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:33,430
Ah, really? Then we could drink it together.

691
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:36,270
Yes.

692
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,730
It's no use

693
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:58,430
no matter how much you give your kids education.

694
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:03,940
It doesn't matter how hard I work at educating them. They think they're all that.

695
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:07,010
Then everything will be okay, oh man.

696
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,870
Even so,

697
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:14,220
I wish our Jeong Bong would resemble at least half of Bo Ra.

698
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:21,220
Even though he's my child, he's so hazy,

699
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:23,090
I'm worried.

700
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:30,730
There's something nailed in my and my wife's heart

701
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:33,720
He was very spoiled when we raised him.

702
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,750
Even so, I'm still worried.

703
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:43,480
But is Bo Ra fine?

704
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:50,500
I'm not going to eat?

705
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,780
Eat a little. Are you going to die?

706
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,400
I'm not hungry. I have no appetite.

707
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:02,310
Just one spoon. Just eat one spoon and sleep.

708
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:06,660
I made something you like. Just eat one spoon.

709
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,990
I said that I'm not going to eat!

710
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:11,160
Just leave me alone!

711
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,310
Just one spoon, Bo Ra!

712
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,130
Just eat one spoon.

713
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:25,450
Then I'll put it here

714
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:29,460
so eat it whenever you want to. Understand?

715
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:35,480
If you don't want to eat it now, eat it later. Understand?

716
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,250
Jin Joo!

717
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:11,970
I have to wash it again, this girl.

718
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,860
Here. Arms

719
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,090
Who's daughter is Jin Joo?

720
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:25,530
Mom's daughter.

721
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,410
My child.

722
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:30,760
Do you want to eat something? What should we eat this dinner?

723
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,920
Banana.

724
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,050
Banana? We ate banana yesterday.

725
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,570
Banana.

726
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:43,120
I understand. I'll go out and buy it later.

727
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:21,180
 To my kind daughter, 

728
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:26,140
 I don't have money so I didn't put much. 

729
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:30,430
 My daughter, buy a piece of beautiful clothing. 

730
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:35,130
 My daughter, whom I love, live without losing confidence. 

731
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:40,810
 You didn't do anything wrong. Take care of your health. 

732
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:15,150
♫  On the day when you leave  ♫  

733
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,850
♫  The sky also rains  ♫  

734
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:21,700
Really, Grandma.

735
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:26,920
♫  The tears are not flowing.   ♫

736
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:37,350
♫  Its not a story that today is sad. 

737
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:45,850
♫  The hands which hold on to the tears which rain down for a long time get wet  ♫

738
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:51,650
When did she see that?

739
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,570
I can't live.

740
01:07:54,600 --> 01:08:06,730
♫  On the day you leave it rains  ♫

741
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:15,780
♫ Heaven cries on parting.  It's not the tears which are flowing.  ♫

742
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,890
Honey, the laundry.

743
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,270
Aigoo, you're doing well.

744
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,200
Seon Woo, have you not seen our Bo Ra?

745
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,640
Yes! I haven't seen her. Why? She's not home?

746
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,520
Where did she go? Where did she go?

747
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:59,750
No, I haven't seen her. She didn't come to our house.

748
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:07,740
Taek's father, have you seen Bo Ra? Did she not pass this way?

749
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,040
I haven't seen her.

750
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:12,790
Oh my. What should I do?

751
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:17,100
Bo Ra's mother. This.

752
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,990
You're Seong Bo Ra, right?

753
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,810
Seoul University Department of Mathematics Education, student Seong Bo Ra, right?

754
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,420
You know Jo Hong, right?

755
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:22,700
Leader of the union of student councils,  head of the student council at Seoul National University, Jo Hong.

756
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,280
You guys are executives.

757
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:31,690
You participated in the illegal civil rights demonstration and protest

758
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:34,500
at the Democratic party headquarters in Garak-dong, Songpa-gu, didn't you?

759
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:38,010
No. I didn't.

760
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:42,310
Look at this bastard. Why don't you acknowledge and go with us while we talk nicely.

761
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:44,280
Bo Ra!

762
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:58,800
It's not our daughter. You can't arrest my daughter.

763
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,370
Excuse me, Mother...
-Do you what kind of daughter my daughter is?

764
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:03,590
She's the smartest kid in this neighborhood.

765
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:07,400
She pushed the rich kids and always placed first.

766
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,580
Even though she has grades to get into Seoul Law School,

767
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,900
In her first year at Seoul National University she received a letter

768
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,460
written by the dean of the College of Education telling her she had won a scholarship.

769
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,630
Her dream when she was young was a prosecuter, lawyer, and a judge

770
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:20,420
but now in order that her parents don't have to worry about money,

771
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,870
she talked to the teacher

772
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:25,780
and applied to Seoul University. You know Seoul University, right?

773
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:29,120
She went to Seoul University, where the smartest kids in our nation go to,

774
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,570
without going to a tutor or academy and went in one try.

775
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:36,320
She, our daughter, is that kind of daughter.

776
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,910
Do you know often and how long our neighborhood celebrated?

777
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:42,640
Even in her father's company, they sent him flowers as a congratulation.

778
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,750
And do you know how it was when she graduated high school?

779
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:50,080
As the student representative, she went in front of the teacher and received an award.

780
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,490
Her mathematics score was placed in the top ten nationwide.

781
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:56,650
Her maternal uncle is chief of the borough office

782
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:59,430
so she's in a relationship where she eats with the team members.

783
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,900
She has a cousin that goes to medical school.

784
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,390
And do you how her father is?

785
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:10,410
He's been working in the Han Il Bank for twenty years and received an award.

786
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,730
They even ate dinner with her.

787
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:17,430
They said that there's not a smarter daughter like her in this world.

788
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:19,750
And manager of the bank directly gave her allowance.

789
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,850
He personally drove his car to the front of our house.

790
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:26,410
I did wrong. I did wrong.

791
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:29,320
Bo Ra what are you talking about? Don't say anything nonsense.

792
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,650
I did wrong.
-No! No!

793
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:34,540
Our daughter isn't that kind of kid. Our daughter isn't that kind of kid.

794
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:37,140
I did wrong! I will go to the police station.

795
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:40,060
No, Bo Ra! What did you do wrong?

796
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,010
Aigoo, our daughter isn't that kind of kid.

797
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:44,270
Let's go.
-No.

798
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,320
I said our daughter isn't that kind of kid.
-Let go, Ahjummoni.

799
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,170
Let go! Let go!

800
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:51,460
Our daughter isn't like that.

801
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:55,900
 Sometimes I was embarrassed of my mom. 

802
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,830
 Sometimes I was mad about 

803
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:02,760
 why mom doesn't have a bit of  honor or pride? 

804
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:07,150
 That is because 

805
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,970
 there is something more precious than herself. 

806
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:13,580
 Because it's for me. 

807
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,850
 I didn't know then. 

808
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:22,800
 When people get stronger, it's not through their pride 

809
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,250
 but when they throw away their pride. 

810
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:31,170
 So Mom is strong. 

811
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:34,780
 Mom, I'm here! 

812
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:37,230
My kid, you've come!

813
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:40,430
Jin Joo.

814
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:41,880
Were you doing well?

815
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,330
Did Jeong Hwan drop you off?

816
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:44,780
Of course.

817
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:47,190
It's good for him that he doesn't have to do late night studying because of me.

818
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:50,040
I'm going to wash up first.

819
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:57,290
Hello?

820
01:13:57,290 --> 01:14:00,330
Tae Soo, are you alright?

821
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:05,010
Aigoo, you bastard, what's your age that you still bother Mom?

822
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:09,680
How are you going to live without Mom? Is Mom not yet sleeping?

823
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:12,280
Give the phone to her then.

824
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,410
 Hello? 

825
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,980
Mom.

826
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:34,060
 Seon Yeong. H-hello? 

827
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:37,340
Why am I like this?

828
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,610
Mom... Mom...

829
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,260
♫  Someday it'll leave  ♫  

830
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:08,900
♫  This lively youth  ♫  

831
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:14,490
♫  Like a flower that falls and blooms again  ♫  

832
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:16,310
Mom...

833
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:19,550
♫  When nights when the moon is bright  v  

834
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:22,600
 They say that because gods can't be everywhere 

835
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,300
 they made moms. 

836
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,850
 Even though we become the age where we are moms, 

837
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,650
 Mom is still my protector.. 

838
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:37,560
 Still calling Mom is a name that hurts my heart. 

839
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:41,490
 Mom... 

840
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:43,720
 Is still strong... 

841
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:48,440
♫  We should rather let it go  ♫  

842
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,990
♫  We should turn around  ♫  

843
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:58,140
♫  That is how time goes  ♫  

844
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:02,810
♫  I'll probably 

845
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:06,580
♫  forgive the one who already left me  ♫  

846
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:12,220
♫  It is the time that goes leaving me behind  ♫  

847
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:17,350
♫  There is no place to leave attachments  ♫  

848
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:19,890
♫  Empty hearts  ♫  

849
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:22,330
Is Bo Ra okay?

850
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:24,720
Well, she will be released soon.

851
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,370
That's a relief. It's okay then.

852
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:30,180
It will be okay.

853
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:33,990
But it's time she comes out.

854
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:37,140
Didn't you quit smoking?

855
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:43,640
At this point a scolding would be good for the soul.

856
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:48,690
Sit her down and frown and give her a lot of fear.

857
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,440
This person, why should I scold her?

858
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,070
It's not like she did something bad.

859
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:59,160
Why should I bring her to her knees and give her a lot of fear

860
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,380
and scold her?

861
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,130
Banana.

862
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:56,960
The biggest one is Jin Joo's.

863
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,180
And this is our Mom's.

864
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,620
Stop. I'm not going to eat. You eat.

865
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:05,440
Then I'm not going to eat. Let's just throw this away.

866
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,490
Fine then. I'll eat it.

867
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,850
Jin Joo, does it taste good?

868
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:19,390
I'm home!

869
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,440
God's Shield?

870
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,920
What about Dad?

871
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,390
What about food?

872
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:29,410
I'm hungry.

873
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:33,820
Hurry up and come. I put all the left over side dishes and made fried rice. I fried dumplings.

874
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:38,480
Hello?

875
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,810
Who is it?
-Who is it?

876
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:53,800
Mom. She said she just arrived at the terminal.

877
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,310
Did you finish cleaning?

878
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:02,050
What are you doing? Hurry up and clean!

879
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:16,160
When did you play badminton?

880
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:08,910
What about the briquette? You didn't turn off the briquette?

881
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:12,500
Of course. That room is really warm.

882
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:18,190
What about the laundry? It rained. You didn't bring the laundry in, right?

883
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:21,630
We did. Hyung brought it all and put it in the wardrobe.

884
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:27,620
Honey, what did I say? We said that we'll be living fine.

885
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:31,270
We were totally comfortable without you.

886
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:34,220
Don't worry.

887
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:43,540
Honey, are you not hungry? I fried your favorite dumplings.

888
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,720
Forget it. You eat it.

889
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:05,050
Do you want to have a drink of Soju since it's raining?

890
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:08,360
What right do you have to drink soju at night?

891
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,090
Then should I heat some kimchi pancakes?

892
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:13,250
Forget it. Just go out and watch television.

893
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:23,650
Why? Why doesn't she feel good?

894
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:26,000
It seems like the house is dirty.

895
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,760
No way. We cleaned everything. Cleaning, laundry, dish washing everything perfectly.

896
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,900
We changed all the briquettes. We ate all the side dishes Mom told us to eat.

897
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:36,350
She probably was surprised. She doesn't have to raise a finger.

898
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:40,710
Jeong Hwan.
-Yeah?

899
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:02,630
Mom, Hyung burned his hand.

900
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,480
I can't live.

901
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:09,280
How old are you that you can't make ramyun properly?

902
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,860
It stuck again.

903
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:24,750
Scissors ...

904
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:40,070
Mom! Dad wasted briquettes again.

905
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:47,950
You're doing well, you're doing well. You can't even do anything properly. I can't live!

906
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,670
Mom, have you not seen my shorts?

907
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:01,500
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

908
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:07,630
Here it is. You can't even find that?

909
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:08,960
I didn't see it.

910
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,150
Gosh, you morons.

911
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:13,950
How can anyone live without me?

912
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,940
You can't even do anything proper.

913
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:22,460
Eat together. What kind of dumpling is it?

914
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:25,650
Kimchi dumpling, your favorite.

915
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:29,080
With soju?

916
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,820
If you want to.

917
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,320
I'm forcing myself to eat it.

918
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:40,440
Thank you. Let's go.

919
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:44,780
Jeong Hwan, you don't know why your mom is gloomy?

920
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,270
I don't know.

921
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:49,420
Because her family was living so well.

922
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:55,820
Even though the mom isn't there, the family was living so well.

923
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:05,790
Cheers! It's been a long time!

924
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,950
Been a long time? It's only been two days.

925
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:14,620
Nice! Honey, without you this time

926
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:17,040
I felt something.

927
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:21,480
These guys are all trash without you.

928
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:26,790
 When we've become the age to comfort Mom, 

929
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:32,750
 it's after we've matured to say "thank you" or "I love you" to Mom. 

930
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:37,390
 Right now if you want to make Mom happy, 

931
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:42,110
 It's just the words 

932
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:45,250
 "Mom, I need you" is enough. 

933
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:53,600
♫    All the stories which saddened you dear   ♫

934
01:24:54,970 --> 01:25:01,880
♫  Brush away those which were blamed on you   ♫

935
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:11,750
♫  Let the past be the past.   ♫

936
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:17,630
♫  That's what it means.   ♫

937
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:26,650
♫  Let's sing to those who have left  ♫

938
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:32,330
♫  Tell them that you loved them without regrets  ♫

939
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:39,450
Go home early.

Hey why are you moving around when your leg is hurt.

01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,790

Hey, I'm going to the bathroom. Go in my room.

954
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,420
Look at how he arranged them alphabetically. Such a pervert.

955
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,890

Do you want anything to drink?

961
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,170
 I have someone I like 

962
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:54,990
 I think he's going to do it soon. I got the feeling. It's time the phone call should be coming. 

963
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:58,610
 You're leg is going to fall off.

970
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:24,420
 The game begins now.

 Even in baduk, he's bashful before strangers.

01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,130
 Do you want to bet whether she comes or not? 

973
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,980
 She will come. Watch.
