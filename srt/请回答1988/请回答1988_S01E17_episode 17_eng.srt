 Don't Sleep Study Room 

4
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,950
It's probably difficult.

5
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:42,240
It's difficult and he has an appointment so of course he has to cancel.

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,040
No. But is it that difficult?

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,830
He was the one who set it up and he's the one cancelling it.

8
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,700
I must be crazy.

9
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,500
He must be tired. He must be meeting someone from the higher ups.

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,020
But then, what am I?

11
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,030
Am I nothing?

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,260
That's right. I am no one.

13
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,330
Well... It's not like I'm so great.

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,240
Hey, I thought you were going to watch a movie today. You didn't go to your appointment?

15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,690
What's with him? So annoying.

16
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,660
Right?

17
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,780
He's playing with a person.

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,470
I think I know it.

19
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,190
What?

20
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,080
Choi Taek. Baduk... You...

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,760
He takes you for a pushover.

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,910
What?

23
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,550
He takes you for a pushover—a pushover.

24
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,740
Right. What about Man Ok?

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,120
Man Ok has been forbidden to  go out.

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,580
I barely got to talk to her. She's not allowed to go a step out of her house.

27
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,880
What should we do? She needs to go on a date.

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,990
What date? It's all over.

29
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,980
Hey, you know tomorrow, right? We're going to eat pizza with Se Mi in Apgujeong tomorrow.

30
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,920
I know. How could I forget that. It's been a long while since I went to Apgujeong.

31
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,600
Aiyoo. Oppa, she's heavy. Give her to me.

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,370
No. It's okay. She's not heavy at all.

33
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,450
Let's go inside.

34
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,590
Can you not do that job anymore?

35
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm bored these days.

36
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,910
Oppa, what happened to your hand?

37
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,350
Nothing. It's okay.

38
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,470
What do you mean okay?

39
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,700
You should have put iodine on it before.

40
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,850
It's probably healed.

41
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,750
These days, I haven't seen the motorcycle. He must have gone to another neighborhood.

42
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,570
No. He comes once in a while. You should be careful.

43
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,970
Hey, I'm going. See you at Hanyang Shopping Center.

44
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,660
Okay. Bye.

45
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,220
Alright, pizza.

46
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,650
Hey, are you alright? Are you not hurt?

47
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,200
Yeah.

48
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh! Seong Deok Seon, you have fast reflexes.

49
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,490
You even protected your bag in the middle of that. What the heck? The best!

50
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,560
What do I do?

51
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,750
- Are you alright?
- No.

52
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,460
- Try moving it.
- It won't move.

53
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,380
What should we do?

54
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,830
I slept well.

55
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,140
You're working hard.

56
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,700
Come here. Work hard.

57
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,160
Go on.

 Choi Taek 6-dan who won the Eungssibae Competition 

73
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,290
 has arrived at Gimpo Airport, today, Sunday in the afternoon. 

74
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,690
 Choi Taek 6-dan who won Eungssibae and Fujitsu Competition 

75
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,500
  has won all the worldwide competitions and has the title of the best Baduk player. 

76
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,420
Hyung Taek must be back.

77
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,080
Hey! Hey!

78
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,350
Noona. I will buy you pizza next time.

79
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,270
Or you can ask Hyung Taek to buy one.

80
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,630
Why did it have to be a weekend?

81
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,290
How nice would it be if it was tomorrow or the day after.

82
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,020
This would only take a few days anyway.

83
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,800
Tomorrow is the school's anniversary so we don't have to go to school. Tomorrow would have been a good day to get hurt.

84
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,840
Why did I have to be hurt on the day I have fun?

85
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,810
Aigoo. When will my small noona mature?

86
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,500
Hey! Seong Deok Seon! Are you alive or dead?

87
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm alive!

88
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,810
So you're alive? Then I'm going.

89
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,390
Where are you going?

90
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,910
Playing soccer. We'll be playing with Taek after a long while.

91
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,900
- Piggy back.
- What?

92
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,480
Give me a piggy back ride. I want to go watch.

93
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,540
How could I carry you? How could I carry someone bigger than me?

94
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,820
What are you saying?

95
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,630
Hey, Seong Bo Ra. But at least eat.

96
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,850
Younger brother, 1000 pieces...

97
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,770
I already folded them all.

98
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,880
Where did my brother go?

99
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,750
 Air Force Cadet Recruitment 

100
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,680
 Merit Training Institute  

101
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,290
Hey, there's no one. Hurry and come in.

102
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,800
Won't we get caught if we keep on doing this?

103
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,510
We will never get caught. We have never once been caught.

104
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,140
Where's Taek?

105
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,200
Here.

106
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,080
It's still cold though.

107
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,300
Exercise a bit, Choi Taek.

108
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,630
It's because I haven't adjusted to the time difference.

109
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,240
You're funny.

110
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,820
Hey. You warm up. I'm going to the bathroom.

111
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,430
Wake up, bastard!

112
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,800
You tied your shoelace well. What's up with that?

113
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,400
It's just the way as you tied it.

114
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,780
I thought I won't be able to tie it the same if it gets undone so I tied it tight once more.

115
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,920
Did you perhaps open my wallet?

116
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,710
No.

117
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,520
I didn't look at it.

118
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,790
Hey! Hey! You will fall over!

119
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,430
- Get off!
- I don't want to!

120
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,310
- Get down!
- I don't want to, I said!

121
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,040
Hey! Hey! You'll kill her.

122
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,180
Hey! Please! Let go!

123
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,630
He keeps on yelling that I am heavy when there are a lot of people watching.

124
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,890
Did I say something wrong?

125
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,660
You eat so much!

126
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,730
Hey! Be quiet. The sun is about to set.

127
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,010
2 vs 2. I will be with Taek so Jeong Pal, you be with Salamander.

128
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,560
It's the same as him not being here so I'm letting you slide.

129
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,240
Hey, are you kidding? I can kick some too.

130
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,830
Aigoo. It's just like saying our Deok Seon could go to Seoul National University.

131
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,860
Seriously.

132
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,600
Hey. It's been long since you've seen sunlight, right?

133
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,650
Jeong Pal, get up so that we can bury them.

134
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,490
Okay.

135
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,420
Woah!

136
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,940
Ohhh! Seon Woo.

137
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,850
Here. Right.

138
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,970
Yeeah!

139
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,090
Ack!

140
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,970
Salamander, are you okay?

141
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,710
It hurts so much that I could die. It feels like my butt is being split.

142
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,190
Aigoo, this bastard is going overboard.

143
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,770
Does it hurt a lot?

144
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,050
I feel like dying.

145
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,870
Go and sit over there.

146
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,820
Okay.

147
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:17,250
But then, guys... Beyond what you are thinking, it hurts so much to death.

148
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,350
What's wrong?

149
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,360
- Hey!
- Hey! Do Ryong Nyong!

150
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,790
Why?

151
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,970
Hey! Are you on your period?

152
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,380
Who? Me?

153
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,530
Hey! Hey!

154
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,850
Get him on my back!

155
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,640
I'm taking him to the hospital!

156
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,590
Hey, Taek. Go to Dong Ryong's house and tell them. The Dean is home.

157
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,820
- Hurry.
- Okay.

158
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,470
Hey, go ahead. Hurry.

159
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,480
Hurry.

160
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,610
Hurry up.

161
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,390
Get on my back.

162
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,950
What are you doing? Hurry.

163
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,850
Hey.

164
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,530
What are you doing over there, students? Just stay there!

165
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,620
What are you doing? Hurry.

166
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,330
Hey! What are you? Put me down!

167
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,050
Hey!

168
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,370
Hey! Hey!

169
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,370
Let go. Hey!

170
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,130
♬  It seems the rays of sunshine and the  moon beams are protecting our love  ♬

171
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,810
Bo Ra. But still, congratulations.

172
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,020
Your dream has come true.

173
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,490
Well, you still haven't passed the exam,

174
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,950
but since the freshmen orientation, you've been saying how you want to go to law school.

175
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,460
Anyway, congratulations.

176
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:24,170
 Episode 17
Life is ironic - II 

177
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,580
 SW ❤︎ Purple
  ("Bora" means Purple) 

178
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,950
Honey! Mi Ran! I am hungry.

179
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,610
You're not hurt anywhere else, right?

180
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,040
But why are you smiling so much? Do you like it that your back is broken?

181
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,670
Is this year the so-called three misfortunes' year?  Why are things not going right?

182
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,490
Your hip and the National Singing Contest, too.

183
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,190
Here.

184
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,910
Do you like me that much?

185
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,610
Yeah.

186
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,960
The saying misfortune begets fortune fits this perfectly.

187
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:13,500
My back might have been broken but when else would I receive such treatment from you.

188
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,120
It's like when we were newlyweds.

189
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,540
And also, it ended well with the National Singing Contest, too.

190
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:28,620
It is right that you got dropped in the preliminaries. I would die if you went to the finals.

191
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,690
And also, the National Singing Contest

192
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,780
has a history and tradition as our country's best program.

193
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,910
It's not like a dog or cow can go on it.

194
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:45,770
No matter if one says your talent is outstanding, there is a standard to maintain. Maintain it.

195
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,440
What did I just say?

196
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,750
I must be out of my mind. I must have gone slightly crazy.

197
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,890
Mi Ran. Mi Ran, I have to poop.

198
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,930
Honey. Mi Ran, I'm sorry.

199
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,660
I love you! Mi Ran!

200
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,490
I... Please take me to the bathroom!

201
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,000
Seon Woo, set the table.

202
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,970
Yes. Wait a bit, Mom.

203
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,690
I've come searching.

204
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,040
Jin Joo, wait a bit. I will put this first.

205
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,200
It's okay.

206
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,750
Ahjussi, you should have disinfected it before you placed the band aid.

207
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,970
Seon Woo, tell Taek to hurry up. I cooked beef bone soup.

208
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,910
I will tell him to come.

209
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,250
Hello.

210
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,650
Hello, Jin Joo.

211
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,320
How did you come?

212
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,660
There was a smell.

213
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,500
What? Do you have a dog's nose?

214
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,020
Earlier, Ahjumma told me to come and eat dinner.

215
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,440
Oh yeah, is Do Ryong Nyong alright? But does a high schooler get hemorrhoids?

216
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,530
Yes. We went to see him earlier with Taek. He's fine.

217
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,000
So why did he place garlic in there.

218
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,810
He put garlic? Why?

219
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,040
It's a folk remedy.

220
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,240
He thought it was hemorrhoids at first but he was embarrassed and tried to solve it with garlic.

221
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,710
He said not to go to the hospital until tomorrow because he's embarrassed.

222
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,980
He was even more embarrassed, much more so. How could he be so immature?

223
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,380
He wants to eat a banana so he's making a fuss for Taek to buy it for him.

224
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,850
When will he grow up, that bastard?

225
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,030
I'm sorry, Ahjussi.

226
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,890
It's okay.

227
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,330
Hey, you staying still, is helping.

228
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,310
Just sit there. It's all not matched.

229
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,020
Just go and play with Jin Joo.

230
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,830
Hey, that...

231
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,040
That girl... Didn't you say she was the same age as Deok Seon?

232
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,950
Yeah.

233
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,210
Wow. She looks so beautiful.

234
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:57,480
Her parents... What did they bring from the past life to have a daughter like that?

235
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,130
Just...

236
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,780
But what is our Deok Seon doing?

237
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,430
She must not be able to to move because she hurt her foot.

238
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:11,830
Perhaps, in her room is she... No. Is she study...

239
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,670
No. Studying?

240
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,520
Sleeping.

241
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,340
She said that beauties are sleepyheads. She's asleep now.

242
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,220
You sleep quite a lot too.

243
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,780
 Hey! Put me down. 

244
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,690
 Hey! 

245
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,270
Taek.

246
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,230
No, nevermind.

247
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,020
Seon Woo.

248
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,180
Before, there was a time when I came home early from the Association.

249
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:02,950
But then Dad was alone, eating cold rice with water.

250
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,620
He didn't know I was going to come home early.

251
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,840
Dad was so flustered.

252
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,730
That time, I thought of this.

253
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:31,220
Seeing how he was so flustered not knowing what to do, seeing his backside like that,

254
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,400
I thought it would be nice if a good person was beside him.

255
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,050
I like it that it's your mom.

256
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,350
It's so fortunate.

257
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,640
Are you alright?

258
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,610
Don't you think of your mom?

259
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,850
It's been longer for me than you.

260
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,200
That's why it's easier for me.

261
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,350
I... must be younger than you.

262
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,330
You didn't know?

263
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,090
My pride is hurt.

264
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:39,230
Hey, you know that my birthday is before yours, right? Call me 'hyung' from now on.

265
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,330
Crazy bastard. I am mentally more mature than you.

266
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,300
What the heck? You're kidding me.

267
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,610
What the heck?

268
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:52,230
Whoa! You have learned a lot of bad things these days.

269
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,730
 You must have heard that wishing on a shooting star would grant your wish. 

270
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:11,000
 Tonight starting midnight until dawn, it is expected that hundreds of shooting stars will appear. 

271
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,770
 It is said that this will be the most shooting stars which can be viewed in 81 years. 

272
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:20,570
 According to the astonomers the shooting stars will appears in the center of Perseus in the northeastern sky. 

273
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,100
Mi Ran, should we go out and look at the stars too?

274
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,320
I don't want to.

275
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,330
Okay.

276
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,500
East, West, South, North. East, West, South North.

277
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,340
East, three times.

278
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,300
Ahjussi, you're a princess.

279
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,420
 9 dan Choi Taek wins ING Cup 

280
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:53,530
Oppa, a big headline like this has come out.  Shouldn't you have a party?

281
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,390
He won a really big competition.

282
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:00,540
Aigoo. Taek will be burdened.

283
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,140
There are times when he wins and loses. If I like it too much when he wins,

284
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,100
I thought he would feel pressured.

285
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,370
So if he wins or loses it's the same.

286
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,830
That's true too.

287
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,970
But Oppa, you should keep the newspaper.

288
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,350
Our Taek came out really well.

289
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,370
Aigoo. Nevermind. No. It's alright.

290
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:30,200
Aigoo. He won so many times that it's nothing to you now if he's in the newspaper, right?

291
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,400
- Is that right?
- It is. It's not like it's something big.

292
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,360
South, five times.

293
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,700
What are you saying about watching the stars?

294
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,290
Dongsaeng (younger brother),

295
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,610
do you know the legend of the shooting star?

296
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
Do I have to know?

297
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:18,110
As you look at the falling star and make a wish, they say it would grant your wish.

298
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,030
Dad.

299
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,240
Yes, yes.

300
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,720
You can put the volume up. I will rest today.

301
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,410
No. I will go to bed now.

302
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,690
Yes.

303
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,130
That... Taek.

304
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,890
Don't take medicine before you sleep tonight.

305
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,570
Yes. I won't take any.

306
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,400
Should I make you milk?

307
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,470
No. I will make one when I can't fall asleep later.

308
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,180
Hurry and sleep. Good night.

309
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,110
Okay.

310
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,140
Hello.

311
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,040
Noona? What's the matter at this hour?

312
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,930
Right now? You're up front?

313
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,860
Okay. I will be right out.

314
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:55,320
Melt it when you eat it. That way your love will come true.

315
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,810
Huh?

316
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:03,860
This chocolate, you have to melt it when you eat it. Then your love would come true.

317
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,500
It's candy, Hyung.

318
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,870
How could there be nothing that my brother doesn't know?

319
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,970
But do I have to watch the shooting stars today?

320
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,740
Yes.

321
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,970
You have this too?

322
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,560
Of course. Who am I?

323
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,260
Later, when Jeong Bong and Jeong Hwan would get married,

324
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,350
that time I would give it to them as a gift. That's why I collected them.

325
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,550
Look at how nice Jeong Hwan's handwriting is.

326
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,100
He was smart since he was young, right?

327
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,550
Noona. Is there something wrong?

328
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,140
That... Seon Woo.

329
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,790
Noona, wait.

330
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,200
The stars are falling.

331
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,450
The stars should be falling by now.

332
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,750
Oh! Look one!

333
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,330
Oh! It's true.

334
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,100
Wow! I saw it.

335
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,550
Did you make a wish?

336
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,220
No, I forgot.

337
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,380
I made one.

338
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,430
What?

339
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,780
For your relationship with Man Ok to go well?

340
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,530
No.

341
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,720
For my brother, I wish that he would do what he wants to do.

342
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,560
 Today I played soccer. 

343
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,140
 Taek and Deok Seon put one goal. Seon Woo and Do Ryong Nyong put zero goals. 

344
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,040
 But then I put in two goals. 

345
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,560
 Because my hyung cheered me on with a loud voice. 

346
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,310
 Hyung dreams to be Maradona. 

347
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,660
 I made a promise with Hyung. 

348
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,760
 In his place I will become Maradona. 

349
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,760
 I will need to work harder playing soccer in the future.

Yeah. Dong Ryong's mom is stuck beside him.

  Surprisingly, Mister Ryoo, the high school student,

  had put garlic in his anus for treatment of his hemorrhoids."

Aigoo. Don't worry, Mom. She'll take care of herself.

It's not like she doesn't have money or doesn't have her own room.

What are you worried about? Worry about me.

I'm not worried about you one bit.

What is it?

455
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,330
A singer. I want to be a singer, Mom.

456
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,660
No. Do something else.

457

What singer? Know your level.

458

467
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,760
I just got a call. What should we do?

468
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,380
She can't take a step outside the house.

469
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:37,140
She said don't wait outside her house because her dad is keeping watch.

470
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,560
What should we do, Oppa?

471
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,690
That... I will be sure to give it to her.

472
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,790
Right.

473
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,790
I will go to Bo Ra's house for a while.

474
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,390
Just lie down! Why are you going back and forth!

475
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:45,280
I'm bored and stuffy.

476
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,540
Then call Gil Dong or Teacher Ryoo for a chat.

477
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,460
Should I?

478
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,130
But then, where did Jeong Bong and Jeong Hwan go?

479
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,550
They're both studying, I guess.

480
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,230
I will go to see Dong Ryong in the hospital for a bit.

481
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,720
Is there no one beside him?

482
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,160
He told me to bring him something. I'm going.

483
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,260
Okay. Don't be so late.

484
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,610
If it's too late then take a taxi.

485
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:19,640
♬  Don't cry by thinking this is parting   ♬

486
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:26,780
 To Miss Man Ok. First, Happy Birthday.
 ♬   That is just a small delusion  ♬

487
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:35,330
 More than anyone in this world, I wish you the most and greatest greetings.
♬ If you go , where will you go?♬ 

488
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:40,530
 Miss Man Ok, if in case  
♬ The sky under the sun is narrow  ♬

489
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:44,280
 you are feeling sorry because you could not keep  our promise today, 
♬ For a little while we will stay far apart ♬ 

490
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,210
 you don't need to. 
 ♬ As you smile, let me go♬

491
00:51:50,980 --> 00:52:02,390
♬  We will meet someday with new images  ♬

492
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:14,920
♬  The word parting does not exist  ♬

493
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,040
♬  This small sky under the sun  ♬

494
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,970
Ohh! What is that?

495
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:23,160
I bought some crabs.

496
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,980
Seon Woo likes crabs so much. Eat it later. 
   ♬ The word Bye does not exist ♬ 

497
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:32,520
Aigoo! Why are you giving us this, you also have a lot in in your family. 
 ♬   Before leaving this world  ♬

498
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,210
I bought them in the market for a cheap price. 
 ♬    Don't cry  ♬ 

499
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,800
What are you eating?
  ♬ For the word bye  ♬

500
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:47,490
Hyungnim! I never knew No Eul had that talent.

501
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:51,880
He's probably going to become our alley's big star.

502
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,360
Don't even mention that.

503
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:59,310
He will be mislead by that. He says he wants to be a singer.

504
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,350
You should make him do it. What's wrong with being a singer?

505
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:06,470
Aigoo! No, hyungnim. There's no reason to be selling fingers just to survive.

506
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:10,160
And it's not like anyone could become a singer.

507
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,410
Yes. My dream when I was young was to be a singer.

508
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:17,520
- What?
- Really?

509
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,190
Is that something to be surprised about?

510
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:25,980
When I was young, not now, but when I was young.

511
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:31,360
Well, when I was young too,

512
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,350
my dream was to be a movie actress.

513
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:38,060
I really liked Choi Moo Ryeong.

514
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:46,320
I wanted to become an actress and have a meal with Oppa Moo Ryeong, that was my wish.

515
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,370
What about you, Hyungnim? What's your dream when you were young?

516
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,060
Me?

517
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,760
I... wanted to be a painter.

518
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,270
- Huh? 
- Huh?

519
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,450
When I was young. You can't even dream when you're young?

520
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:10,930
Is that why, you really like to play hwatu,

521
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:15,160
matching those pictures? So you wanted to be an painter.

522
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:22,220
 We conducted a survey on the dreams and ambitions of elementary students this year. 

523
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:28,870
 The first is scientist, 2nd professor, 3rd athlete then doctor came after. 

524
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:36,120
 Ten years ago, in the 70's, civil servant and soldier were the top choices, thus showing a very different result. 

525
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,900
 The reason that the ambitions of the children have changed is 

526
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:44,540
 seen to be part of the parents expectation and the influence of mass media. 

527
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,360
I also used to want to be a scientist.

528
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,680
Oh my! Your dream came true then. Not anyone can become an owner of an electronics store.

529
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,100
Ahhh, it also fits that way.

530
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,580
That's right. The way I see it, Seon Dol's father and MacGyver

531
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,370
are very respectable scientists.

532
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:06,110
But then, Hwangdang hwangdang Boohwandang, what was your dream?

533
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:12,380
That's right, since you have very good skills with your hands you would have been a great technician.

534
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,470
A ssireum (Korean wrestling) athlete.

535
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,340
Huh?

536
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,880
I used to have a dream of becoming a ssireum (Korean wrestling) athlete.

537
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:26,870
If I continued, I would have brought home the trophy that athlete Lee Man Gi.

538
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:30,600
He's a very lucky man.

539
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,260
The way I see it, you are the lucky one for not breaking your back.

540
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,750
Aigoo!  Hwangdang hwangdang Boohwandang sure tells big lies.

541
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:42,520
No. I really did sports before.

542
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:47,820
It's just that I just suddenly turned out to run a watch store all of a sudden.

543
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,520
What about Teacher Ryoo?

544
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,000
Me?

545
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,050
I... a dancer.

546
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:59,340
Even before I went to the military, I was so crazy about dancing.

547
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:04,410
I played a bit in Mi Pal Gun Club.

548
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,130
What, should I show you?

549
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:13,490
Aigoo. I don't know if this would work.

550
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:19,280
Come! Looking Good!

551
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:48,050
Wow, I wondered who Do Ryong Nyong took after for his dancing and playfulness. Turns out it's from his dad.

552
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:54,290
How could he hide that blood and be a teacher?

553
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:43,090
Your foot is hurt so why are you out here?

554
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,420
It's okay. I can walk.

555
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,900
Your competition is over but why do you go to the Association?

556
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,880
If you miss one day, do you feel restless?

557
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:07,250
Hey, it's not the butt.  Isn't it the tongue?

558
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,970
Hurry and go in.

559
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:17,070
Ok. You should go in too.

560
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,880
Come in.

561
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,210
Did you not go home?

562
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,670
Yeah.

563
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,420
Stop taking the sleeping pills.

564
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:26,050
Alright. I'll take less of them from now on.

565
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:39,780
Deok Seon, I'm going to sleep now.

566
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,700
Okay.

567
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,860
Hurry up and go.

568
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,130
Bye!

578
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,420
Seon Woo, eat breakfast!

579
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:50,790
Deok Seon, the food is ready!

580
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:55,470
Jeong Bong and Jeong Hwan, it's time for breakfast!

581
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:59,550
In the middle!

582
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:04,900
Make way! M a k e    w a y!

583
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,760
Ok, let's eat now.

584
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,630
Eat a lot my sons!

585
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,720
I will eat well.

586
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,470
Wow! This is so delicious!

587
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:23,130
This is against the rules.  You are Han Bok Seon, a better cook than Teacher Lee Jeung Im.

588
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:27,150
Is it good, Son?

589
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,870
Yes.

590
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:33,690
How about my eldest son? How is the bulgogi?

591
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,720
It's really good.

592
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,620
I'm telling you it's really good! It's really delicious!

593
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:43,670
It's very very good! It's overwhelming.

594
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:46,080
Wow! How can bulgogi taste like this?

595
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,150
This impressive taste which is felt at the tip of my tongue causes a thrill which flows all over my body.

596
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:52,600
It makes my back better because I am eating bulgogi.

597
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,730
The one hundred year old traditional Jongga Jip soy sauce taste.

598
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,540
It's really delicious.

599
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,680
It looks delicious! Hi, Jin Joo!

600
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,050
Aigoo, Jin Joo.

601
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:15,140
Seon Woo, if you have any clothes that need to be washed just bring them out. I'm also cleaning your room today.

602
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,170
It's okay, Mom! I already put all the dirty clothes in the washer and my room is clean.

603
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,280
I cleaned it yesterday.

604
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,760
Jin Joo, do you want a bite?

605
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,630
Here.

606
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,730
Mom! How are we supposed to eat all of this?

607
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:43,620
Why can't we finish it? We can do it.

608
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,450
Listen to the adults first, then you should eat, girl.  Adults.

609
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,530
Eat a lot! Eat a lot!

610
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,690
Taek! Taek! Let's eat breakfast.

611
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,660
Okay.

612
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,830
Let's eat breakfast.

613
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:26,200
I'll go out right now.

614
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,610
Bye, Taek!

615
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,350
Okay.

616
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,810
Bye, Taek! Wake up and open your eyes.

617
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:52,060
Bye.

618
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,860
What are you doing here?

619
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,710
I'm trying to wake up from my sleep.

620
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,710
Okay.

621
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,630
Wait, Deok Seon.

622
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,000
What time did you leave last night?

623
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,380
Me? I left right after you said you were going to sleep.

624
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,240
Why?

625
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,840
Why did you have a dream?

626
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,740
Yes.

627
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,620
What a relief.

628
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:46,990
Why? Did I appear in your dreams? What kind of dream was it?

629
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:50,280
No, it was a silly dream. You don't have to concern yourself about it.

630
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,240
By the way, what's going on with Dong Ryong?

631
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,630
Him? I'm so jealous of him.

632
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:59,830
He's probably playing at the hospital.

633
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:37,130
Dad!

634
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:39,990
Oh my, it's my Deok Seon!

635
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:45,910
Oh my daughter. Were you waiting for me?

636
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,370
But your foot is not well.

637
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,740
Why? Because you wanted to see me so much?

638
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:54,580
This is why people raise a daughter!

639
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,800
Yeah.

640
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,780
Dad, buy me a World Cone, a World Cone.

641
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:03,560
You rotten kid, you weren't waiting for me but waiting for a World Cone.

642
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,380
I was waiting for both! Both.

643
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:10,010
- Omo, where are we going? 
 - To eat a World Cone.

644
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:12,580
Both.

645
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:24,120
Our Deok Seon, you must be having a hard time studying so much lately.

646
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:29,510
Dad, even if I don't get into a college, you can't get mad at me. Okay?

647
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,680
Oh my.

648
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:38,550
Our Doek Seon will get some hard time. Also, are you someone who would be disheartened by that?

649
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,270
No, Dad. I think I'll be disheartened this time.

650
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,930
Deok Seon.

651
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:56,870
Even if you are worried that you might not get in, I can't hate you.  Understand? Just do something else.

652
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:58,010
Liar.

653
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:01,660
True, ain't? It's a lie, huh?

654
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:13,130
Still, there's exactly one year to go.

655
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:20,220
During that one year, how about thinking that you have died and give everything you've got?

656
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:27,240
If you just give up without even trying, that's not right.

657
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:32,570
Devote yourself completely and give everything you have,

658
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:38,220
and if you still can't, then there's no way about it.

659
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:44,550
Dad, I'm going to do the best I can, but just in case, just possibly...

660
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:48,800
I still can't get into a college, you can't hate me, alright?

661
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:53,450
Alright, I got it, Girl. Don't worry.

662
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:57,200
My Deok Seon is saying she is going to do her best,

663
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:03,060
that alone makes me feel that Heaven is helping out.

664
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,540
But...

665
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:14,280
What's your dream Deok Seon?

666
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:18,590
What do you want to be?

667
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:27,030
Dad will secretly support you more than Unni Bo Ra, so tell me.

668
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,910
Don't worry!

669
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:34,280
Our debt is already paid off and now we're saving a lot of money.

670
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:40,900
Why? Is your dream a secret?

671
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,160
I don't have one.

672
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:51,770
I don't have a dream, Dad.

673
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:56,920
It's pitiful, right? I must be really stupid.

674
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:02,810
What's stupid? You can just

675
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:05,390
have a dream!

676
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:08,160
-Really? 
 -Really!

677
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,170
At your age, your dad lived without a thought.

678
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:17,340
Deok Seon, everyone's like that. It's okay!

679
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:21,770
You're not the only one. So don't worry about a single thing!

680
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:28,580
Do you think working at a bank was my dream from the start?

681
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,870
It wasn't. It just ...

682
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:39,910
It just happened while I was trying to live and eat,

683
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:43,350
and ended up down this path.

684
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:48,380
Then, what's your current dream?

685
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,370
Then, what's your dream right now? ( in dialect )

686
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:59,100
My dream is for

687
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:11,060
my Bo Ra, my Deok Seon, and my No Eul to live without pain and to be healthy.

688
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:16,410
My dream is just that one wish.

689
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:19,010
I'm not talking about my dream. Your dream.

690
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,910
What's your dream?

691
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:25,930
Yeah. That's my dream.

692
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:30,030
For my children to not be in pain and to be healthy.

693
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:34,340
There's nothing else besides that.

694
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,460
There's nothing. Just that one.

695
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,540
What kind of dream is that?

696
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:48,780
♫    Dear, don't worry about a thing   ♫

697
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:57,490
Oh my girl, why are you crying? 
 ♬    Let's sing a song together  ♬

698
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:00,690
♫   All of your painful memories    ♫

699
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:06,580
Do you remember when...

700
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:13,260
I was wondering who Dong Ryong takes after in dancing. It was exactly his father!

701
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:20,850
How did he hide that overflowing need and become a teacher?

702
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,580
I don't have the stamina. Stamina...

703
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:28,890
Instead, why don't you try and put out an album?

704
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,830
It's just this time.

705
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:34,840
In regards to dancing, I don't even have

706
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,550
a nasal hair worth of regret.

707
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:39,680
- Truthfully? 
 - Yes, not at all.

708
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,180
For me, my youngest taking after me and

709
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:50,020
brainlessly dancing around instead of studying, is my biggest worry.

710
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:57,470
My little kid, Dong Ryong, needs to get his act together.

711
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:01,000
As a father, I really passed on something really worthy.

712
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,050
Something really good.

713
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,390
Me too. I wish Taek wasn't like me.

714
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,730
That's my dream. Dream.

715
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:14,640
What are you saying?

716
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,360
He is reliable and mature because he takes after you.

717
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,570
Don't you worry about Taek at all.

718
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:24,860
He should take after something that's worthy.

719
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:34,930
Like other kids, my Taek should complain, be irritated and get angry.

720
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:42,520
I wish he would live by expressing his inner emotions.

721
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:50,250
Because he started playing babuk at a such young age and being around grown-ups,

722
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,030
he has developed a habit of suppressing his anger...

723
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:55,020
Oh geez.

724
01:13:55,990 --> 01:14:00,820
He wasn't originally such an introverted person.

725
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,600
I don't wish for anything else.

726
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:09,240
I just want him to live like his peers his age.

727
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:18,760
Stop taking sleeping pills and comfortably sleep at least one day. That is my dream.

728
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,440
Dream.

729
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:23,310
I don't want anything either.

730
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:29,830
I just want my Jeong Bong to be healthy as he is now.

731
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:32,810
I don't want anything else either.

732
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:38,880
Why are you all just worried about your kids?

733
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:46,590
So that is why Hyungnim Mi Ran likes to play hwatu,

734
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:51,420
matching all those pictures, I guess.

735
01:14:56,550 --> 01:15:00,170
That's all in the past.

736
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:04,760
Now, my wish is... for our Jeong Bong to go to college.

737
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,460
That is my dream. My dream.

738
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:09,810
Aigoo! Me too, Hyungnim.

739
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:12,400
And also...

740
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:17,090
Bo Ra... If only her personality would be smoother, then I won't have any other wish.

741
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:21,210
I wish I could blend her and Deok Seon together.

742
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:26,780
My Seon Woo too. He takes after his dad so much.

743
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:31,400
It's not good once he goes out to the society.

744
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,570
Once every so often he gets incredibly exhausted.

745
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:38,070
No. You're worrying about all sorts of things.

746
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:41,140
I have no other wish too,

747
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:44,010
my Jeong Hwan is so blunt that it's a big problem.

748
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:48,570
He should take after his dad even just half. He only passed down that nose bleed.

749
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:52,680
Well, my wish...

750
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:57,880
Nothing else, but for my Jin Joo and Seon Woo,

751
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,030
I wish they would be treated preciously when they are out.

752
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:03,400
That's my only wish.

753
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,920
Aigoo. The kids are already seniors.

754
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,400
Our worries are piling up.

755
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,210
I feel like I should be giving them tonics.

756
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:19,240
The year of the pig out of all zodiac signs is supposed to be the most.

757

It seems  in '71 something happened so everyone just gave birth. They gave birth.

758
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:28,840
I need to feed Jeong Hwan too.

759
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,890
 Ahjussi, but where are you really going? 

760
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:34,740
 It's a secret. 

761
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,050
 Huh? 

762
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,730
 I'm going to buy banana. Banana. 

763
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:41,880
 My youngest wants to eat banana so I'm off to buy him some. 

764
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,130
 But I think there won't be any stores open yet today. 

765
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:48,080
 A place should be open. I'm going. 

766
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,430
 Goodbye. 

767
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,540
 Yeah. 

768
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:57,520
 You're working hard. 

769
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,090

 I always thought about why I was the only one without a dream.

01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,890
 But, Dad's words were a huge comfort. 

776
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:19,000
 However, I am still jealous of the people who have dreams. 

777
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,280
 I'm jealous of Mi Yeon who wants to work in a hair salon 

778
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:26,920
 and it might seem crazy but, I'm jealous of No Eul who wants to become a singer. 

779
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:32,960
 How did they find out what they wanted to be? 

780
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,770
 And why do I not have something I want to become? 

781
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:41,050
 It became a night where I became very pitiful.

 Summer vacation started and Jeong Beong Oppa left to go to the temple. And...

 For the first time in my life I had a nose bleed.

01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:43,050
 While we were spending senior year in school, Taek broke three more records. 

874
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:48,920
  Most winnings in a year, most consecutive victories, and most matches won.

 College Entrance Exam D-1
 Tomorrow  the standardized academic ability test (SAT)  

877
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:04,770
 for entrance for the 1990 academic year for 89 colleges nationally will be simultaneously administered at 526  test centers. 

878
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:08,820
 As baby boomers, especially those born in 1971 are taking the test, 

879
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:12,970
  a record number of 894,000 examinees will be gathered. 

880
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:18,320
 So, this has the record high competition ratio of applicants to places available of   4.57:1. 

881
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:21,150
 Meanwhile, the number of spots available in colleges remains at the same level as last year. 

882
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:26,820
 It is being predicted that more than any time, the entrance competition is worse.

933
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,510
 And towards my dreams, I accepted a new challenge. 

934
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:38,150
 In flowering spring, in March, I enrolled at Hansaeng Academy in Noryangjin. 

935
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:45,120
 But I wasn't lonely. I had my forever buddy Dong Ryong with me. 

936

 1990 December 31 

937
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,220
This year it is Byeon Jin Seob. The grand prize is Byeon Jin Seob for sure.

938
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:06,080
If you raise your hand, it's Hyeon Cheol. You don't even know it.

939
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,050
Stay put.

940
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:10,310
They are doing it. It's now.

941
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,780
Dooley.  Dooley.

942

 1991 December 31 

945
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:27,270
My life is mine, Min Hye Gyeong.

946
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:28,930
I don't think that's right.

947
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:31,360
Keep quiet, I can't hear.

948
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,440
 Yeah!

01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:18,200
If I don't get it right, you guys are not my children. Just you see.

958
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,680
This year...

959
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:22,330
Seo Tae Ji and Boys!

960
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:32,200
How could I not even once get it right?

961
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,970
Not even the last?

962
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,820
- Honey! Honey! 
 1994 October 8 

963
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:41,270
Hold it!

964
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:43,150
Pedal on.

965
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,580
What to do?

966
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:49,850
- Honey! Honey! 
- You're doing well!

967
01:37:49,850 --> 01:37:52,090
Honey!

968
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:54,910
What are you doing?

969
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:58,190
Oh my! Do you like it that much?

970
01:37:58,190 --> 01:38:02,380
Aigoo! You might fall.

971
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:05,110
Did you go to the market? You should just order in.

972
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:06,650
No.

973
01:38:06,650 --> 01:38:12,120
The kids don't eat that well. While I'm seeing them in a while I should feed them one more bowl.

974
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,690
All the kids are coming today, right?

975
01:38:13,690 --> 01:38:16,920
Yes. Jeong Hwan is coming out of the camp since it's the weekend.

976
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:20,090
Deok Seon is coming tonight because of her schedule.

977
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:24,140
What about Dong Ryong? I heard he's so busy working in Dae Ryong's store.

978
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:28,510
All of them said they'll come. They take care of Taek's birthday no matter what.

979
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:31,870
But anyway, Taek is the busiest out of them.

980
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:36,790
After feeding the kids, we should have a round of GoStop!

981
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:39,980
That's good.

982
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:43,180
I will be waiting with the mat laid out.

983
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:45,290
Go and ride.

984
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:48,140
Go and date.

985
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:53,710
This time, you should go to the end. Just straight, okay?

986
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:54,890
Oh!

987
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:57,000
Honey!

988
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,770
- Wait!
- Aigoo!

989
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:23,030
Dad give me 1000 won! Each one is 10 cents.

990
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,560
There are black ones too.

991
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:31,140
I picked over 10 and I also gave you a discount!

992
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,190
Jin Joo, Mom is here!

993
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:36,750
Aigoo! We should have gone together. You should have called me.

994
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:41,160
Oppa! All the kids from the neighborhood are coming today.

995
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:45,140
Oppa! I would get to see Taek's face after a while.

996
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:47,990
Seriously.

997
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:57,660
 Shin Sung Woo 3 

998
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:13,630
Aigoo.

999
01:40:15,530 --> 01:40:18,140
Do you like it that much?

1000
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:24,180
If you like it that much, you should frame it and put it up against the wall and look at it every now and then.

1001
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:30,240
We saved a lot! Soon, we will be able to escape this place.

1002
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,390
Of course.

1003
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:37,230
There's no law saying that we have to live in this place without sunlight.

1004
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:43,600
Anyhow, we have two daughters earning money, so money accumulates in no time.

1005
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,810
They are better than me. Better than me.

1006
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:50,210
If I knew it was going to be like this, I should have just given birth to just girls.

1007
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,410
Daughters are the best.

1008
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:56,770
It's not because daughters are the best, but because OUR daughters are the best.

1009
01:40:56,770 --> 01:41:00,230
Oh, you said Deok Seon is coming for sure today, right?

1010
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:02,490
Of course. It's Taek's birthday today.

1011
01:41:02,490 --> 01:41:05,860
Bo Ra said she's coming later during the night too.

1012
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:08,680
Aigoo. Speaking of that,

1013
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:12,580
it's good that our daughters are earning money.

1014
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:16,550
But now, eating even a single meal for Chuseok would be hard.

1015
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:21,930
On weekends, they just come and we barely see their faces and they go.

1016
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:27,510
If our daughters get married,

1017
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:30,920
how are we going to live with the loneliness?

1018
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:38,650
Aigoo, you're right.

1019
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:44,710
Omo, why are you crying?

1020
01:41:44,710 --> 01:41:49,750
It's not going to happen for a while.

1021
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:54,520
No, it is. Just wait, our daughters

1022
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:59,090
are soon going to tell us they want to get married.

1023
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:03,480
Well, did you expect to have them by your side forever?

1024
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,730
Are you okay?

1025
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:10,470
Aigoo, I'm crying already.

1026
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:22,910
Just thinking about that. Aigoo, how am I going to go to their weddings in this state?

1027
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:27,440
Aigoo, Why are you crying? Just wait,

1028
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:30,440
on the days of Bo Ra's and Deok Seon's weddings,

1029
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:33,140
I'm going to dance, with a smile, down the aisle.

1030
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:37,110
I will go while dancing.

1031
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:42,280
Are you sure about that?

1032
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:44,440
I'm going to see if you are actually like that.

1033
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,390
Just you watch.

1034
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:51,180
If I cry, then I'll become your son.

1035
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:54,030
Seriously.

1036
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,340
Where's your mom? Is she still riding the bicycle?

1037
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:14,210
Wow! My Mi Ran rides well now.

1038
01:44:14,210 --> 01:44:16,780
Go on, straight on.

1039
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:18,290

Can he drive though? Like can the car even go?
