Honey! Your husband Dong Il is here.

4
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,890
Keep quiet and just sleep.

5
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,040
The children are all asleep.

6
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,870
Okay. Okay.

7
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,440
Oh my. My baby.

8
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,710
My son, No Eul, how pretty could he be?

9
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,060
Ouch.

10
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:07,270
Don't do it, Dad. You reek of alcohol. Don't. It's annoying. I'm going to sleep.

11
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,760
Oh my. Who gave birth to this son?

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,980
Who gave birth? Dong Il did.

13
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,400
Who would think you're in high school? Your cheeks are so plump.

14
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,020
Let me see your pepper.(   Korean slang for male genital. )

15
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,590
Dad! Dad! Your hand is cold!

Hey, Seong Deok Seon.

17

Seong Soo Yeon.

18
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,520
You said you wanted to listen to this, right? Here.

19
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,110
You don't want to listen? Then don't.

20
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,450
No, no. Give it.

I'm sorry Noona. Mom stayed up late.

34
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,630
What about Soo Yeon? Is she sleeping?

35
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,510
Yeah. She probably wouldn't notice if someone were to piggyback her.

36
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,110
- Is your mom asleep? 
 - Yes.

37

 Is Jin Joo sleeping too? 

38

Yes. She's sleeping beside me.

You sleep with Jin Joo?

No.

41
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,210
She woke up to pee. She said she wanted to sleep with me so I brought her with me.

42
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,570
You're kind.

43
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,590
 Noona, what are you doing tomorrow? 

44
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,070
Should we watch a movie together?

45
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,950
Watch? You're speaking shorter (informally).

46
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,870
Can't we drop formal speech between a dating couple?

47
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,930
Can't we?

48
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,720
 Okay. I'm sorry, Noona. 

49
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,110
But then, the street is really quiet. Everyone must be asleep.

50
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,760
Of course. It's already late.

So?

Let's sleep together. I'm lonely.

61
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,360
What's wrong with you?

62
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,710
Where are you touching?

66
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,920
 So? 

67
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,870
Come out.

68
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,820
 I will wait in front of the gate.

72
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,040
Where are you going, Noona?

73
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,210
Restroom. Hurry and sleep.

74
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,020
Are you crazy!

75
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,550
No one is watching.

76
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,940

77
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,700

78
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,050
Noona.

79
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,000
Where did she go at this hour?

80
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,890
Does No Eul sleep walk? What's wrong with him all of a sudden?

81
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,250
I will take care of it tomorrow.

82
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,450
Seon Woo, you should hurry and go in. We'll meet everyone in the neighborhood at this rate.

83
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,460
I'm going.

84
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,470
- Hey! 
 - Just for a while. Who would come at this hour?

85
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,670
Everyone is asleep now.

86
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,090
Everyone is asleep now.

My precious friend, Taek.

90
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
It's a secret.

91
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,100
I said it's a secret.

92
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,140

Seon Woo.

94
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,050
Aren't you scared of Noona Bo Ra?

95
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
No, not at all. She's cute.

96
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,390
Crazy bastard.

97
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,510
Y-You know how to say things like that too?

98
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,370
You! Where did you learn to curse? Who taught you to curse?

99
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,160
It's a secret.

100
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,000
Crazy bastard.

101
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,880
More feeling! Crazy bastard.

102
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,160
Crazy bastard.

103
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,050
Fine. Next.

You son of a b*tch.

105
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,580
Aish... You son of a b*tch.

106
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,340
Good, you've gotten better.

107
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,790
What are you doing now?

108
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,540
You are teaching him good things. Good things.

109
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,920
That's not it. He lent his sunbae 10,000,000 won again.

110
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,310
What?

111
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,010
That crazy bastard of a sunbae, son of b****, motherf*****!

112
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,230
You should teach him to chew razor blades!

113
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,450
How are you going to live in this harsh world? Are you a pushover?

114
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,410
So frustrating.

115
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,410
Follow me.

116
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,700
I don't want to.

117
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,160
I don't want to.

118
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,880
Why should I?

119
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,790
What the heck! You're pissing me off.

120
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,970
What the heck! You're pissing me off.

121
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,610
What are you doing?

122
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,310
Cursing.

123
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,230
You're ruined!

124
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,410
What are you doing?

125
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,670
- I'm going. 
 - Where are you going?

126
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,460
I'm going to watch some videos with Jeong Bong.

127
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,530
Stay still. I have a gift to give you.

128
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,550

Tto-oh-chi Restaurant? What's that?

131
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,780
It's a donkatsu place. My third hyung gave it to me.

132
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,420
Hyung Geum Hyeon?

133
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,880
His friend opened up a restaurant. As I live I get to see all sorts of things.

134
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,270
Then when are we going? Should we go on the weekend? Are you all free?

135
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,930
But these can't be used on weekends.

136
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,280
This coupon is only for weekdays. Let's go on Tuesday.

137
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,410
The school is already in session if it's next Tuesday, man.

138
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,450
We can just go during dinner time.

139
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,570
It's at Ssangmun station. It's on the first floor.

140
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,150
It's in the middle between Deok Seon's and our school so we can just eat and go.

141
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,370
- You'll go, right? 
 - Alright.

142
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,720
- I have competitions all Monday and Tuesday. 
 - What time?

143
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,810
9 o'clock. If I finish early, I'll come.

144
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,440
Hey, don't overexert yourself.

145
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,070
What about you?

146
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,580
Oh, me?

147
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,630
Hey, their part time worker looks exactly like Lee Mi Yeon.

148
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,420
- You're going, right? 
 - Oh, then I have to go.

149
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,380
Okay.

150
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,100
Seon Woo, I'm going to the market with Jin Joo.

151
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,210
Let's go together, Mom.

152
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,330
No. You can stay at home and study.  I'll go by myself.

153
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,800
No, she's heavy. Wait for a bit.

154
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,710
It's okay though.

155
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,640
Hello!

156
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,230
What happens to this one?

157
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,240
Go on.

158
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,030
How much is one bag of bean sprouts?

159
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,210
300 won.

160
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,700
Cut 100 off, just 200.

161
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,220
There she goes again. How could I cut off 100 from 300?

162
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,480
Okay fine, hurry and pack a bag.

163
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,250
How come you're giving up so fast today?

164
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,270
You haven't even said "just 50."

165
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,920
Hurry, hurry.

166
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,700
 Mom. 

167
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,710
Yeah. How much is it? 300 won?

168
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,250
300 won.

169
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,400
Are you going to make beansprout soup?

170
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,960
Right. The day is cold and we'll just add some pepper powder and spice it up.

171
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,760
Seon Woo, bring Jin Joo and go home first.

172
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,160
I have to pick up some sesame seed at the sesame oil store around the corner.

173
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,040
- Let's go together. 
 - No, Jin Joo's cold.

174
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,830
And I'll chat a bit with the ahjummas.

175
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,270
Okay. Then I just have to change the coal briquette, right?

176
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,460
Yes.

177
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,940
Your wrist isn't well, so don't buy any more.

178
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,370
Okay.

179
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,690
If you buy something heavy just leave it. I will come get it later.

180
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,940
Okay. Hurry and go. Jin Joo is cold, she might catch a cold.

181
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,960
Okay. Jin Joo let's go.

182
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,850
Bye, Mom.

183
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,900
Aigoo. Such a good boy.

184
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,840
Your son is so pleasant! I bet you're full even without eating.

185
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,530
You gave birth to your son well.

186
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,410
- 100 won. 
 - Huh?

187
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,240
Cut off 100 won.

188
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,820
No. We already finished it at 300, earlier.

189
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,740
It's because I was in a hurry because of my son.

190
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,990
Cut off 100.

191
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,600
Or just 50?

192
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,050
Cut off 50!

193
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,510
 Yi-eung. Ah. Right. 

194
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:26,730
N. An! O. A. E.

195
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,810
Sae.

196
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,190
Yo.

197
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,970
Jin Joo, wait.

198
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,660
From now on, it's not "Eup Ni Dah."

199
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,480
  "Seup Ni Dah"  

200
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,390
You write "Seup Ni Dah" from now on. Use "S."

201
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:52,200
Our Jin Joo doesn't really know how to write yet. She's just drawing.

202
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,160
Mom, did you catch a cold?

203
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,920
No, it's okay. It comes and goes.

204
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,790
Seon Woo, taste this.

205
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,170
How is it? Delicious, right?

206
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,470
- Yeah. 
 - Does it taste bad?

207
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,900
It's a little bit salty but I think it would be perfect with rice.

208
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,140
Is that so? I put a lot of salt to match it with rice.

209
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,640
Clean up so we can eat.

210
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,850
- Jin Joo, let's eat.
 - Should I put more salt?

211
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,160
- No, no, Mom. I think's it's just right. 
 - Okay.

212
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,820
Isn't Dad working overtime tonight? Why are you cooking so much rice?

213
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,430
I should still prepare ahead. It's better than having not enough.

214
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,110
Oh my, I should give those out. They should eat them with their meals.

215
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,720
- Soo Yeon!  
 - What? 

216
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,670
Go and deliver these.

217
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,840
Go to the house upstairs. They probably started eating already.

218
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,770
- Okay. 
 - Don't do any nonsense, you still need to deliver these to Seon Woo's.

219
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,460
Why do you only order me around? Am I the only child in this house?

220
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,500
I will go.

221
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,900
Give it to me, Mom. I will be the one to go to Seon Woo's house.

222
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,120
What? This?

223
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,840
Doesn't Seong Bo Ra need to go to the hospital? She must have lost her mind.

224
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,180
 Crazy. Crazy. 

225
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,770
I've gone crazy.

226
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,190
Ahjumma! Soo Yeon is here!

227
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,590
Deok Seon, you're here!

228
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,900
I said it's Soo Yeon.

229
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,690
Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon.

230
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,660
Mom said to have these.

231
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,030
Ohh, she made a lot.

232
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,260
Did your Father get his pay?

233
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,800
No.

234
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,630
What are you doing?

235
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,680
What do you mean? Eating of course.

236
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,070
Soo Yeon, can't you be Deok Seon again?

237
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,900
Soo Yeon.

238
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,100
I like to call you Deok Seon better.

239
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,080
Our Deok Seon matches Deok Seon well.

240
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,740
Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon.

241
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:54,510
Since you call me like that, things won't go well with me.

242
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:02,520
Our Soo Yeon has to do well.

243
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,550
Soo Yeon, do you want to eat dinner before you go? I made some club sea squirt.

244
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,090
That's good!

245
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,050
I am our Soo Yeon's bell forever!

246
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,700
Ring, ring, ring!

247
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,130
Thank you!

248
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,520
 I get it. 

249
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,070
I get it.

250
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,010
This... My mom says to eat this.

251
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,400
Noona.

252
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,210
Right. Tell her we will enjoy it.

253
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,530
Yes.

254
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,190
Wait.

255
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,840
I have something to ask you. For a while.

256
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,720
Right, Bo Ra. Teach Seon Woo even though I can't give you tutoring fees.

257
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,810
I will give you some allowance.

258
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,440
You didn't even wear socks, aren't you cold?

259
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,090
Are you crazy? What if we get caught?

260
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,040
We won't get caught.

261
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,700
Sit down.

262
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,680
Never mind. I'm going.

263
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,670
Hey! Do you want to die!

264
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,290
Okay.

265
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,320
Noona. I'm going back to school tomorrow.

266
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,090
- I know. 
 -I will stop briefly in the morning  before I go to school.

267
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,300
No. I will go to the library at dawn tomorrow.

268
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,040
At dawn?

269
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,610
Why?

270
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,670
There's this thing. You don't have to know.

271
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,860
It's school break though.

272
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,730
Could it be?

273
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,230
To Exercise?

274
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,940
No. I'm really going to study.

275
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,820
I'm going.

276
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,340
Then let's see each other after night study. Come at about eleven.

277
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,380
- I can't. 
 - Noona.

278
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,400
- Keep quiet. 
 - What now?

279
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,280
No Eul has caught a scent.

280
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,530
It's dangerous in front of the house. See you at the food stall on the big street.

281
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,370
At 11.

282
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,580
Student, study hard.

283
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,950
Yes. I understand.

284
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,360
Eat this.

285
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,410
Ahjumma, seems like Seon Woo is anemic. Better give him some medicine.

286
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,840
Good bye.

287
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,240
Does it hurt?

288
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,510
Are you dizzy?

289
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,940
- No. 
 - Should I buy medicine?

290
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,590
No. No, I'm really okay.

291
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,500
Ahjussi, I'm going.

292
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,250
 Oh, okay! 

293
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,850
What time are you going to school tomorrow?

294
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,520
I'm not sure. Early.

295
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,270
Okay. See you tomorrow.

296
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,710
I'm really going.

297
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,380
Oh, Soo Yeon. Be careful on your way.

298
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,110
Your house is far.

299
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,160
Oppa.

300
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,890
Did you write a reply?

301
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,620
Yeah.

302
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,430
I went to the post office personally and sent it for the fastest service.

303
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,550
There will probably be a response by tomorrow.

304
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,060
What is that about?

305
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,910
You don't need to know.

306
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,860
I will tell you next time. Something good has happened to me.

307
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,930
My heart is already thumping.

308
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,360
It's on the other side.

309
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,670
Son, wake up!

310
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,550
Break is done. You need to go to school.

311
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,680
Dad, what time is it?

312
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,540
It's already 6:30. Hurry and wash up.

313
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,360
And also, wake your little Noona.

314
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,180
This girl is already a senior so she should get up on her own. Until when will we wake her up?

315
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,560
Anyway that girl is so hard.

316
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,820
Little Noona, wak—

317
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,160
What is this? You're all ready?

318
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,080
Yeah. I'm already a senior.

319
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,770
Aish!

320
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,210
Noona Soo Yeon is going to school.

321
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,120
Aigoo. Deok— Soo Yeon is going to school early.

322
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,860
Ahjumma, what about Jeong Hwan?

323
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,220
- Jeong Hwan? 
 - Yes.

324
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,840
He already left.

325
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,410
What?

326
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,310
Our Jeong Hwan probably plans to go to Harvard, he left early in the morning.

327
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,360


328
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,990
 Ssangmun Girl's High School 

329
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,110
- You're here. 
 - Yeah.

330
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,550
Hey. Something really astonishing happened yesterday.

331
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,730
Why? Did you get dumped after confessing again?

332
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,910
No. Hey! And how is that astonishing? It happens all the time.

333
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,360
Right.

334
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,200
Why? What happened?

335
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,140
No, I went to a western restaurant with my family yesterday.

336
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,320
There's something that opened recently. Was it Dochi or Dooner?

337
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,700
Oh! We're going there next week. We've got a coupon.

338
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,370
Hey, be careful there.

339
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,070
I saw a flasher there yesterday.

340
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,360
- Flasher? 
 - It was totally bad.

341
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,210
I haven't seen one.

342
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,020
What the heck? You really haven't seen one?

343
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,460
Yeah. I'm the only one in our class who hasn't seen one.

344
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,320
It looks like you are disappointed. If you see it you might faint.

345
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,130
Are you okay?

346
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,310
For me, well, I see it often so it's okay.

347
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,320
When I looked at him he looked cold.

348
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,920
So I said, "Ahjussi, it's cold so hurry go on in." I sent him off.

349
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,680
Ohhh! Joey Wang, that's great.

350
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,190
Well, that much.

351
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,290
But at first, I was so shocked that my heart was beating fast and I cried so much.

352
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,290
Not to that extent. I'm going to get an autograph.

353
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,380
Seong Soo Yeon would do such a thing.

354
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,050
Hey, but should we ditch self study and go to Brazil ddeokbeokki?

355
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,010
No. I will study hard starting today.

356
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,420
I will also go to college.

357
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,920
Isn't it too late?

358
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,460
- Hey, the moment you think it's late— 
- It's really already too late.

359
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,810
So nice. So sweet.

360
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,160
Now that the kids are back in school, the neighborhood is quiet. Now it's our break.

361
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,740
All the kids are out and all that's left is Jin Joo.

362
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,000
Hello.

363
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,730
Where are you going?

364
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,170
Outside for a while.

365
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,840
Jeong Bong!

366
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,500
Come here.

367
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,730
Go to the arcade at least.

368
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,200
Thank you.

369
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,430
Then have fun.

370
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,230
I need to see him go to college before I die.

371
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,810
Aigoo. You have a lot of greed.

372
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,770
Last time you sang how you would wish for him to just be healthy.

373
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:08,360
That's right. Jeong Bong is really kind. At his age there's no child who's as docile as him.

374
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,110
That's enough.

375
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,680
- Did you catch a cold. 
 - Not yet.

376
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,090
Aigoo! Buy medicine, you neglectful one.

377
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,330
I can just make some hot ouija tea.

378
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,520
You're going to work again, starting today? What time?

379
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,060
The same time.

380
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,120
I can just go when the bathhouse closes at 8:30.

381
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,850
You will get caught sooner or later. What will you do when Seon Woo finds out?

382
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:39,570
How would Seon Woo know? After night study it would be 11 when he comes home.

383
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:45,640
I finish cleaning the bathhouse at 10:30. I will never get caught.

384
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,220
But then, our Jin Joo, where did our princess go?

385
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,000
Ah, our Jin Joo. She has found a new friend.

386
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,360
Even when I go to work, I leave her with her friend.

387
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,220
Friend, who?

388
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,280
There's one who's on the same level as her.

389
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,380
Jin Joo, wait a minute. It's almost done.

390
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,740
It's done. Jin Joo.

391
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,300
Why? Jin Joo, why?

392
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,260
Shoulders!

393
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,740
Shoulders?

394
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,680
Oh, wait.

395
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,520
Ahjussi will stick the shoulders again. Wait a bit. Don't cry.

396
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,980
Shoulders. The shoulders are missing.

397
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,150
That... I have to cut it and stick it again.

398
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,240
Wait for a while.

399
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,940
Ahjussi! Perhaps, is there a letter that came for Kim Jeong Bong?

400
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,500
Jeong Bong?

401
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,150
Kim Jeong Bong, the blue front door.

402
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,740
There's none.

403
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,940
There's really none.

404
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,350
Is there none? Is there really none?

405
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,720
Our Soo Yeon is now a senior.

406
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,280
It's about time that she comes to her senses and studies.

407
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,900
You should believe in that fortune teller, though she was wrong about my Jeong Bong.

408
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:03,320
Same for me. We never know. She could be right about even just one.

409
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,760
Aigoo, Soo Yeon! Please study! Study!

410
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,480
Please. It's your mother's lifelong wish.

 ♫   Isn't living life just like that?   ♫

425
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,440
- Taekie's room. 
 - Who's going?

426
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,120
I have an appointment so I'm going first!

427
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,720
What! He's always going.

428
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,600
What else? Porn. I paid 10,000 won to Michael to borrow it.

429
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,780
Taekie is having a competition so his friends should take care of him.

430
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,400
Studying is not everything. You need to experience it with your whole body. Your body should experience it.

431
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,800
You should feel it with your body, you punks!

432
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,680
I'm watching Die Hard with my hyung. So you should please go home.

433
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,400
I really don't want to see the Dean at home today.

434
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
That...

435
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,660
Let's go home!

436
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,080
Did you wait for long?

437
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,300
About ten minutes.

438
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,860
Next time, let's meet ten minutes later. I came running as soon as I was done but I still arrived at this time.

439
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,760
So... next time, let's meet at 11:10.

440
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,340
Okay. We can just meet around 11.

441
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,380
Noona... It's because you would be waiting in the cold. Noona, udon?

442
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,740
Yeah.

443
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,060
Ahjumma, two udons please.

444
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,040
Yes.

445
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,200
Hurry eat so we can go. Your mom is probably waiting.

446
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,080
But still I have to see your face.

447
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,880
You should eat this, I don't eat chrysanthemum coronarium.

448
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,560
You're worse than our Jin Joo. You should not be picky with your food so that

449
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,160
you should grow tall and become a strong adult.

450
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,040
Stop messing around.

451
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,940
But then Noona, what are you busy with these days that you are always in the library?

452
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,940
Are you already preparing for the teacher certification examination? Until what time are you studying? Math?

453
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,750
Are you studying anything aside from Math?

454
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,030
You sure are curious about a lot of things. Do you have that many things that you're curious about me?

455
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:55,290
Of course. It's usually like that. It's you that's strange.

456
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,080
I don't like having secrets though.

457
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,860
You're speaking shortly. (being informal)

458
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:08,580
-Yo (makes it formal). But really, what are you doing lately? Huh?

459
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,000
Seriously.

460
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,360
I will go and see Taekie for a while.

461
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,580
I'm studying accounting these days.

462
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,720
Why? Are you going to take the CPA exam?

463
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,880
I am on the Seoul Police Bureau's blacklist so it's hard to get certified.

464
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,770
A sunbae that I know introduced me to a part time job. It's an accounting company so I want to study a bit.

465
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,530
It pays more than tutoring fees.

466
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,680
If I get in I might as well get hired.

467
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:12,420
That's why these days, this noona is busy.  I don't have time to see you for a while.

468
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,720
Then won't it be better for you to prepare for the CPA exam instead?

469
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,520
Do you think anyone can take the CPA exam? You need to study really hard for that.

470
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,520
And if I prepare for that then it would be the end for both of us.

471
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,660
I can't do two things at once. You should consider yourself lucky.

472
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,900
But still, we're seeing each other every night here, right?

473
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,640
Only on weekends. From now on, let's just meet on weekends.

474
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,400
Hey, you're also a senior now. I really hate it if your grades drop just because you're seeing me.

475
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,220
I will take care of my own studies.

476
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,700
No. Let's just see each other on the weekends.

477
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,360
Click.

478
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,620
- Your dad? 
 - He's sleeping.

479
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,360
Okay. Nice.

480
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,140
Let's watch it with the guys.

481
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,620
I need to return this tomorrow.

482
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,640
A friend who takes care of his friend's sex life is a genuine friend.

483
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,680
That's me. You should thank me.

484
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,240
This is... Taek, Taek.

485
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,340
Taek! Mom said to eat—

486
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,860
That...

487
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,580
Sheesh!

488
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,240
What is that? This is some porn, right?

489
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,140
- Huh?  Ahjussi!  
 - No, Deok Seon!

490
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,860
Good job, Kidong!

491
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,360
No! No! No, Deok Seon!

492
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:05,480
What are you doing! No!

493
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,800
Deok Seon...

494
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,050
Deok Seon ...

495
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,810
That Michael ...

496
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,850
That son of a b*tch!

497
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,100
Are you sulky?

498
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,350
- No. 
 - No?

499
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,570
These days you're talking shortly.

500
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,890
Can't we speak informally?

501
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,920
Can't we?

502
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,530
- yo. ( Makes it formal.) 

503
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,770
Not informally. You really want to go all out.

504
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,950
Aren't we dating?

505
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,640
-Yo? ( Makes it formal. )

506
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,880
Am I your younger brother? You always treat me like one.

507
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,530
This is... This is just a one-sided love.

508
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,690
Never mind. Stop saying nonsense. It's late, let's go.

509
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,990
Ahjumma, how much is it?

510
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,200
300 won.

511
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,610
Let's go.

512
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,990
Goodbye.

513
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,310
Won't you hurry and come?

514
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,610
She's playing with me, huh.

515
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,620
Noona!

516
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,870
Noona, you wore that because of me, right?

517
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,610
Shut up!

518
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,190
Aren't you cold? Skirts are probably cold.

519
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,940
It's cold.

520
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,730
- Aigoo. 
 - Someone might see.

521
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,780
Burberry man (flasher)? You're talking about a strange person wearing a coat, right?

522
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,830
Yeah. They say he always appears near that restaurant.

523
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,970
Then we should go somewhere else.

524
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,460
No! We need to use the coupon.

525
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,620
That's okay. What's so scary about seeing a flasher? It's my wish to see one.

526
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,740
- Aren't you scared? 
 - No.

527
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,270
Hey! She won't be scared by that.

528
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,210
She's a person who has nothing else to fear other than Noona Bo Ra.

529
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,450
What are you saying? Impossible.

530
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,690
What is that sound?

531
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,620
Don't you hear anything?

532
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,690
Mice.

533
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:11,450
Dad placed some mouse traps but we still haven't checked because we're too scared.

534
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,340
We need to throw those away though.

535
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,810
Hey, your dad looks like he could hit a truck but he has a quite human side to him.

536
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,030
He's only scared of mice, only mice.

537
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,120
He was bitten by a mouse before.

538
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,620
Where are you going?

539
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,500
To catch some mice.

540
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,300
Let's go. I will throw them away for you.

541
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,940
Oh yeah. Three of them.

542
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,720
What are three?

543
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,750
What is?

544
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,360
Look!

545
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,080
- Are you really a girl? 
 - Don't Deok Seon! Don't!

546
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,380
- It's Soo Yeon though! 
 - Don't! Seriously don't! I might kill you!

547
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,310
I'll kill you!

548
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,550
Go away!

549
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,830
Go away! Don't come close!

550
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,280
Go away!

551
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,850
Look at this!

552
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,700
She's gone.

553
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,870
- Think it over again. 
 - Huh?

554
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:22,780
Do you really like her as a woman?

555
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,010
She's cute though.

556
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,110
Get hold of yourself, you fool!

557
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,740
I bit my tongue.

558
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,500
♫ The drizzle rain is falling quietly

559
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,450
♫ Sad partings at Busan Station

560
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,510
I will kill all of you today!

561
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:30,510
♫ I say goodbye and you say goodbye, too

562
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:37,710
Aigoo, my child. No Eul.

00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,520
Aigoo, so pretty.

564
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,380
Dad!

565
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,670
Please! I'm sleeping! Why are you doing this!

566
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,150
- Good Morning. 
 - Bo Ra, you're heading out early.

567
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,590
Yes.

568
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:15,130
Wow! As expected a Seoul National University student is indeed different.

569
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,590
Ahjussi, good morning.

570
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,860
Deok Seon, where are you going?

571
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,070
It's Soo Yeon.

572
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,930
Ah, right. Soo Yeon. Where are you going at this hour?

573
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,450
School.

574
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,090
Good bye.

575
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:39,230
Perhaps, did Jeong Hwan already go?

576
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,540
No, I haven't seen him.

577
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,760
Ahhh!

578
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,000
Yes, goodbye.

579
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,770
Alright.

580
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,350
She must have come to her senses now that she's a senior.

581
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,830
It's late.

582

 ♫    Sometimes it's not a big deal.  ♫

583
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,090
Student, wait for a while. I will just go grab some coffee.

584
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,610
Yes.

585

What's with you? Why are you going so early?

589
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:28,670
Then what about you? Why are you going so early'?

590
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:36,470
I'm going to sleep so wake me up when we arrive.

00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,160
No, I want mackerel!

602
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,300

00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,980
Jin Joo, Ahhh.

604
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,420
Jin Joo is eating well.

605
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,390
Girl, seriously...

606
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,380
You caught a cold. Did you take a medicine?

607
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,670
It's okay. I'll buy some medicine later.

608
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:30,900
You'll be late today too?

609
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,260
It'll be the same. Buy some medicine, okay?

610
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,100
Okay.

611
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,700
You, Ahjussi, should be careful too.

  Baduk News.  

613
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:46,080
  Starting today, the Wong Eui Jeon Tournament will take place at the special match hall in the Korea Baduk Association building.  

614
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,680
  The first match is between Choi Taek, Level 6, famous from last year and Yoo Jin Ho, Level 9, with a winning streak.   

615
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,210
  There is no time limit in this match. Ability to endure a lengthy match and physical stamina is very important. 

616
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:01,400
 The past record shows three wins and two losses for 6-dan Choi Taek. 9-dan Yoo Jin Ho ....  

617
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,960
Oppa! Leave it there. I'll do it.

618
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,770
No, I'll do it. You do it all the time.

619
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,990
- Jin Joo's here? 
 - Yes.

620
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,880
Oppa, Where's Taek? Did he already leave for the Baduk center?

621
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,840
He had a competition in the morning. He left early today.

622
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,400
Did you catch a cold?

623
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,260
No, I'm fine. Try this.

624
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:31,300
Put one or two spoons of this in hot water and drink it when you feel a cold.

625
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,690
You should drink this. You're the one who caught a cold.

626
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,830
No, I said I'm fine.

627
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:38,780
Oppa, I'll ask you to babysit Jin Joo a little later again.

628
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,040
Okay.

629
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,170
Jin Joo, let's play with me a little later.

630
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,710
Shall I cut lots of paper dolls for you?

631
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,880
Yes.

632
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,270
Gosh, girl...

635
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,820
Yes, I brought my 'Do Shi Rak' (lunch box).

636
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,700
  Do Shi Rak  

637
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,420
Give me some broth.

638
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,430
No, my noodles!

639
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,990
Did Taek finish his competiiton?

640
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,350
What should we do with our Taek?

641
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,440
Why? Did he lose?

642
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,170
No, it's still not finished yet.

643
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,540
Didn't it start in the morning?

644
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,700
It started at 9 am and is not finished yet. It's been for ten hours.

645
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:43,700
They said that his opponent is really good. What if he loses after all that?

646
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,270
He would feel like a weak loser.

647
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,990
  Yoo Jin Ho, Level 9 
 Choi Taek, Level 6 

648
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,000
Seems like he spent all night yesterday. He'll be knocked out.

649
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,890
Do you still have an upset stomach? You were sick after you had lunch.

650
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,800
I don't think I can eat dinner.

651
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,070
Go to the bathroom!

652
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:02,060
Did you vomit?

653
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:03,850
Yes, a little.

654
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:07,110
Just go home! Get a pass.

655
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,210
  Geez, man... 

656
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,120
Did he say you can go?  Do you want me to walk you home?

657
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,270
No, it's okay. I'll go first.

658
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,070
Let's go in.

659
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:50,470
There's nothing to lose. Challenge!

660
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:12,340
Father, I also have an upset stomach. I had the same lunch as Seon Woo today.

661
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,630
I feel bloated.

662
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,540
Father...

663
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,990
Seemed I farted.

664
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:56,930
Father, I feel better.

665
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,690
My fart... Fart...

666
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:05,150
 (Editor's note: A traditional remedy for upset stomach: draw blood from the thumb.) 

667
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,970
I have indigestion. Please give me some medicine for it.

668
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,190
And, give me cold medicine, too.

669
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:46,550
Nasal congestion.

670
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:50,460
Are you going to take them? It's not good to take both.

671
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,130
Cold medicine is for my mom.

672
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:57,230
Please give me a cold medicine that's mild and high quality—not too strong.

673
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:59,490
Okay.

674
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,800
Jin Joo.

675
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,310
Why're you here already? It's early.

676
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,610
Jin Joo wanted to play here, so we came a little earlier.

677
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,850
Then, have a seat there and rest for a little while.

678
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:29,470
Right, wait a second. Wait.

679
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,310
Let's sit down for a minute before I go.

680
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,750
- Take this. 
 - What is this?

681
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,440
- Medicine. 
 - What?

682
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,830
While I was buying medicine for Taek, I bought yours, too.

683
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:53,630
Oh my, thank you.

684
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:04,830
Give it to me. Let me open it for you.

685
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,120
Aigoo, I'm so clumsy.

686
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,290
Oppa, why don't you dye your hair? You've got lots of gray hair.

687
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:30,660
It's fine. I'm too old to dye my hair.

688
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,050
What do you mean old? You're in your mid-forties. You just look old.

689
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,690
You look older when you laugh, Oppa.

690
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,700
Isn't it funny, Jin Joo?

691
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,930
So cold.

692
00:58:56,930 --> 00:59:00,670
Well, let's go.

693
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:48,790
Jin Joo, say thank you to Ahjussi.

694
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:53,690
Thank you.  Oppa, thank you. We'll get going.

695
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,000
Go in, Oppa.

696
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,630
Go in, Oppa.  Let's go, it's cold.

697
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:40,070
Thank you, Manager.

698
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,160
Good night!

699
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,300
You know that you have a competition at 9 am tomorrow?

700
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:59,480
I'm afraid he's going to faint.

701
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,120
Mom, I'm home.

702
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,440
Seon Woo.

703
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,050
Is my son home? You're hungry, right?

704
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,820
No, I ate with my friends.

705
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,050
Did you eat Dukbokki?

706
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:34,060
Yes, we had dukbokki and other snacks, too.

707
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,280
Is it right? Do you want me to cook something for you?

708
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,240
No, it's fine. Did you eat something?

709
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,380
Yes, I did. Look at this stomach.

710
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,940
- Jin Joo? 
 - She's sleeping.

711
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:48,330
  The first match of Wong Eui Jeon Tournament took place at the special match hall in Korea Baduk Association building today.  

712
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:52,190
 After ten hours of fierce competition, Choi Taek 

713
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,830
 lost to Yoo Jin Woo. 

714
01:01:55,830 --> 01:02:00,180
  Choi Taek, Level 6, could not maintain the lead he took midway through the match.  

715
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:04,440
 He unfortunately surrendered to the opponent's last ditch effort.  

716
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,560
Poor Hyung Taek!

717
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:11,080
Wow, how frustrated he must feel after losing like that.

718
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,400
Where's Soo Yeon? She's not home yet?

719
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,540
It's about time she's here.

720
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:40,560
Hey Master Choi, why don't you cheer up?

721
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,200
Hey, straighten your shoulders when you walk.

722
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,370
Head up!

723
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,690
You must have had a tough time today.

724
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,330
Right, you can lose.

725
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,340
Y-You w-worked hard.

726
01:03:54,950 --> 01:04:02,000
♫   Oh, my, already? Did the sun come up?   ♫

727
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,900
♫   Outside the window is lit up bright   ♫

728
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,640
Mom, I'm going to school.

729
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:16,480
♫   Light morning footsteps   ♫

730
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,300
Hello.

731
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:24,210
Hi.

732
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:29,440
What a coincidence!

733
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,140
It's rare that everybody comes out of the house at the same time.

734
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:36,930
If Master Choi comes out...

735
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,130
Are you going to school?

736
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:46,810
When you live in the same neighborhood for about twenty years, telepathy like this...

737
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:49,060
Hi, Deok Seon!

738
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:51,280
It's Soo Yeon!

739
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,110
Okay.

740
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:58,670
You guys remember, right? Tto-oh-chi Restaurant? Try skipping out, even one of you. We'll all die together then.

741
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,410
Can you come? Don't you have another competition today?

742
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:03,120
If it's finished early, I'll come.

743
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,670
Don't get lost again.

744
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,930
- Got it. 
 - Guys, we're late.

745
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:11,360
Let's go.

746
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:31,830
 Aigoo, Oppa, what don't you dye your hair? You've got lots of gray hair. 

747
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:35,350
 That's fine. I am too old to dye my hair. 

748
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:39,000
 What do you mean old? You're in your mid-forties. You just look old. 

749
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:54,970
Hey, where're you going?

750
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:56,570
To wash my face.

751
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,850
If you're sleepy, you should sleep. Why wash your face? Jeez, and even without studying ...

752
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:05,540
Washing has no connection to studying.

753
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:12,540
Geez, vicious ones. Geez.

754
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:16,860
Where are you going?

755
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,670
To wash my face.

756
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:24,630
Unbelievable! People might think I don't get good grades because I don't wash my face.

757
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:37,330
Namo amityurbuddhaya...

758
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,260
Oh, you scared me.

759
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,580
Jeong Bong! I am going to the market.

760
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,500
See you soon.

761
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,740
Let's go together. It'll be heavy for Mom to carry a lot of stuff.

762
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,970
It's so cold.

763
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,330
Sungnim, are you going to the market?

764
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:13,580
- Yes. 
 - What're you going to cook today?

765
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,800
I'll just fry some cutlass fish.

766
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,360
Are you taking bottles to recycle?

767
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,700
Yes, I can exchange these for money, with which I  can buy a tofu, right?

768
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,610
Is your work fine?

769
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:27,630
Yes, no problem.

770
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,340
Seon Woo still didn't find out?

771
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:32,110
Of course not. It'll be a big problem if he does.

772
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:36,480
Even though Seon Wook looks kind, once he gets angry, he's very scary.

773
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,210
At my age, I'm watchful of my son's mood.

774
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:44,310
Because he hates to see his mom suffer, he's a good son.

775
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,260
I know that he's a good son.

776
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,910
You must be happy.

777
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,520
Attention! Salute!

778
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,080
Thank you, sir.

779
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,540
- Have a good dinner!  
 - Yes.

780
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,740
Let's hurry.

781
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,010
Do I really have to go?

782
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,870
Seriously. Are you saying you don't need to eat pork cutlet because your family is rich?

783
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:08,100
We have to use all five of these coupons today.

784
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:13,230
Dong Ryong, I'm sorry. I have to go somewhere.

785
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:16,790
If Teacher asks about me, tell him that I've still got an upset stomach.

786
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:18,070
I'll get going first.

787
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:21,500
Hey.

788
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,840
What happened? He's skipping the night study.

789
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:29,270
Okay, one person can't make it. It's fine because  I'll just eat two pork cutlets.

790
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:31,420
But if Taek doesn't come, it'd be bad.

791
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,950
No, Soo Yeon can eat two, and I'll eat two.

792
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:36,970
No, I eat three, and Soo Yeon eats one, and then...

793
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:40,130
Then, if Soo Yeon eats four—

794
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:43,740
Are you possessed by a ghost who died craving for Tonkatsu (pork cutlet)? It's late so let's go quickly.

795
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,840
Ghost?

796
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:50,300
Wait for me.

797
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:13,100
Hey, here!

798
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,100
This restaurant looks nice!

799
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,530
Give us five pork cutlets.

800
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:19,970
There.

801
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:21,960
Where's Seon Woo?

802
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,340
He left because he had something come up.

803
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:24,730
Why? Is he sick?

804
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:26,160
No.

805
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,190
We've come to see the day Seon Woo ditches night study hall.

806
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,100
Taek isn't here yet, right?

807
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,570
I don't think he'll come. It took ten hours to finish the competition yesterday.

808
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,880
Ohh! Master Choi, you're here!

809
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,740
You won, right?

810
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:47,640
Yeah. It ended early today.

811
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,260
- Did you order already? 
 - Yeah, we ordered.

812
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,580
But where's Seon Woo?

813
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:57,360
He skipped night study, saying he had somewhere to go.

814
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,350
Seon Woo did?

815
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,110
♫ Excuse, excuse me

816
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:17,060
♫ Is this the Fan Medium, who peers deeply deeply into you

817
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,670
- That's right! 
 - Deeply! Deeply!

818
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:24,030
♫ How did you come to know?

819
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,530
Enjoy your meal.

820
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,430
You said it was Lee Mi Yeon.

821
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:43,830
I'm sorry.

822
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,730
Hey, I can eat two, right?

823
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,850
Halv it with me.

824
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:51,380
You can eat mine.

825
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,910
Never mind. You should eat it yourself and gain some weight.

826
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,960
Hey, give it to me.

827
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,340
Here.

828
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:18,330
Now, should we formally start eating.

829
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:22,010
First, I need to empty my insides clean. I'm going to the restroom.

830
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:24,070
So dirty, seriously!

831
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:26,790
Did I ever say I was going to do a big one?

832
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:30,150
Me too, restroom.

833
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,010
Should I go to the restroom too?

834
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,170
Seriously! So small!

835
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,410
There's nothing to look at!

836
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:23,100
Go home, Ahjussi. There's nothing to look at.

837
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:37,870
Deok Seon, you're really amazing!

838
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:40,040
Where did you learn—

839
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,010
Sit down. Let's eat together.

840
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:16,250
- Our Jin Joo, eat a lot. 
 - Yes.

841
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:19,970
Oppa, did you drink the tea I made? Did it taste alright?

842
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:23,090
Yeah. You made it well. It tasted good.

843
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:27,130
If you want some more, just tell me and I will make it.

844
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:28,930
How's your cold?

845
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:32,020
After I took the medicine that you gave me, I got better.

846
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,460
That's good.

847
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:37,750
- Jin Joo, you should eat a lot. 
 - Yes.

848
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:54,880
♫   My dear. My dear, I want to love you again   ♫

849
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,700
Why aren't they coming? 
 ♫   My dear, I want to love you again   ♫

850
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:00,780
♫   My dear, I want to love you again   ♫

851
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,650
♫   But it's too late   ♫

852
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,390
Our Taekie has started his attack.

853
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,000
That scary guy.

854
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,800
♫   For our love   ♫

855
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,830
Are you done crying?

856
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:29,670
Don't tell the guys.

857
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:33,190
What's wrong with crying a bit?

858
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,710
But still, it's embarrassing.

859
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,390
Oppa, I leave her to your care.

860
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:48,180
Okay. Don't worry and go. You're going early today.

861
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:51,060
Yeah. Yesterday I forgot to clean the restrooms.

862
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,360
I have a lot of work today.

863
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:57,250
When you clean, make sure you wear gloves.

864
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:00,140
The cleaning agents are really bad for your skin.

865
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:01,640
Okay.

866
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,070
But then, when you work it won't go as well.

867
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:06,840
Seon Woo still doesn't know, right?

868
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:11,840
I'm nervous about Seon Woo. You should just stay at home.

869
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,290
My Seon Woo is busy studying so he's out of it.

870
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:19,820
I will earn a lot of money and buy him sneakers

871
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:24,530
and I should dress him well when he goes to college.

872
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:26,420
Does Seon Woo want that?

873
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:30,410
Aigoo! That's just how a mother's heart is.

874
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:33,490
I'm going. Look after her well.

875
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:37,250
Huh? Thank you.

876
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,280
Make sure you wear gloves!

877
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:58,620
  Business is closed for the day, Big Rain Public Bath  

878
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,360
Hey, no one is going to take it away so eat slowly.

879
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,970
Look at these guys. Maybe it's because they are from well off families

880
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:37,060
they have different attitudes with food. Only you and I are like that. So embarrassing.

881
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,520
You are a bit well off. It's only me.

882
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,570
I can't leave my habits from home. I'm scared that someone might take it from me.

883
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:46,450
Do Ryong Yong, is there dessert, too?

884
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,910
Dessert my ass. It's dessert (in English).

885
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:52,800
Do you know parfait? You know it, right?

886
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,890
- Yeah, I tried it before. 
 - Me too.

887
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,420
I haven't tried one.

888
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:59,910
As expected. If not for me, where would you be?

889
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:02,050
Deok Seo— no, Soo Yeon.

890
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,600
There will be two parfaits coming so you can eat both of them, okay?

891
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,680
Oh yeah!

892
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:13,170
Parfait is served.

893
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,710
What the heck! The best!

894
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:21,380
Hey! You don't put that on your hair.

895
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,840
Put it down. Hurry.

896
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:31,440
I will go call home.

897
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,790
Why? Is there something going on at home?

898
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:36,080
I will tell Hyung to record the boxing match.

899
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,550
Okay. Hurry back.

900
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:44,750
But what should I do?

901
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,800
Why? You think you can't eat them all?

902
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,210
No, I want to go to the restroom again.

903
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:53,430
You went earlier. You already pooped everything.

904
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:56,500
You stuffed yourself so much. Hurry go.

905
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,530
It's okay.

906
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:11,780
Is there an earthquake? Stop shaking your legs and go.

907
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,120
Okay, I will hurry and go.

908
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,340
Go.

909
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,340
To smoke.

910
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:25,750
Go. I will be here.

911
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:37,100
Okay.

912
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:04,540
I came to see my mom. I can come in, right?

913
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:09,140
Are you Mrs. Kim's son?

914
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:14,530
Your mom is inside, you can go in.

915
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:17,400
Yes. Thank you.

916
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:40,910
Please don't tell my mom that I came.

917
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,740
That... Seon Woo.

918
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,930
Yes?

919
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:06,810
Your mom went out up front. She will be back in a short while.

920
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,960
It's cold. Let's go inside.

921
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,800
Ahjussi.

922
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:17,000
I know it too.

923
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,760
About mom working in the bath house. I know it too.

924
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,560
What about Jin Joo?

925
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,480
Yeah. She's sleeping inside.

926
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,510
That, Seon Woo, your Mom isn't thinking about anything else...

927
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:35,440
It's okay.

928
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,840
I will pretend not to know.

929
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:43,720
Okay. Thank you.

930
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:49,570
I will go with the guys and come back when it's time to go home.

931
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:51,870
Thank you, Ahjussi.

932
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:15,330
Noona, why do I hate it so much?

933
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,850
I really hate it, seriously.

934
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:22,780
I'm really okay.

935
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:26,830
Nice clothes, nice shoes—I don't need to wear those.

936
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:29,580
I don't need to go to academy.

937
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:33,170
I don't need to do all the things the the other kids are doing, so

938
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:37,070
I just wish my mom did not work.

939
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:40,270
I really hate my mom having a hard time.

940
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:44,040
And also, why does Ahjussi know something that I don't?

941
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:49,940
Why does Taek's dad know what the son doesn't know?

942
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:56,660
It's okay for me, so why is she doing that?

943
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,150
I really don't need anything.

944
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:03,060
We can just live like we have now.

945
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,830
Her son hates it so much—

946
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:11,160
Seriously.

947
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:22,800
Hey! Enough of that. Just go and massage her shoulders.

948
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:32,210
Go and massage your mom's shoulders.

949
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:55,180
♫   Don't worry about anything, dear    ♫

950
01:25:55,180 --> 01:26:01,040
♫    Let's sing a song together   ♫

951
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:09,550
♫   All the memories which hurt you dear    ♫

952
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:14,260
♫   Bury them deep in your heart    ♫

953
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:19,780
 You don't want your mother to have a hard time, right? And that makes your heart feel comfortable, too. 

954
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:26,470
 Hey, a mother hates it for not being able to buy you Nike sneakers. 

955
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:31,080
 Do you only think about yourself? You don't think about your Mom? 

956
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:35,890
 Is it fine if only your mind is at ease, you immature punk? 

957
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:45,950
 Loving someone is not just the desire to give, 

958
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:49,760
 rather it's the dire desire to give. 

959
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:57,750
♫   You had many difficulties    ♫

960
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:00,060
♫   You've lost the freshness    ♫

961
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:03,510
Mom! I'm back! I'm hungry!

962
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,060
Yes. Our Seon Woo is back.

963
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:09,230
Hurry and wash up. I bought some carp bread for you today.

964
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:12,120
Yeah. I will go and wash up.

965
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,610
♫   Let go of those which blame you    ♫

966
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:17,750
- Is it delicious? 
 - Yes, it's really delicious.

967
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:21,380
In the three way intersection down there,

968
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:26,350
that— Not the one that the ahjumma made, but the ahjussi,  is really delicious.

969
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:32,080
 Seon Woo, you love your mother, right? 

970
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:39,950
 Hey, loving someone is really hard. 

971
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:48,580
♫   Let's sing, say that we dreamed without regrets    ♫

972
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:57,760
♫  Let the past be the past    ♫

973
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,960
My cute child, No Eul.

974
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:06,050
♫   That's what it means    ♫

975
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,630
♫   Together  lets sing a song  ♫

976
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:14,860
Make my hands warm. 
♫   Together  lets sing a song  ♫

977
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:20,250
♫    Tell them that you dreamed without regrets   ♫

978
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:26,860
 Loving someone is not just liking to be around that person. 

979
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:30,110
 It means you are becoming like that person. 

980
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:36,650
♫   That's what it means    ♫

981
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:45,050
♫   Let's sing a song together. Let's dream without regrets.   ♫

982
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:48,740
But what did Jeong Hwan say he'd be doing to leave first?

983
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,880
He said he'll watch some video.

984
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,950
Sometimes he's just like Jeong Bong, right?

985
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:56,040
Bye, friend.

986
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,840
Yeah.

987
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,780
Jab jab!

988
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:18,970
Jab! Jab!

989
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:25,760
 And loving someone is, even though that person bothers you to no end, 

990
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:30,170
 that's why you want to hate that person so much. 

991
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:35,170
 In the end, it also means you cannot hate that person. 

992
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:39,810
 Jeong Hwan! Take this to Taekie! 

993
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:17,430
 Loving does not mean not hating, but 

994
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:21,510
 it also means that in the end you cannot hate them. 

995
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:49,360
♫  Today, from a forgotten friend, I got a call  ♫

996
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:57,330
♫  That he will be leaving far away tomorrow  ♫

997
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:09,220
♫  He wants to meet in that alley that when we were young, we used to run and play together  ♫

998
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:18,040
♫  Tomorrow he will go far, far away  ♫

999
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:27,490
♫  Riding a bumpy subway  ♫

1000
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:49,360
  To: Kim Jeong Bong  

1001
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,930
Oppa, did a letter arrive?

1002
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:18,800
Love letter?

1003
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,830
Oh, Mr. Kim Jeong Bong. You're popular these days.

1004
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:25,200
But then, Soo Yeon why does your friend send her reply so late?

1005
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,160
This Oppa thought he would die waiting.

1006
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:31,440
What are you saying? Man Ok sent a reply?

1007
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,250
Yeah, this one.

1008
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:34,620
Are you crazy?

1009
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:37,510
She had an accident so she's not even able to eat properly.

1010
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:41,970
What reply? She can't even move a finger now.

1011
01:32:55,410 --> 01:32:57,420
Then what is this?

1012
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:59,490
I know. What is that?

1013
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:01,670
Where did that come from?

1014
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:19,530
This letter started in England.

1015
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:25,710
It goes around once a year and gives the person who receives this luck.

1016
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:31,960
It's a lucky chain letter. Oppa, you don't have time. You need to make seven of those.

1017
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:34,500
Write it well.

1018
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,380
Okay?

1019
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:43,340
America's President Kennedy received it, but

1020
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:46,360
was assassinated.

1021
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:57,100


1022
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:04,540
 With this card, you can go wherever you want to go. 

1023
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,430
 What the heck. 

1024
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:08,640
 Hey, why did you get so pretty. 

1025
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,370
 Hey, no. What are you saying? 

1026
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:12,750
 Take care. 
 - I will call. 

1027
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:13,850
 Yeah. 

1028
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:16,080
 Until Saturday this week, entry to Taekie's room is prohibited. 

1029
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:21,030
 Then our Taekie, should you eat breakfast or not? 

1030
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:23,410
 I need to eat. 

1031
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:26,140
 Frustrating. Fool. 

1032
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:28,440
 You should put strength in here. Are you stupid? 

1033
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,800
 Like this? 
 - Right. 

1034
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,120
 Thank you. 

1035
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:35,770
 We are really not in that kind of relationship, I tell you. 

1036
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,690
 Do you not like Ahjussi? 

1037
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:39,260
 But I still don't like it. 

1038
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:41,190
 Seon Woo. 

1039
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:44,040
 Oppa, aren't you scared? 

1040
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:45,910
 I am scared. 

1041
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:56,600
 What happened? 

1042
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:00,970
 Ahjussi! Did a call from Taekie arrive?
