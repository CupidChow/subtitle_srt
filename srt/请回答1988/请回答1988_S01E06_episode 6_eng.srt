Hello, Ahjumma.

4
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,060
Is our Jeong Hwan here?

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,910
- Hey, I'm going to the bathroom. Go inside my room.
 - Okay.

6
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,230
Look at how this bastard arranged everything alphabetically.

7
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,130
Pervert.

8
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,100
He's a pervert, all right.

Look at this. It's a new book.

Do you want something to drink?

14
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,950
What are you thinking about?

15
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,060
This is 100% proof.

16
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,980
What is 100%?

17
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,170
Sit down. I'll tell you everything.

18
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,350
Forget it. What's point of hearing about other people's romances?

19
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,010
I'm leaving.

20
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,320
Hey, eat dinner before you go!

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,030
 Forget it.

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,870
 Episode 6: First snow is coming 

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,840
Is Taek home?

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,310
Did he come yesterday night?

25
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,100
He did come home, but he's probably sleeping right now because he stayed awake the whole night.

26
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,850
Don't make soup in the morning.

27
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,280
Today I'll make delicious cabbage soup. I'll bring it to you later.

28
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,810
Delcious—

29
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,920
It's okay. It's really okay.

30
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,050
Then I would like it if you give a little bit.

31
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,400
Taek, let's eat—

32
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,900
Blanket!

33
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,050
This house... I should know if the sun rose or not.

34
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,140
Hey, feet. Feet are out!

35
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,350
It's cold. Is there no warm water?

36
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,510
I think No Eul used all the warm water to wash his hair. Wash with cold water.

37
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,020
How can I wash with cold water? I'll freeze to death. What about Dad?

38
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,310
He did it in the morning.

39
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,850
Washed his hair...

40
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,140
Jeong Hwan, come eat!

41
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,590
Forget it. I'm not going to eat.

42
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,010
Are you going to school?

43
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,140
Aren't you going?

44
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,190
I'm going to go.

45
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,180
Aren't you late?

46
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,970
That's right. That's why I'm just going to go late. I'll crawl in the dog hole (A hole made beneath the school gate).

47
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,800
Hey, Seong Deok Seon, did you receive a confession?

48
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,920
You didn't receive it. You didn't receive it.

49
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,410
Hey, does he perhaps

50
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,800
cherish you so much?

51
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,510
It seems like he's worried that you'd be shocked.

52
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,200
Good for you, girl.

53
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,290
Wow. He's a careful style.

54
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,990
Still, he'd confess before Christmas.

55
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,150
What if while he cherishes it, it becomes poop?

56
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,770
I think he'll do it soon. I've got a  feeling.

57
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,820
Hey, if you kiss him,

58
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,960
you have to tell us.

59
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,850
I understand. Of course.

60
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,080
But get me a signature.

61
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,210
What? Why get a signature? What's so big about being a school president?

62
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,660
No. Not your boyfriend, but Choi Taek.

63
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,130
You said that Choi Taek lives in your alley. Choi Taek, the genius Go player.

64
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,820
My dad said to get it.

65
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,090
Deok Seon, can't you introduce him to me? I'll really do well.

66
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,100
No. Just give me his  phone number.  We'll do phone dating.

67
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,230
I don't see him often either. He's barely home.

68
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,910
Even if he is, he only does Go.

69
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,730
Still you get to talk to him.

70
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,480
I envy you.

71
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,570
He doesn't talk much. You'll die from frustration.

72
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,220
Hey, China even calls Choi Taek a god.

73
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,280
I heard that they treat him as a god.

74
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,370
God of baduk. God of gods.

75
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,000
God? He's an idiot.
(God sounds like shin. Idiot sounds like deung-shin)

76
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,600
You're only like this to us, right? You're not going to be like this in other places, right?

77
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,630
Hey, people really, really respect you.

78
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,850
Some people think of you as a god.

79
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,440
So, don't do anything in front of people.

80
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,210
Don't touch stuff,

81
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,450
and if you don't know anything, ask someone to do it for you.

82
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,530
Am I a fool?

83
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,700
It doesn't work.

84
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,200
Here. You're a fool, right? You're a fool, right? Yeah, you're a fool.  (Turning volume higher) 

85
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,890
 Next is Go news. 

86
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,000
 The final round of the Woori Securities Baduk World Challenge Cup. 

87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,010
 will start in Shanghai, China tomorrow. 

88
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,230
  In the Woori Securities World Cup the best masters from three countries Korea, China and Japan 

89
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,630
 are the only competitors in the international competition. 

90
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,630
 Our country which was the winner last year, had five contestants but four were eliminated 

91
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,790
 and currently there is one player, Grade Six Choi Taek left. 

92
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,540
 Truthfully it is hard to expect him to win. 

93
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,150
Is this all your luggage? You said that you're in China for a week.

94
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,240
A white shirt and pants. What about a jacket?

95
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,010
I put it in.

96
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,160
Then that's it.

97
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,040
Three from China. Two from Japan.

98
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,570
Since there's one person from Korea,

99
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,270
you'll probably come tomorrow after you lose in the first round.

100
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,290
I wasn't uselessly making noises earlier.  If it's not meant to be, it won't be.

101
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,830
Don't uselessly plant hope in the nation's citizens

102
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,020
and just come back and buy us pizza. There's a new shop in Jongno.

103
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,390
What are you going to do if I win?

104
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,360
If you win, you do whatever you want. Why do you ask me?

105
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,130
Do you drink or do you meet women?

106
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,350
With what fun do you live?

107
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,940
Do you have anything you want to do? Do you have anything you want to do instead of Go?

108
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,610
Movie.

109
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,690
Movie actor?

110
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,970
I want to watch a movie.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,740
Then you'll see it when you win this time.

112
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,810
Try to win this time.

113
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,850
Before that, Taek,

114
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,290
let's put your clothes on again.

115
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,890
Really...

116
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,530
I don't understand.

117
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,310
Why do people lose to you?

118
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,410
Really...

119
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,170
I'll do it.

120
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,420
 The 6th Annual Woori Securities World Baduk Championship 

121
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,740

 Tsui Hu 

125
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,900
Let's just leave it at that for today.

126
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,590
It's okay to lose since there are are still two more people.

127
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,860
I'm sure that with three people, at least one will win.

128
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,240
Yes, yes.

129
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,960
We will definitely win this year.

130
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,100
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting! Fighting!

132
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,220
Ahjussi, did Taek win?

133
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,740
It didn't start yet.

134
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,180
Did anyone come inside yet?

135
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,930
Ah, Seon Woo.

136
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,790
Ahjussi boil some water for ramyun!

137
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,100
Seon Woo, let's eat ramyun...

138
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,290
Seon Woo and Jeong Hwan and Dong Ryong are in there.

139
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,570
So unlucky. How can you guys eat like misers?

140
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,880
Then you should hurry up and come.

141
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,770
Can't you call before?

142
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,570
Anyway you're so rude.

143
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,640
Aish, have we ever called before coming?

144
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,990
Because we know when we come, it's to eat.

145
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,280
Anyway, why are your cheeks as rosy as a village girl? Are you some Alois?

146
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,890
Then are you Nello? You look like a country chicken! 
 (Nello and Aloise are the characters in Dog of Flanders.) 

147
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,760
Country bumpkin? Wow?  Big nose-su!

148
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,850
What? Big nose-su?

149
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,270
Stop it!   This country bumpkin, Big nose-su. Jeez!

150
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,160
Hey, when do you escape Sssangmun-dong kindergarten?

151
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,990
And Deok Seon, your cheeks really look chapped.

152
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,640
It's really red. It's really cracked.

153
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,860
See?

154
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,950
Hey, it's because I suddenly came to a warm place after being in a cold place.

155
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,290
It's for a moment. Just a moment!

156
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,900
These guys...

157
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,630
Deok Seon, should I make you another ramyun? It's going to be quick.

158
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,350
No. This is enough. It's okay.

159
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,750
But why does Taek have to win five games all by himself?

160
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,530
He must have successive victories.

161
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,310
Hey would she understand if you say it like that?

162
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,540
All of the Korean players were eliminated and Taek is the only one left

163
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,470
and China has three players, and Japan has two players.

164
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,550
He needs to win today's game to continue to play.

165
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,210
Ah...

166
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,110
But I think it'll be a bit hard for Taek this time.

167
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,300
How can he win everything?

168
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,050
And it seems like he doesn't have a great condition.

169
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,280
Hey, Do Ryong Nyong, you do well yourself.

170
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,700
Have you even seen Taek play?

171
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,500
Nello and Aloise?

172
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,670
He is on  a different level than us.

173
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,920
I said he was in a different class, you kids from the forsythia class at Ssangmun Kindergarten.

174
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,690
Such an unlucky bastard.

175
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:35,090


176
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,480
 Tsui Hu 

177
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,020
Yes.

178
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,920
Yes.

179
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,870
The wind outside is no joke.

180
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,430
- It's so warm.
- Get lost, get lost.

181
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,440
It's because it's so cold.

182
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,320
These days my heart and body are cold.

183
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,070
 The night when the stars shine. 

184
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:15,110
 Hello Starry Night families. This is Starry Night's Lee Moon Sae. 

185
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,990
 The wind outside has now gotten stronger. 

186
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,320
 If you're with someone you love, 

187
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:30,160
 why don't you try to lean onto that person using the wind as an excuse? 

188
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,100
 With a hug warmer than any stove in the world, 

189
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,780
 he will embrace you. 

190
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,000
Ah, Jeong Pal.

191
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,620
Yeah.

192
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,210
There isn't much time left before Hyung Jeong Bong's achievement test, right?

193
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,530
Is studying going well for him?

194
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,320
Do you know our hyung's favorite number?

195
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,220
What is it?

196
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,230
Lucky seven.

197
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,780
I think our hyung is going to make a mistake.

198
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,680
Our hyung is writing postcards these days.

199
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,230
What postcard? To whom?

200
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,170
 This is today's first story. 

201
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:11,740
 "Hello, Hyungnim Moon Sae. I am Kim Jeong Bong who lives in Ssangmun-dong." 

202
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,790
 "It's already been three years since I've listened to Starry Night" 

203
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,370
 I'm a test-taker in the upcoming academic achievement test. 

204
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,200
Yes!

205
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:26,190
 "Your voice and music are a comfort when I am having a hard time from studying." 

206
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,740
 "If I get into college, it's all thanks to Starry Night." 

207
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,000
 "Hyungnim Moon Sae," 

208
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,630
He keeps on saying hyungnim. Hyung Jeong Bong  looks older.

209
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,910
But, I always sent postcards there too. But why doesn't mine get chosen?

210
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,810
Be quiet. Let me listen.

211
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,430
 "It might be hard to believe, but do you know who lives in my alley?" 

212
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:50,140
 "It is the genius Baduk  player, Choi Taek." 

213
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,510
 "Me and Grade Six Choi Taek are childhood friends and very close." 

214
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:02,690
 "But Hyungnim Moon Sae, our Taek is having a hard time because of a big competition coming up." 

215
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,820
 "Soon there will be the first game in Shanghai, China soon" 

216
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,300
 "but they say that the opposite player has an IQ of 160." 

217
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,830
 "For reference, my IQ is in the high nineties." 

218
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,030
 Mister Jeong Bong, you've revealed your IQ to the whole nation. 

219
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:30,780
 "Hyungnim Moon Sae, please cheer for our Taek that he may beat the IQ 160 Chinese player. 

220
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,200
 "It seems like he will need a lot of cheer since he is in a country far away." 

221
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,020
 "Even though I am a Buddhist, I will pray hard." 

222
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,420
 But what should I do Mister Kim Jeong Bong? 

223
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:51,010
 There are more than fifties stories that say that they live in the same alley as Grade Six Choi Taek. 

224
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,580
 So next time, please include a picture with Choi Taek. 

225
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,590
 So then, it will be more confirmed. 

226
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,030
 Still we'll give you a present. 

227
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,430
 For the third winner, Ssangmun-dong's Kim Jeong Bong, we will give 

228
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,090
 a Cabbage patch doll which is very popular these days. 

229
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,440
 I wish Grade Six Choi Taek will come here later if he has a chance. 

230
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,100
 It would be nice if he comes. 

231
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,950
 And some news came out not long ago. 

232
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:27,910
 Six Grade Choi Taek finally beat the IQ 160 Chinese player and got his first win. 

233
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,630
 He's great, right? 

234
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:38,050
 To Grade Six Choi Taek, who won the lonely fight in Shanghai, China, by himself, 

235
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,220
 while wishing for a day which will become very special, on which day? 

236
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,070
On That Day!

237
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,160
We will listen to "On That Day."

238
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,090
Give me some of the blanket.

239
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,280
Hey, hey. Give some to Deok Seon!

240
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,150
Okay, okay.

241
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:06,950
♬  On a day so hot that the sun hurts  ♬

242
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:14,650
Okay. Cover yourself. 
 ♬  On a day the rain poured endlessly  ♬

243
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:23,480
Hey, hey. Stay still. 
♬   On a  day we felt so happy that we waved banners  ♬

244
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:34,480
♬  On a day so mournful life a departing train  ♬

245
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:42,670
♬  Will I go there? The open place in the blue sky  ♬

246
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:50,750
♬   Where the sun is setting across the hill  ♬

247
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,100
I'm leaving.

248
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,000
- Okay. I'm leaving.
- See you tomorrow.

249
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,710
Then, how many people are left?

250
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,010
Four people. There's two from China and two from Japan. But the rest of the four are no joke.

251
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,850
Wow. Can Taek win?

252
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,860
Maybe. He has to take care of his stamina.

253
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,350
Still I wish he would win. Right?

254
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,200
That's right. If Taek wins, we get to eat pizza.

255
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,370
That will be great.

256
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,350
 The 6th Woori Brokerage International Baduk Charmpionship Finals 

257
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,310
 second round will begin after a short time. 

258
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,660
 Six-dan Choi Taek's opponent today is Japan's 9-dan Jang Shwi. 

259
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,930
 He is Japan's highest baduk master who has won as many as 1400 games. 

260
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,120
 At the Japanses press conference today. an  early triumph over Korea was predicted. 

261
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,270
Hey. what are you doing?

262
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,820
How many people are left now?

263
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,890
Four.

264
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,740
Still four people?

265
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,040
It's really hard. It's really hard.

266
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,800
Anyway, if

267
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,000
Taek beats all the Chinese and Japanese,

268
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,240
you can't pass by with chicken.

269
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,420
Ah that thing, the whatchamacallit Maotang or Muetai expensive alcohol.

270
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,770
You will have to give that to us.

271
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,460
Yes. But it'll be a bit hard this time.

272
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,600
Because he has a competition every day and it is hard physically,

273
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,290
and because he's in a slump these days...

274
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,510
I think it'll be hard for him to win.

275
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,340
And the Chinese and Japanese players left

276
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,920
are really good.

277
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,270
So I told you.

278
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,800
If.

279
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:40,290
Even if its by a tiny bit Taek wins, then it's going to be Mao Tai?  Huh?

280
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:45,540
Is it perhaps you're like this because it's a waste to buy alcohol?

281
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,530
No. Not at all.

282
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:55,530
It's just... The competition doesn't rest a single day

283
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,950
and because Taek lost six games in a row, it'll be hard to win, mentally.

284
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,040
So it depends on how this friend

285
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,770
solves this problem.

286
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,510
I wonder what kind of move he is going to make,

287
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,500
when I made so many measures like this.

288
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,530
Taek is really great. I should just make him my son-in-law. My daughter, my dog daughter.

289
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,030
Really? Should I just seduce him?

290
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,320
That's right. Try to seduce him.

291
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,250
You never know, he might not have a good eye for women because he always does baduk.

292
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,430
What? What about me? I'm pretty good this much.

293
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,670
What car is that? Where did you get that?

294
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,200
My sunbae's. He went somewhere so I'm going to be using it for a few months.

295
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,840
Jail. Jail.

296
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,000
A car is dangerous. You never drove after getting your license.

297
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,180
It's okay. I can just do it carefully.

298
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,310
But what is your jacket?

299
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,930
I bought this after saving my allowance. Stop thinking about it.

300
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,240
I'm going to wear that jacket tomorrow.

301
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,210
Then I'll wear your dress, the one that goes up to the knees.

302
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,740
Go ahead.

303
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,450
Aigoo. It's cold. Let's go inside. I'll make some soojaebee.

304
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,410
Get in. You can go riding my car.

305
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,010
No. It's right here.

306
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,260
It's cold. Hurry up and get in!

307
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,520
- No!
- It's right here. It's fine.

308
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,780
Aish!

309
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,710
- No.
- Go ride it. It's quick.

310
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,040
Hurry up and get in. Mom, hurry up and get in.

311
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,640
 Great news has come from Shanghai, China. 

312
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,570
 Grade Six Choi Taek competing against Grade Nine Jang Shui, 

313
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,150
won by a wide margin in 245 moves in Shanghai.

314
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,850
 Grade Six Choi Taek has three games left. 

315
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,540
 Therefore, Korea's victory embers, which were on the verge of dying, can once again be saved. 

316
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,820
Son, I made some castella. Come out and have some.

317
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,620
Forget it. I don't want to eat.

318
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,670
Okay. Study.

319
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,130
Why? Did he say that he's not going to eat?

320
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,570
Yeah. Jeong Bong! Bong!

321
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,990
Don't shout. He's busy studying. Don't bother him.

322
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,140
Jeong Bong, eat some castella.

323
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,180
It's fine. I'm not going to eat it.

324
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,700
I don't have time right now.

325
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,530
What did I say? I told you not to bother him.

326
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,140
I think he'll really go to college this time. The way he concentrates is different than before.

327
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,370
Of course. If he's human, he shouldn't fail seven times.

328
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,170
Here. I'll give it again.

329
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,870
Don't do it. Really.

330
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,920
I understand. I won't do it.

331
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,610
You're not even some lackwit, how can you keep being fooled?

332
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,820
Here. I really won't do it. I really won't do it.

333
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,910
Really. Here.

334
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,710
 On this starry night Joo Yeon and a lot of other people requested the first song. 

335
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,550
 It was "Don't Forget Me" by Kim Hee Ae. 

336
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,960
 Seeing 

337
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,400
 I'm thinking of introducing a story by Ssangmun-dong's Kim Jeong Bong again. 

338
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,630
- Oh yeah!
-  He must be unemployed. 

339
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,640
 He sends a lot. No. I heard that he's a college test taker. 

340
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,970
 It's either he gave up or prepared perfectly. 

341
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:45,440
 "Hyungnim Moon Sae, today I will introduce you to another star in Ssangmun-dong." I'm really going crazy. 

342
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,790
 I guess because it's the neighborhood where Dooly lives, there must be a lot of stars, right? 

343
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,990
 "The star I will introduce today" 

344
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,640
 "Is Seong Bo Ra who lives under our house." 

345
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,940
 "Bo Ra is the smartest kid in our neighborhood." 

346
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,830
 During her high school student days she took first place in her entire school, and she was ranked within the top 80 for the whole country. 

347
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:12,780
 She entered the Seoul University Department of Mathematics with the highest of marks. She's a brilliant mind among brilliant minds. 

348
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,250
 "A couple of adults seeing her say" 

349
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,190
 "that she is violent, scary," 

350
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,850
 There are even people who say that they feel like they'll piss themselves,  

351
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,270
 "but the Seong Bo Ra I know only talks roughly," 

352
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,000
 "but has a warm heart." 

353
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,300
Noona, are you crazy? You'll die if you get caught by Dad.

354
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,130
Forget about that. Why?

355
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,610
Aunt Grandma passed away.

356
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,090
Really?

357
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,680
Okay.

358
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,960
Bo Ra,

359
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,980
we can just ride a bus.

360
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,660
The bus stopped.

361
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,800
Which one was the  accelerator? Is it this one?

362
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,600
Bo Ra, Bo Ra, we'll just ride a taxi. It's hard for you.

363
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,480
Is our house rich? Do we have a lot of money? Just go.

364
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,950
This crappy car.

365
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,070
You should put down the side mirror.

366
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,970
- Oh.
- Noona, the front. The front!

367
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,090
I'm looking at everything.

368
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,900
- Dog, dog!
- I said that I'm looking!

369
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,520
I think the car hit something.

370
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,060
- Should I go out and look?
- No, don't go!

371
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,790
- I'll go out and see for a moment.
- I said don't go! Don't move.

372
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,510
You girl, I think you hit a dog. Don't we have to go out and check?

373
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,010
I said don't go!

374
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,370
Then hurry up and go. What if a car comes from behind?

375
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,830
I don't want to! I'm not going to go. Don't go out. What should I do?

376
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,280
Then, Honey, you should go out. See what happened.

377
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,700
I said don't go. Don't go out. No one move.

378
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,130
Then hurry up and go. A car is coming from behind!

379
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,000
I said I'm not going. I'm not going to start!

380
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,010
Hey, aren't you going to turn it off?

381
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,600
 Girl, shouldn't you go out and check if something happened? 

382
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,930
 No! Never! Try going out! 

383
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,150
 Bo Ra, I think it's okay to slowly start going. 

384
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,860
 Are you crazy? How can we just go if the dog died? 

385
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,720
 Then let's just spend the night here. Let's spend the night here! 

386
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,470
 If you grow older, you should be more mature. The more you age, your temper grows worse. 

387
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,980
 What about me? What did I do? 

388
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,130
 One day you came to me
-Aren't you going to turn it off? 

389
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,120
Turn it off!

390
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,260
Do you want to die, you bastard? Why are you crying?

391
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,200
 This heart is getting excited. 

392
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,630
♫  One day  ♫  

393
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:18,410
♫  Let's bury love in our two hearts  ♫  

394
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:25,250
♫  We are whispering again  ♫  

395
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,850
Did something good happen today? Your dancing is good today.

396
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,920
Yeah. Taek won again.

397
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,720
Really?

398
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,140
Taek said that he'll buy pizza if he wins.

399
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,460
But there are still three people left, right?

400
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,680
Yeah, Chinese players.

401
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,510
He's a Wang Lei  killer!He's a Wang Lei killer!

402
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,540
Why is this bastard like this?

403
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,270
He's a Wang Lei killer!

404
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,470
Are you crazy? Hey.

405
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,350
The third round will start with 6-dan Choi Taek and 9-dan  Wang Lei

406
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,930
Mom, have you seen my jacket?

407
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,430
Your sister wore it and went out early in the morning. She has sports competition.

408
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,920
Really? Then I'm going to wear Unni's dress.

409
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,410
Aigoo. Go ahead. You two agreed.

410
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,060
But can you wear it even though it's cold?

411
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,540
It's okay. I can just wear a coat on top.

412
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,960
Gipsy, gipsy, gipsy, gipsy.

413
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,490
Seong Bo Ra this crazy girl.

414
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,670
I'm going to kill her!

415
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,820
Ball! Ball, ball.

416
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:12,010
Okay! Ah, don't come closer !

417
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,390
It's mine. It's mine. Don't come near!

418
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,590
Hey! Hey!

419
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,780
I bought a new bag.
- It's nice.  Do you want to trade?

420
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,810
Why do you say such nonsense like that?

421
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,830
Students.

422
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,970
Can you look at me?

423
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,070
This was expensive.

424
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,100
Ah ha!

425
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,060
What?

426
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,390
You guys did two wrong things. The first is

427
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:55,700
students smoked cigarettes. And second is that you threw  the cigarette on the floor.

428
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,800
Okay?

429
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,290
Ahjussi, just go.

430
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,660
Right now, you increase your wrongdoings to three.

431
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:11,380
I am not an Ahjussi.

432
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,580
Ahjussi, I said to go.

433
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,910
I said that I'm not an ahjussi.

434
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,830
Really!

435
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,160
Ah Ha!

436
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,560
What are you glaring at? What are you glaring at? You small kid.

437
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,740
Who are you?

438
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,110
What do you mean who I am? I am the magistrate for justice.

439
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,380
Hey, you're from Ssangmun High School, right? You're from Ssangmun High School, right? Should I call the Dean?

440
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,200
Should I call your teacher, she lives right there!

441
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,270
No, no.
-No, no.

442
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,760
Your bones are going to rot, bastards.

443
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,030
And a student smokes 88 Gold, not Pine Tree?

444
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,310
I'm sorry.

445
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,800
Look. American products? American products?

446
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,960
Do you know how good domestic products come out these days?

447
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,190
Follow me. "Let's use domestic products!"

448
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,350
"Let's use-"
-Aren't you going to say it loud?
-Yes, loud.

449
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,530
"Let's use domestic products!"

450
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,730
"Let's use domestic products!"

451
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,730
"Let's quit smoking!"

452
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,240
"Let's quit smoking!"

453
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,610
Salvation in the flames!

454
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,000
The nation's flames!

455
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,640
The nation's flames!

456
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,590
The nation's flames!

457
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,300
Flaming warriors unite!

458
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,810
Flaming warriors unite!

459
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,550
Set the fighters for democracy free!

460
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,810
Set the fighters for democracy free!

461
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,440
Freeze the tuition fees!

462
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,400
Freeze them!

463
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,500
- Freeze them, freeze them, freeze them!
- Freeze them! Freeze them!

464
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:57,450
Why is the Ohgong Government Building not a prison?

465
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,200
 In Shanghai there has been a miracle at the Woori Securities International Baduk Championship. 

466
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,400
 The only remaining players are Korea's 6-dan Choi Taek, China's 9-dan Wang Lei. 

467
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,130
 Japan's 9-dan Wang Ming Wang was defeated. Today there will 

468
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,170
 be the last ferocious battle between Wang Lei and Choi. 

469
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,590
- I'm leaving. 
 - Yeah.

470
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,550
Why don't you just live in our house if you're going to come all the time?

471
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,230
I didn't come here to see you.

472
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,220
Did Oppa Jeong Bong wake up?

473
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,560
Yeah. What about Bong?

474
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,350
I always send stories to Starry Night but Oppa Jeong Bong only gets picked.

475
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,060
I'm going to borrow postcards from Oppa Jeong Bong.

476
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,680
Is your hyung not studying these days?

477
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,030
Did he ever do it?

478
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,030
I'm leaving.

479
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,900
Oh my, oh my. Bong Hwang Dang!

480
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,440
There's only one person now.

481
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,910
Yes. If he wins today, he wins.

482
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,980
Wow... As expected our Taek

483
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,940
For me he is just a man among men.

484
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,760
He beats all five people.

485
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,170
Then if Taek comes back, a congratulation party.

486
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,090
Boom, will he have one clean sweep after a long time?

487
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:30,040
There's still one game left. He has to win this round to win.

488
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,860
There you go again, pretending there's a problem.

489
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,740
They say that last competition is against a rookie player

490
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,370
According to the news, they say that Taek will win for sure.

491
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,980
You do know when it comes to Go.

492
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,510
Oh my. What do you mean you don't know? Do you know what kind of guy Taek is?

493
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:47,770
All the best experts lose to our Taek.

494
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:52,970
Those who looked like masters were just minnows.  Have a go at our Taek!  What can he do?

495
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,280
Taek has a jinx.

496
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,160
What jinx?

497
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,530
As you can see, he doesn't speak and is quiet.

498
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,130
And he's severely shy.

499
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,630
There is no one who is more cheerful than our Taek.

500
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,060
Go is also shy.

501
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,580
He's weak to a new opponent.  When they first confront each other, he gets weak-kneed.

502
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,700
Ahjussi, did Seon Woo pass by?

503
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,540
Yeah, not long ago.

504
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,040
Say your greetings while living, girl.

505
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,130
Good bye!

506
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:32,320
Then if he's really unlucky, he could lose.

507
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,150
Anyways, even if he loses, since we tried hard to cheer for him, let's have a drink.

508
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,350
Fighting!

509
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,620
Director, why is Grade Six Choi Taek not coming down?

510
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,240
Did something happen?

511
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,560
Grade Six Choi Taek usually comes down on time.

512
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,040
After thinking on his own, he comes right before the game.

513
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,630
There. He's coming.

514
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,590
It looks like he's going to die soon.

515
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,470
It seems like he didn't sleep at all.

516
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,680
Reporter Shin, five games in a row. Five consecutive games.

517
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,360
Even in domestic matches there is day break in between.

518
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,510
Master Choi is admirable even sitting there.

519
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,030
Perhaps, even if he loses, write good reports.

520
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,730
No way he's going to win?

521
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,890
Because everyone is like this, Taek can't sleep.

522
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,340
Grade Six Choi Taek is black.

523
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:47,840
But, wasn't Grade Six Choi Taek's results better when he was white?

524
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:57,570
The match will be starting.  We want the reporters to leave within ten minutes.

525
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,000
Ah Ahjussi, did you get a call?
-Did you get a call?

526
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,490
No, not yet.

527
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,920
Ah, yes.

528
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,000
Hey, how is Taek doing? Did he win?

529
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,100
Did he lose?

530
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,170
The game isn't over yet.

531
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,380
I'm waiting for his call.

532
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,230
What about Taek? Did he win?

533
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,180
Not yet.

534
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,680
Did a call from Taek not come yet?

535
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,670
I don't know yet.

536
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,590
The game didn't finish yet. I didn't receive a call yet.

537
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,920
Wait in your home.

538
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,120
Did a call not come yet?

539
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,600
Yes, not yet.

540
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,630
 Return to Sender 

541
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,690
She put a charity sticker and not a postage stamp?  Gosh.

542
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,870
 Hello Oraboni Moon Sae.(Oraboni: more honorific than oppa) 

543
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:24,100
 I am Sunny from Ssangmun-dong. 

544
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,200
 Please do not reveal my name. 

545
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,900
 Oppa, right now, I am experiencing my first love. 

546
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,040
 I started to love a close friend living in the same neighborhood. 

547
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,110
 Whenever I see that friend, I feel better 

548
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:42,100
 and whenever I eat and study, I only think of that friend. 

549
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,080
 Oppa, this is love, right? 

550
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,950
 The kid's name that I like is SW. 

551
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,980
 His name is cool, right? 

552
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,180
 He looks more cool than his name. 

553
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,990
 Lastly, I want to say something to SW. 

554
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,590
 SW, thanks for liking me and 

555
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,870
 I like you too. 

556
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:14,650
  015B On an empty street 
 ♬ A miserable figure which is seen through the windows  ♬

557
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,910
Jeong Hwan!

558
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,080
The game is over. I just received a call.

559
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,000
How was your game today?

560
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,290
It was very difficult. I couldn't win at all. He's an expert.

561
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:44,570


562
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,730
You've worked hard.

563
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,900
Hey Bong Hwang Dang!

564
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,920
What happened? Did he win?

565
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,940
Right, did he win or lose?

566
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,890
By this time, the results must have come out. Tell me.

567
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,650
Did Jeong Hwan not say?

568
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,930
He just went to his room.

569
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,930
Really! Hurry up and say it. Stop stalling.

570
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,670
This quick tempered guy is just going to collapse from being short of breath!

571
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,240
He won.

572
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,520
I said that Taek will win!

573
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,580
Korea hooray!

574
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:48,110
On this kind of day, this shouldn't be not here.

575
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,790
What are you going to do now?

576
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:34,270
There's no game for a while. Don't you have any plans?

577
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,280
I have something to do.

578
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,520
What?

579
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,550
 The Woori Securities International Baduk Championships are over. 

580
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,420
 Our country's Choi Taek won five consecutive games. 

581
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:03,430
 And brought Korea to winning which seemed impossible. 

582
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,330
 Our county's defending championship team ... 

583
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:09,270
I only heard that Taek was good but I didn't know that he was that good.

584
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:13,240
Only our nation doesn't consider him highly, but other countries treat him better than a president.

585
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,760
Is that right?

586
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,300
Deok Seon, why aren't you eating sweet potato? Whenever see potato go crazy.

587
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,630
Well she probably shoved something down.

588
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:28,390
Girl, how can you talk about your sister like that.Could you just say "she ate:"

589
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:32,250
Deok Seon, there's a lot of dietary fiber in sweet potatoes.

590
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,050
I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat it. I shouldn't fill my stomach with that.

591
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,420
It's time I should be receiving a call.

592
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:46,180
 Although he suffered a domestic slump in which he lost six matches in a row, 

593
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,850
  in international competion this time, he won five consecutive matches 

594
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:54,270
 and up to now has had recorded twenty consecutive wins internationally, and once again is at the top 

595
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:57,780
  and has proved himself a master to people. 

596
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,010

♫  I received a call  ♫   

599
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,950
 In the big competition he displayed his ability in a strong show of force. 

600
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:14,750
Jeong Hwan, eat sweet potato.

601
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,490
Forget it.

602
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,460
Taek still didn't arrive?

603
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,300
♫  He said to meet  ♫

Mom eat it. I'm fine.

608

00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,260
Why? Are you crazy?

626
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,470
Do you want to die?

627
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,750
What is this? You didn't even eat it because you had no appetite.

628
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,420
I'm going to take it home.

629
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,930
Hey, do rock paper scissor.

630
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:14,460
Aish. I got rejected by the cardigan noona in the library.

631
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,510
I'm really pitiful.

632
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,430
I live in a half attic.

633
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,650
Jeong Hwan lived in a single room three years ago.

634
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,600
My unni is Seong Bo Ra.

635
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,040
His hyung is Kim Jeong Bong.

636
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,260
Aish.

637
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,370
Why? I like my hyung.

638
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,590
Then, that's it, right? I'm going to eat this.

639
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,220
No, no. Wait. Do you have any tough situation?

640
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,350
What? Pitiful stuff?

641
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,380
Don't say your dad.

642
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,380
Don't say your mom. It's a foul. These guys.

643
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:09,950
I have someone I like but I haven't been able to confess for two years.

644
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,350
I said it to laugh but why is the mood like this. You eat it.

645
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,580
It's real.

646
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,580
Why is the mood like this?

647
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,350
I don't know what I will do.

648
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,740
Confess.

649
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,030
What?

650
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,120
Confess.

651
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,430
When the first snow falls.

652
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,980
When the first snow falls, confess, okay?

653
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,160
Taek is really great.

654
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,130
Taek's father must be full without even eating.

655
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,260
Yes. I feel good today.

656
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,550
So that's why I'm saying this.

657
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,840
Do you have no thought of switching our three children with Taek?

658
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,470
Three to one trade.

659
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:33,380
If you think about it, it's not a damaging trade. But it's because

660
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,840
it's so hard taking care of daughters.

661
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,550
Of course. Bo Ra is a bit hard.

662
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,240
I still can't look at her face.

663
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,590
Because she's scary.

664
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:48,490
To me, especially.

665
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,860
What about Jin Joo? I don't see her.

666
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,460
I sent her to our relatives. Because Tae Soo was going to Gimhae, I sent her with him.

667
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,430
I guess she's doing well not crying.

668
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,200
She really like her maternal grandma.

669
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,070
It's good. She can eat whatever she likes as much as she wants. And I can eat whatever I like as much as I want.

670
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:09,700
What is this? The alcohol is gone already.

671
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:16,360
Seriously... why did you just buy only one

672
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,450
who is barely making a living?

673
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,290
I will go buy some.

674
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,400
At our house we have a jar of plum liquor.

675
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,350
Call home and tell Bo Ra to hurry up and bring it.

676
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:30,020
There's No Eul.

677
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,860
No Eul went out to sleep in his friend's house.

678
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,060
Deok Seon is playing with Taek.

679
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,690
What are you doing not calling?

680
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,180
 Why are you telling me bring that? I don't want to. 

681
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,620
 I'm going to Sunbae's house. I said that I'm going to be out all night. 

682
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,810
So, while you're going out,

683
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,140
cant you  just drop by for a moment?

684
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,080
After opening the gate, one, two, three, four.

685
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,580
You come after walking four steps.

686
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,630
That girl... as if she would come out.

687
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,540
Look. Even though she's like this, she'll come.

688
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:22,850
Really, Sungnim? Do you want to bet whether she comes or not?

689
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:28,690
She'll come. Look. Even though her words are like that, her heart is warm.

690
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:31,610
If you say she is warm two times, we would all burn.

691
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:34,090
We'd all burn and die.

692
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,620
Look. I said that she'll come.

693
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:45,240
Bo Ra, hurry up and come. Come here. Put it here.

694
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:48,660
Ahjumma, where is the bathroom?

695
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,150
Bathroom? Here, here.

696
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:02,270
Aigoo. Who is it in this time of night? My back...

697
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,510
Since when? What did the hospital say?

698
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,620
Yeah.

699
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,380
Oh... Still you have to watch all night.

700
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,410
Her fever can go up suddenly.

701
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,130
Tomorrow morning,

702
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:27,860
I will go down with the first bus.

703
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:32,130
Yeah, yeah. I understand.

704
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,510
Is Jin Joo sick?

705
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:41,460
Yes. They say that her fever went up to 40 Celsius at night.

706
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,850
What about the hospital?

707
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,730
She did go and got a lot better but

708
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:52,010
as a Mom I am drinking alcohol without knowing my child is sick.

709
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,590
Don't you have to go down now?

710
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:56,810
Get up. I'll drive you there.

711
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:01,330
Sit down. How are you going to drive when you're drunk?

712
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:04,220
Aigoo, the last car probably left.

713
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,400
Just go out tomorrow morning in the first car. She'll be fine.

714
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,170
Since she went to the hospital, nothing bad is going to happen.

715
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:14,600
Don't worry. All kids grow up like that.

716
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,390
Good bye.

717
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:23,670
Hey. The friend you're meeting today is a girl friend, right?

718
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,510
Aigoo, she's an adult, an adult. Why do you interfere so much?

719
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:30,340
What if it's a guy or a girl?

720
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,970
Aigoo, I don't know where she goes all the time.

721
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:38,300
Don't worry about Bo Ra. She will do everything well herself.

722
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,480
Isn't she a smart kid?

723
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:46,750
She's already two times smarter than her parents and bosses us around so much we are in agony.  Bossy.

724
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,310
 Bong Hwang Dang 

725
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:01,430
Taek, sleep well. I'm going to sleep.

726
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,430
Yes. Good night.

727
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:07,280
Ahjussi, good night!

728
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,750
Seon Woo.

729
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,840
What is it?

730
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,310
Let's switch places with me.

731
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:38,580
I don't want to. I'm going to sleep next to Taek. He's really warm.

732
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,540
It's good if I hold him and sleep.

733
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:43,680
It's not that.

734
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,810
This bastard farted again.

735
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:51,450
Ah, really. Why are you like this?

736
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,670
Ah! It smells! What did you eat?

737
00:59:54,670 --> 01:00:00,670
Hey, hey. Why are you like this? You always fart.

738
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,950
Mom, did she look for me?

739
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,580
Oh. She might have had indigestion. So if she wakes in the middle of the night, don't give her anything.

740
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:14,880
Okay, okay. I understand. I'll go early in the morning tomorrow.

741
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,670
Why? Did Jin Joo wake up?

742
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:57,490
I can go tomorrow. You won't be able to sleep all night.

743
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:02,480
Anyway, even if I go to Sunbae's house, we were just going to be playing all night.

744
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,370
Get in.

745
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,220
Hurry up and get in.

746
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,230
- It's cold! 
 - Okay, okay.

747
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:30,280
Bong, call Dad. Tell him to eat dinner.

748
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,110
Yes.

749
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,750
Yes.

750
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:48,380
He's asking what we are having for dinner.

751
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,220
Meat.

752
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,920
It's meat, Dad.

753
01:01:55,970 --> 01:02:00,600
What kind of meat?  Beef?  Pork?

754
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,510
Beef, beef, beef!  Come quickly.

755
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:07,390
 I will report the weather. 

756
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,810
 We have great news of first snow on the first Wednesday of December. 

757
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:15,030
 We can predict that a great amount of snow will come, although it's the first snow. 

758
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:19,940
- I've come back from school! 
 -Hurry up and wash up so we can eat dinner.

759
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,490
Okay.

760
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,740
I'm home.

761
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:30,250
Son, you've come? Hurry up and wash up. I bought meat today. You don't eat these days.

762
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:34,440
Forget about me. I don't feel good. I'm going to wash up.

763
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,520
 Now, should I start introducing stories? 
Yes!  

764
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,490
 Because it's almost Christmas, there are a lot of stories of love and break up. 

765
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,470
 This is the first story: 

766
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:57,300
 "I am Lee Ji Eun from Myeongmok-dong." 

767
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,990
 Deok Seon, I'm going to the market! 
Okay!  

768
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:05,170
 1988 winter is so cold for me. 

769
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:14,950
Oh my, it looks like it'll really snow today.

770
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:26,490
Dongsaeng, outside snow-

771
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:36,990
might come. So if it snows wake me up.

772
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:41,550
I want to see the first snow.

773
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,990
Really...

774
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:13,130
Please say my story once.

775
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:18,240
Deok Seon! Seong Deok Seon!

776
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:35,310
Seon Woo, are you here? Come in.

777
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:37,580
It's okay.

778
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,920
What's up?

779
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:44,520
Is Noona Bo Ra here?
-Who? Seong Bo Ra?

780
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,150
Seong Bo Ra isn't here.

781
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,790
Why Unni?

782
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:56,230
Snow is falling.

783
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,740
Huh?

784
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:32,000
♫  Stay by my side. You must not leave. ♫  

785
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:40,350
♫   Leaving the longing behind the long road    ♫

786
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:47,800
 Seon Woo, wait for a moment. I'll hurry up and bring it.
Okay. 

787
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:55,070
♫  While sitting on the windowsill and seeing the sunset  ♫  

788
01:05:55,070 --> 01:06:01,350
♫ and clouds floating far away 

789
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:07,080
♫   The memories    ♫

790
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,270
  Oh, Noona! 

791
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:12,210
 Oh, Seon Woo. Did you come here to borrow something again? 

792
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:15,000
 Pencil lead. 

793
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:40,710
♬  Stay at my side. ♬

794
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:47,710
♬  Don't leave.  ♬

795
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:02,930
 What are you looking at? Did you come here to spy on me too? 

796
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:07,560
 No. I'm just wondering if you're okay. 

797
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:15,420
 Seon Woo. Here, sewing kit. 

798
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,750
 That's mine. 

799
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:22,230
 Where would she get a sewing kit? You should borrow things from people who have them. 

800
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:25,240
 You too are really frustrating. 

801
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,780
 What happened to the class president? 

802
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:44,050
♫  The old memories I want to hold unto.  ♫  

803
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:54,740
♫  In the cold blowing wind  ♫  

804
01:07:54,740 --> 01:08:01,940
♫  Don't cry of loneliness  ♫  

805
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:09,360
♫  I will always be by your side  ♫  

806
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:16,630
♫  I won't leave  ♫  

807
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:43,150
♫ From my side, you must not leave  ♫  

808
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:46,370
Hey! Stand there.

809
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:55,000
Why?  Why Seong Bora? I said why Seong Bora?

810
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,400
- Because I like her. 
- Where? What do you like about her?

811
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,640
- She's pretty. 
 - Bullsh*t.

812
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,800
- She's smart. 
 -Wow.

813
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,170
- And she's kind. 
 - Crazy dude.

814
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:09,660
And the mole next to her eye is pretty.

815
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:15,360
I made that. I said I made that by poking it with a pencil lead when I was nine years old!

816
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:19,610
Really! Why is is Seong Bo Ra? Seong Bo Ra...

817
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:23,410
I said why is it Seong Bo Ra?!

818
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:32,620
You... I won't see you again.

819
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:39,990
What are you going to do if you don't eat like that? Are you hungry? Should I make you some ramyun?

820
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:43,360
Yes, that's good. Ramyun.

821
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,490
Ramyun.

822
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:57,090
 This is the last story for today. Truthfully for this person's story 

823
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:04,470
 we waited for a day. The day of first snow. 

824
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:12,010
 A lot of Starry Night families probably wanted to spend the first snow with the people they love. 

825
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:18,750
 I think that this person who sent the story waited for it the most. 

826
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:24,290
 This is a story sent from Sunny who lives in Ssangmun-dong. 

827
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:31,660
 "Hello. Orabeoni Moon Sae. I am Ssangmun-dong's Sunny, who is currently through first love's heartache". 

828
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:35,830
 "I am liking a friend who lives in the same neighborhood." 

829
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:38,870
 And that friend likes me too." 

830
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:45,040
 "But I haven't received a confession from that friend yet." 

831
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,020
 "He's a very shy friend so he doesn't become brave easily." 

832
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:56,440
 "Oppa, my wish is to receive a confession from that friend on the first snow." 

833
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:00,420
 "So please read my story on the first snow." 

834
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:05,020
 "Because even if I don't receive a confession on that day" 

835
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:11,020
 "I might be a little bit comforted if I don't get a confession since the story was released to the whole nation." 

836
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:18,020
 "I would also really like it if I get a confession from that friend and my story is read on the broadcast." 

837
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:23,200
 "Orabeoni Moon Sae, please pray that my first love will happen." 

838
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,160
 "I will trust in you." 

839
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:32,170
 I feel very burdened. It's good to trust me but... 

840
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:39,490
 I think there will be a lot of people who have a story like the story Ssangmun-dong's Sunny gave. 

841
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:45,660
 Ah... Ssangmun-dong's Sunny, you know that it's the first snow is falling right now, right? 

842
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:49,870
 Did you perhaps receive a confession from him? I'm really curious. 

843
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:55,140
 What is the feeling of receiving a confession from your first love on first snow? 

844
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:58,190
 I think maybe tonight  

845
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:02,610
 the two people will the happiest people on earth. 

846
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:06,210
 Now, like that beautiful first snow falling 

847
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:11,530
 I hope you two would grow a beautiful love together for a long long time. 

848
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:17,580
 Starry Night families, do you know this? 

849
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:23,920
 If you confess on first snow, the chance of succeeding is 90%. 

850
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,040
 I think it's because of the romantic mood. 

851
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:32,300
 Right now, if you are loving one someone right now 

852
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:38,750
 and if you're hesitating on confessing. Tonight is the chance. 

853
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,080
 I hope you be brave and confess. 

854
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,710
Noona!

855
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:46,620
 The chance of succeeding is 90%. 

856
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:52,330
 And the rest of the 10% is destiny. 

857
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:57,460
 You just have to leave it to luck. Have strength. 

858
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:01,610
- Where did you come from? 
 - From the countryside.

859
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:06,470
- Dressed  like this? 
 -Anyway, I feel like I'm freezing to death.

860
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:10,030
What is it?  Did something happen?  What are you doing here?

861
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:13,720
I've been waiting for you.

862
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:18,860
For me?  Why?

863
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,190
I have something to tell you.

864
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:24,600
Speak.

865
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,010
- I'm really saying it.  
  - Yeah. Do it.

866
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,100
I like you.

867
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,370
I said I like you.

868
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:50,630
 I hope everyone who confessed today will fulfill their love. 

869
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:57,260
 Lastly, if you didn't receive a confession from someone you love, 

870
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:02,720
 or if anyone is having a hard time because a hurt from love, 

871
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,130
 don't be too sad. 

872
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:10,710
 There might be someone else right now loving you. 

873
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:17,430
Hello? Oh, what's up in this time of night?

874
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:22,110
Oh, wait. Deok Seon, answer the phone! Deok Seon, you got a phone call.

875
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:25,400
 And the person might confess suddenly. 

876
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:30,940
 That that person liked you for a long time. 

877
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,680
- Hello? 
  -Wow. This will be the ending song today. 

878
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,520
 It is a song that matches tonight so well. 

879
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,890
 Lee Jeong Seok is singing, "The First Snow is Coming". 

880
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:53,200
It's me, Taek. 
  -  Oh. Why are you calling? Did something happen? 

881
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,920
No.  Nothing happened.

882
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,820
 Hurry up and go in. Hurry up and sleep. It's almost 12. 

883
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,100
Yes. Okay.

884
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:07,600
- Deok Seon.   
  - Yeah. What? 

885
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:12,010
Shall we go to a movie?

886
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:16,450
♫   Everything is gone.   ♫

887
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:19,130
Let's see a movie.  We two.

888
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:22,950
♫   Ball of snow.     ♫

889
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:38,650
♫    I miss all the forgotten memories, I really miss them    ♫

890
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,030
Puhlease Unni!

891
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:46,940
Hey, cut some slack.

892
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:50,260
I can't even smoke at home. I could only smoke here.

893
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:53,250
Then go outside and smoke. Go to the veranda in the back and smoke.

894
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:56,160
Ah, really. So strict.

895
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,850
Unni, it's your phone.

896
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:02,900
It's Brother-in-Law. It's a video message.

897
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,260
- Here, here.
- Hey.

898
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,310
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

899
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:13,460
Honey. Why are you calling at this time?

900
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:17,460
I'm at Deok Seon's house.

901
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:21,670
Deok Seon, it's snowing.

902
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:24,470
It's real.

903
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:27,150
Honey!

904
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:30,250
Hey! It's snowing. Hurry up and come out.

905
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:35,350
 Honey, you come too. I miss you. 

906
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:39,280
The memory I remember the most when it comes to first snow?

907
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,490
When you confessed to Seon Woo and got rejected? Around 1988?

908
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:48,780
She wrote a postcard to Starry Night. It was chaotic. She put on a whole show.

909
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,240
How did you know that?

910
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:54,900
Perhaps, did I say it?

911
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:59,480
What do I not know about you? Treat me well.

912
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,200
Because it's me, I understand all this about you. Where is there such husband like me?

913
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:07,650
You're joking. Should I say all the people you met before marriage?

914
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:12,170
Should we spend all night? 
 - Anyway, if it was 1988

915
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,410
wasn't that when I went to the university music contest? Was it at the Gymnastics Stadium?

916
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:17,950
Who did you go to College Music Festival?

917
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:21,340
No. I went with our friends.

918
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:24,020
I said I saw it at home on the television.

919
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:28,680
No. We went and saw it. What was the grand prize winner? Jeong Yoo Na's "Love Is".

920
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:34,240
That was in 1989. 1988 was Infinite Love's "To You".

921
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:38,440
Oh... It's not. It's Jeong Yoo Na.

922
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:41,890
Aigoo, I said that it's Infinite Orbit..

923
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:16,980
  Should we guess who gets first place? We'll all pay one dollar, and the winner will take everything. 

924
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:19,050
 Me! Me! 

925
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,400
 Early Merry Christmas. 

926
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,190
 Let's see on the night of Eve. 

927
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:29,040
 Then the presents for our children this Christmas is 

928
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,660
 There is no Santa. 

929
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,530
  That's it, that's it! 

930
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:38,100
 Hurry up and apologize. Hurry up and beg. 

931
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,050
 There's no need to apologize over this. 

932
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:43,490
  Really just throw it. Just throw it. 

933
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:48,030
 Why is the mood like this when's it's Christmas? 

934
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:50,850
  - Something big happened. 
 - What happened? 

935
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,730
 What's with the shivering? 

936
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:56,200
  Freeze. Freeze. 

937
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:02,250
 Only the two of us know about what happened today. 

938
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,470
 I have something to say to you. 
 -Me? 

939
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:07,630
 What? Why are you putting a fight again? 

940
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:12,120
  We will start the manito game from now. 

941
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,940
  I have you. 

942
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,540
 You're my manito, right? 

943
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:20,200
 I don't even have a manito. 

944
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,500
 I am a child that doesn't deserve love. 

945
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,720
 Then see you on Christmas day. Stay well until then.
