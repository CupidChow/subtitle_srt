Hey, Kim Jeong Pal! You should've also bought a poster.

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,060
No need, as long as I heard it with my ears.

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,450
Hurry! We have a long walk to the bus stop.

6
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,920
I am coming.

Hey! Ho Yeong! It's been a long time!

Hey! That's not true. What are you saying?
 ♬  In an unforgettable memory  ♬

I called you a few times after we graduated middle school.

Your home phone number hasn't changed, right? Can I call you?

Ho Yeong! What are you doing!

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,630
Yeah, I will be right there! Deok Seon, I will be going first.

 ♬   When autumn comes which cold rain  ♬

23
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,520
In Pang Hak Middle School, if you didn't know him then you would be a spy (from the north).

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,070
He followed me around a lot. He gave me a lot of letters too. 
♬   In the cold wind will wash it away?  ♬

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,130

Then the person whom I saw in middle school was a ghost and not you? What nonsense are you talking about?

Stop talking nonsense and wait here. I will go to the restroom.

She's not pretty.

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,300
Not pretty but really cute, right? I followed her around so much in middle school.

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,840
She's cute as always.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,760
This punk has a weird taste.

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,910

Seriously!

Isn't that bastard crazy?

Seriously!

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,510
How come you don't even have a gram of caution?

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,200
Where is the part where you could trip in here? Where? Look, where is it?

Anyway, you can't stand it—

42
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,600
Hey, do you think I wanted to trip? It happened when I went to the bathroom.

43
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,590
Jeong Pal, I think I can't walk a step. What should I do?

44
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,000
Seriously.

45
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,610
- Hey! Hey! 
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

46
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,500
You should put strength in here.

47
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,750
Should I?

48
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,900
I can't live because of you. Seriously!

49
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,050
Why are you laughing? What good thing did you do to be laughing?

50
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,650
Okay.

51
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,050
You should put strength here, to go. Are you stupid?

52
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,930
- Like this?
 - Right.

53
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,650
- Do you like it? 
 - No.

54
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,140
We're really late, aren't we? Shouldn't we call home?

55
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,410
I will go and make a call.

56
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,270
Okay. Hurry back.

57
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,910

 - I'm a senior now so I will study.

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,550
Then turn the TV off.

59

No Eul, am I pretty or is Chae Si Ra pretty?

60
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,650
Noona, am I cool or is Tom Cruise?

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,780
- For me, you.
 - For me, Chae Si Ra.

62
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,330
Jin Joo, do you want to sleep in my room today?

63
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,810
No, you can't. Jin Joo is reading a book right now.

64
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,750
What book? She doesn't even know the letters yet.

65
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,400
Jin Joo, I will read it to you so let's sleep in my room.

66
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,040
You're going to your Oppa?

67
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,170
Here. Sleep well, Mom.

Teacher... I mean Father, no, Teacher, no Father.

72
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,760
It's 7:10 and it's time for Janghak Quiz. I will be going inside now.

73
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,730
Okay. Janghak Quiz, it's such a good program.

74
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,380
A student should be watching it. Go and enter.

75
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,310
Entering.

76
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,090
That... Deok Seon.
- Soo Yeon.

77
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,260
Okay, fine. Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon.

78
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,820
That... I have a wish.

79
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,460
What is it, Dad? I will fulfill it no matter what.

80
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,180
Going on there... Janghak Quiz.

81
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,240
I... if you go on there

82
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,970
I don't even expect you to win or something.

83
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,260
It's okay to get it all wrong so just seeing you stand there would have me wishing for nothing else.

84
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,940
- I'm sorry, Dad.
 - What for?

85
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,260
I don't think I can fulfill that wish.

86
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,680
Right.

87
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
For your honesty, very good.

88
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,460
Bo Ra, teach Soo Yeon to study. She's a senior now.

89
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,260
I don't want to.

90
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,970
I will study in the room today so you go study in the library.

91
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,620
The library is under construction today. You go study in Taek's room.

92
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,360
Taek is busy. I shouldn't bother him.

93
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,790
Right, right. Next week would be the finals for the Fujitsu, right?

94
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,910
If our Taekie gets the Fujitsu then he would have a grand slam.

95
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,880
Wow. Don't disturb him, don't hassle him and don't even go.

96
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,580
I know better than that. Don't worry.

97
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,470
Wait, there's one more, right?

98
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,990
Seon Woo, go to Taek's house for a while.

99
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,830
What is it?

100
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,170
It's seasoned seaweed. It's good for high blood pressure.

101
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,290
Go and give it to Taek's dad.

102
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,340
Oh, okay.

103
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,710
Ahjussi!

104
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,930
What are you doing here?

105
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,880
Studying. In this neighborhood, this house is the quietest.

106
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,730
Then what are you doing here so early in the morning?

107
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,740
- Seon Woo, you're here. 
- Mom wants you to have this.

108
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,960
I'll eat it well.

109
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,820
Seon Woo, about the faucet...

110
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,640
Faucet? In our house?

111
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,860
Yes. Tell your mom to just leave it be. I will go and fix it later.

112
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,310
Yes. I understand.

113
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,300
Soo Yeon, you still haven't had breakfast yet, right?

114
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,440
I did eat but I can eat again.

115
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,470
Hey, you. Don't go to Taek's room. Until Saturday this week, going to Taek's room is prohibited.

116
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,440
Yeah, I know. The Fujitsu finals. I'll be going. Ahjussi, I'm going.

117
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,300
Okay.

118
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,190
I will enjoy the food.

119
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,720
Ahjussi, did Taek eat dinner last night?

120
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,870
No. He's not eating breakfast either.

121
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,030
Go and get him.

122
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,710
During competitions I can't bother him either.

123
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,160
I feel like if I were to bother him he would fall down and die.

124
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,840
- Taek!
 - Be quiet!

125
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,020
Not this week. Play somewhere else.

126
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,030
- Why? Does he have a match?
 - Yeah. Fusitju.

127
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,830
Fujitsu.

128
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,850
Hurry and get lost.

129
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,250
Deok Seon, I will really be quiet and play Blue Moon.

130
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,590
I will really be quiet. The Dean is in the house and there are a lot of complications, so please just don't tell me to go home.

131
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,080
Then I will...

132
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,850
No. Never.

133
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,610
I may trust you but I don't trust your mouth. So hurry and get lost.

134
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,660
I'm going. I'm going home. Home...

135
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,040
I'm not going! So disgusting!

136
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,130
I will play Blue Moon with the Dean!

137
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,900
Yeah, come in.

138
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,070
How did you know it was me?

139
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,620
- Dad just calls me and you knock. 
- Ahhh.

140
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,810
Come out. Let's eat breakfast.

141
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,560
It's okay. I will just drink coffee.

142
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,020
Lunch?

143
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,630
Dinner?

144
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,080
Then, our Taekie... do you need to eat breakfast or not?

145
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,980
I need to eat.

146
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,650
Right. Good. Let's go.

147
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,710
If you eat breakfast, I won't bother you for lunch or dinner.

148
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,480
Okay. Thank you.

149
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:54,940
Jeez, anyway, I've never been able to take my kids to see a healthy natural plantation.

150
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,670
What on earth are you doing right now?

151
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,770
I am Han Il Bank's Security Inspection Department's Seong Dong Il.

152
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:15,100
It was useless to do that, and on top of that, how would it look to be buying a silver bracelet (handcuffs) from the country?

153
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,590
Let me just move one time.

154
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:27,350
This person. Where is moving in Baduk? Don't you even feel sorry for Taek?

155
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,610
Baduk is fair. It's been played fair and square from olden times.

156
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:37,260
But then, why is the house so quiet? It's Sunday. Did everyone go somewhere?.

157
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,220
The kids' mother is up front sharing the pollack that she bought yesterday.

158
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,320
Jeong Hwan is studying and not coming out of his room.

159
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:51,010
Ahhh! Then our Jeong Beong is not moving an inch from his desk.

160
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,810
Bo Ra's dad,

161
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,320
my eldest son seems to have come back to his senses.

162
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,990
 Luck will come to the person who receives this letter. 

163
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,290
 It might be hard, but think of it as a good opportunity 

164
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,270
 while praying for seven years of luck. 

165
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,970
 Seong No Eul; Kim Jeong Hwan.

  Yoo Jae Han - A Gloomy Letter

168

 Choi Taek.

171
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,110
Aigoo! So good. This is good.

172
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,770
It's fresh.

173
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,300
No, no, you should eat it.

174
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,000
Why do you bother sharing it with us?

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,510
Aigoo. It's not like this is much. Tonight just cook a refreshing soup.

176
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,010
Okay.

177
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,950
It would be good to have a glass of soju here.

178
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:00,150
  Sounds good.  If two people say it, I get short of breath; if three, I'll have a heart attack! 

179
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,430
Should we have a drink later?

180
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,390
The kids are home so let's have a drink after we send them off to school.

181
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,020
- That's enough. 
- Looks delicious.

182
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,980
But then, the men are quiet.

183
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,570
They're not drinking in broad daylight, aren't they?

184
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,570
Just one glass. Bo Ra's dad, let's have just one glass.

185
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,420
I said let's just drink soju. Soju.

186
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,780
Wild ginseng wine. Let's taste that. If you keep on saving that it becomes poop.

187
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,310
Goddamn. It's not like you're saying that Deok Seon will be going on Janghak Quiz or something.

188
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,600
That wild ginseng wine is the same as my life.

189
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,790
I prepared that to drink on the day that Bo Ra gets married.

190
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,120
Just one glass. Just one sip.

191
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,910
Oh my, look at that.

192
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,480
Aigoo! How is the world turning around?

193
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,620
How could there be a burglar in broad daylight?

194
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,560
 Burglar!!! 

195
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,360
- The thieves are going into ordinary houses. 
 - Burglar!

196
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,480
Burglar!

197
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,680
Burglar!

198
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,560
Where? Where? Where?

199
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,420
Where? Where?

200
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,590
Are you alright?

201
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:30,610
Burglar? Where? Where?

202
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,280
Where is the burglar?

203
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,410
How could this be happening?

204
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,520
Where? Where? Did you catch the burglar, Dad?

205
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,010
It looks like he's gone.

206
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,900
Isn't that the ice boss's voice? What burglar in broad daylight?

207
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,760
Th-Th-There. I saw his back!

208
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,410
Really? He escaped like a squirrel.

209
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,610
That punk! Just wait till I catch him!

210
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,920
- But then, no one is hurt, right?
- Yes.

211
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,290
Who is missing? Who is not here?

212
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,080
Department Head Jo.

213
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,820
Your mom is on a seminar, you punk!

214
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,340
Where is Taek's dad? Where did the two of them go?

215
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,990
Taek is playing Baduk. He's probably not paying attention.

216
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,580
Never mind Taek. Where is his father?

217
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,640
Seon Woo's mom, the water is flowing well now.

218
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,900
Taek's dad, there was a burglar!

219
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,540
Yeah, I know. I heard.

220
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,440
But then, why are you all outside? It's cold out.

221
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,140
That human. Even if he's chased by a wild boar he won't bat an eye.

222
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,630
Isn't he a bear?

223
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,300
Should I try pouring hot water on him to see if he get's startled or not?

224
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,640
Don't. You'll just be wasting water.

225
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,110
That... If you have something that needs to be fixed just tell me, I will fix it.

226
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,620
Mother, we will be going inside.

227
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,750
I'll go in.

228
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,040
Now... He's not a human.

229
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,030
Next time, I will try letting out a dog to scare him.

230
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,670
Even if a human is beaten, shouldn't he be afraid?

231
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,330
These people are disgustingly fast.

232
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,950
It's like wind in the fog.

233
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,070
Jin Joo. Jin Joo.

234
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,110
Go to Oppa Jeong Bong.  It's his time to eat ramyun.

235
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,440
- Ramyun? 
- Yeah.

236
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,220
Seon Woo.

237
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,590
Why?

238
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,470
For real, how is it?

239
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,070
Is what?

240
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:56,120
No... I mean Taek's dad. Do you really have no thoughts of getting together?

241
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,960
- Huh?
 - That's right.

242
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,300
For me, you two...

243
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,160
I wish you would just get together.

244
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,710
These hyungnims, seriously. Why this again? Stop saying nonsense.

245
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,030
What's the nonsense?

246
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:15,550
Now your kids are all grown up. It would be nice to have someone to talk to for the remainder of your life.

247
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,140
That's right. He's not some stranger anyway.

248
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,760
You both went through a lot. Even now, it would be nice to have someone to depend on.

249
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,860
Taek's dad seems to have some feelings for you.

250
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,100
You are seriously crazy.

251
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,260
Anyway, I'm already so cautious thinking what the neighbors might say.

252
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,900
What makes you cautious?

253
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,950
That's right. There are other things to be cautious about.

254
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,930
Aigoo. You don't know. There are things like that.

255
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,200
This is why I didn't visit Taek's dad often, in case you would be like this.

256
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,580
In case there would be a misunderstanding.

257
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,690
Last time, I took care of him because he was sick in the hospital.

258
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,560
Look, look. All this talk comes out.

259
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,800
Hyungnim. We really are not in that kind of relationship, I tell you.

260
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,360
Don't just cut him off right away.

261
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,270
Just give it a thought. Taek's dad is a good person.

262
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,310
Earlier you said that he was a bear.

263
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,460
He is a bear.

264
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,870
But he's a rich bear. And he's good to you.

265
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,490
That's right, Seon Yeong.

266
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,470
Now, Jin Joo would be going to school soon. Won't it be better for you two to raise her rather than on your own.

267
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,600
Aigoo! No thanks. No thank you.

268
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,910
Is there a reason for me to crush Seon Woo's heart?

269
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,120
For me, even just for Seon Woo,

270
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,620
I will never get remarried.

271
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,680
And also, Taek's dad is really a good person.

272
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,210
Even in Gimhae, he was a person who was a good person even in rumors.

273
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,540
This is why I want to take care of him.

274
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,740
If you keep this up, starting from today

275
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,380
I will never lay a step in Taek's house.

276
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,300
Okay.

277
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,270
But it's a bit of a waste.

278
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,410
But, Seon Yeong.

279
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,760
What about your life?

280
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,890
Children are great.

281
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,440
It's not that I'm not in your position

282
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,110
and you might think that I'm just saying nonsense.

283
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,420
Your life is also just once.

284
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,280
That's true.

285
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,640
You also just once

286
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,610
should live happily.

287
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,330
Isn't that so?

288
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,700
It's because your age is such a waste.

289
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,860
You're so young.

290
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,310
To pour it all on your children,

291
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:22,090
your age is so young. Your youth is such a waste.

292
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,440
Aigoo. Never mind, Hyungnim.

293
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,680
My children... Being happy...

294
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,250
Why is the garlic so spicy?

295
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:48,140
Is also me being happy. That's all for me.

296
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,540
That's it.

297
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,240
Seon Yeong.

298
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,800
The bear is here. The bear.

299
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,830
Aigoo. Oppa, you're here.

300
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,150
- You're all here.
 - Yes.

301
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,430
Have some garlic.

302
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,240
Seon Woo's mom, are we going to the hospital together tomorrow, right?

303
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,410
Yes. Yes. Of course, I'll go.

304
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:19,420
It's Taek's dad first treatment since getting discharged from the hospital.

305
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,610
And... he needs to get medicine

306
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:28,790
and get a lot of tests. They say he must bring at least one person with him.

307
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:34,130
That's why as this neighborhood's representative, I was picked to come.

308
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:39,370
Of course, I have to go. Among us three, I'm also the youngest.

309
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,340
And according to age, you are the eldest. Would you want to go then?

310
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,040
I think he won't like it.

311
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,830
Huh? I'm the youngest so I should go.

312
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,630
You don't like Ahjussi?

313
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,110
I like him. He's good, but

314
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,280
I don't like him getting close to my mom.

315
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,200
Hey. In this neighborhood, everyone is close to that extent.

316
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,650
It's not just the two of them.

317
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,920
But I still don't like it.

318
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,680
Don't mind it too much.

319
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,820
It's not like they are going to get married right away.

320
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,080
And, I think it looks good how they depend on each other.

321
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,060
But then, you could not like it.

322
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,110
I understand how you feel. I think I would feel the same if I were you.

323
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,350
Why?

324
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,010
In times like this, you seem like an adult.

325
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,220
Do you want to die?

326
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,900
Now, I'm not scared of that.

327
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,680
Should we see each other tomorrow for a while? I will be in front of your school during dinner time.

328
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,590
You're talking informally again.

329
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,150
Everyone is dropping (honorifics).

330
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,320
Never.

331
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,930
Let's meet at the school's station.

332
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,060
Yes, Noonim (extremely formal form of Noona).

333
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,690
Are you sulky?

334
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,150
Yes.

335
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,470
You sure get sulky a lot.

336
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,110
If your boyfriend gets sulky, other things would

337
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,800
make him feel better. Kissing or some—

338
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,640
Noona!

339
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,480
Bo Ra's mom, you're also going to the hospital tomorrow, right? What time?

340
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,810
Tomorrow, early in the morning.

341
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,380
Why? Are you sick somewhere?

342
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,570
No. The bank that Bo Ra's dad works for gives out a health examination coupon.

343
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,450
Wow. That's a good workplace. They also give those.

344
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,210
It's not that good.

345
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,770
What's so good about giving just a small salary?

346
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,510
It came out when the children's father has worked 25 years there.

347
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,300
He worked to his bones for 25 years but they just gave that.

348
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,370
But it's still a reputable workplace so it's nice.

349
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,340
It's your first time having a health examination, right?

350
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,340
Yes. It's a first.

351
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,510
But then, what if I have cancer?

352
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,970
You're worried about all sorts of things.

353
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,080
I honestly...

354
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,250
Right here, under my right breast, there seems to be something hard that I feel.

355
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,410
- Since when?
- It's been a while.

356
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,270
What if it's cancer?

357
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,360
- You're saying nonsense!
 - Hyungnim!

358
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,790
Your words could be seeds. Don't say that.

359
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:33,300
No... There are a lot of people who could feel a lump in the breasts.

360
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,240
It's just going to be a water wart. Don't worry.

361
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,690
But then...  Are you going to the hospital alone?

362
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,130
The bear next door is going with his girlfriend.

363
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,790
Seriously!

364
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,410
I'm sorry. I just tried saying it.

365
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,440
Just you say that again...

366
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,330
I won't, I won't.

367
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,330
If you're scared of going to the hospital alone, then let's go together.

368
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:02,800
No. Bo Ra's dad got a day off tomorrow.

369
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,260
He knows I have so much fear.

370
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,870
Aigoo. He did well.

371
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:13,040
But still, it's dependable to have a husband during times like this, even though we want to kill them most of the time.

372
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,910
This person...

373
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:33,590
Just go to bed. Getting an examination would be hard on you.

374
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,580
What if...

375
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,280
if something bad...

376
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,770
What bad would be there?

377
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:51,320
You are worrying about worthless things. Don't worry. Hurry and sleep.

378
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,970
Just in case, it comes out bad...

379
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,910
tell me everything.

380
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,740
Don't hide it from me.

381
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,460
Aigoo. I got it. Okay.

382
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,710
That's enough. Go to sleep.

383
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,740
Yes! We understand!

384
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,330
Yes!
- Fold the paper into a square.

385
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,050
Huh?

386
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,880
The electricity went out, right?

387
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,680
Yes, I think so.

388
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,810
Call your dad and ask him to come here.

389
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,550
- Wow!
 - Wow!

390
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,550
As expected, this is why a man is needed in a household.

391
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,400
What? Do you have something else that needs to be fixed?

392
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,910
You just barely changed a fuse.

393
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,040
I could change that in no time too.

394
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,920
It may look easy,

395
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,840
but do you know how many principles are involved in this?

396
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,190
I can fix it because it's me.

397
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,690
Do you have something that's worrying you?

398
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,850
Not me.

399
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,290
Bo Ra's mom is having a health examination today.

400
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,010
It's going to be okay, right honey?

401
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,040
Of course, it's okay. It can't be not okay.

402
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,640
It's going to be okay for sure.

403
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,660
Don't wo-wo-wo-

404
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,800
wo-wo-wo-wo-rry... son!

405
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,660
Dul-dul-dul (sounds when it's cold)

406
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,640
Don't do it?

407
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,280
Do it moderately! Moderately!

408
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,800
Anyway, I don't feel good as it is.

409
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,530
This is good. Dul dul.

410
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,070
Then, you can't be certain?

411
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,570
You would need to do a biopsy to know for sure?

412
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,310
Yes. First, through the x-ray we have detected a suspicious mass.

413
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:45,170
We would need to do the biopsy to be able to check it.

414
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,940
Then, would the test start right away?

415
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,480
Yes. You will have a simple local anesthesia for the biopsy.

416
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,630
- You can be discharged by dinner time. 
 - Yes.

417
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,710
Doctor... I... Could it possibly be cancer?

418
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,450
This person.

419
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,080
What cancer? Why are you saying such nonsense?

420
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,200
It would be normal for a biopsy to be done during a health exam.

421
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,520
Don't worry about a thing and just believe me.

422
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,070
We don't know for sure, as of now.

423
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,780
The biopsy results should come out for us to determine fo it's malignant or benign.

424
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,380
Don't worry too much. First, prepare for the biopsy.

425
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,530
Ms. Lee Il Hwa, please come out. You need to change clothes.

426
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,150
Yes.

427
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,280
Go and prepare.

428
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,880
Doctor...

429
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:57,090
Perhaps... How much probability is there for the results to be bad?

430
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,260
It's probably not cancer, right?

431
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,890
Honestly, the shape (f the mass) is not that good, so I am worried.

432
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,260
It is a worry,

433
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,270
but then we still don't know.

434
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,980
We need the biopsy results to come out to know for sure.

435
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,480
For now, I can't tell you anything.

436
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,760
Okay.

437
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,450
Anyhow, thank you.

438
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,080
I leave her to your care.

439
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,310
 Ssangmun Girls High School 

440
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,030
Oh yeah!

441
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,050
Let's mix them together for the first time in a while.

442
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,890
Yeeaahh.

443
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,570
What about the red pepper paste?

444
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,550
- Hey, isn't that enough?
 - Enough already.That's it!

445
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,460
That looks good.

446
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,550
Without Man Ok, there's a lack of side dishes.

447
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,750
Our Mi Ok, I wonder how bored she must be in her hospital room.

448
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,100
She can't even move.

449
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,840
Should we really not go and visit her?

450
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,910
Man Ok said never to come. She said her dad is really scary.

451
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,420
I saw him for a while on the street.

452
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,770
He really looks scary.

453
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,340
But what does her dad do? You also don't know, right?

454
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,510
It seems like Man Ok doesn't want to talk about it so I didn't ask.

455
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,680
Soo Yeon, perhaps...

456
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,810
Not a gangster... sir?

457
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:01,680
Or a thug. It's probably not it, right?

458
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,960
Is that why she said not to visit her?

459
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,410
Is that so?

460
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,280
Hey! It's probably not it.

461
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,660
Man Ok goes on trips and eats out with her dad all the time.

462
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,200
It's probably not it.

463
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,990
Right?

464
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,820
It's not it.

465
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,680
- But he really looks scary.
 - Really?

466
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,900
Don't move. You'll hurt yourself.

467
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,100
Bear it for just a week.

468
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,520
Dad, hurry and go. It's already 10:30.

469
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,000
You need to open the store.

470
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,310
Hey, Bo Ra. Let's eat dinner together.

471
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,780
I have plans. You two eat together.

472
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,400
Hey.

473
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,740
You got yourself a boyfriend, right?

474
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,400
Hey, Seong Bo Ra!

475
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,320
Seeing you smile, it seems to be true.

476
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,990
You are skilled, Seong Bo Ra!

477
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,820
When did you have time to date?

478
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,130
I know. I also find it fascinating.

479
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,020
Who is it? Sunbae (senior)? A classmate?

480
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,410
You don't need to know.

481
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,350
Who is it?

482
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,670
Noona!

483
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,220
Who is he?

484
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,880
Hello.

485
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,800
Yeah.

486
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,120
Hi there.

487
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,490
- But who are you? 
 - He's a dongsaeng (younger brother).

488
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,520
Dongsaeng?

489
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,630
I know your brother's face though.

490
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,640
He didn't look this young.

491
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,730
Student, what relationship do you have with Bo Ra?

492
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,590
He's a dongsaeng that lives next door.

493
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,460
He's my younger sister, Deok Seon's friend.

494
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,790
Ahh! That's a really nice neighborhood.

495
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,530
A neighborhood noona even treats her dongsaeng to food.

496
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,370
I now know why Dooly (cartoon character) landed on Ssangmundong.

497
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,320
Eat a lot of tasty food.

498
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,180
This punk is handsome.

499
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,800
- I'm going.
 - Yeah.

500
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,730
Tell Noona, "Buy me some parfait."

501
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,420
There's a famous store in Nokdu Street. Bo Ra, we're going!

502
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,870
Yeah.

503
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,490
Eat all of that.

504
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,420
Oh, isn't today the day you go to the hospital?

505
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,700
Yeah. I went.

506
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,100
There's nothing wrong. Everything is good. Don't worry.

507
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,840
You should have gone with me.

508
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,290
I'm all better.

509
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,740
I just got medicine.

510
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,790
They said I should come once every two months.

511
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,420
I'm alright, so

512
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,930
you just concentrate on your thing.

513
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:45,080
I'm sorry, Dad. Your son is just...

514
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,380
You're sorry for all sorts of things.

515
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,640
I'm alright, so...

516
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,640
Taek... That. Eat even just half of it. Hurry.

517
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,100
Yes.

518
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,560
Hey, I'm sorry, so hurry and eat.

519
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,200
The tofu kimchi stew here is really delicious.

520
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,620
Noona, you are a really nice person.

521
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,860
You're even treating a dongsaeng from next door to dinner.

522
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,040
I'm sorry. I'm already apologizing like this.

523
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,070
I was wrong, so hurry and eat.

524
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,630
♬   You catch the smoky rosy light from there and give it to me  ♬

525
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,670
♬   Your white cheeks seem red  ♬

526
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,820
Hey! Look at me.

527
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,820
I'm counting to three. One, two, three.

528
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:24,970
♬    Every happiness in the world is in my heart  ♬

529
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,280
Hurry and eat.

530
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,270
Okay.

531
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,750
♬  Because forever and ever  ♬

532
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,170
- I will eat well, Bo Ra (calling her like same age friends would).
 - What!

533
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,410
- Huh?
 - I ought to!

534
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:45,850
♬  It's always  ♬

535
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,960
I'm back.

536
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,010
I'm back too! Soo Yeon is here!

537
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,470
Mom, I came too.

538
00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:00,210
Oh. You're here. How did the three of you come in together?

539
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,750
Mom, I'm hungry. Give me food.

540
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,670
You haven't eaten yet, right?

541
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:10,430
Dinnertime came early so we ate a while back. Mom, food for me too.

542
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:15,570
Okay. I will prepare food for you. Just wait a bit.

543
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,410
Here. Eat up.

544
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,890
Mom, there's only cold rice?

545
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,790
I was so out of it today...

546
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,130
Ahh... Then I want to eat just ramyun.

547
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:35,500
Why? Eat rice, you can just wet it with the stew.

548
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,290
Mom, just cook ramyun for me too. How could we eat cold rice this late at night?

549
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:43,470
Mom, did you wash my shirt? I was going to wear it tomorrow.

550
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,330
Ahh... That... there was a stain so it's in the washing machine.

551
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,010
If I iron it tomorrow morning, you will be able to wear it.

552
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:54,570
Sheesh! You should please ask me before you washed it!

553
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,510
Goddamn!

554
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,970
What's wrong with the food on this table! You bad kids!

555
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,690
No Eul, you punk! You stuff yourself with cold rice!

556
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,200
Deok Seon, you cook your own ramyun!

557
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,710
Bo Ra, you! You wash your own clothes!

558
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,330
A grown up daughter who's in college still has her laundry done by her mom!

559
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,290
You ungrateful kids!

560
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,210
You bad children!

561
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:37,070
Do you think your mother would be by your side for a thousand, ten thousand years?

562
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,130
Don't you find your mother pitiful?

563
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:44,410
Be nice to her while you still have her please. And please mature a bit.

564
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:50,190
These children. You are not my children but  some alien's children.

565
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,330
Bad children. Stuff yourselves!

566
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,330
Honey!

567
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,170
I guess those two fought again.

568
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,930
Why are they getting mad at us?

Of course, it's nothing serious.

580
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:09,500
Just in case, she's getting a biopsy done.

581
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:17,170
You... There's nothing much so you should not worry about a single thing.

582
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:26,550
Anyhow, since you are the eldest daughter I thought you should know.

583
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,870
This is why I am telling you.

584
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:34,750
So keep this a secret from your siblings and just be the one to know.

585
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,490
Okay.

586
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:48,990
That... Then... These days, perhaps do you have some hard—

587
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,770
I'll go and sleep.

588
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,650
Okay. Sleep early.

598
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,830
That's right, Hyungnim. Don't worry.

599
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,510
That's probably it.

600
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:55,270
My younger sister also had a biopsy on her breast and it was just a water wart so don't worry.

601
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,810
So when will the results be out?

602
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,580
This Saturday.

603
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:04,910
I was so nervous that they said they would tell me the results early and through phone at that.

604
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:12,010
Hyungnims, there's probably nothing wrong, right?

605
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:16,450
Of course not! You're worrying too much.

606
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:23,090
Okay. My mind doesn't go the way I want it to.

607
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,410
Oh my. Why are you coming out from there?

608
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:53,150
I thought she would be locked up all day so I brought her for a cup of coffee.

609
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:57,350
Aigoo. Jeong Bong's mom, thank you so much.

610
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:02,410
This person, lighten up your expression.

611
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:05,450
It's nothing.

612
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:09,150
I am not worried a single bit.

613
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,870
Let's go and eat some carp bread.

614
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:21,270
Aigoo! President Seong!

615
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,750
Aigoo! President Kim!

616
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,890
It is really nice meeting you. Nice meeting you.

617
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,350
You're coming out from there?

618
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:33,890
Ahhh! The light bulb went out so I came to fix it.

619
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:37,870
You hear the sound? The filament went out.

620
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:41,850
I fixed it so the light will come on brightly.

621
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,990
Okay. Okay.

622
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:48,410
As if changing a light bulb is something so great.

623
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:53,470
Our No Eul would be able to change it with his eyes closed.

624
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:57,810
Honey, what happened yesterday was... Bo Ra's dad was—

625
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:02,870
Oh my! What kind of talent do you have!

626
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:06,550
Edison only made that but he probably doesn't know how to change it.

627
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,550
If you look at your physiognomy, you are one with a lot of talents.

628
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:14,890
It's not like anyone could work for Goldstar.

629
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,750
I will be going in first.

630
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,170
- Yes. 
- Hurry and go in.

631
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,910
She's really okay, right? I'm worried too.

632
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,570
Yes... that is...

633
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,470
Oh my! Jeong Bong's mom!

634
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:40,810
Aigoo! It's nothing much so there's nothing to worry about.

635
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,990
While my wife was being examined, I talked to the doctor.

636
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,750
When it's not someone for whom they caught some kind of lump,

637
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:53,450
he said that a lot of people get biopsies done.

638
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:59,810
For me, I'm not worried a single bit, not a single bit.

639
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,830
Yes.

640
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,240
 This is February 25, Saturday news. 

641
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:20,110
 We are a day closer to the finals of the Fujitsu Competition that will be held in Japan, 

642
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:25,100
  which has 15 million yen in prize money. (In our money it is 70 million won). In the global competition 

643
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:30,510
 our country's six-dan Choi Taek, who finished as a runner up in an upset last year, has advanced to the finals. 

644
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:34,310
 Choi 6-dan is leaving the country through Gimpo Airport this afternoon. 

645
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:38,350
 Just as with any competition, he looks calm. 

646
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:43,940
 For the next news. Today the spring break starts for the high schools in Seoul City. 

647
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,710
 Most of the schools have matched the date to March  2 as the opening ceremony. 

648
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,140
Taek hasn't left yet, right?

649
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,960
You're here.

650
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,850
 Starting this year, the lunar new year as the Solnal has been confirmed. 

651
00:50:55,850 --> 00:51:00,840
This... Feed him this before he goes. It would be easier to digest than rice.

652
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,280
This is good. We'll enjoy it.

653
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,290
I'm going.

654
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,110
Okay.

655
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,240
Mom, I'm going to the study room.

656
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,640
Okay.

657
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,020
Spring break starts today so you don't have to iron that.

658
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,690
But I'll just iron it in advance.

659
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,720
Okay.

660
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,090
Oh, right. Taek is going to Japan tomorrow, right? It seems like a big competition.

661
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:27,650
It's called Fujitsu. He was champion twice in it. I'm going.

662
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,970
Okay.

663
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,140
Why isn't this working?

664
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,060
Honey! Honey!

665
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,610
Yes, master. What should I help you with?

666
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,900
This iron doesn't work.

667
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:02,010
The line is cut.

668
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,440
Give it to me. I will fix it.

669
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,110
How will you fix this? Just call someone.

670
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,020
Call someone? Just because of a mere iron?

671
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,300
Give me an hour and I will fix it like a ghost.

672
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,620
I'm worried though.

673
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:33,770
Department Head Lee is here already. He's waiting outside.

674
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:34,670
Yes.

675
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,590
Taek, where did you say the hotel was?

676
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:42,710
Give me the hotel's phone number before you go.

677
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,850
Just a moment.

678
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,370
 Baduk '89 Diary 

679
00:52:56,370 --> 00:53:02,930
 Tokyo Garden Hotel 

680
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,500
Put this back. You might need this later on.

681
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,550
Yes.

682
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,280
Hello.

683
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,750
I parked the car up front.

684
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,830
We'll be late for our flight. Let's go.

685
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,640
I leave him in your care.

686
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,330
Yes.

687
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,870
Department Head, just a moment.

688
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,830
Did you sleep well? That's great.

689
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:57,900
Are you going now?

690
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,160
Yeah. Aren't you cold?

691
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,020
I'm not. But aren't you cold?

692
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,620
Me? A bit.

693
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,980
Aigoo! Close up your zipper.

694
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:16,060
Bring me a present.

695
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,220
What do you want?

696
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,260
You're really buying me one?

697
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,300
Aigoo. As if you would remember.

698
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,350
It's true. I will buy you a present this time.

699
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:30,030
Never mind that. If you get something from the competition, don't toss it and just bring anything.

700
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:34,410
Last time they gave key chains as souvenirs.

701
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,820
You'll be late. Hurry on.

702
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,570
Okay.

703
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,490
I'm going.

704
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,560
You really!

705
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:55,250
Deok Seon. I... It's okay if I lose, right?

706
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,400
I'm going.

707
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:15,990
This person. Wake up and eat this.

708
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,580
It won't go down.

709
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,300
Get up. Come on.

710
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,040
Get up.

711
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:31,070
Right. Not eating breakfast, not eating lunch.

712
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,690
at this rate you might die.

713
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:37,420
Don't be like that and eat the drumstick.

714
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,780
What about the kids' share?

715
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:45,480
You know those kids. They will stuff themselves.  What's with this person worrying?

716
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:51,840
Honey. Why isn't there a call still?

717
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,080
Didn't they say they would call this afternoon?

718
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,110
This person, it's just barely two o'clock.

719
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,530
If they said they'll call in the afternoon then they will.

720
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:05,440
And also, it's not like there's just one or two that they have to call.

721
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,640
There are a lot of people so let's just wait a bit more. Stop worrying.

722
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,080
And also, stay still.

723
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,570
You have nothing wrong going on.

724
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,770
Just believe me.

725
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:28,090
Are you a doctor? You're not even a doctor so what are you doing?

726
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,790
Just based on the atmosphere it seemed that way.

727
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:36,990
You, as the person undergoing it, would be scared.

728
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:40,300
But based on the doctor and the nurse,

729
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:46,500
they don't think that its grave serious at all. There's nothing to worry about.

730
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,120
Hurry and eat.

731
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,490
Here.

732
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:03,410
It's not done yet?

733
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,030
Wait.

734
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:12,040
You cut the cord? Then how can I use this?

735
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,820
You need to cut a bit and connect it.

736
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:21,510
Madame Zebra, don't worry and just watch TV outside.

737
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:28,400
But where did the kids go? I haven't seen them at all.

738
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:45,020
First, receive 400 won as a salary.

739
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:02,170
Hyung, you need to watch the bank properly. It's not easy doing a bang job.

740
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:04,970
What do you think, Hyung? Is it right if you watch while I play?

741
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:10,100
Do Ryong Nyong, do yo know what the start of my long 7 experience is?

742
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,200
 Blue Moon 

743
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,390
It's this.

744
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,330
Ahhh.

745
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,860
But then, I can't really play Blue Moon well.

746
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:27,220
What's the problem? This hyung will teach you perfectly.

747
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,060
Ten!

748
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,390
 Desert Island. 

749
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,290
You landed on the desert island.

750
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,950
You have no chance for the next three days.

751
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,760
Next turn.

752
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,730
Taipei. I'm not so sure about Taipei.

753
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:56,290
If you build a building you would only get 10 won, so would it be worth it to invest.

754
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:57,750
Eleven.

755
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,950
Two, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ...

756
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,240
Seoul!

757
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,940
You can't build a building in Seoul but there's a toll of 2,000,000 won

758
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,570
Golden key! Seong No Eul gets the golden key!

759
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:13,030
You can flip one card now.

760
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:17,610
Hey! You said you don't play well but it's all your land!

761
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:19,780
They say that snails also have a talent for flipping.

762
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,330
Hurry and flip a card!

763
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,440
What is this?

764
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:33,050
Noona, what is space travel?

765
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,030
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

766
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,680
How could a kid who doesn't know get golden card and flip a space travel?

767
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,280
So annoying!

768
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,990
You don't even know that?

769
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,710
We told you that in the start!

770
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:49,520
Soo Yeon, they say its Bul Chi Ha Mun.

771
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:55,380
It means that you should not be embarrassed about asking someone who is no better than yourself.

772
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,410
Are you saying that I am lower than him?

773
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:02,240
999th place or 1000th place are about the same.

774
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:06,310
You're even the last place.

775
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,500
Can you all please keep quiet.

776
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:14,420
Hyungnim Jeong Bong, what card is the space travel card?

777
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,120
It's the best card in Blue Moon.

778
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:26,520
With this card, you can go to anywhere you want to.

779
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,840
What the heck.

780
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,980
It's also my favorite card.

781
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,500
No Eul, where do you want to go? Just say it.

782
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,830
Oh yeah!

783
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,170
Let's go our separate ways here. I need to hurry home.

784
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,460
Is there something wrong at home?

785
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:02,960
No. Just... I have something to study. I'm going.

786
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,280
I'm home.

787
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,470
Yeah. Bo Ra, you're here.

788
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,380
Aigoo. Where are my senses? I need to prepare dinner.

789
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:20,610
No, let's just order in. I want to eat jajjangmyun (black bean noodles).

790
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,250
That's right. Let's order.

791
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,740
Call Deok Seon, Soo Yeon and all.

792
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:32,480
Right. Okay. Let's do that.

793
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,580
Go in.

794
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,360
Stop.

795
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,050
Give it to me.

796
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:22,340
I'm sorry. I'm sorry Mi Ran.

797
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,770
If you can't do it then you should just say so!

798
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,730
How could I use this!

799
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:35,130
We should just have let AS (After Service) do it from the start!

800
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,930
It's really hard. Not anyone could fix it.

801
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:40,690
Because it's me that's why it lasted like that.

802
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,050
How could I use this!

803
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,970
Put the iron down, then we can talk.

804
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,970
Ohhhh!

805
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:52,010
See you all tomorrow. Ahjussi just don't tidy up the Blue Moon.

806
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,090
Okay!

807
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,650
That... Soo Yeon.

808
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,570
Yes. What, Oppa?

809
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,390
You know your friend.

810
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,360
Man Ok?

811
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,370
Oppa, it's going to be a while before she gets out of the hospital.

812
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:15,780
I was wondering if I could visit her. What does she like?

813
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,560
I was thinking of getting a gift. What would be good, Soo Yeon?

814
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,790
She's rich so there's nothing she doesn't have.

815
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:24,340
- But still.
- Let' me see.

816
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,860
- Bouquet of flowers?
- Her hospital room is flooded with them.

817
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,720
- Cake?
- She doesn't like it.

818
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:36,450
What Man Ok wants the most now is... the outside world.

819
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:41,280
She's been locked up in the hospital room for two weeks so she's suffocated to death.

820
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,990
We want to go and visit but her dad is so scary.

821
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:51,980
I will help you once she gets out of the hospital. Trust me.

822
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,590
I'm going.

823
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:13,840
Here. Jin Joo.

824
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,000
Wait just a bit.

825
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,450
Here.

826
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:27,320
Here.

827
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,380
Tada!

828
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:34,740
Aigoo! Here.

829
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,710
Seon Yeong, it's all done.

830
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:45,700
Already? You're so talented, Oppa!

831
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:50,500
Jin Joo! Aigoo! Our Jin Joo.

832
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,120
You can now watch your cartoons.

833
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,920
Good for you Jin Joo!

834
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,400
I'll be going.

835
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,030
Oh! Oh Jin Joo.

836
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,940
Ahjussi needs to go.

837
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:13,390
What do we do? I have to go.

838
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:15,350
Is it fun?

839
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:21,210
Oppa, eat dinner before you go. If you go now, she will cry the whole night.

840
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:25,770
Should I? Okay. I will eat before I go.

841
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:28,380
Jin Joo, open your mouth.

842
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:32,210
Is it delicious?

843
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:38,980
Mom, I'm ho—

844
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,440
Oh! Our Seon Woo is here. Hurry and eat.

845
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,250
Yeah.

846
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,890
- Hello. 
- Yes.

847
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:58,560
It's opened. The video player was broken.

848
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:03,300
Jin Joo wants to watch cartoons but the player is broken so I came to fix it.

849
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,590
She won't get off of me.

850
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:10,350
Jin Joo, do you like Ahjussi that much?

851
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:14,760
Mom, rice.

852
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,100
Yeah, yeah.

853
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,440
That one.

854
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,440
Here.

855
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:33,790
Aigoo.

856
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:41,480
But then, are the results for Il Hwa still not out?

857
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,060
The sun has set already.

858
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,880
I will go to Hyung Jeong Bong's room.

859
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,960
I will meet Joo Yeon up front.

860
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,910
Mom, aren't you eating more?

861
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:06,530
I'm good. I don't really like jajjangmyun.

862
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:14,040
You should eat some more.

863
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,590
I also don't like jajjangmyun that much.

864
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:37,320
Don't worry. I will go to the store tomorrow

865
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,760
and get you the best one.

866
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,240
Who said I'm worried about the iron!

867
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,290
Then what?

868
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,740
Today is the day that Bo Ra's mom's health exam results should come out.

869
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:54,930
There's still no news. She said she would call after the results are out.

870
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,380
Hello.

871
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:22,310
Yes. That's me. I'm Lee Il Hwa.

872
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:25,810
Yes. Yes. Yes. Please go ahead.

873
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:30,050
Are the results out?

874
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:32,720
Is it bad?

875
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:39,340
Ahh... Yes, yes.

876
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:42,030
Yes.

877
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,900
Then, it's nothing, right?

878
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,680
Yes.

879
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,890
Yes. Yes, I understand.

880
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:55,350
Yes, I will do so. Yes. Thank you.

881
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:57,160
Yes.

882
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,180
Jeez. See, I told you it was nothing.

883
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:07,410
It was just a water wart. Once a year in the future ...

884
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:11,480
What was it?  Ah, a follow up. I will go to receive that.

885
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,350
What did I say?

886
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:18,010
I said there is nothing, not a single thing to worry.

887
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:21,770
For me, I said you're worrying needlessly.

888
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:28,020
For real, I was really not worried a single bit.

889
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:33,810
Is that so? I thought that you would be anxious.

890
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:37,260
But still, my husband, Seong Dong Il, you're a man!

891
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:41,170
For real, I was not worried about a single thing from the start.

892
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:44,880
For real, why are you worried over nothing?

893
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,180
Not even a single worry for me.

894
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,200
Okay. Aigoo.

895
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,870
Bo Ra's mom.

896
01:09:55,940 --> 01:10:01,020
Looking at your expression, the results are out. It's just nothing, right?

897
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,050
It's just a water wart.

898
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:09,370
That's a relief. Seeing how anxious you were so I was a bit worried too.

899
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:12,920
Aigoo! Congratulations, Bo Ra's mom.

900
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,350
Yes, thank you.

901
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:18,400
Bo Ra's dad must have had a hard time too. You can now relax.

902
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,910
What hard time?

903
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:26,710
From the start I wasn't worried about a single thing.

904
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,820
Ah! As celebration we should

905
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,660
have a drink.

906
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,180
I ate well.

907
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,690
- Yes.
- Go in. You worked hard.

908
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:41,070
We have rice wine and a box of pollack at home.

909
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,860
Let's eat that.

910
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,380
No, rather than that.

911
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:48,340
Wild ginseng wine, let's have that today.

912
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,620
Wild ginseng wine? There's something like that?

913
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:53,150
Oh my! Jeong Bong's dad sure has a large liver (he's brave).

914
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:58,370
This person treats that as more precious than his life. He will never open that.

915
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:02,530
Anyhow, on a cold day

916
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:07,100
a good warm rice wine would be good.

917
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,540
Bo Ra's mom, do you perhaps know?

918
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:14,330
We'll open that wild ginseng wine! Let's open it up or down! I oughta open you!

919
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:19,520
Let's decide on it. Where should we open it?

920
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,280
So we're having wild ginseng wine, right?

921
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,920
Where do we open it?

922
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,320
- Where do we open it?
 - It doesn't matter, it's wild ginseng wine.

923
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:32,030
Come in.

924
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:40,290
Taek's dad, did you hear?

925
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,470
What?

926
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:44,590
There was a burglar recently.

927
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:48,210
The neighbor said that he had a knife.

928
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,220
Really? Was he not hurt?

929
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,710
He was hurt.

930
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,630
On the arm, he was scratched a little.

931
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:58,430
Something big almost happened.

932
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:03,230
Oppa, aren't you scared?

933
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:04,730
I am scared.

934
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:17,100
Excuse me. A person was stabbed with a knife.

935
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,540
I heard. It's scary.

936
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:29,300
I shouldn't say it.  I won't tell you.

937
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,410
Oh! Airplane!

938
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:33,610
 Breaking news. 

939
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:39,100
 This afternoon a plane left Gimpo Airport carrying 182 passengers 

940
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:43,070
 heading to Tokyo, via Narita Airport, was in an accident. 

941
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:46,910
 At the moment, we are still confirming the list of the Koreans on board. 

942
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:50,930
 There is still no definite report on the number of injuries or deaths. 

943
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:56,660
 According to the news that's just arrived, the competitior in the  Fujitsu competition, Choi Taek 6-dan 

944
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:59,870
 is aboard the plane. 

945
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:05,420
 Though the definite name list has not been given, it would take time to give the certain news. 

946
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:10,510
 As of now, from the reports that we have gathered, it is almost certain that Choi Taek 6-dan is aboard the plane. 

947
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:14,880
Oh my! What do we do! Oh my! What do we do!

948
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,640
A-Ahjussi! Did you get a call from Taek?

949
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:21,940
What time is his flight? You know his hotel, right?

950
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,010
I wrote it down.

951
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:30,150
What should we do? What? Wait.

952
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:41,800
The club! The club! Call the club!

953
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:46,320
Wait! This morning, Taekie placed it on his notebook.

954
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:52,530
Is this wild ginseng wine?

955
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,920
Are you kidding me?

956
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,040
Where is the wild ginseng?

957
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:01,060
It's floating right on the middle.

958
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:07,100
This is a wild ginseng that has been alive for 20 years.

959
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,070
It's really a wild ginseng wine.

960
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:14,810
He slightly pulled some from his branch manager.

961
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,080
 A Korean plane that departed Gimpo Airport 

962
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:24,640
What does that mean?
 destined for Narita, Japan, due to bad weather ...

963
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:31,120
 At present, the list of passenger names  is not out yet, but based on the reports from the airport, Baduk player Choi Taek 6-dan...  

964
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,290
Goddamn!

965
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:38,110
Taek!

966
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:48,850
Now, now, now. Everyone go back.

967
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:51,150
The situation has been handled.

968
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,900
Oh my. What does that mean? Is Taek alright?

969
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,020
Is he able to contact him?

970
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:58,970
Yes, yes. He's okay. He's already in the hotel. His father is talking to him right now.

971
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,150
I thought my heart would fall.

972
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:04,720
- I was so startled.
- I still can't calm down.

973
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,370
Is Taek's dad alright? He must be in shock.

974
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,450
Who? Taek's dad?

975
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:13,700
As I live, I haven't seen someone with such a strong heart.

976
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,030
Go on back.

977
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,380
I heard it's raining a lot there.

978
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:24,080
Okay. Manage your condition well.

979
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,520
Take care of your meals.

980
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:31,250
Are you alright?

981
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:46,490
No matter how I think about it, he's not normal.

982
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:50,340
That's right. I think so too.

983
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:55,680
He's not even human. He's a bear.

984
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:00,950
Don't worry about me, sleep early today.

985
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,050
Just take a little pain killer.

986
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:08,250
Okay. Yeah.

987
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:12,410
 And also in the morning make sure to take an umbrella. 

988
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:14,130
Yes.

989
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:19,100
Yes. Good night.

990
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,330
Yes.

991
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:24,640
Did you go somewhere?

992
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,010
Look at that.

993
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:33,050
 We don't have any detailed information yet. 

994
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:38,460
 According to the news that's just arrived, the competitors who were to compete in the Fujitsu competition tomorrow, 

995
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,920
 the Korean Baduk player, Choi Taek 6-dan, and another Korean ... 

996
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,370
Is that me? 
 were reported to be on board. 

997
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:48,020
Anyway, it's chaotic because of that news.

998
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:54,670
In the lobby downstairs, the media and embassy people are fussing about whether you are okay.

999
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:57,870
A correction will come out in the evening news.

1000
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:01,120
Oh right. Did you talk with your father?

1001
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:05,740
Yes. Just a while ago. My dad was just normal.

1002
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,870
He's a person who doesn't get agitated that much.

1003
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:13,010
Are you kidding now?

1004
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:21,310
No... His child is probably hurt but how could he be so fine?

1005
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:24,560
It seems like Taek takes after his dad.

1006
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,170
A bit of a stone Buddha.

1007
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:30,940
Even if your kid trips over a root, if you're a parent, you get heartsick.

1008
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:34,950
A parent's heart would be torn. That's normal.

1009
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:39,840
No matter how I think about it, I can't understand.

1010
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:44,400
That bear bastard.

1011
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,000
Let's go in.

1012
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,470
Are you kidding me now?

1013
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:51,400
Yes?

1014
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:56,930
You father... it's the first time I heard him so agitated.

1015
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:59,710
I thought he would dig a hole in my ear.

1016
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:07,770
Department Head Lee, a moment.

1017
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,510
Rest up.

1018
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,380
Hello.

1019
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,740
 Choi Taek? 

1020
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,750
Yeah.

1021
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:28,260
 I needed to hear your voice to be at ease. 

1022
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:29,680
Yeah, I'm fine.

1023
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:33,050
 Hey! Why don't you answer your phone! 

1024
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:34,630
When?

1025
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:36,820
When did you call?

1026
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,520
 We kept on calling. 

1027
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:46,560
 Because of you, your dad kept on crying. It wasn't a joke. 

1028
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:52,720
 Taek, even today, I thought your dad was Superman. 

1029
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:57,400
- What do you mean?
 - Where did he find such strength? 

1030
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,390
What do you mean, I said.

1031
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:26,850
 Oh my! 

1032
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,730
  Excuse me. I will do it. 

1033
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:57,140
 That... brown one... right, brown. 

1034
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:01,490
 Seon Woo, my hands are shaking so dial the phone. I can't do anything. 

1035
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:03,520
 Yes. Yes. 

1036
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:43,020
 Choi Taek 

1037
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,310
 He's not answering. 

1038
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,350
 Oppa! Oppa, he'll be fine. 

1039
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:03,860
 Aigoo, what do we do? 

1040
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:21,200
 Hello. 

1041
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,500
 Hello, this is Korea. 

1042
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,490
 Who is this? 

1043
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:28,630
 Is Taek there? This is Choi Taek 6-dan's family. Is Taek in his room? 

1044
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,780
 Taek is showering right now. 

1045
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,560
 Are you sure? You're really sure? 

1046
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,250
 But then, for what reason— 

1047
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:37,420
 Where is Taek right now? Where is he? 

1048
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:41,830
 This is Taek's father, right? 

1049
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:45,330
 Taek... Is he in his hotel room? 

1050
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:48,100
 Huh? Is he in his hotel room? 

1051
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,580
 Is he? 

1052
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,220
 He's really in his hotel room, is that true? 

1053
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:58,040
 Yes, Father. Taek is showering right now. 

1054
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,120
 Yes, I saw him clearly when he went in. 

1055
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,770
 But then what's the matter? 

1056
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:07,890
 He's okay? 

1057
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:16,030
 Hello. That... News came out that Taek was in an accident. 

1058
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:17,550
 Pardon? 

1059
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,260
 Accident? 

1060
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:24,880
 Department Head Lee, there's trouble because of the news. Come out quickly. 

1061
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,740
 Okay. 

1062
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:30,670
 Yes, yes. I understand. 

1063
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:45,300
 Hello. 

1064
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:51,040
 Dad. Did something happen? 

1065
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,600
 I heard it's raining a lot there. 

1066
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,430
 Yes. It is. The weather is not nice. 

1067
01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:00,960
 Right. Manage your condition well. 

1068
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,540
 Take care of your meals. 

1069
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:07,990
 And also, make sure to take an umbrella in the morning. 

1070
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,810
 Okay. 

1071
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,780
 I'm hanging up. 

1072
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:41,940
Good.

1073
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:50,480
You were so calm, Oppa.

1074
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,890
 Taek, be good to your dad. 

1075
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:08,970
 Your dad... It seems like you are his everything. 

1076
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,380
 Sleep well. Hey! 

1077
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:18,690
 It's okay to lose! I'm hanging up. 

1078
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:24,320
♫   All the memories which hurt you, dear    ♫

1079
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:33,590
♫   Bury them deep in your heart    ♫

1080
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:41,540
♫    Let the past be the past   ♫

1081
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:44,990
Let's have a drink!

1082
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:46,930
A drink of soju!

1083
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:53,160
♫    Let's sing to those who have left   ♫

1084
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:57,630
But then, you must have been in shock. Are you alright?

1085
01:24:57,630 --> 01:25:00,310
No. I'm alright.

1086
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:03,780
He's not a human I tell you.

1087
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:07,540
What do you mean? Being agitated won't solve anything.

1088
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:12,910
Wow. Taek's dad, you're really a man. A man.

1089
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:18,460
If it was Bo Ra's dad then he would be bawling and crying and all.

1090
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:24,510
It's just between us men, so what's there to be embarrassed about?

1091
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:28,200
Can't we cry a bit?

1092
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,010
Deok Seon's dad, did you cry?

1093
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:31,900
Did something happen?

1094
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,660
No.

1095
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,570
Goddamn.

1096
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:39,700
Don't even talk about it. The day that Bo Ra's mom had her health examination,

1097
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,880
because she was going to have a biopsy.

1098
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:49,350
On his way after work, he held on to me,  crying and crying, and made a fuss.

1099
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:57,210
 What should I do about my pitiful Il Hwa? 

1100
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:02,840
 She met such a stupid  husband and just suffered. 

1101
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:10,690
 Now she... is having fatal disease on top of that. 

1102
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:13,340
 My Il Hwa is so pitiful. What should I do? 

1103
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:20,600
 My Il Hwa is so pitiful. What should I do! 

1104
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:26,740
 I can't live without my Il Hwa! 

1105
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:29,420
 My Il Hwa! 

1106
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,780
 Il Hwa! 

1107
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:38,030
 No. It's not like a biopsy is a big deal. 

1108
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:42,160
 For real, it's not going to be anything. 

1109
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:47,030
 But still, if ever she has a disease, what should I do? 

1110
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:51,220
 This person, tell me something! 

1111
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:56,540
 Aigoo, Bo Ra's dad. It will be okay. It's not going to be anything. 

1112
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,540
 What is okay? 

1113
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,600
 Are you just saying things because it's another person's story? 

1114
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,280
 It's okay? 

1115
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:08,760
 Just because it's someone else's story! My Il Hwa is so pitiful! 

1116
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:14,820
 I can't live without her! Should I just die with her! 

1117
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,700
 That woman. 

1118
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:23,720
 Well, the doctor was smiling while he was talking about the biopsy. 

1119
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:27,120
 But just in case, Il Hwa! 

1120
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:32,820
 What if she has a fatal disease, how do I raise three kids alone! 

1121
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:37,820
 With what strength? 

1122
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:42,050
 I can just raise them well without her, right? 

1123
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:48,750
 Aigoo! Aigoo! What's the use of children! 

1124
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:54,890
Every one in this food stall was watching. It was no joke.

1125
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:56,930
How manly. Very manly.

1126
01:27:56,930 --> 01:28:03,830
So how manly are you? I heard you cut off all the cord of an iron because you didn't know how to fix it!

1127
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:05,370
Who said that?

1128
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,450
Where do you find a secret in this neighborhood?

1129
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:13,070
You don't even know how to fix it but then you cut off the cord?

1130
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:21,150
Anyway, the only true man in this neighborhood is Boohwandang. 
  (Name of Taek's Jewelry Store) 

1131
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:23,370
Here.

1132
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:34,050
But then, Taek's dad, was your personality originally like that?

1133
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:37,630
There is a saying, Mool ryeong mang dong.

1134
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:41,540
What is that "Mool ryeong" about?

1135
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:47,510
It was Admiral Yi Sun Sin said before the Battle of Okpo in the Japanese invasion to the trembling troops.

1136
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:49,420
Do not move your body easily.

1137
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:55,410
In short a man should be calm and act heavily.

1138
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:01,140
- Oh my! Mouse! 
 -Where?

1139
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:05,150
Making a fuss just because of a single mouse.

1140
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,840
- What are you doing?
 - Over there!

1141
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:14,350
- What to do?  There, there!
 - Oh my!

1142
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:19,490
It's gone. It's gone.  It went there.

1143
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:25,770
It's gone so come here. How could  something so small be worth ...

1144
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:33,340
Aiyoo. It's not because I'm scared.

1145
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:37,840
I have no problem with anything else, just mice.

1146
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:42,640
It's a mouse!

1147
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:47,770
Aigoo! Seriously.

1148
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:52,980
No. I think there's a misunderstanding so I'm saying this to clear it up.

1149
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:57,340
Honestly, it's not that I am scared.

1150
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:01,670
When I was 6 years old, a mouse bit me.

1151
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:05,510
How should I say this? It's some kind of disease.

1152
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:07,200
Were you bitten by a mouse?

1153
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,230
Yes. It was as big as a rabbit.

1154
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:13,160
That... Because I was bit

1155
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,040
I have some trauma

1156
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,240
or something.

1157
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:20,980
When I was in the army, in front of a fence,

1158
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:24,710
This  calf and a wild dog and I just ...

1159
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,040
"Don't move," and I looked up and the dog ...

1160
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:30,070
 When I was young, Superman lived in our house. 

1161
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:39,300
 He was a MacGyver who could fix everything in this world. 

1162
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,670
Thumbs up!

1163
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:53,360
The hair dryer is broken?

1164
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,520
Give it to me, I will fix it.

1165
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:03,700
 Anywhere, when something happened to someone 

1166
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:06,950
 he was like Astroganger who appears to solve things. 

1167
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:09,460
♬  He is old but don't make fun of him.  ♬

1168
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,370
♬   Don't  ridicule  him.  ♬

♬  My dad's youth  ♬

1173
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:29,760
 He was a hero among heroes, in whom you could not find a weakness. 

1174
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:33,310
- Ahjussi, bye!
 - Bye.

1175
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:36,760
Go on.

1176
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:44,670
 But once we outgrew being children, we find out. 

1177
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:51,600
 It's just that it was not caught, but Superman was also a human. 

1178

1183
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:21,210
Mi Ran, Mi Ran. I'm almost done fixing it.

1184
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:25,640
Mi Ran, I can fix it. Just give me a chance.

1185
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,840
I can really fix it.

♬   Bravo Bravo To Dad's  Life ♬

1188
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:49,590
 How many filthy, petty, nauseating, sad, 

1189
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:54,160
 frightening things are there in the world that Dad passes through in life. 

1190
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:01,010
 And now, we realize the reason 

1191
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:04,010
 the filthy, petty, nauseating, sad, 

1192
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:09,270
 frightening, and hard things were overcome strongly 

1193
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:13,690
 was because he had people he needed to take care of. 

1194
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:18,370
 Because he has a family and he had me. 

1195
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:24,240
 It's not just anyone else but he has to live with the name 'Dad'.

 6-dan Choi Take wins 1st place in the  Fujitsu Competition 

1197
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,510
Wow! Taek Hyung is really great! He even won the Fujitsu.

1198
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:51,110
The prize is 70,000,000 won.

1199
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:56,000
Wow! But Noona, what is that?

1200
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,850
I don't know. Taek gave it to me.

1201
01:33:57,850 --> 01:33:59,650
Huh? Where did he get it?

1202
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:02,660
I'm frustrated to death. Isn't he stupid?

1203
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:05,550
Who's calling whom stupid?

1204
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:07,360
Do you want to die?

1205
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:13,280
No, I told him to just bring anything that the competition gives and he brought that. It's so hard bringing that.

1206
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,380
So frustrating. Fool. Dummy.

1207
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:21,850
Soo Yeon, can you lend me that jar. I will make some green onion kimchi.

1208
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:23,430
Okay.

1209
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:31,690
No! No! No! You must be crazy!

1210
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:33,810
Why?

 - He dressed up and went out early in the morning.

1213
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,220
Where?

Excuse me.

1218

Give it to me. I will give it to her for you.

 To the hands of Jang Mi Ok
  From Kim Jeong the hands of Bong

He was standing in front of the room the whole day.

1221
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:22,770
It was so frustrating, so I told him I would give it to you.

1222
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:25,540
I won't tell your dad.

1223

 Brother, happy birthday.

 I have something to say to you, Mom and Dad. 

1232

 For me, I believe in you.

 Noona, there's nothing going on these days, right?

 Why am I so anxious?

 About what? 

1236
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:12,380
 It's okay. Don't worry. Don't cry.

 I'm so sorry.

- Why is it Deok Seon for you? 

1239
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,730
 I just like her. 

1240
01:39:22,730 --> 01:39:27,190
 Why? Why doesn't anyone like me? 

1241
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:32,260
 I must be a woman not deserving of love. 

1242
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,300
 I think it's nothing again this time. 

1243
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:37,610
 Do you like Joeng Pal or Taek? 

1244
01:39:39,290 --> 01:39:41,690
 I have someone I like. 

1245
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:45,500
 I will confess. 

1246
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:46,930
 Soon.
