00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,150
Dad. Can't we move?

3
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,190
Why are you talking about moving, out of the blue?

4
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,820
It's so cold. It feels like I'm going to freeze to death.

5
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,620
Hey, if you're cold, you can wear more layers underneath like your father.

6
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,530
I've been wearing it since November. November!

7
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,800
Look at how cold Bo Ra's hands are. They're like ice!

8
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,720
Bo Ra has always had cold hands and feet.

9
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,450
Your father is sorry...

10
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,710
Just be patient for a little longer

11
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,310
We have almost completely paid off our debt.

12
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,880
I have nothing to say to you. I am sorry.

13
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,640
Anyhow, where did your Mom go since early in the morning?

14
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
She just made this soup. Where did she go?

15
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,500
Let's eat

16
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,340
Where did our mom go?

17
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,460
I don't know. Since this morning, she put a bunch of something on her face and left.

18
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,330
Where did mom go?

19
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,300
I don't know. She didn't say anything to me either.

20
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,050
What are you curious about?

21
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,070
Our three kids are all the same age.

22
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,230
They're going into their final year.

23
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,410
My son studies well, but...

24
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,550
Can he get into Seoul National University?

25
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,010
My son too... Will my son go to Seoul National University as well?

26
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,180
I have a daughter. Can she go to any university in Seoul?

27
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,570
One person ask at a time

28
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,350
Then... I'll go first...

29
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,910
Even though my son studies a lot,

30
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,080
you also need some luck when taking an exam.

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,470
Is there some way he can get into Seoul National University?

32
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,150
He has got 'great luck.'

33
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,050
What?

34
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,330
This year he has a great luck,

35
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,360
your eldest son.

36
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,920
What?

37
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,790
Wow that's amazing. How did she know that you even have  an eldest son?

38
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,530
My eldest son?

39
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,740
Your younger son will be doing good

40
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,190
without you doing anything for him.

41
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,680
Your eldest son is always giving you trouble, isn't he?

42
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,250
What do you mean by 'great luck'?

43
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,170
Do I have to tell you that much?

44
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,480
No... No, it's fine.

45
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,590
But, ma'am,

46
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,780
this year means solar year or lunar year?

47
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,700
Of course it's lunar year.

48
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,570
Then there are not many days left.

49
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,620
It will be soon Lunar New Year.

50
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,590
There's only one week left.

51
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,930
Oh my god... What if Jeong Bong wins the lottery again?

52
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,140
Couldn't that be it?

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,730
What is it?

54
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,780
Why?

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,260
Three days from now, the exam result will be announced.

56
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,450
Congratulations!

57
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,550
Your worries are finally over! Congrats!

58
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,130
Yeah!

59
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,880
Is there something important?

60
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,340
That is great luck. It's that.

61
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,370
If you guys are going to gossip, go to a coffee shop!

62
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,320
Next.

63
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,520
What about my son? Can my son go to Seoul National University?

64
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,090
Besides that...

65
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,970
there will be something better to celebrate for you.

66
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,770
What?

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,380
Me? To me? What is it?

68
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,280
What?

69
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,510
Don't laugh.

70
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,850
You never know a person's fate.

71
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,190
Also, lately, hasn't my face gotten pretty?

72
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,790
No, you haven't gotten prettier.

73
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,020
Next.

74
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,300
I have a daughter and my daughter's studies...

75
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,010
Can't study at all.

76
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,400
- Yes, yes... 
 - She's so on point!

77
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,420
She is not a good student at all. I don't even desire a university in Seoul for her.

78
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,220
I just hope she could get into any university.

79
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,060
Can my Deok Seon get into any college?

80
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,670
Change it.

81
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,960
Change what?

82
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,600
Her name is the problem. Her name is Deok Seon?

83
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,470
Yes, my kind Seong Deok Seon.

84
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,270
Her name is the problem. Because of her name,

85
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,880
she doesn't study at all.

86
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,500
Change her name.

87
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,970
And from now on, till she gets into college, don't call her Deok Seon.

88
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,570
Don't even say it.

89
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,240
Every time you call her Deok Seon, the level of the college

90
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,990
will lower by one rank. Do you understand?

91
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,730
Yes, we will never call her Deok Seon—

92
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,700
I won't call her that, but ma'am,

93
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,640
what should I change our child's name to?

94
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,230
 Soo Yeon! 

95
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,670
 Soo Yeon! 

96
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,370
Soo Yeon, what are you doing, not getting changed?

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,140
Mom, who's Soo Yeon? Is someone coming over?

98
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,850
From today, you are Soo Yeon.

99
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,150
Why is she Soo Yeon?

100
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,040
We need to call Deok Seon, Soo Yeon in order for her to get into college.

101
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,680
Nonsense!

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,450
Don't any of you ever call Deok Seon, Deok Seon. Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon...

103
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,530
Every time you call her Deok Seon, the rank of the college she'll go to lowers by one... Soo Yeon, you understand?

104
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,130
Can it even get any lower?

105
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,570
Bull... What a load of nonsense.

106
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,360
Why do we need to change her name?

107
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,290
What's wrong with the name Deok Seon? Deok Seon's a fine name.

108
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,740
Soo Yeon ,Soo Yeon.

109
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,940
What are you doing, crazy?

110
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,800
Right after you say Deok Seon, you have to say Soo Yeon.

111
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,690
We have to say like this to eliminate bad luck.

112
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,950
How else would it be for it to be like that?

113
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,450
I like it

114
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,700
What use is it if only we call her Soo Yeon?

115
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,390
Everyone else in the neighborhood will call her Deok Seon anyway.

116
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,630
Soo Yeon.

117
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,050
I already told everyone in the neighborhood to call her Soo Yeon.

118
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,970
Good job! Good job!

119
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,790
Can that be possible right away?

120
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,200
You're the problem, Honey! All you have to do is never call her Deok Seon.  Soo Yeon. Got it?

121
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,950
I'll call my daughter by whatever name I want!

122
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,490
Duk Seon is a great name! Deok Seon, Deok Seon, Deok Seon! Your name is Deok Seon, Deok Seon!

123
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,560
Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon! Your name is Soo Yeon, Soo Yeon.

124
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,600
Soo Yeon, eat a lot!

125
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,980
Small Noona, you better start studying hard now.

126
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,140
Why do you keep pushing the table? Just talk to me if you have any problem with me.

127
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,460
What are you talking about? I'm not moving anything.

128
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,200
Dad, if you sit there, the table always moves right to your stomach.

129
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,510
What nonsense are you saying?

130
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,980
You keep pushing it towards me.

131
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,490
I said I didn't move it!

132
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,990
Or is the room crooked or the ground slanted?

133
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,020
What a bunch of nonsense you're talking about.

134
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,660
Maybe that is the case.

135
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,400
What?

136
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,410
Then watch!

137
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,900
Watch. If I drop the orange, it'll stay still. And if the ground is crooked, it'll go over there. Look!

138
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,190
Look, the orange moved!

139
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,520
What? Thats so weird.

140
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,820
Look. If I drop it, it'll stay right there.

141
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,020
All of the floors...

142
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,640
Dad. Where are we going to sleep?

143
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,950
Where? Of course we have to sleep in our landlord's house.

144
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,750
Ugh, that's so uncomfortable.

145
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,020
It's so nice. Their house is a hundred times better than ours.

146
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,030
Bo Ra and Deok Seon—

147
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,570
Soo Yeon.

148
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,840
It'll be a little uncomfortable, but just bear with it.

149
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,740
They said it will be done before Lunar New Year's Day.

150
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,300
It's not even a little uncomfortable Dad.

151
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,730
I love that house.

152
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,350
 Episode 11: Three Prophesies 

153
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,890
 Don't Sleep Study Room 

154
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,220
 Should I go on the blind date? I said should I go? 

155
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,460
 Don't go on the blind date 

156
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,080
I got rejected.

157
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,940
Why did you get rejected?

158
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,590
By any chance did you confess?

159
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,200
Are you crazy? You are crazy.

160
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,470
Hey, don't you know for us, after you confess it's over?!

161
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,600
Her liver is all bloated!  (That is, she was over-confident.) 

162
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,770
What were you thinking by confessing?

163
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,230
We just have to be part of a one-sided love.

164
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,220
If you confess, you'll get rejected right away.

165
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,140
What's wrong with you? Were you born yesterday?

166
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,810
But still, I did it in case.

167
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,210
God...

168
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,930
Oh that's right...

169
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,210
Deok Seon...

170
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,050
Soo Yeonie.

171
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,610
Oh, Soo Yeon, what happened with him?

172
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,700
Did you ask him?

173
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,890
He told her not to go on the blind date.

174
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,910
Told you! This time I was totally sure.

175
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,370
But still, you can't be the first to confess.

176
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,660
Wait until he confesses.

177
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,760
Crying made me hungry. Let's go to Brazil (Restaurant).

178
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,960
Okay. You guys go ahead. I have to go home.

179
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,450
What happened? You were always crazy about Dukbokki.

180
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,220
 I like Deok Seon. 

181
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,940
 Not as a friend, But as a woman, I like her .

182
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,970
 Jung Hwan! Come out to eat dinner! 

183
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,720
Okay.

184
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,600
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

185
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,230
This fork?

186
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,900
Hyung!

187
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,750
Come over here! Here, here.

188
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,860
What are you doing? Is it not done yet?

189
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,270
It's finished! Just wait a little bit!

190
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,770
What are we doing for dinner tonight? What is our mom doing?

191
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,100
Because we're all eating together, she made some western dish.

192
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,150
What western dish?

193
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,410
Hamburger steak.

194
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,190
Hyung, since I've been born, I've only seen pictures of hamburger steak.

195
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,900
It's my first time eating it!

196
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,680
Mi Ran, give us food now. We're so hungry.

197
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,830
 OKAY! 

198
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,890
Is this hamburger steak?

199
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,110
It looks similar to pork cutlet.

200
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,570
There's nothing special about hamburger steak.

201
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,680
Where is Bo Ra's dad? Isn't it about time for him to come home?

202
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,140
He's working late tonight. Hyungnim, is there anything I can help with?

203
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,960
Just pour the soup first.

204
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,650
Okay the soup?

205
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,370
Hello?

206
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,270
Oh, Seon Woo, you're here?

207
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,460
What about your mom?

208
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,790
She went to get Ahjussi Gil Dong. They'll be here soon.

209
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,700
Have seat.

210
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,610
Hello

211
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,980
You're here?

212
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,820
Mi Ran! Did you go to the US to get these steaks—

213
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,950
Be careful.

214
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,070
Here. Let's drink the soup first.

215
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,620
It's hot. Be careful.

216
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,120
Mom, what is this?

217
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,230
Is it pumpkin porridge?

218
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,680
She serves it often, true,  but it is a delicious soup.

219
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,100
We can take a bath here for two nights and three days.

220
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,810
Mi Ran! What about the steak?! Quickly bring—

221
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,620
Steak!

222
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,380
I put some effort.

223
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,680
This is different from what I've seen at the restaurants.

224
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,490
Why is there kimchi on the side?

225
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,580
It was so greasy then.

226
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,190
So, to make it special, I did fusion style tonight. Go ahead and eat.

227
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,750
We'll eat well!

228
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,280
It's really good, Mom

229
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,330
Tasting this steak and radish kimchee together,

230
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,610
it is as if eastern and western cultures mingle together.

231
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,710
It is like I can taste the culture of Hellenism.

232
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,880
Is it not Hellenism?

233
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,410
It's right.

234
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,580
But what about Deok Seon? Is Deok Seon not coming?

235
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,240
- Soo Yeon. Soo Yeon. 
 - Soo Yeon.

236
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,700
She went to the library.

237
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,490
She said she'd be back for dinner though.

238
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,680
We've arrived!

239
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,120
Hello!

240
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,740
Oh,   "we"  arrived?

241
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,400
Looks nice.

242
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,780
Oh, this is too small. Let's have the adults eat at the table. Honey, get up

243
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay.

244
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,810
What about Taek? You should have brought Taek.

245
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,260
The day after tomorrow, there'll be a final match.

246
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,550
So he's been studying. He hasn't left his room at all.

247
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,060
Ah... Master Games...

248
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,110
Taek is in possession of the title?

249
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,820
Yeah, but...

250
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,660
The opponent of the final is his master,

251
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,110
so he is feels a lot of pressure.

252
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,990
Why did you make galbi so flat?

253
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,130
Aigoo. This is not galbi.

254
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,650
It's skate.

255
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,860
Steak.

256
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,470
Oh... Skake?

257
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,390
Steak.

258
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,800
Hamburger skake!

259
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,100
This is something that people from western countries eat.

260
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,190
And what is this?

261
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,210
Who poured so much guk (Korean soup) here?

262
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,510
Seon Yeong, can you get me some water?

263
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:47,010
But, we should bring some to Taek. He hasn't eaten yet.

264
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,640
I'm here.

265
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,780
Oh, Deok Seon, you're here?

266
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,500
Soo Yeon! Soo Yeon.

267
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,970
Soo Yeon, you're here?

268
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,740
Mom! I want ribs too!

269
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,970
Soo Yeon, can you bring this to Taek?

270
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,530
Oh... Taek isn't here?

271
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,620
He has a final match the day after tomorrow, so he stays in his room all day.

272
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,850
Even if he doesn't eat the ribs, tell him to at least eat the soup.

273
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,550
Okay.

274
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,200
Hey, eat it before it gets cold.

275
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,230
Okay.

276
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,180
If it gets cold, it won't taste good.

277
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,020
Deok Seon.

278
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,940
Soo Yeon.

279
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,280
Who's Soo Yeon?

280
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,180
Me. I'm Soo Yeon. Call me Soo Yeon from now on

281
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,570
so I can go to college.

282
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,140
Are you laughing at me now?

283
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,210
No. Are you crazy?

284
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,010
Hey watch yourself. I'm letting you off a lot lately.

285
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,400
Alright.

286
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,540
But Deok Seon...

287
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,630
Soo Yeon, you idiot!

288
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,300
Oh, Soo Yeon. Can you get me coffee?

289
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,340
Like before, half-and-half with milk.

290
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,410
Okay.

291
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,440
Just do what you were doing.

292
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,170
Just do what you were doing.

293
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,770
Soo Yeon!

294
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,700
Water.

295
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,650
Soo Yeon.

296
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,570
I heard that Taek receives lots of letters from his fans?

297
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,940
You can choose a good girl among his fans for your daughter-in-law.

298
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,570
Taek would show that he likes someone?

299
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,470
He wouldn't show that.

300
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,110
He would not say anything.

301
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,820
Taek shows it too.

302
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,000
How does he show it?

303
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,740
Seon Yeong, pepper.

304
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,470
Alright

305
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,980
Look at Taek's personality.

306
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,080
He's not the type to kiss a**, right?

307
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,170
No. Never.

308
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,710
He took after  me so he doesn't have any charm.

309
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,400
Seon Yeong, can you give me a tissue?

310
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,170
Okay.

311
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:17,240
How does Taek act? When he likes someone, how does he act?

312
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,170
He's clingy.

313
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,730
When he's with someone he likes, he's very clingy.

314
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,140
He asks her to do this and do that a lot.

315
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,940
But to people he is close, he rather has good manners.

316
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,140
Seon Yeong, give me a smaller bowl.

317
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,980
Stop ordering Seon Yeong around.

318
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,130
Me?

319
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,570
Seon Yeong, forget about the small bowl.

320
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,670
Warm water.

321
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,110
I was just letting it go!

322
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,200
Hey! You go get it!

323
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,700
I gave you a break because you were working hard.

324
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,940
Am I your servant? Are you the boss?

325
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,390
It hurts! It hurts!!

326
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,940
There is a tea kettle right there! Do it yourself!

327
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,890
Okay. It really hurt.

328
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,430
Hey...

329
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,070
The cord...

330
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,760
Oh...

331
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,150
Okay, just give it to me.

332
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,860
It's okay. I can do it.

333
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,600
Nose bleed.

334
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,530
Well...

335
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,860
Deok Seon...

336
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,140
Soo Yeon.

337
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,370
Oh, Soo Yeon.

338
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,510
Sleep a little.

339
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,980
I'm going to keep working.

340
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,520
Why isn't my sister coming back?

341
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,480
She left a while ago.

342
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,340
She must be eating with Taek then.

343
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,600
Those two are on the same level.

344
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,660
Noona, let's meet at the alley in ten minutes.

345
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,750
Aren't you going to back up?

346
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,200
What are you two doing?

347
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,790
I don't know what it is, but can you count me in?

348
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,710
Let's do it together!

349
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,380
Me too!

350
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,540
It's not anything! I just had to ask her something.

351
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,310
When did you say you will know the result of your exam?

352
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,650
You're so mean.

353
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,110
Hyung, I'll get going. No Eul, I have to go to the Study Room.

354
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,650
I'll see you later.

355
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,260
Mom, I'm going to the study room!

356
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,160
Jin Joo, your brother left, right?

357
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,480
Right?

358
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,830
Honey, I'll do some delivery.

359
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,760
This late at night?

360
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,660
One item I forgot to deliver. I'll be back soon.

361
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,150
Jeong Bong's father is really diligent.

362
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,620
He is only diligent with his store, not in this room.

363
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,320
I shouldn't have brought it up.

364
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,930
Oh yeah, have they come yet?

365
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,440
You mean the passports?

366
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,600
Let me see them.

367
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,160
Oh, it came out so well.

368
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,400
You're so lucky! You can go overseas now.

369
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,730
It's Japan. So close. There is no time difference.

370
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,480
When do you leave?

371
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,980
New Year's Eve.  In three days.

372
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,630
I can't believe I'll spend the Lunar New Year in Tokyo.

373
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,810
What about your children? They will be with your mom?

374
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,410
I told them to stay in the hometown.

375
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,190
Why isn't Seon Yeong coming? We need to deal cards.

376
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,470
Sungnim!

377
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,990
Can you guys watch Jin Joo for a little bit?

378
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,860
Where are you doing? We have to play Go Stop.

379
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,660
Starting today, I'm cleaning for the bath house.

380
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,480
What?

381
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,740
After the bath house closes, I work from 8:30 pm until 10 pm.

382
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,900
I need to earn even a penny.

383
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,530
If Seon Woo finds out he'll get mad.

384
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,660
How would Seon Woo find out?

385
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,260
He goes to the study room these days.

386
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,630
He comes home to eat dinner for a short while and leaves. He comes back home late at night.

387
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,880
He takes after his father so he watches the clock..

388
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,990
He never comes back before 1 am.

389
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,480
But why work all of a sudden? Do you need money? I can lend you some.

390
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,340
No. I have a healthy body. Why do I need to borrow money?

391
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,290
I am not doing this because I need money now.

392
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:09,770
To send Seon Woo to a college next year, I need to save money.

393
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,740
Besides, cleaning the bath house is easy.

394
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,810
You don't need any skill to do that.

395
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,420
Jin Joo won't look for you?

396
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,810
Don't worry!

397
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,820
If I use this, then it's all good.

398
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,890
Oh!

399
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,960
She's automatic.

400
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,990
I think she'll get caught.

401
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,710
Anyway what should we do? It is not fun for just us to play Go Stop.

402
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,970
What worry? There is one person that has lots of free time because of school vacation.

403
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,200
Noona!

404
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,130
Why are you coming so late? You're fifteen minutes late.

405
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,120
Are you advertising that we're dating?

406
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,720
Who'll see us? There's nobody around.

407
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,440
Hey, how can you eat that this late at night?

408
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,750
Oh, Seon Woo!

409
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,980
What are you two doing?

410
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,610
I had something to ask her.

411
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,500
At this time? You two?

412
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,190
Talk about what? You could just do it from your house.

413
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,140
Oh, it's not much.

414
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,000
I was curious about something I was studying, so

415
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,470
on the way back, I saw Noona and...

416
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,410
Hey! Aren't you going to back off?

417
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,300
What do you care what we were doing?

418
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,090
Don't meddle into adult's business and get out of here.

419
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,230
Okay...

420
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,430
Excuse me, Bo Ra...

421
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,180
Do you have any coins?

422
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,170
Thanks.

423
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,880
There's definitely something.

424
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,700
Jeong Bong, do you think those two are acting strange—

425
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,280
Ugh! Lost again!

426
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,430
It's okay. If you eat more, you'll surely draw '1 more'.

427
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,950
Why are you frustrated because of that?

428
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,150
How many did you eat?

429
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,600
Two boxes.

430
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:59,140
I never win anything. I've never gotten "One free bag."

431
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,790
- Jeong Bong. 
 - Yeah?

432
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,000
Watch Jin Joo for a bit.

433
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,560
Okay. Are you going somewhere?

434
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,300
To earn money.

435
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:19,200
Will we see your skill today, Dean of Students?

436
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,550
Sungnim, cut it.

437
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,780
No need between close neighbors.

438
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,230
I heard that you play well.

439
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,550
No ...

440
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,420
I tried to play with other teachers a few time during night shifts at school.

441
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,870
I am really a rookie.

442
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,830
Then, shall we earn some money off the dean of students at Ssangmun High School?

443
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,360
Right.

444
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,440
Should we do that?

445
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,540
Now, line up.

446
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,250
Aigoo, it's done.

447
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,750
Aiyoo... 12...

448
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,210
What is 'Joo So Ya Dae'?

449
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,340
Aigoo, Hyungnim.

450
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,140
We're playing Go-Stop with a person who doesn't know what 'Joo So Ya Dae' means.

451
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,760
I feel so sorry for him.

452
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,350
That's how you learn.

453
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,760
I'll just turn any card then.

454
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,770
Aigoo, Bi!

455
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,420
Then I will...

456
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,480
Oh I lost... I lost what to do?

457
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,990
Deal! Deal! Deal the cards!

458
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,880
Hey senior student. Go in and study.

459
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
You should become a great person.

460
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,120
I don't need to go to the study room today.

461
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,960
I just got out of my house.

462
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,720
Noona, do you want to go see a movie?

463
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,220
I don't want to.

464
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,740
I'm busy. I have a lot to study

465
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,880
It is school vacation. Why are you busy?

466
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,870
I have something to prepare. You don't need to know.

467
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,780
Then when will we go on a date?

468
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,350
We just did a little while ago!

469
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,650
I'm cold. I'm going to go.

470
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,580
Are you crazy? Do you want to die?

471
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,280
To hold your hand, I have to have a death wish?

472
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,910
Yeah. If you want to die, then do it. Got it?

473
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,820
I'm leaving.

474
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,170
I'll go to the front of your house later. See you then!

475
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,950
I'm going to be sleeping. See you tomorrow.

476
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,510
I'm cold... Seon Woo, give me your blanket.

477
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,220
Aish!

478
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,150
Thanks.

479
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,580
♫  That is love, love, that is love   ♫

480
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,620
♫   I didn't know love as a child   ♫

481
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,330
♫   As times goes by, I learned about love   ♫

482
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,510
♫  That is love, love, that is love   ♫

483
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,360
♫  Someone who's never been in love even though it's commonplace   ♫

484
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,920
♫  Someone who's been in love one too many times   ♫

485
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,490
♫  That is love, love, that is love   ♫

486
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,610
♫  Everyone has cried over love at least once   ♫

487
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,430
♫  Everyone has smiled over love at least once   ♫

Oppa?

00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,300
  Mr. Jeong Bong, Oppa Jeong Bong ...   

494
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,490
Ahew, really.

One card each and one Go!

501
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,920
Godori! Two Go's. Three Go's.

502
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,740
Hwangbak and pibak... Wow!

503
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,670

507
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:01,530
What? Did you play with the teacher Ryoo?

508
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,650
He's not even a human. You should not go up against him.

509
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,850
You need to pay attention when you play with him.

510
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,030
What're you saying?

511
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,270
How much did you lose?

512
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,530
120 won.

513
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,660
Seriously...

514
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,740
Don't worry. Today—

515
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,300
I will earn ten times what you lost.

516
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,820
You should hold him in the evening. Wait for me.

517
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,890
Manager Seong is the one who can beat Teacher Ryoo.

518
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,920
Me too.  I will close the store early and come home early.

519
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,520
Anyway there is no customer because it is right before Lunar New Year.

520
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,740
When will Jeong Bong's exam result for second round schools come out?

521
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,150
This time... He should get in a college.

522
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,460
Will it be difficult?

523
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,190
Tomorrow.

524
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,410
I hope he should make it this time.

525
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,700
It is difficult for us, too.

526
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,720
it will be difficult for him, too.

527
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,100
He didn't express it,  but he's having a hard time.

528
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,840
It'll be difficult even for colleges in rural areas.

529
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,440
Yes, hello?

530
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:27,310
Seon Woo? I will put Jeong Hwan on. Wait a second.

531
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,250
I will take a shower.

532
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,250
Hey. Lower your eyes!

533
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,600
Why again?

534
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,620
Okay. I got it.

535
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,000
Go in a little later.

536
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,110
It is steamy. You won't see anything.

537
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,550
It's okay.

538
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,430
No Eul. Have you taken a bath there?

539
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,610
Noona. It's old-fashioned. It's not a bath.

540
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,280
It's a shower.

541
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,740
It was so warm and nice. It's not cold at all.

542
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,780
Isn't it right? You don't have to wear shoes.

543
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,300
I want to live in this house forever

544
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,760
with Hyung Jeong Bong.

545
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,810
Wait. Oppa Jeong Bong. Did you get the exam result?

546
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,820
Is it tomorrow?

547
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,540
You're so mean. Really.

548
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,040
What?

549
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,030
Let's not do this between us.

550
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,760
Soo Yeon. Give me any clothes that need to be washed. We can run the wash machine.

551
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,890
No Eul. You too.

552
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,220
I don't have any.

553
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,910
I don't either. I washed them while I was taking a bath.

554
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,460
Don't buy stuff because of Lunar New Year. I won't open the door for you. Got it?

555
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,370
I got it.

556
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,130
You should buy something when you come home, please.

557
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,050
I often buy things these days.

558
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,520
Do you want me to buy one steamed bun? You like it.

559
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,280
Buy one package! Package!

560
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,020
Okay. I will buy one package of steamed buns.

561
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,840
Don't yell. All the flower pots will fall.

562
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,030
Anyhow, you two come home early.

563
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,540
Okay. I will be back before the bank closes.

564
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,620
I will close the store early too and come home early.

565
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,630
Ah, really!

566
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,530
Honey. I'm home.

567
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,470
I bought a package of steamed buns.

568
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,520
The flower pot...

569
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,380
Jin Joo. Your earrings aren't heavy?

570
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,820
What do you want to be in the future?

571
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,000
Magic Princess, Minki!

572
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,190
Minki?

573
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,230
If you finish your rice, I'll buy you a magic band.

574
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,760
Really?

575
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,380
Seon Woo. Aren't you late for the study room?

576
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,840
It's already 8 pm.

577
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Mom. I'll get going.

578
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,320
Jin Joo. Oppa is leaving.

579
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,460
Okay. Study hard!

580
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,100
Yes.

581
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,310
Jin Joo. Don't eat. Let's go.

582
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,610
Jeong Bong. Take care of her.

583
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,460
Mother. Earn a lot of money.

584
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,030
It'll be hard for him in February.

585
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,340
There are lots of matches in winter.

586
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,650
You don't know about that and call yourself a friend?

587
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:12,320
Tomorrow's match is the most difficult. He said he'd spend the night at the baduk center.

588
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,470
Jeong Pal?

589
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,690
Didn't Dean of Students come out of your house yet? Look.

590
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,830
Why're you so late? You're five minute late.

591
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:05,100
I am the only one who takes her boyfriend to the study room.

592
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,430
Because we don't have time to go on a date.

593
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,090
Did you eat dinner late?

594
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,030
We just see each other for a short while after dinner.

595
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,400
Then, we can have dinner together.

596
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,490
I don't have to eat at home.

597
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,400
I need to eat dinner at home.

598
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,760
Why?

599
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,760
Otherwise, Mom and Jin Joo eat alone.

600
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,140
I want to eat together even during school breaks.

601
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,660
You're nice.

602
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,950
I like you because you're nice.

603
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,900
Is it all?

604
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,200
Yes. That's the only reason.

605
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,270
I have many.

606
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,130
What?

607
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,450
The reasons why I like you.

608
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,910
That's okay.Be quiet.  I don't want to hear it.

609
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,740
Don't say anything.

610
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,980
Noona, the previous glasses are more pretty.

611
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,980
The round ones,

612
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,640
they are much more pretty.

613
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,240
It is my face. I can do whatever I want.

614
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,400
Don't boss me around.

615
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,070
And you always wear only pants.

616
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,440
Hurry up!

617
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,990
You guys will go?

618
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,450
I don't go to a male singer's concert.

619
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,200
What about you, Jeong Hwan?

620
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,720
He will go because he is a fan of Lee  Moon Sae.

621
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,390
You'll go?

622
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,920
I can't.

623
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,680
Taek will go?

624
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,490
Taek has a tight schedule in February.

625
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,050
Why? What happened?

626
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:48,190
He won't go because of the match.

627
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,560
If Deok Seong goes, he will go too.

628
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,680
No, no.

629
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,000
Baduk is more important than a woman to him.

630
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,920
Can you really not go?

631
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,590
No, I can't.

632
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,170
I will go to the bathroom.

633
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,540
Then who else?

634
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,260
Seon Woo. Go with him. He likes songs.

635
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,100
He likes Lee Sun Hee, but he likes Lee Moon Sae, too.

636
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,410
It will be difficult for people of our age not to like Lee Moon Sae.

637
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,510
Shut your mouth.

638
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,760
Okay.

639
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,290
Do you want a steamed bun?

640
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:46,160
No, thanks.

641
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,780
You don't play Go Stop?

642
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,630
I don't know how to play.

643
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,860
And there are only professional players there.

644
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,230
The stakes are high.

645
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,090
Really?

646
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:11,170
Right.

647
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,180
5, 6, 7 points.

648
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,360
You, 14 points.

649
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,560
Cheetah, pi bak 28 points.

650
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,870
Cheetah, 280 won. Seong Dong Il, 140 won.

651
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,550
Thank you.

652
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,330
He plays so well.

653
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,330
How much?

654
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:26,570
280 won.

655
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,660
He is too strong.

656
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,240
Geez, the winner in the beginning usually ends up losing.

657
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,460
Anyway Teacher, deal me good cards.

658
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,050
Okay.

659
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,150
Well, let's run.

660
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,860
What?

661
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,780
They play Go Stop with my dad?

662
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,530
Yeah, they played last night, too.

663
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,140
Why? They can't?

664
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,850
There will be a big fight tonight.

665
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:03,180
I'm so ashamed to live.

666
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,710
Do you know what my dad's nick name was when he was single?

667
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:32,540
It's telling me to take it easy this round.

668
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,650
This is not bad.

669
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,820
What are you doing right now?

670
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,660
Let's not play tricks here.

671
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,520
Put them back to their original place.

672
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,530
They're mine.

673
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,420
They're mine?

674
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:01,120
They were out here for a long time.

675
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,270
How come a teacher can deceive people like this?

676
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:08,240
If you do it one more time, I'll break your finger.

677
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:13,050
Let's do properly. I won't get fooled from now on.

678
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,960
Nam Po Dong's Swindler.

679
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,740
He conned so many times when he played Go Stop. So his nick name was Swindler.

680
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,010
How embarrassing!

681
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,580
He can't beat my dad though?

682
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,930
You know where my dad works?

683
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:39,900
Han Il Bank.

684
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,530
Do you know what he does there?

685
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,010
2 points more.

686
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:58,490
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 points.

687
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,730
Oh man.

688
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:15,150
Do you want to die? Next time it'll be the back of your hand.

689
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,980
He works in the Audit Department.

690
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,990
What do you do at the Audit Department?

691
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,690
He investigates corruption.

692
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,620
It is the place where people investigate employees' embezzelment and fraud.

693
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:45,430
4 points, 7, 8, and 9 points.

694
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,530
Pibak, 18 points. 180 won.

695
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,620
Swindler Teacher.

696
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,930
Pibak 36 points. Give me 360 won.

697
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,620
Please give a good whipping  to your students.

698
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,740
My husband is doing a good job.

699
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,520
I will rake all the money here

700
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,290
and I will buy you a mink coat.

701
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,880
Three.

702
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,760
Chok.

703
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,770
5 Hwang.

704
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,650
Cho-dan (red ribbon)

705
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,100
Hong- dan.

706
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,240
Chung-dan (blue ribbon)

707
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:36,750
Godori (5 birds)

708
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,210
Do you think my mom is doing nothing when your dad plays Go Stop?

709
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,060
Our mom is Ra Mi Ran.

710
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,150
It is a big accident.  A train wreck.  Beep Beep Beep

711
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,910
Come on!

712
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:15,000
Oh, my, my, my... I got three again. Three.

713
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:20,230
Mrs. Chee-tah. at Gwangbak. At Pibak. Oh my.

714
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:23,600
I'll go drink a glass of water.

715
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,990
What are you doing?

716
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:29,230
Don't move.

717
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,220
Don't move and come back right away.

718
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,640
How can't I move and come back?

719
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,180
If you call 'Go', it'll be 5 'Go's'?

720
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:40,930
What is this? Tatatatata.

721
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,690
Hey, you... Anyhow...

722
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:47,640
You got to go to a hospital a lot this winter.

723
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,840
Why to a hospital?

724
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,250
You need to receive treatment when you sweat so much and get a skin problem from wearing a mink coat.

725
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:57,590
Heat rash is no problem. I'm about to wear a mink coat.

726
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,050
I like it.

727
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:06,780
She can't play Go Stop very well. But her brain is ...

728
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,290
What is her IQ?

729
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:16,860
It's not her IQ, but her petty tricks.

730
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,670
Jin Joo, you should be careful.

731
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,670
Jin Joo, let's have a bonus.

732
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,350
Jin Joo, you are not very lucky either.

733
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:37,680
Jin Joo. Do you want to play with me?

734
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:49,080
Jin Joo is here.

735
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,490
Hello Jin Joo.

736
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:55,610
The player should come quickly. Why did you come late?

737
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,200
At this point in time, I want to shout again.

738
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,300
Well, Five Go's!!

739
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,280
Wow, seriously! My, my, seriously!

740
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,320
I'll have a heart attack.

741
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,250
I am going to earn a big fortune this round.

742
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,010
At this point in time,

743
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,780
one more time I want to shout!

744
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,580
Five Go's!!!

745
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,310
I'll be getting a mink coat!

746
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,260
Oh, no, no...

747
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:13,010
Oh my God, Jin Joo!!

748
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,610
- Aigoo! 
- Aigoo!

749
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:19,050
This game is invalid. Invalid. What to do!

750
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,610
Aigoo...

751
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,480
♫   Magic Princess Minki  ♫

752
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,190
Invalid.

753
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,730
 Jin Joo!! 

754
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,970
 Minki! 

755
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:53,820
 Minki! 

756
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,080
Oh man. I'm late.

757
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,380
Good Morning!

758
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,900
You're late a bit.

759
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,020
Yes.

760
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,580
Well. Teacher.

761
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,610
It's not over 'til it's over.

762
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:11,550
Yes?

763
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,840
Tonight we should do a second round.

764
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,510
Tonight I will go to Busan.

765
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:24,080
It's Lunar New Year. Happy Lunar New Year!

766
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,230
Happy and Lunar New Year!

767
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:33,970
♫ Dreams and hopes that disappeared into space

768
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:38,590
♫ What will happen today

769
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:50,080
  In accordance with the government's decision to liberalize overseas travel,  

770
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,920
 regardless of age, from this year, anyone can have a tourist passport issued... 

771
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,700
 Travel abroad has no limit. 

772
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,690
 So, the number of people who obtain passports and travel abroad will reach a record high. 

773
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:05,870
You will leave tomorrow?

774
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,620
Yes. I am jealous.

775
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:14,210
When can I fly on an airplane?

776
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:16,440
Why are you jealous? You have two daughters.

777
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,820
You will fly many times in the future.

778
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,850
Now people can have their passports issued quickly.

779
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,160
Before it was complex. You should have a saving's account that amounts to 2 million won.

780
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,470
Now it is simple.

781
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:32,230
You just need an application, certificate of residence, and ID clearance. Then you get one right away,

782
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,010
a three year passport.

783
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:37,460
Three year... Wow so long.

784
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,440
It got improved a lot.

785
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:44,650
What's the point of getting improved?

786
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:45,890
We don't have money.

787
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:51,690
I am envious of you the most. You have nothing to worry about.

788
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:55,490
Why not? I have one.

789
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,410
Ahew...

790
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:58,580
Jeong Bong...

791
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,710
He will get the result at 2 pm today.

792
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,960
I have nothing to be envious as long as Jeong Bong passes the exam.

793
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,420
He will pass. Don't worry.

794
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,490
She told us that he has great luck.

795
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,060
He'll definitely pass.

796
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,420
I should trust the fortuneteller.

797
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,800
That way, Soo Yeon will go to a college.

798
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,000
What about Seon Yeong? Will she have an 'accident'?

799
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,740
Why is it an 'accident'? It is something to celebrate.

800
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:40,220
Then to do so, she has to meet a guy and make an 'accident.'

801
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,000
When does she meet a guy? She has no time..

802
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,100
It takes only a  second to make eye contact with a guy.

803
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,860
Aigoo...

804
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,570
Where did you meet Jeong Bong's dad?

805
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:59,460
Oh right. You met him at Go Hwan.

806
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,760
Yes, right. We met at Go Hwan.

807
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:13,950
Do you want me to share my story?

808
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,210
Do you like this kind of music?

809
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:20,480
You look different.

810
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,660
Only Vivaldi.

811
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,110
That's right. Even when we were so poor and had a hard time, you were different.

812
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,180
You looked so intelligent,

813
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:39,320
so we were wondering why she came all the way to Ssangmun-dong.

814
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,310
It was because of love.

815
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,840
I was working in the investment industry.

816
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:53,000
I probably was the best in that field in Go Hwan.

817
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,640
I was the best one. I was a good employee.

818
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,420
And then I met Jeong Bong's father.

819
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,290
I liked him more that he did.

820
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:06,110
Oh my God.

821
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:08,950
Back then, he was pretty good-looking.

822
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:10,610
Well, he is still handsome.

823
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:13,620
No, he is messed up now.

824
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,990
I went on an errand to a terminal.

825
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:19,820
There stood a soldier.

826
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:23,530
I thought he was Buddha.

827
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:27,310
He was glowing.

828
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,290
Jeong Hwan!

829
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:45,770
Will you really not go to the concert?

830
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,990
Lee Moon Sae's concert?

831
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,410
I have plans with my friends.

832
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:53,800
What plans?

833
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,610
I will go to Seoul Land with friends.

834
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,530
Friends? Who?

835
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,510
There are. You wouldn't know even if I told you.

836
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,190
Is there any friend that I don't know.

837
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,410
I have.

838
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,460
I'm sorry. Let's go together next time.

839
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,510
I will change.

840
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,600
Okay.

841
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,340
It's time.

842
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,860
Hello. You work hard.

843
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:03,460
Law Department. His ID number is...

844
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:07,200
863757.

845
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,130
- Wait a second please.  
- Yes.

846
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,140
 Hello? 

847
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,380
 I'm sorry. He failed. 

848
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,270
The result came out?

849
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,230
What was the result?

850
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:44,970
Where are you going?

851
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,380
I will go meet the fortune teller to complain.

852
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,580
That's enough. No use.

853
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,550
Great Luck?

854
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:57,160
My a** Great Luck. It is Great Failure!!

855
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,550
I won't stand this.

856
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,620
Be patient, Sungnym.

857
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:03,130
What's the point complaining to her? It's no use crying over spilt milk.

858
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:04,870
I mean...

859
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:08,190
If she had said he'd fail, I would have not had high hopes.

860
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,650
She made fools of us!

861
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,910
I won't leave her alone.

862
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:13,860
Honey. Don't go.

863
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,800
Let go of me.

864
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,430
Honey. Wait.

865
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,160
Let go of me!!

866
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,720
- Let go! Let go! 
 - Aigoo.

867
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,000
Honey.

868
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,640
It must be like a house of mourning right now.

869
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,030
I knew it from the moment that fortune teller told me those strange things.

870
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,790
Yes, I am going to eat lunch now.

871
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:38,580
Seon Woo went to the study room. It's about time for him to be home.

872
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:42,650
Then, Jeong Hwan, Bo Ra, Soo Yeon...

873
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:47,890
No it is Deok Seon, and No Eul. Send them all over here.

874
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,740
How can they eat anything in that house?

875
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:54,690
I will make Kimchee fried rice.

876
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:57,270
Yes.

877
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,710
Geez...

878
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:08,630
I thought I was going to change my fortune at this old age.

879
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:15,510
I will make really delicious Kimchee fried rice.

880
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,620
Jeong Hwan. Where did he go?

881
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,880
Jeong Hwan went on an errand for his mom.

882
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,760
He said he'd go to a travel agency.

883
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,550
Bo Ra? Where is she?

884
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:30,740
I don't know.

885
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,600
She left right after breakfast.

886
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,550
I asked her where she was going and got beaten up.

887
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:39,190
Oh man. She is beating you?

888
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:42,020
- I thought she only does to Deok Seon— 
 - I am Soo Yeon.

889
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:44,830
You are now Deok Seon again.

890
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,070
Yes?

891
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:48,480
There is something like that.

892
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,230
I thought she was beating Deok Seon only. She's really rough.

893
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:57,400
I'm worried about who will take her.

894
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,670
When is Noona Bo Ra coming back?

895
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:01,950
I don't know.

896
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:04,960
You have to risk your life if you want to ask that kind of question.

897
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,600
Poor No Eul!!

898
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,920
No Eul, do you want to live in my house?

899
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,690
I like any place as long as it is not my house.

900
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,510
Right.

901
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,500
Wake up. Jeong Bong is hungry.

902
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,590
You should at least give food to him.

903
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,120
What good is he?

904
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,210
Again, again, again!

905
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:43,020
You want too much.

906
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:46,110
We naturally  didn't expect him to pass.

907
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:50,240
You just listened to the fortune-teller and vented your anger on her.

908
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:59,030
My Mi Ran is so pretty. My wife is the best.

909
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,650
Forget it!

910
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,240
Jeong Bong, let's eat lunch.

911
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:11,450
Bong, it's okay.

912
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,410
We have already decided to try the entrance exam next year, the seventh time.

913
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:17,420
You shouldn't get discouraged.

914
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,440
Don't make me feel bad.

915
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,750
Get up and eat. I'm hungry.

916
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,740
Bong!

917
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:31,410
I'll get going first. Come right away.

918
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:15,910
Wait, where's Jeong Hwan?

919
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:18,790
I sent him to the travel agency because we needed to pay the balance.

920
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:21,870
You haven't paid the balance yet? We'll be leaving tomorrow.

921
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:25,170
It was until today. It's fine.

922
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,450
Finish eating and go to the public bath.

923
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:30,810
Bath? I don't want to.

924
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:34,300
You don't want to wash when you travel overseas?

925
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,390
Go with Jeong Bong.

926
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,340
I'm fine.

927
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:40,920
Go!!

928
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,530
Yes.

929
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,290
  Don't Fall Asleep Study Room 

930
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,550
Where did she go all day long?

931
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,350
Hajimae Mashitae!

932
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:08,080
Dojo Yoroshigoo. Omaegashimas!

933
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,200
Wow. Can you speak Japanese?

934
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,530
No. I just memorized a few phrases.

935
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,240
You are too valuable to just stay at home.

936
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:23,800
If you had worked, you could've lived in a place much larger than this house.

937
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,720
No way. This house is more than enough too.

938
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,330
From tomorrow it will be the Lunar New Year holidays. Won't you go down to your hometown?

939
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,960
This time we booked train tickets.

940
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,900
Tomorrow morning, we will take a train.

941
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:38,780
Anyway, I don't have a mother-in-law. We'll just visit her grave.

942
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,650
What about you? Did you finish packing?

943
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,700
You'll depart tomorrow morning?

944
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,810
I finished packing.

945
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:46,300
One month ago.

946
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:52,150
- Hello? 
 -  Yes. It's me. 

947
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:54,980
Yes Jeong Hwan. Did you pay the balance to the travel agency?

948
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,770
 Yes. But Mom, bring your passport. 

949
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,570
Huh? Passport?

950
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:01,690
Wait a second.

951
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:06,290
Why the passport?

952
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,840
 They said they had to put your English name again because they changed the hotel. 

953
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:12,690
 Spell your English name. 

954
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,800
English name...

955
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,360
Let's see...

956
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,070
 Hurry up. People are waiting behind. 

957
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:24,630
Jeong Hwan. Can you call me a little later?

958
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,340
Soup is boiling in the kitchen.

959
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,120
 Mom? 

960
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:33,030
What happened, Sungnym? Did something happen to Jeong Hwan?

961
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:35,050
The hotel is changed.

962
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:38,350
Let me check the soup in the kitchen.

963
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:41,520
Did you pack everything?

964
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:45,520
Your mom did one month ago.

965
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,540
Would it be alright even though you don't speak any Japanese?

966
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,320
People say that Korean people should be careful not to be ripped off when they go overseas.

967
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,920
Is your mom a person who could be ripped off?

968
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,910
Don't worry.

969
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:01,720
And your mom speaks a little Japanese.

970
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,270
Wow.

971
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:07,350
Aigoo, fine...

972
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,780
Hello.

973
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,040
Jeong Hwan. Your mom? Wait.

974
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,840
Sungnim. It's Jeong Hwan.

975
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,830
Yes.

976
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:25,880
 Mom, give me the name quickly. 

977
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,940
 Why did you hang up? 

978
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,680
 You have your passport with you? 

979
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:36,990
Where was the passport?

980
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:39,510
The passport?

981
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:45,410
 Mom? I said people are waiting here. Just give me the English spelling of your name. 

982
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,640
Jeong Hwan. Water, water. Water is boiling right now.

983
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,220
- Let's talk again. 
  - Mom, Mo— 

984
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,740
Sungnim, I'm going to be in front of the Dooley Supermarket. I'll be back.

985
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,690
Okay.

986
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:07,270
Father. Which university did Mom go to?

987
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:14,060
I heard that she used to work at a bank. Which university did she come from?

988
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,580
Hello?

989
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,640
 Mom?! Ah, seriously!! 

990
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,640
  Are you training your son like a dog or what? 

991
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,220
 I told you to give me your English name. Why're you so busy? 

992
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,430
 Look at the passport. 

993
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:46,080
Yes.

994
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,910
 You're holding the passport in your hand, now, right? 

995
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:53,870
Yes.

996
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:56,040
 On the first page where your photo is... 

997
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,660
 There is your English name next to the photo. Spell the name quickly. 

998
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,130
Say there Jeong Hwan!

999
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:07,060
 Yes. Hurry up! 

1000
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:13,710
Well, Jeong Hwan... Mom doesn't know English.

1001
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:20,200
Mom doesn't know how to read English.

1002
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:24,110
I am sorry, Son.

1003
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:37,690
♫   Don't worry about anything   ♫

1004
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:43,550
Your mom didn't go to a college. What are you talking about the bank? 
♫   Let's sing a song together  ♫

1005
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:46,680
She said that she used to work in the investment industry.

1006
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,120
She was a day lender.

1007
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:54,480
Your mom was the biggest day lender in Go Hwan since age fifteen.

1008
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,210
She was smart.

1009
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,620
Later she used to work for a Japanese person.

1010
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:09,530
She sold dollars and Yens because she was smart. 
 ♫  Let the past be the past  ♫

1011
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:13,120
♫  That's what it means.  ♫

1012
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,410
Your mom only finished elementary school, like me.

1013
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:22,610
What about only finishing elementary school? We have had no problem living a life.

1014
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:27,500
From your dad's perspective, your mom is the smartest person in the world.

1015
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:34,560
You don't need to go to a college and get a PhD.

1016
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,350
Why do you need a paper like that living a life?

1017
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:43,090
You don't commit a sin against other people and you earn your living. That's all you need.

1018
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:48,650
Jeong Bong, you too!

1019
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:52,620
Dad is fine even though you don't go to a college.

1020
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:57,430
Look at your mom! She is living so well without a college degree?

1021
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,990
Jeong Bong!

1022
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:11,900
Dad wants you not to resemble me, but your mom.

1023
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,360
Isn't your mom really an incredible person?

1024
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:20,780
♫   Let's sing a song together to those who have left.   ♫

1025
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,750
Let's go. Chee-tah is waiting.

1026
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,930
Yes.

1027
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:28,320
♫  Tell them that you loved them without regrets  ♫

1028
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,410
♫  Tell them that you will dream a new dream  ♫

1029
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:38,580
How about walking like this. 
 ♫  Tell them that you will dream a new dream  ♫

1030
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,170
Like this. Like this.

1031
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,590
Honey. Mi Ran! We're home.

1032
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:49,580
Why're you so late? Did you two eat something?

1033
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,670
No, we didn't.

1034
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:54,680
Why don't you remove the bean on your mouth?

1035
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,490
She's a ghost.

1036
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:59,970
Your mom's really a ghost.

1037
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:07,190
Seon Yeong. Here is the bowl.

1038
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:11,950
I told you I'd pick it up.

1039
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:14,530
That's fine. It's good if I can exercise.

1040
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:18,560
What exercise? We're only ten steps away.

1041
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,090
Seon Woo?

1042
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:22,100
He ate dinner and went to the study room.

1043
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,260
He'll be back after 1 am.

1044
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,550
Jin Joo? Say hello to Ajuhssi.

1045
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:34,910
She is probably scared of me.

1046
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:39,010
Oppa doesn't have a cute face.

1047
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:41,050
Oppa, you won't go to the countryside  this Lunar New Year either?

1048
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:43,510
Your mom is overseas, isn't she?

1049
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:47,330
Yes. This time I decided to go big and be filial.

1050
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:50,900
Do you have to go to work today, too?

1051
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:55,420
Of course. I have to earn some money because from tomorrow it will be the holidays.

1052
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,360
Will you leave Jin Joo to your neighbor in front of your house?

1053
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,960
Yes. She's playing well.

1054
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,740
Why? Do you want to take care of her?

1055
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:06,320
No way. You're aware that I cannot take care of children.

1056
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:10,700
Even though I have nobody to ask to take care of her, I wouldn't ask to you.

1057
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:14,890
Oppa, you might fall from a brain hemorrhage again.

1058
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:46,090
Did you call the travel agency?

1059
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:47,700
Yes.

1060
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,400
Here...

1061
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,550
I bought them as they were selling them right around the corner.

1062
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,080
There is no dinner tonight.

1063
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,880
Why?

1064
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,890
Because we'll be eating out.  Out.

1065
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:41,620
Yes! Eating out! Eating out!

1066
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,010
Nice!!

1067
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:50,800
Jin Joo!

1068
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:55,030
Eating out, eating out!

1069
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:56,790
Dad, we're eating out.

1070
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:58,140
Where are we going?

1071
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,440
- Eating out, Eating out! 
 - Where are we going?

1072
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,000
Where are we going?

1073
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,520
- Eating out, eating out! 
 - Do you like it that much?

1074
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:10,530
Who always does this?

1075
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:13,740
There must be a dog in our neighborhood.

1076
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:21,380
Who did this here again?

1077
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:31,930
Oh my God. Where did everyone go?

1078
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,740
How did—

1079
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:48,720
Oppa! Save my life just once.

1080
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,100
I don't know.

1081
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:03,530
Seon Yeong.

1082
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:07,450
We had a good dinner.

1083
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:12,730
Going back home...

1084
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,850
Call me when 'Saturday Movie' is on TV.

1085
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,460
Yes.

1086
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,030
Jeong Hwan!

1087
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:07,210
Get out of your room. Sleep in your older brother's room today.

1088
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:11,180
How can we have girls sleep outside, Bo Ra and Deok Seon?

1089
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:13,130
Soo Yeon.

1090
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:15,190
What? Wasn't it over?

1091
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:20,680
I wanted to trust the fortuneteller until the end.

1092
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:24,340
Somebody said that it's not over 'til it's over.

1093
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:29,610
Anyway, Bo Ra and Soo Yeon sleep in Jeong Hwan's room.

1094
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,420
Oh Yes!

1095
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,820
Wow. Bed!

1096
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:50,720
So good!

1097
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:58,260
It's pretty clean, huh?

1098
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,530
Good night!

1099
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:05,340
Kim Jeong Hwan?

1100
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,010
Good night!

1101
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:16,160
You two got pretty close.

1102
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,440
We have been  close for a long long time..

1103
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,590
Where did you go earlier today?

1104
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:22,550
Mind your own business.

1105
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,510
Not interested.

1106
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:28,660
Do you notice anything that changed about me?

1107
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,660
You have become much uglier.

1108
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:36,750
Ah, really?

1109
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,600
I said you look uglier because you do. Why?

1110
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,770
Do you really not notice anything looks different?

1111
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:45,550
Please!

1112
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:48,940
This is not your house. Don't ever fight again!

1113
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,370
I will strip you off and kick you out of here, okay?

1114
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,150
Okay.

1115
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:00,940
Here.

1116
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:10,750
Have a good trip to Japan.

1117
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,030
In regards to that,

1118
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:16,120
- cheers! 
 - Cheers!

1119
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:21,860
I'm jealous of you.

1120
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:25,780
You live in a place like a palace and you travel to Japan.

1121
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:31,080
Which one of you are lucky to live like this? I'm jealous.

1122
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,470
If only Jeong Bong had passed the exam.

1123
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:36,850
That's enough.

1124
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:41,180
Yes, Sungnim, He can take another exam next year.

1125
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:43,760
It'd be his seventh attempt.

1126
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,600
If he had entered a university seven years ago, he would've already graduated by now.

1127
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:51,090
If he had joined the military he would already be a sergeant.

1128
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:53,920
We should've not seen the fortuneteller.

1129
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,910
If she hadn't mentioned 'Great Luck', we wouldn't have anticipated anything.

1130
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:01,340
Did she say that Jeong Bong had 'Great Luck'?

1131
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,050
Yes. She said that he had great luck this year.

1132
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:07,380
That's why we thought he'd surely pass the exam this time.

1133
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:11,200
Who knows? He might have great luck in other things.

1134
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,250
- Other things? 
 - Yes.

1135
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,660
What would it be?

1136
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:19,740
How would I know? I am not a fortuneteller.

1137
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,050
What else will take more luck than this?

1138
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:02,880
Oh Yes!!

1139
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:14,310
She told Deok Seon to change her name, and Jeong Bong has great luck.

1140
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:18,620
Then, what about Seon Woo's mom? What did she say about her?

1141
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:22,390
I cannot say because I'm embarrassed.

1142
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,960
There is something like that. You don't need to know.

1143
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,360
Oh man. I am so curious.

1144
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:32,490
Who knows? She might have said that she'd meet a good guy and marry.

1145
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:35,300
That's enough.

1146
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:39,530
Oh, right. Jin Joo? What about Jin Joo?

1147
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:45,770
I forgot about that. Where did Seon Woo's mom leave Jin Joo?

1148
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:01,770
Oppa, I'm a little late.

1149
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:06,850
Oppa?

1150
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:17,920
You're back.

1151
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:24,230
- Oppa, are you okay? 
 -  I think I'm going to die.

1152
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,920
Is she really your daughter?

1153
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,910
She's so bright.

1154
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:46,900
Aw, my Jin Joo!

1155
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,640
What is this in your hair?

1156
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:52,170
Be careful, it hurts.

1157
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:54,130
Okay.

1158
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:59,970
♫   Watching those expressionless years    ♫

1159
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:04,600
♫   You were wavering    ♫

1160
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:11,250
♫   I wasn't able to give you anything    ♫

1161
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:17,870
♫   I hated myself    ♫

1162
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:23,480
♫    I hated myself   ♫

1163
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:37,660
♫    Walking down the unlit street   ♫

1164

♫   Walking down the unlit street    ♫

1165
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:46,860
♫    To you who is wandering around   ♫

1166
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:54,470
♫   I want to give you a flower    ♫

1167
01:26:54,470 --> 01:27:00,630
♫   A sunflower on an open field    ♫

1168
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:07,680
♫   Why do the birds fly?    ♫

1169

Jung Hwan...

01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:35,820
Yeah?

1181
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,780
Let's go to the concert

1182
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,160
Let's go together.

1183
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,590
You'll go, right?

1184
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:03,740
Hmm?

1185
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:05,680
Yeah.

1186
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:10,030
I'll go.

1187
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:29,050
♫   Stay only next to me  ♫

♫   You cannot leave me  ♫

♫   and going on a long journey    ♫

1191

♫   You cannot find your rainbow    ♫

1192
01:30:54,790 --> 01:31:00,640
♫   As I sit by the window    ♫

1193
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:09,130
♫   As I see the clouds floating from far away    ♫

1194

♫   The thoughts that I want to find    ♫

♫   The thoughts that I want to find    ♫

1196
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:19,250
♫   I draw them on the sky    ♫

1197
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:22,590
Where did you go all day today?

1198
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:25,870
I just had something. You don't have to know.

1199
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:30,640
♫   In the cold blowing wind    ♫

♫   If you get lonely    ♫

1201
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:37,040
Did you wait for me?

1202
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:41,510
Who else would I wait for this late at night?

1203
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:44,190
Seriously.

1204
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:46,370
Dating a high schooler is hard.

1205
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:53,830
♫    I will not leave you   ♫

1206
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,360
You changed your glasses.

1207
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:12,150
It's pretty.

1208
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:28,610
Noona.

1209
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:38,490
Can I kiss you?

1210
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:15,120
♫   Every day with you   ♫

1211

♫   I want to be in your arms at night   ♫

1220

♫   Everyday with you   ♫

1221
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:11,750
♫   I want to fall asleep.   ♫

1222
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,990
Go right away. Grandma is waiting for you.

1223
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:25,410
Yes. Don't worry and have a good trip.

1224
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,780
We will get going.

1225
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:28,450
Yes.

1226
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,790
Ahjussi, let's go to Gimpo Airport.

1227
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:54,680
I'm not sure they will be okay.

1228
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:58,070
Don't worry. Whose children are they?

1229
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,190
Whose children are they?

1230
01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:01,920
Your children, aren't they?

1231
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,990
They've grown up. Don't worry.

1232
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:08,430
What do you mean grown up? They're still far from it.

1233
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:12,020
Did you bring the passports?

1234
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:14,320
Oh my. Passports.

1235
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:20,700
Here they are!

1236
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,470
Let me see your photo.

1237
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:27,050
No need. It is Miss Korea's photo.

1238
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:30,020
What is this? Did you write this?

1239
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:31,210
What?

1240
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:34,890
This? Did you do it?

1241
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:46,380
(English pronunciation written in Hangul)

1242
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:13,190
Jeong Hwan wrote it. I can see it right away.

1243
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:16,220
Oh really?

1244
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:19,970
Wow, our Jeong Hwan also knows how to do those things.

1245
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:25,250
I wanted to ask them quietly, but I didn't because it was embarrassing.

1246
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:29,100
Our Jeong Hwan even knows to do these things.

1247
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:33,490
They're grown up.

1248
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,160
They're grown up. They are.

1249
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:48,320
My child has grown up.

1250
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:56,440
Your mom already left. We didn't even say good bye to them.

1251
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,330
We're late for the train. Let's hurry.

1252
01:36:58,330 --> 01:36:59,950
We will go.

1253
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:02,430
See you again after Lunar New Year.

1254
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:04,190
Okay.

1255
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:06,110
Take care!

1256
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:10,470
Hurry!

1257
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,270
Good morning!

1258
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:16,470
Aigoo. You're going now?

1259
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:18,710
- The buses are probably full. 
 - We purchased the train tickets.

1260
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:20,290
Keep watch of our street.

1261
01:37:20,290 --> 01:37:23,240
Have a good trip!

1262
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:29,670
Oppa! Jeong Bong Oppa. Wait!

1263
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,760
Oppa. This!

1264
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:39,890
I almost forgot. My friend, Man Ok asked me to give it to you.

1265
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:44,260
Do you know her right? I heard you met in the intersection.

1266
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:48,910
All sorts of things are happening.

1267
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:54,210
Oppa, you got so lucky this year. A love letter for Kim Jeong Bong,  wouldn't you say?

1268
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,930
I'll really get going.

1269
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:12,360
Brother, this year is not over yet?

1270
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,630
What? What're you talking about?

1271
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:15,680
There's just something.

1272
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:41,830
Aigoo. Since it's' Lunar New Year everyone went to their hometowns.

1273
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:45,690
The street is so empty. Wow it's so cold.

1274
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:00,510
There are lots of foods here, Jin Joo.

1275
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:03,370
Seon Woo, call him one more time. Ask him to come quickly.

1276
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:06,440
I'm here.

1277
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,070
You don't need to call.

1278
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:11,520
- Good morning. 
 - Seon Woo. Long time no see!

1279
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,700
Why didn't you come earlier? The food is getting cold.

1280
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,010
It it  rice cake soup?

1281
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:17,110
Today is Lunar New Year's Day. You know that, right?

1282
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,480
I know.

1283
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,570
- Where is Taek? 
 - He'll come soon.

1284
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:21,670
I'll go bring him.

1285
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:24,670
No, eat. Eat.  He'll come.

1286
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:28,960
When he plays Baduk, he becomes absent-minded.

1287
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,810
Right. Bring him here.

1288
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:39,890
You went see a fortuneteller? What did she say?

1289
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:43,630
Don't mention about it.

1290
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:45,610
Sungnims passed out because of that.

1291
01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:50,010
Really? Why? What did she say?

1292
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:54,300
I'll tell you because you're Oppa.

1293
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:12,970
 There is a bigger blessing in your fortune. 

1294
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:14,780
 What? 

1295
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:17,680
 Me? To me? 

1296
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:20,150
 What is it? 

1297
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:22,600
 You're going to have another son. 

1298
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,270
 What? 

1299
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:26,080
 Oh my... 

1300
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,560
 What the heck? 

1301
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,950
 You're going to have another son. 

1302
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:35,570
 You're still able to be pregnant, right? 

1303
01:40:35,570 --> 01:40:38,790
 It's so nice to be young! 

1304
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:46,710
Is it funny to you, too?

1305
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:50,380
Jeez, am I a kid young enough to conceive a child now?

1306
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:53,980
Live. Live. I will hear the sound of the stars, really.

1307
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,540
What a waste of money.

1308
01:40:56,540 --> 01:41:00,110
You never know. You're still young.

1309
01:41:00,110 --> 01:41:03,770
What? You must be crazy.

1310
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:07,310
I am in my mid forties.

1311
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:13,120
You never know. If a child falls from the sky...

1312
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,050
Right, Seon Woo?

1313
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:19,620
What? About what?

1314
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,640
Hello.

1315
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:31,830
Happy New Year Ahjumma.

1316
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:33,220
Hi Jin Joo.

1317
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:36,720
Eat. You slept late last night didn't you?

1318
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,240
It's okay.

1319
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:41,570
The big matches are all over now?

1320
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:44,170
Tell them not to schedule any more matches.

1321
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:48,710
It's okay now because the big matches are all over. Today. and tomorrow, I'll rest for a while.

1322
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,840
Eat it.

1323
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,430
How can I eat this?

1324
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:56,750
Just eat it man.

1325
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,430
Here.

1326
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,280
 Hi Deok Seon. 

1327
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:11,910
 Do you really like her as a girl? 

1328
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:14,900
 She's cute. 

1329
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,980
 What are you guys doing? 

1330
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:19,210
 I'm going. 

1331
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:23,200
 Hi Jin Joo. Let's play later. 

1332
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:27,270
 Seon Woo doesn't know yet, right. I am nervous because he might find out. 

1333
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:30,190
 Sun Woo doesn't know yet? He'll kill me if he finds out. 

1334
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:32,090
 It's not that your mother has other things in mind. 

1335
01:42:32,090 --> 01:42:34,230
 Why does Ahjussi know something that her son doesn't even know? 

1336
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:37,530
 Something her own son doesn't even know... 

1337
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:40,460
 What?! 

1338
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:42,900
 Crazy bastard 

1339
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,240
 Noona. 

1340
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:46,570
 See you tomorrow! 

1341
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:50,040
 Then when are we going to go? On the weekend? 

1342
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:55,170
 Are you finished crying? 

1343
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:58,070
 Our Taek is very competitive. 

1344
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:09,780
