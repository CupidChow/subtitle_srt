00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,110
  1988 ...  

5
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,240
 It was still cold as ever, but our hearts were hot.   

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,380
 People didn't own a lot, but a time existed when at least their hearts remained warm.  

7
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,580
 Of course, if we compared things to now, it would be no better than Paleolithic times. 

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,580
 Clearly it was the time of analog,  

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,140
 but still, our 18-year-old youth was spent living as state-of-the-art.  

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,270
 For the first time in history, we wore the slip-on sneakers,  

11
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,500
 and we obviously wore way too much denim while listening to Shin Hae Cheol's songs on our Walkmans.  

12
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,330
 Guys would go crazy over Jaime Sommers and Joey Wong. And even Sophie Marceau and Professor Jimena.  

13
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:24,520
 And girls would go crazy over Oppas Pierce Brosnan, Tom Cruise, Richard Gere and also New Kids on the Block. 

14
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:34,540
 But without gender distinction, there was one movie which both boys and girls liked best.  

15
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,170
 It was... 

16
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,860

 But, what's the use here. He's a complete idiot here.  

38
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,010
Go and get me a rag.

Get me some leftover steamed cake from the kitchen.  Oh, milk, too!

Go get it! He hasn't been home for a while.

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,860
 This is Seon Woo. He is the normal guy of our neighborhood.  

42
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,960
I didn't hear what they said!

43
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,640
- Why are you mad at me?
- Dunno!! It's your fault...

44
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,310
 Um.  She is me.
   

45
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,730
 My bangs were so wavy you could surf on them.  

46
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:15,300
 I had short hair that gave King Tut a run for his money, and wore a shirt that wasn't pink, but flashy fuchsia. 

47
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,030
 Back then it really was the best I could do.

Ah! What's the baby's name?!

- It's Sung Ho Yin.

Oh my! Oh my! How could an ice cream be 200 won (appx. 25 cents)?

147
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,580
But since it's the World Cup, ice cream costs 300 won (appx. 38 cents), right?

148
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,060
A pack of cigarettes would be 300 won.

149
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,350
A pack of cigarettes costs 600 won (appx. 75 cents) now. It's been a long time since the price went up.

150
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,670
Oh my, this punk who hasn't even had the blood on his head dry, he wants to die! 
 (as if a newborn baby)

151
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,520
Do you smoke, you punk! This punk!

152
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,720
I don't , Dad! It's just an errand for eldest noona!

153
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,510
Are you crazy! How dare you spout some nonsense!

154
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,530
If you smoked it then you should say it! How dare you sell out your sister!

155
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,220
You're the one who looks old enough to use grandpa's pipes!

156
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,230
Do you smoke with pipes?

157
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,980
I smoked.

158
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,940
Either with pipes or cigarettes, it's me.

159
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,560
I smoked. I smoked it. I smoked it.

160
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,950
Anyway, this punk will die after we eat dinner.

161
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,200
What are you doing? If the food is ready then you should come in!

162
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Here.

163
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,290
Let's eat.

164
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,520
I shared to the neighbors so it's not much. Just say if it's not enough.

165
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,420
At first how much was there? 
  (Reply series joke that  Lee Il Hwa has no portion control.) 

166
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,830
Look here, person, it's not like we are goats. Why is it all greens?

167
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,360
I was wondering where my pay went to. It seems like it all went to pay for vegetables.

168
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,650
Aigoo! If someone heard they would think you earn quite a lot of money.

169
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,970
When I tell everyone you work at a bank, they think we're filthy rich. No one would know how I really feel. Who knows?

170
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,930
Hurry and give it.

171
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,170
This person, we should eat first. Oh my, look at the vegetables. They're all wilted.

172
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,760
No, give it to me.

173
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,580
Where is it? Here it is.

174
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,750
Aigoo! The envelope is thick.

175
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,230
This month, how much is in here?

176
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,760
3, 7, 9, 2, 3.

177
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,740
3, 17, 9, 2...

178
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,390
Look here.

179
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,390
♫  The Pepero is going in my mouth and goes to the mountain! The Pepero  ♫ 
  (1988 Lotte Pepero commercial jingle.)  

180
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,240
- Bora's father!
- ♫ Ya, ya, ya ho! ♫

181
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,770
♫ Dong-tak, dong-tak, dong-tak-tak... ♫ Ah!

182
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,830
Why is the money short? Where did the 110,000 won (appx. $137.50) go?

183
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,640
Okay. Okay.

184
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,290
I... bought some books.

185
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,730
You know Yeong Cheol's son, Seok Jin, right?

186
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:18,360
That brat co-signed some loans and went completely broke.

187
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,450
But then, in order to live, he kept on struggling here and there,

188
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,810
and he came to the bank and asked me to buy some books.

189
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,080
How could I ignore him, right?

190
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,180
Is he the only one who's bankrupt? We are also!

191
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,390
We also went bankrupt because you also co-signed wrongly for a promissory note. Who is helping whom now?

192
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,650
Okay. But still we are living with this much to eat.

193
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,710
We are just barely making ends meet.

194
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:48,110
Deok Seon and No Eul's extra curricular fees for this month aren't  paid yet and what are we going to do for Bo Ra's tuition next year?

195
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,300
I'm the only bad wench here.

196
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,740
I can't even have money for others

197
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,160
to buy them a cup of coffee. But you are the one who's good and helping all the neighbors.

198
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,800
I'm the only bad wench.

199
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,430
This person, you're always talking about money.

200
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,390
Look here! What is there to worry about?

201
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,740
Do we not have money or debt?

202
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,410
Do you think that makes sense?

203
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,350
No, I'm am fine and you are healthy.

204
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,210
And all three of our children are healthy.

205
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,780
And they are good in their studies.

206
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,720
Deok Seon this time placed 999th in the entire school.

207
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,990
No Eul is 1000th.

208
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,890
I just gave birth to half wits. All my children are dumb idiots.
 (bakasari - South Gyeongsang dialect for completely dimwitted) 

209
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,040
That... Right!

210
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,730
We have our Bo Ra. Our eldest daughter, Bo Ra. Who is she?

211
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,660
She is goes where the best students in the Republic of Korea attend, Seoul National University.

212
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,910
So what are you worried about? I'm not worried even this much.

213
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,920
Please have my glasses changed.

214
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,750
I'm asking to have my glasses changed.

215
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,030
This girl, it hasn't been a year since we changed that.

216
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,020
My eyes got worse. I should see things in order to study.

217
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,170
Since my birthday is next week, buy me glasses for my birthday gift.

218
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,020
This time, I'm having my birthday separately. I'm never having it together with Unni, got it?

219
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,750
I should slap you with this lettuce.

220
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,640
Your birthday is just 3 days apart from your sister, so why do it twice?

221
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,320
And also, it's too much for your mom.

222
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,560
You're going to buy them, right? Right, Mom?

223
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,360
Those glasses are good ones. We spent a lot to buy that.

224
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,200
I can't see, I tell you.

225
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,690
I can't see any of the writing on the board.

226
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,520
I already told you, I'm not having my birthday together.

227
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,780
Hey!

228
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,400
Your sister is talking.

229
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,230
So funny.

230
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,850
Funny?

231
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,390
- You want to die!
- Mom look at this child!

232
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,030
- Child?! You must be crazy! 
- Mom!

233
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,670
Say it again, wench! What?

234
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,740
Bo Ra, stop it! All her hair is going to come off!

235
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,230
You're acting like you're cursed with typhoid fever.

236
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,580
Just even for one day, let's live quietly!

237
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,490
IT'S SEONG DONG IL'S WISH!

238
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,050
You!

239
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,440
Damn it! Mother!

240
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,880
Your dad is here.

241
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,530
- Father, you're home.
- Father, you're home.

242
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,110
♫ Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 ( imitation of comedian Jang Du Seok playing the Fan Medium on KBS's Humor #1 in late 80s )

243
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,770
♫ Excuse, excuse me.

244
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:33,830
♫ Meet the Fan Medium, who peers deeply deeply into you.

245
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,640
Let's eat.

246
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,840
We'll eat the food well.

247
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,730
That's right, that's right.  You should reply like that.

248
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,750
I will clear your plate.

249
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,580
Darling, you should be nice while I'm here. I'm a scapegoat.

250
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,550
You made salad today.

251
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,430
Mother! I found someone named Bong Yi Ya (scapegoat) here.

252
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,910
It's fascinating.

253
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:22,190
 Kim Jeong Bong: 24-years old, six-time college entrance exam taker. Interested in everything but studying. Original otaku (obsessive). 

254
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,940
But then, how did Deok Seon think to become a picket girl (  country placard bearer for parade of nations )?

255
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,750
Do they take tests to become one? Deok Seon is not good in her studies so what happened?

256
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,890
It just happened.

257
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,660
This one is made by Seon Woo's mom, right?

258
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,030
It's really hard to make curry taste bad.

259
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,910
How did you know?

260
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,630
When I first saw it. 
 ( imitation of comedian Hwang Gi Sun's act )

261
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,250
Okay. I won't do it, Honey.

262
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,440
Is it not funny?

263
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,080
  - I ate one spoonful. 
- You ate one spoonful? 

264
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,670
It's delicious, right?

265
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,540
Son, it's delicious right?

266
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,450
Mom.

267
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,540
Why? Is it a rock?

268
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,420
Dad really hated this.

269
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,530
I know.

270
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,870
Hey, Deok Seon seems to be suffering these days.

271
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,750
That girl is practically burnt black from being in the sun.

272
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,800
Hey, it's still admirable that she got picked.

273
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,040
Of course. She should work hard. There are only three high school students among the picket girls.

274
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,050
Jin Joo.

275
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,580
Deok Seon almost burned to death this summer, practicing at the HyoChang Stadium.

276
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,990
Anyway, what country's sign is she carrying? I've heard it but I forgot.

277
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,910
Even if I tell you, you'll probably forget it again. I also heard it for the first time.

278
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,170
Are you all done, our Jin Joo?

279
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,460
 Madagascar 
 (BGM: Leslie Mandoki &amp; Eva Sun - Korea, part of official Seoul Summer Olympics OST)

280
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,800
Aren't you going to go out? You want to be killed, don't you!

281
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,660
Are you bragging about being played by the government's 3S policy? 
 (3S - Sex, Sports, Screen - to distract public from real life problems)

282
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:49,330
Do you even know about the hidden agenda of our government?  (re: Chun Doo Hwan Administration's policies to distract people) 

283
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,850
Do you know how many residents were dispossessed because of the Olympics?  (gov. forced people out in plank-board houses) 

284
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,370
Do you know or not? Huh!?

285
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,130
What are you saying!

286
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,410
Get out! Get out! Aren't you going out?

287
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,300
  D-8 to '88 Seoul Olympics 

288
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,970
Oppa is going.

289
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,220
Mom, I'm off.

290
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,790
Your lunch box.

291
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,670
Mom, I need ₩1000 (appx. $1.25) for class fee.

292
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,020
Class fee? For what?

293
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,350
Our homeroom teacher's wedding gift. We are collecting a class fee to buy her a wedding gift.

294
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,040
- Really? So I guess she finally decided to marry that Korean history teacher. 
 - Yeah

295
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,910
But didn't they break up? I heard that the drill sergeant  teacher threw a fit about it.

296
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,440
Yeah. But she got pregnant.

297
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,060
Is that true?

298
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,790
Oh my. How embarrassing. How can she show her face?

299
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,970
What should she do, your teacher!!!

300
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,210
That also happened to you, Mom.

301
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,330
- How much is it?
 - ₩1,000.

302
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,830
Mom, please  give me my class fee.

303
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,970
How much?

304
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,830
₩30,000 (appx. $37.50).

305
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,050
Mom, I want fried egg! 
 ( meat was expensive, eggs slightly more affordable )

306
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,260
Mom, me too!

307
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,010
No need for mine. I don't need to eat it.

308
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,530
Aigoo. Here.

309
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,060
Eat.

310
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,950
Our Deok Seon likes black beans stir-fried in soy sauce, right?

311
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,610
You take after me so you're like a black bean beast. Eat a lot, my daughter.

312
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:52,610
I wish Deok Seon's school would also have uniforms. It would be nice not to spend much on clothes.

313
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,440
Noona's school is going to have them starting next year.

314
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,600
You don't even go to school that much, so what use is a uniform?

315
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,080
I do too go to school.

316
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,940
Hey. You're only going to half of the classes today.

317
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,000
Because you are practicing for the Olympics or what not.

318
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,590
Yes. I only go until the 2nd period.

319
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,100
I don't know if she'll be able to go to college at this rate.

320
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,780
She can't. How could a 999th placer go to college?

321
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,930
- Hey!
 - Hey? 
 ( Like "hey you," rude. )

322
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:17,390
Hey, hey. Your food will get cold.

323
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,080
You just need to work hard for one more week.

324
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,290
Wow, but still, our daughter's face will be shown to the whole world. Seong Deok Seon, you've really made it.

325
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,060
Because I'm pretty.

326
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,680
Has she gone crazy?

327
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,020
But look at how our second daughter has grown to be pretty.

328
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:39,270
When she was born both of us cried so hard.

329
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,820
We thought it was chewed  sujebi  (dough flakes soup) that was spit out.

330
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,590
I... even though I gave birth to her I wanted to shove her back in.

331
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,870
We put her back in halfway, then pulled her out again.

332
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,220
Usually those who are born ugly are the ones who grow pretty, they say.

333
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,570
It's no use being pretty when you're young.

334
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,340
Hey, Seong Deok Seon.

335
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,410
What's that on your lips?

336
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,260
That's mine.

337
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,040
- No. 
- It is mine.

338
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,390
- It's not.
- It's not?

339
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,420
It's not.

340
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,890
If you touch my makeup you will die.

341
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,680
Do you get that?

342
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,740
Do you get that?

343
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,880
Hey, Seong Deok Seon!

344
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,900
Okay.

345
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,780
 Mathematics Education Theory 

346
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,160
 Class president 
  

347
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,860
Attention.

348
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,660
- Bow to the teacher.
 - Thank you.

349
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,320
Enjoy your dinner.
  Nighttime Self-Study, ends 22:00 

350
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,690
Yes!

351
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,240
You're seriously disgusting.

352
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,570
Hey, the seniors are waiting so hurry and eat.

353
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,570
Give me some soup.

354
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,720
We're missing one person. We have to fill that one person. If you don't come out right now we're dead.

355
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,740
Don't you see the weather outside? Soccer in this weather? Do you want to die of heat stroke?

356
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:03,270
 Rumania 

357
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,190
Five, six, seven, eight...

358
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,490
One, two, three, your arms are falling. Raise your arms.

359
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,200
That's right. Right. One, two, three, four.

360
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,270
I told you your arms can't fall down. Raise them! That's right!

361
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,710
One, two, three, four, five, si—

362
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,960
This arm is also falling. Raise your arm!

363
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,110
 Rwanda 

364
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,810
Where are you going? Straight line. That's right.

365
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:29,450
One, two, three, four.  Walk properly. Properly.

366
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,070
Five, six, seve— Straight line! Walk properly in a straight line. Look at the line down the middle.

367
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,770
 Madagascar
 Madagascar.  Madagascar. 

368
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,490
One, two— Your expression.

369
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,520
Arm! Expression!

370
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,280
Elegantly. Smile elegantly.

371
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,340
Arm! Arm, arm!

372
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,210
Expression, arm, expression.

373
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,380
Elegantly, I said.

374
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:59,920
Arm, expression, arm.

375
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,450
 Ssangmun High, Class 16 

376
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,380
Hurry up and eat!

377
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,360
I don't want to.

378
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,850
Michael, you bastard. You scared me!

379
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,250
Class President, what should I do?

380
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,720
- Why?
 - I...

381
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,320
All the student fees were mugged.

382
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,040
What?!

383
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,650
 "Math" Changed to Read "Jae-Soo" (Study One More Year to Get into University) 

384
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,250
So why did you go there, idiot?

385
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,000
I must have been possessed. They sell the tea set we wanted at the Dobong Shopping Center!

386
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,950
But I must have made a wrong turn. So right when I turned around,

387
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,950
I was in the back alley of Brazil Spicy Rice Cake.

388
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,040
You were caught.

389
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,860
You decided to serve the money up on a platter, didn't you?

390
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,180
Did you get all the money stolen?

391
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,730
The entire class fund. Not counting the five kids who didn't pay yet. Sixty three thousand won (appx $78.75).

392
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,010
What should I do? We have to buy it by tomorrow.

393
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,760
I really don't have a single cent.

394
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,020
Me either.

395
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,270
How much did you get for student fee today again?

396
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,460
Do you want to die?

397
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,010
Hey, Kim Jeong Hwan, aren't you going to hurry up and come out?

398
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,530
Yes!

399
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,760
Hey, wake up. Hurry up and wake up.

400
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,670
Hey, hey.

401
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,620
Hey, Kim Jeong Hwan! Bastard, do you want to die?!

402
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,160
Yes, I'm going.

403
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,130
Let's go.

404
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,810
Thirty-thousand won? Did you say 30,000 won?

405
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,100
Hyung-nim, it's 1,000 won. Just 1,000 won. You should ask before giving.

406
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,940
What if he uses it to do something bad?

407
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,180
I guess he needed it.

408
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,910
Jin Joo is putting on make up.

409
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,170
Who does she take up after that she is already trying to doll herself up?

410
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,960
She resembles you. Do you think she resembles Seon Woo's dad?

411
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,380
That country bumpkin?

412
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,390
But, why did they need the student fee?

413
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,790
I don't know. He didn't tell me.

414
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,320
Their homeroom teacher is marrying the history teacher.

415
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,160
Really? She must have been a single lady teacher.

416
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,270
It's been an year since they've been dating. She was popular for being pretty.

417
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:28,830
They were secretly dating. But as they were walking and holding hands, they got caught red-handed by Michael.

418
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,060
Who is Michael?

419
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,800
His class's manager.

420
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,760
Since that kid had dark skin and thick lips,

421
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,050
they call him Michael because he looks like the character Michael from the cartoon, Dooly.

422
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:42,930
Really, you know all sorts of things.

423
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:47,850
Because Seon Woo comes and tells me everything. There are no secrets between us.

424
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,840
You are making your son weary.

425
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,010
Hyung-nim, he comes to me first and tells me.

426
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,290
He's a hundred times better than Jeong Hwan who comes home and says nothing.

427
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,420
Hyung-nim, you must be so bored. How can you live?

428
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,640
We say all the stuff we need to.

429
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,720
Don't worry about my son but your daughter.

430
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,590
She's going to kill that horse.

431
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,790
It's okay. The horse has a lot of strength.

432
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,530
That horse has a lot of strength, but...

433
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,980
And, Hyung-nim, even though you live with a husband younger than you, feed him good stuff.

434
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,510
Then he'll have strength at night.

435
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,810
She bought thirty eels yesterday. (Eels are said to boost male virility.)

436
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,560
Every month, with the eels, loach, chicken soup with ginseng,

437
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,580
she completely wasted ten million won (appx. $10K).

438
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,050
Really?

439
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,830
Don't be like that. You should feed Bo Ra's Father such good stuff.

440
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,350
These days his face is looking very tired.

441
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,800
Who would say that he looks the same age as Jeong Bong's Father?

442
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,350
He looks at least ten years older.

443
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,610
Who has the money for that?

444
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,620
It's not that you don't have money, you don't have the space.

445
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,240
What if he eats eel? He can't release it.

446
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,000
Bo Ra's father is also a pitiful man.

447
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,930
Hyung-nim, tonight is the perfect night.

448
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,610
The kids won't get home from night studying until after 11 o'clock.

449
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:09,430
Bo Ra is not coming home today. Why don't you try making a little sibling for No Eul?

450
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:13,670
Aigoo, aigoo. That's enough. So noisy, so noisy.

451
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,230
Come here, come here.

452
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,460
Bo Ra's Father, you're here?

453
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,850
He's coming.

454
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,820
Why did you come so early today?

455
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,350
Hyung-nim, didn't he come home early to make a little sibling for No Eul?

456
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,100
I didn't even heat the soup yet.

457
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,600
Why do you heat the soup? You have to heat his body first.

458
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,380
Really...

459
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:44,730
Bo Ra's Father, don't worry about anything today and do all that you want!

460
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,350
 We'll be guarding the front door! 

461
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,620
 No one will come in so you can keep going at it 

462
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,780
 with an Olympic spirit, fighting! 

463
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,510
I think those people's energy all gathers in their mouths.

464
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,460
Those people who have such weird energy running through them!

465
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,440
Aigoo, you know they're like this all the time.

466
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,030
I can't even come home from work because I'm scared of those women.

467
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,920
I wish they would just die one of these days.

468
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,860
While we're talking about it anyway, why don't you go wash up first.

469
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,820
Jeong Bong's Father is late today.

470
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,210
He always comes home at 7 PM, we could set a clock by him.

471
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:25,490
He's probably holding someone captive and telling his bad jokes.

472
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,560
 Bong-Hwang-Dang: Gold Jewelry, Luxury Brand Watches 

473
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,280
- You came. You're three minutes late today.
 - Yes.

474
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,630
I met Taek's father while coming.

475
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,540
Aren't you cold? Why do you bare your shoulders like that?

476
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,930
Oh my...

477
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,770
Are you afraid that someone might take your wife?

478
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,400
Don't worry.

479
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,770
She's only pretty in your eyes. No one else thinks that. To them she's Kang Ho Dong's shoulder.

480
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,390
It's enough as long as she's pretty in my eyes.

481
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,790
Honey.

482
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,320
Stop, really!

483
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,620
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop.

484
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:39,500
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop.

 1988 Seoul Olympic D-7 

486
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,360
Have a good weekend and don't wander off because it's Saturday.

487
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,510
And be sure to show your parents your report cards.

488
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,550
Yes!

489
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,500
Class President!

490
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,780
Attention!

491
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,450
Bow!

492
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,840
Teacher, congratulations on your wedding!

493
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,470
I don't have enough. You have some, right?

494
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:36,390
One, two, three, four, five. I have exactly 500 won (63 cents) Take it.

495
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,810
Where are you going?

496
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,300
Dobong Shopping Center, to get our teacher's gift.

497
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,610
Let's go together.

498
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,610
Forget it. You guys go together. I promised to play with Jin Joo.

499
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,260
He's ditching us every day these days.

500
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,270
- Hey, I have to go to the restroom.
 - Then go and come.

501
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,730
- Let's go together.
 - Come to the third floor, I'll go ahead.

502
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,310
 Dobong Shopping Center 

503
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,320
 Brazil Spicy Rice Cakes 

504
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,670
 There are two of them there. We have two, too. 

505
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,550
 It's worth trying. 

506
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,060
 The problem is Dong Ryong. If only he covers one person, 

507
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,430
 There's a high chance of winning. 

508
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,580
 Who should I hit first? Right? Left? 

509
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,840
 I've given them too much time. Right now. I need to hit him right now. 

510
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,770
Jeong Hwan, they want you to come too.

511
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,710
♫  I want to cry ♫  
(BGM: Lee Nam E - I Want to Cry)

512
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,240
I want to cry, too.

513
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,050
Hyung-nim, what concerns would you have?

514
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,510
Your husband earns a lot of money. Both of your sons cause you no trouble.

515
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,600
I envy your life the most out of all the people in the world.

516
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,150
What does it matter if I feed him eel? It all becomes poop.

517
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,290
It costs more to unplug the toilet.

518
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,120
Why? You two didn't  "go to Hong Kong"  after feeding him eel? 
 ( euphemism for sex. Because it's as beautiful as the HK night view )

519
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,270
Hong Kong, my butt. We didn't even go to Jeju Island.

520
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,860
If he has a conscience, shouldn't he go outside the country at least?

521
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,490
He doesn't have a conscience.

522
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:14,740
♫  If you leave, you'll understand.  ♫

523
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:22,510
♫  Probably, you'll understand.  ♫

526
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,980
Hello!

527
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,640
That jerk with no conscience.

528
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,520
We hyungs really want to eat Brazil Spicy Rice Cakes, but don't have the money for it.

529
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,030
If I become a great person later on, I'll repay it.

530
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,240
Is this everything?

531
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,130
If I search and find more, it's ten hits per 10 won (a penny).

532
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,650
You can leave.

533
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,510
Thank you.

534
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,350
Thank you.

535
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
Wait a moment.

536
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,660
What is your shoe size?

537
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,640
260 mm.
 ( US Men's Size 8) 

538
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,340
Hey Cabalo. (Brand of his shoes.)

539
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,390
Put that back on.

540
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,530
- Are you going to go meet Dad?
 - Yeah.

541
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,510
It's time for my son to come home, too.

542
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,800
Hello.

543
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,170
Oh hello, you're back!

544
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,120
Jin Joo! How are you doing?

545
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,900
- Is today's dinner bean sprout soup?
 - That's right.

546
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,500
What about Jeong Hwan? Didn't you come back together?

547
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,320
Yes. He went somewhere with Dong Ryong. He will come back soon.

548
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,160
Today is the day you get report cards, right?

549
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,770
Did you take a test?

550
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,980
Yes, last week.

551
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,450
She didn't know. You didn't know this time either, right?

552
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,900
No, he told me about it.

553
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,830
You said that your grade dropped a bit, right? You said that you messed up your math test?

554
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,460
Yes, a little bit.

555
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,440
So this time you didn't come in first place? Then who came in first place?

556
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,370
This time...

557
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:41,180
This, how did it happen?

558
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,970
Did you fight with someone?

559
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,290
No, why would I fight?

560
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,280
Who did this to you?

561
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,060
I said that it's no one. I just got a scratch.

562
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,350
I will go in first.

563
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,010
Where did you get this?

564
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:08,830
It's okay. It's nothing. Just leave him alone and stop exhausting him.

565
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,840
Is he hanging out with bad kids?

566
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,330
Is Seon Woo the kind of kid to do so? I might wonder if it was my kid.

567
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,320
He probably fought with a friend.

568
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,900
What if he got hit by some bad guy?

569
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,620
Forget it. Stop it. He just got one bandage on his chin.

570
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,480
If something really happened, Seon Woo would have come to you and told you.

571
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,610
Stop worrying.

572
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,610
The kids are coming.

573
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,970
- Hello.
 - Yeah!

574
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,720
Dong Ryong, your face is happy these days.

575
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,720
You're back, my son?

576
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,920
A daughter is better. Even though my daughter is ranked 999th place in her grade, a daughter is better.

577
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,460
Why isn't Deok Seon coming? I guess they keep the girls late even on Saturdays?

578
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,610
No. She usually comes early on Saturdays.

579
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:09,730
My husband is not home yet, my son who went to pick him up isn't back yet and my daughter is still not home. Where is everyone?

580
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,240
Hurry up and eat it, your Mom is probably waiting. Why are you eating it so slow?

581
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,220
 Dooly Supermarket Chain 

582
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,690
Does that taste that good?

583
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,920
This is why you come to meet him after work every day.

584
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,420
Did you eat a World Cup ice cream cone every day? I want some, too!

585
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:55,960
Your mom and sister should have some, too. It's heartless if just the three of us eat ice cream.

586
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,970
Your dad is hungry. Let's go.

587
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,560
The ahjummas are in front of the house.

588
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,180
Then eat two and call it dinner.

589
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,720
Sit down and eat it in peace.

590
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,730
I told you to go to the dentist. It won't cost that much.

591
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:28,100
I have money. I'll go next week.

592
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:33,000
But are you really not going to tell me, my son?

593
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,180
How did that happen? Tell your mom.

594
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:42,790
Ah, it's really nothing serious, Mom. Don't worry about it. I'll go to Jeong Hwan's for a bit.

595
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,590
Are you a ghost?
 ( cultural ref: the dead wear white )

596
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,180
Why? Is it your first time seeing someone in a hanbok (traditional Korean clothing)?

597
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,000
You're doing all sorts of things now, all sorts.

598
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,250
They changed our outfits to hanboks. It looks better, doesn't it?

599
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,250
Uh, you shouldn't do anything at all. That's what looks best.

600
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,040
What is that?

601
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,680
What's this? They changed the outfits to hanboks?

602
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,030
Yes, isn't it pretty?

00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,050
No, it's not.

604
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,420
Ah, you startled me!

605
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,570
Oh, really!

606
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,960
If you were close, I would have hit you once.

607
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,700
What are you doing during the nighttime?

608
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,540
Really, talk about Madagascar nonsense.

609
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,880
 The 24th Seoul Olympic Games 

610

- Oh, you're back? 
- You're back, Seon Woo.

631
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,820
Aigoo, Jin Joo is so lucky her brother is here.

632
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,250
She's lucky indeed!

633
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,650
- I'll go home.
 - Bye!

638
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,720
Mom, I'm going to be practicing in the Jamshil Olympic Stadium starting today.

639
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,090
Isn't it completely awesome? It's totally huge here.  Hodori  ( Olympic Mascot's name ) is the size of Mt. Nam, too.

640
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,410
Hyung-nim, it's probably nothing, right?

641
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,070
I told you it's not!

642
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,190
He's at an age where he has his own thoughts and secrets.

643
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,180
When will you cut the apron strings?

644
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,280
This is enough, right? This is probably enough for three families, right?

645
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,180
So many dumplings! Seon Woo's dad would this eat until his stomach exploded.

646
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,390
He must have liked dumplings a lot.

647
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:28,180
Dumplings are second place. Something else is first place.

648
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,330
Rice wine. He would drink one whole bottle of rice wine in a day.

649
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,470
Although that's fine because it's not expensive.

650
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:36,770
Hyung-nim.

651
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:40,680
Please lend me 30,000 won (appx. $37.50). I'll pay you back when I receive my money next month.

652
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,810
Okay.

653
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:46,040
Aigoo, it's almost Seon Woo's birthday. Isn't it the same day as Deok Seon's?

654
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,450
Did you both do it on the same day?

655
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,970
What are you talking about?

656
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,620
Jin Joo is listening.

657
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:55,720
Hyung-nim, when did you do it? I did it on the last day of December in the mountains, while picking pears.

658
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,170
Your kid is listening. Stop it. Are you going to buy Seon Woo a birthday present?

659
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:03,680
Yes. What should I buy for him?

660
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,240
I know, right? What should we buy for our grown sons?

661
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,600
You can buy him more sneakers.

662
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:14,140
You don't know again. You didn't know, right?

663
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,040
Jeong Hwan got his sneakers stolen.

664
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,770
Oh my. When? By whom?

665
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:23,960
Who do you think it would be? Hoodlums, of course.

666
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,470
He could have been in big danger. Is he hurt anywhere?

667
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:31,130
He's not hurt, but he got his sneakers and money taken.

668
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,470
It's been a few days. I heard it from Seon Woo.

669
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:38,470
Looks like Jeong Hwan didn't tell you because he thought you would worry.

670
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,990
It's fine as long as the child didn't get hurt.

671
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,850
Oh, look. Speak of the devil.

672
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:48,760
Hello.

673
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,040
Oh, Jeong Hwan. You've worked hard to study.

674
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,150
Go in and rest.

675
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,630
Mother, there's no food.

676
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:26,410
Your father said he would buy fried chicken. He'll buy two chickens.

677
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,030
Yes.

678
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,030
There's no 'fried chicken' in there.

679
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,110
Who would name their child 'fried chicken?'

680
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,120
Younger sibling, I'm not looking for 'fried chicken' right now.

681
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:54,420
Two of them ( Pronounced Doo Ma Ri in Korean. "Ma Ri" is the quantifier for animals ) I'm looking to see if anyone has the name Doo Ma Ri.

682
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,730
I'm looking for that right now.

683
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,190
Who is it?

684
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,860
Jeong Hwan.

685
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,450
Yes.

686
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,270
What is it?

687
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,500
There's nothing going on these days, right?

688
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,450
Father has arrived.

689
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:45,430
Aigoo, President Ra!
 ( ref to Pukchon Water Vendors from KBS Humor#1 )

690
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,340
You have to say 'President Kim'.

691
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,650
We could divorce.

692
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,830
 Madagascar  

693
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:13,990
Aigoo-oo-oo! President Seong.

694
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,680
Aigoo! President Kim.

695
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,720
It's great to see you. It's great to see you. It's great to see you. It's great to see you. 
 ( Pukchon County is in Hamgyeong Province, North Korea )

696
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,250
- Deok Seon, you're all I have. 
 - Is that fried chicken?

697
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:31,260
You eat the drumsticks. Don't give it to anybody else, okay?

698
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,560
 The Seoul Olympics Opening Ceremony will be held four days from now, 

699
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,390
 and the interest in who will be the final torch bearer is growing by the day. 

700
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:41,070
 The IOC (International Olympic Committee) has stated 

701
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,310
 that the person hidden behind a veil, will not be revealed until that day. 

702
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,300
It's Heo Jae (basketball player). Don't you think so?

703
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,080
Why bother caring? It has nothing to do with us.

704
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,980
Do you not read the newspaper?

705
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,630
Heo Jae has already been appointed as  the athletes' representative. It's not him.

706
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,300
Is that right?

707
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,190
I think there is only one person who can be the one.

708
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,290
- Lim Choon Ae (track and field athlete)
 - Huh?

709
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:07,990
No way.

710
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:12,670
Look and see if my words are right or wrong.

711
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:17,260
Don't eat the wings. You'll cheat on me. ( superstition that he will "fly away" and commit adultery )

712
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,750
Deok Seon, eat a lot.

713
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,700
Mom, what about you?

714
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,470
I don't like chicken. You guys eat a lot.

715
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:29,200
 As someone who will be the holding the placard for the Soviet Team who have never been to Korea before, 

716
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,470
- It's Unni Soviet Union.
  - I feel infinitely great honor and responsibility. 

717
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,710
 Through these Olympic Games, I hope the coldness between the two nations will thaw, 

718
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:38,380
 that the exchanges more spirited... 

719
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,790
Little Noona, why don't you do interviews?

720
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,330
Yesterday, the Noona East Germany did it, too.

721
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:46,090
Are you crazy? Why would they interview her? They only interview pretty girls.

722
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,190
Oh yeah?

723
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:51,450
Then Deok Seon would be picked. Especially since there are only three high school students.

724
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:55,180
If it's not our great Deok Seon, than who else under heaven would it be?

725
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,130
I will do an interview, too.

726
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,630
I'm doing the interview tomorrow.

727
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,090
- Wow? 
- Crazy bitch. You're lying.

728
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,310
It's true.

729
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,780
Hey. How can you call your little sister a crazy bitch?

730
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,850
The crazy bitch is lying.

731
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,060
You wench, I oughta just... in your mouth...

732
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,010
Why are you always like that to me?

733
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,620
Because you're weird.  (uses very informal style) 

734
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:20,360
"You"? "You"? Are you crazy? You?

735
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,470
- Mom! 
- Who are you?! What?! What use is calling Mom?!

736
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:26,530
Mom, Mom!

737
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,800
Let go!

738
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,310
Really!

739
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:38,050
 1988 Seoul Olympic D-3 

740
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,860
Deok Seon, they said to come out now.

741
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,600
Really?

742
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:19,070
Don't be nervous, and just calmly answer the questions.

743
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,280
Yes, I understand.

744
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,880
Please introduce yourself first.

745
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,870
Hello. At this celebration of progress and harmony, this occasion in which our nation becomes one with the world,

746
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:35,070
I am Seong Deok Seon of Ssangmun Girl's High School who has been assigned as Madagascar's picket girl at these Olympic Games of 1988.

747
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:38,520
Yes. I heard you were the youngest out of all the picket girls.

748
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,360
Wasn't it hard for you?

749
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,410
It wasn't hard at all.

750
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:45,770
Because the picket girl unnis treated me kindly, like their younger sister,

751
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:49,460
I have never thought even once that it was difficult.

752
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,120
Still, if you must pick the most difficult part?

753
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,460
I think of it as a huge honor to serve in a national event.

754
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,110
Even if I had difficulties for a moment, with full commitment and dedication

755
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:02,690
I was able to overcome them quickly.

756
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:05,520
You really have great pride as a picket girl.

757
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,060
That's why this must be more regrettable for you.

758
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,600
When did you find out that Madagascar pulled out?

759
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,820
We received the report just yesterday that Madagascar will not attend these Olympic Games.

760
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,070
You must feel very disappointed as a picket girl for that country.

761
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,050
How do you feel?

762
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,560
You still seem to be in great shock.

763
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,420
And in past half of the year, in this hot weather,

764
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,420
didn't you go through lots of hardship?

765
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:46,810
Miss Seong Deok Seon... yeah.

766
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,860
It is very disappointing.

767
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:56,220
It's regretful, but please give a final word to the nation's citizens.

768
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:09,620
Although I am unable to participate in the Olympics,

769
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,700
for the 1988 Seoul Olympics to succeed,

770
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,570
I will pray and cheer harder than anyone else.

771
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:22,310
The world to Seoul and Seoul to the world. Fighting!

772
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:29,150
 With only three days left, Madagascar declared that they will not attend these Olympic Games. 

773
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:31,640
 Because Seoul refused to co-host the Olympics with North Korea 

774
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,890
 it is thought that Madagascar is boycotting these Games for that reason. 

775
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:38,620
 Mario Vázquez Raña, President of the Association of National Olympic Committees told the media 

776
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:42,130
 that Madagascar's decision was political 

777
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:47,950
 and that it was certainly the result of a request from North Korea. 

778
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:59,870
Seon Woo, please buy me some cooking oil.

779
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,260
Seon Woo, please buy me cooking oil!

780
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,580
Seon Woo.
  A Better Tomorrow II 

781
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,750
Oppa isn't here.

782
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,500
He put on his jacket and left.

 English Words and Phrases II

01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,160
Noona. Why are you coming now?

785
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,410
I'm going to die of hunger.

786
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,980
 One, two, three. 

787
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:08,300
♫ Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.♫

788
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,950
♫ To the one we love, our Bo Ra. ♫

789
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:15,590

790
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,820

791
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,920
I'll eat well.

792
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:27,490
No, wait a moment.

793
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:31,990
Like this. Now take out three.

794
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,000
Wait a bit.

795
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:40,280
Here.

796
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,630
Light the candles.

797
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:44,470
Put them in. Finished.

798
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:48,740
Now, now. Now it's our second daughter's birthday party.

799
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,000
Now, one, two, three!

800
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,100
- Happy—
 - Are you guys serious?!?

801
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,840
I told you that I didn't want to do it with Unni! I told you!

802
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,350
Why do you never listen to me?

803
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:06,170
I told you, Mom and Dad, that I didn't want to do a birthday party with Unni!

804
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,730
Let's do it this year and I'll do it separately next year.

805
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:11,370
You said that last year and the year before last!

806
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,700
Why do you do that to me? Do I seem like a pushover?

807
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,930
Am I a person you can treat however you want to?

808
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,810
How come I am the only one you don't make fried eggs for?

809
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:26,760
I really like fried eggs.

810
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,110
You only give me soy sauce beans. I don't like soy sauce beans, either!

811
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:35,110
And, why do you only buy No Eul World Cup Cone ice cream?

812
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,570
Even the fried chicken! Ahjussi gave it for only me to eat.

813
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:45,130
But you only give  the drumsticks to Unni and No Eul and give me the wings.

814
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,780
I know how to eat drumsticks, too!

815
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,490
Deok Seon...

816
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:54,510
And why am I Deok Seon! (old-fashioned name)

817
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,320
I asked why am I only Deok Seon!

818
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:02,500
Unni is Bo Ra and he is No Eul, but why am I only Deok Seon? ( Bo Ra and No Eul are more modern, sophisticated names. )

819
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,440
I said why is my name Deok Seon?!

820
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:11,190
 With only three days left until the Olympics, North Korea, Cuba, Albania, 

821
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,570
Why is she like that?
  Seychelles, Ethiopia, and Madagascar 

822
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:19,880
 because of political issues with Korea, decided to not attend. 

823
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,900
 But the 1988 Olympics 

824
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:27,170
 will still be attended by 160 out of the 167 IOC member countries... 

825
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,310
 Once again, there wasn't anything particularly special about that day. 

826
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:35,640
 The disappointment of being a second daughter was a constant. 

827
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,850
 Just like all the second children in the world, 

828
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,650
 because an elder sister was the oldest and a younger sibling was the youngest, that was why. 

829
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:47,460
 So we always had to sacrifice. 

830
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,700
 Still, I thought that, at least 

831
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:58,260
 my mom and dad would appreciate my sacrificial mindset. But they didn't.

What?

842
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:55,510
You smoke cigarettes, right?

843
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:58,440
No. What are you talking about?

844
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:02,940
Since when did you start smoking. Tell me truthfully.

No. This isn't mine!

It's not mine!

848
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:23,190
Do you know how I raised you?

849
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:28,040
Do you really want to see me die?

850
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,850
You hang out with bad kids and smoke. Why are you like this these days?

851
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:37,740
When did I? Why are you like this suddenly? I said that it's not mine!

852
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:44,330
Then what's this on your face? What happened to your face?

853
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:47,690
Did you fight with someone? Did someone hit you?

854
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,590
Are you really not going to tell me?

855
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,250
Are... you being like this because you have no dad?

856
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,150
I'm just your mom, so you don't care what I say?

857
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,270
Mom!

858

01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:11,480
happened while shaving.

860
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,370

863
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:50,910
Really, why is our mom like this?

01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:54,000

(BGM: Koreana - Hand in Hand)

884

 It is a historical moment. Finally the curtain has risen on the 24th Seoul Olympic Games.

 The beautiful symbol of the Olympics, the five rings, is now being transformed into the Seoul Olympics emblem.

 It is a combination of beautiful colors. 

887
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:20,570
 It is made by 1,100 of students from Seoul Girls' Commercial High and Dongdaemun Commercial High .

It's not luck. Deok Seon worked hard. So they took her because they saw her hard work.

01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,740
She said that she was never tardy.

908
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:35,780
Yeah. If she studied with that heart, she probably would have become first place in class.

909
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:39,550
Hey, so which country is she doing it for?

910
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:45,080
Son, so which country is Deok Seon doing?

911
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,230
You'll see when you watch.

912
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:58,300
Since it's alphabetically arranged,

913
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,760
It's already the Soviet Union?

914
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,460
She'll probably come out soon.

915
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,370
 This is the team from the Soviet Union. 

916
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:08,030
 They have five hundred eighteen athletes. 

917
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,810
 Not long ago our country... 

918
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:13,990
Bo Ra, hurry up and come out! Deok Seon will come out soon!

919
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,490
I said that I'm not going to watch!

920
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,010
...   it's been announced that he is waiting ... (Referring to the torch-bearer) 

921
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:29,430
 - Jordan.
 - Now it is the team from Jordan. 

922
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:31,430
 Jordan is located in the Middle East... 

923
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:35,460
It's next, Dad. It's after Jordan.

924
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,300
Now she's coming out!

925
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,390
 Taekwondo will be an exhibition sport at the Olympics for the first time in history. 

926
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,930
 Uganda. 

927
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:49,590
She came out! She came out! She came out!

928
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:58,200
She came out! Seong Deok Seon, Seong Deok Seon! My noona! My noona!

929
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,050
Mother!

930
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,610
- She really came out!
 - She's so pretty!

931
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:08,480
How can she look so pretty?

932
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,580
- Wow!
 - Hey, Deok Seon!

933
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:15,750
Aigoo! President Seong! It's nice to see you. Nice to meet you! All together!

934
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,170
Uganda! Ugan--

935
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:32,500
Dad, what is this country's capital?

936
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,800
Do you know the capital of Uganda?  Farming and cattle herding...

937
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,780
That's right. It's Deok Seon.

938
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:45,670
Aigoo, it's nothing great... What are you saying? Of course she's successful. Her face is shown all over the world.

939
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:49,000
Seven to one. She beat that.

940
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,830
She was so ugly when she was little so I wondered if she'd ever get married. But as she got older

941
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:55,750
she really blossomed. She's better than her older sister.

942
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:00,960
 The torch bearer is entering. 

943
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,390
 Sohn Kee Chung is carrying the torch. (First medal-winning Korean Olympian, gold medalist in the 1936 Berlin Olympics) 

944
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:09,380
 The torch is passed to Lim Choon Ae. 

945
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:13,780
 The former star athlete Sohn Kee Chung and the current star Lim Choon Ae... 

946
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,890
Lim Choon Ae. I'll knew that it would be her.

947
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:20,780
 Everyone's heart is ablaze like fireworks... 

948
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:24,060
Where did Lim Choon Ae win a medal from?

949
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:29,320
In 1986, during the 10th Asian Games,

950
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:33,060
She won the women's 800, 1,500, and 3,000 meter events in track and field.

951
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:38,040
She is the first Korean woman to win a medal at the Asian Games, and the first athlete to win all three. She was nicknamed Ramyun Girl

952
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,010
Since she had no rice at home, she only ate ramyun. She became a star.

953
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:48,500
But it turns out that she also ate herbal medicine with her ramyun.

954
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:52,340
It happened two years ago.

955
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,270
Right, Hyung, call me when they're playing soccer.

956
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:01,240
Okay.

957
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,580
What are you doing?

958
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,790
Studying.

959
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,050
Okay.

960
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:30,250
- Why?
 - Nothing...

961
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:41,090
- Jeong Hwan.
 - Yes?

962
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:43,750
Don't you have nothing to say to me?

963
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,220
I don't.

964
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:56,050
I heard that you took a test.

965
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,850
Ah, yes. I did.

966
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:02,320
- Did you do well?
 - Yes.

967
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:14,210
Ah, yes. I got first place.

968
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:22,230
Then, why didn't you tell me?

969
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:26,130
It's not like it gets counted into the grades.

970
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:30,570
I want to know everything.

971
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,410
Please tell me these things, too.

972
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,520
Do you know how much I envy Seon Woo's mom?

973
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,710
She says that Seon Woo tells her everything.

974
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:56,290
Though it's not everything, you think about it and pick a few things

975
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,900
to tell me about.

976
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:04,740
It's because I'm embarrassed when I'm with the ahjummas.

977
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,870
Understand?

978
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:16,440
- Answer me.
 - I understand.

979
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,380
♫  The past is the past.  ♫
(BGM: Lee Juck - Don't Worry, Dear)

980
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,730
Study.

981
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:28,980
♫  There is such a meaning  ♫

982
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:33,920
♫  To those who have left, let's sing together   ♫

983
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,140
- Mom.
 - Yeah.

984
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,600
- I...
 ♫  Tell them that you love them  ♫

985
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:43,990
Buy me some sneakers.

986
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,890
I lost them.

987
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:54,210
♫  The past is the past  ♫

988
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:58,100
 - Son! Do you want to go together to buy sneakers today?
 ♫ There is such meaning ♫ 

989
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:03,110
 - No, just give me the money.
 - Okay, I understand. 

990
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:11,400
Hey, Jeong Hwan used to do nothing but play soccer every day. How did he become such a good student?

991
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,240
- It's because he only plays soccer.
 - And he doesn't smoke?

992
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,670
Of course. He's different from how he looks.

993
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:19,160
I thought those cigarettes were Jeong Hwan's if they weren't yours.

994
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,540
No, Mom. Jeong Hwan doesn't smoke.

995
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:25,750
Really? Then whose are those?

996
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,120
Yeah. Whose are they?

997
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:33,380
- But why did he need the student fee?
 - I don't know. He didn't tell me.

998
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,710
Who is it? There's no one to visit.

999
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,260
Who is it?

1000
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,570
Oh, Uncle! Why are you here?

1001
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:14,520
Seon Woo, you need to to go the bath house  with Uncle ( honorific used was for mother's brother )

1002
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,540
- Hurry.
 - What?

1003
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:20,020
Hey, wash well from head to toe, okay.

1004
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:23,450
- Noona, money. 
 - I had a bath yesterday.

1005
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:28,080
I pooped yesterday. If I pooped yesterday, do I not poop today, kid?

1006
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:33,550
Stop talking about poop all the time and marry a woman already.

1007
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:39,640
Tae Soo, take the child, and wash every corner and teach him well about this.

1008
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:45,550
I understand, I understand. Did you pack the razor?

1009
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:51,050
- Go, go now.
 - Let's go. You have to go to the bathhouse with Uncle.

1010
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:55,510
- Why do you pull his ears?
 - I'm going, I'm going!

1011
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:11,930
 Dooly Supermarket Chain 

1012
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,680
How is it, Dad?

1013
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:29,930
- Where did you get that?
 - I got it from an athlete from Uganda. Isn't it cool?

1014
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:38,200
This is a fan I got from a Korean athlete. A hat from an athlete from Equatorial Guinea.

1015
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:43,010
An umbrella I got from an athlete from Netherlands. And also...

1016
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:48,200
And what is that?

1017
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,480
A poor dove. I'm going to bury it.

1018
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,400
There's also a burnt one.
  (When the Olympic flame was lit, doves symbolizing peace were released and burned!) 

1019
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:57,520
I picked it up from under the Olympic Flame Platform.

1020
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,220
Oh my. Okay, okay so put it away.

1021
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:02,770
Okay.

1022
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,480
Our Deok Seon is so kind. Such an angel.

1023
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:23,260
Deok Seon, I also have something to give you.

1024
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,310
What?

1025
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:27,570
Wait here.

1026
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:39,110
Ta-da!

1027
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:43,280
Happy Birthday, my Deok Seon.

1028
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:50,880
Oh my! There are already 18 candles. When did my daughter grow so big?

1029
01:20:56,410 --> 01:21:00,740
Dad and Mom are sorry.

1030
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,150
It's because we didn't know any better.

1031
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:15,650
When the first child was born, we worried about how to teach her. For the second child, we worried about raising her.

1032
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:20,100
For the youngest, we worried about how to make him into a decent person.
 (BGM: Cho Yong Pil - I Wish It Were So Now)

1033
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:23,600
 (BGM: Cho Yong Pil - I Wish It Were So Now) 

1034
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:29,240
This dad of yours was not a dad when he was born.

1035
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:32,400
It's also my first time being a dad.

1036
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:38,510
So that's why, my daughter, please cut us some slack.

1037
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:45,450
Our daughter grew up to be so pretty.

1038
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:51,940
When did you turn into such a pretty young lady?

1039
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:56,990
Even coming on TV and putting on make up.

1040
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:05,570
In any case, when my Deok Seon gets married

1041
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:08,690
Dad will be so sad. How will I live?

1042
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:13,720
- I am not getting married.
 - Don't say such things.

1043
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:20,870
Here. Let's light the candles and sing a birthday song.

1044
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,150
It's pretty.

1045
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:33,410
Deok Seon, happy birthday.

1046
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,570
- Dad, have some too. 
 - No, I don't like greasy food.

1047
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:53,230
 Perhaps you family may know the least about your pain. 

1048
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:57,040
 But what's so important about what we know? 

1049
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:02,870
 In the end, the thing that helps us break down the walls between us, is not the head that thinks 

1050
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:08,330
 but in the end, it is the heart that holds us hand-in-hand without letting go. 

1051
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:13,220
 In the end it is family. 

1052
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:25,050
 Even a hero, even if it's an even greater hero. In the end the ones we go back to in that last moment are family. 

1053
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:30,890
 The scars we receive from the outside world, 

1054
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:37,380
 the scars we receive from life experiences, 

1055
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,800
 Why is my name Deok Seon! 

1056
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:47,110
 even the scars that we receive from family... The people who will embrace you and be on your side until the end... 

1057
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:50,570
 In the end, it is family. 

1058
01:23:57,530 --> 01:24:04,890
 And also— No, despite that, history repeats itself.
   

1059
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,740
Oh, my head.

1060
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:30,830
My head. My head.

1061
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:42,500
Oh no. Is it the gas?

1062
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:49,890
Honey. Honey, wake up! Hey, No Eul! Hey!

1063
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:55,010
Coal briquet gas! Wake up! No Eul, you punk, come to your senses!

1064
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:58,790
Aigoo! Hey, hey! ( Many Korean people died from carbon monoxide gas poisoning from coal briquets. )

1065
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:01,070
Hold on to her. She's acting strange now.

1066
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:06,010
Hey, hey! Are you alright?

1067
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:09,820
- Bo Ra? Are you alright?
 - My head hurts.

1068
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:13,770
My head.

1069
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:04,790
 November 2015 

1070
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:10,180
What was the question again?

1071
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:14,070
When did we first meet? I'm sorry.

1072
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:18,370
When I was young I inhaled so much coal gas.

1073
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:25,220
It's been decades since we first met. We grew up in the same alley.

1074
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:29,850
I didn't know I'd marry him, not even in my dreams.

1075
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:36,650
I must have not been in my right mind. I was crazy.

1076
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:42,800
Truthfully, I inhaled the most coal gas in Ssangmun-dong.

1077
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:48,420
For a very long time. About 20 years?

1078
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:53,500
I think I was not in my right mind because of that.

1079
01:26:53,500 --> 01:27:01,070
My husband is lucky. How else could he get such a beautiful wife?

1080
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:08,370
 Mom, Deok Seon has a crush on someone! 

1081
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:15,850
 - This is a new jacket. How do you like it?
 - I'm late. Get lost.  
 ♫   I will love   ♫

1082
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:18,120
 To go eat spicy rice cakes!  
 (BGM: Lee Tzsche - I Will Love)

1083
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,690
 Don't you think Deok Seon became a little bit cuter? 

1084
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:23,130
 Yeah, a little bit. 

1085
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:24,760
 Yeah. 

1086
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:28,120
  My first love looks like you darn it. 

1087
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:33,690
  Take it out, you bastard. Take it out. 
 (BGM: Lee Moon Sae - Girl)

1088
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,990
  You frustrating bastard. 

1089
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:45,070
♫  you are crying from loneliness  ♫

1090
01:27:45,070 --> 01:27:52,560
♫  I will always stay by your side  ♫

1091
01:27:52,560 --> 01:28:02,380
♫  I won't leave  ♫
