00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,820
 Now, I will introduce my harmonious family members, who are overflowing with love and happiness. 

3
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,490
First, in his sixth year preparing for his college entrance exams,

4
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,380
an emblem of simple honesty and tenacity,

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,440
 I introduce my oldest son Kim Jeong Bong! 

6
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,190
 It seems like he went to the library. 

7
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,580
 Hyper Olympic 50 won (6 cents) per round 

8
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,410
 Next, a person who resembles me from head to toe, 

9
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:28,910
 I introduce to you our family's second son, Kim Jeong Hwan! 

10
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,700
 Jeong Hwan, say something. 

11
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,710
Please don't do these kinds of things.

12
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,690
 It's my first time doing it today. 

13
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,260
 It looks like there's only my wife to rely on. 

14
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,510
 Our main room's madam, my own cheetah, 

15
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,600
 my jaguar! Honey, give us a word. 

16
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,050
Please...

17
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,950
You brought that from your shop again? How much is it?

18
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,700
980,000 won ($1225).

19
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,210
How unusual of you, you narrow-minded fool.

20
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,250
How can you call your husband a narrow-minded fool?

21
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,630
Please say a word for your narrow-minded fool husband?

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,310
Oh, really, I want to hit you but I can't.

23
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,760
It's not because you won't hit me, but you can't because I give you no chance.

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,010
What do you mean, I have no chance?

25
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,680
It stings. It stings.

26
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,520
♫ Excuse, excuse me.

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,200
♫ You're excused.

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,880
♫ Is this the home of Fan-Expert which I can see into?

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:56,990
♫ That's right, right, right. How did you come to this place?

30
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't indulge him, Deok Seon. It'll become a habit.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,650
But it's funny to me.

32
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,870
My mom told me to bring this to you. My grandma brought it.

33
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,500
Aigoo, tell her we will enjoy it.

34
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,430
You must be happy. You like your grandma a lot.

35
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,870
Yes.

36
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,920
But she's leaving tomorrow.

37
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,190
Hey! So dirty with your bare hands.

38
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,120
Mind your business.

39
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,690
Oh, this scent. You smell good, Grandma.

40
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:40,060
Oh, an old person just stinks like an old person.

41
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,040
No, you smell like flesh. Dad smells like this, too.

42
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,220
Your stomach is so slim, so how did you give birth to Dad,

43
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,910
Big Uncle, and my fat aunts?

44
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,960
I gave birth to four kids as big as cows

45
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,470
so my belly shrunk to be this small.

46
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,750
What childish questions from a high schooler.

47
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,860
Grandma, do you know Seong Deok Seon's nickname?

48
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,670
- Don't say it.
 - It's Teuk Gong Dae (Special Forces).

49
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,340
A special head that is terrible at studying.
( Teuk= special, Gongbu = study, Daegari =  (provincial word for head )

50
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,450
Then do you think you study well? You only go to protests.

51
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,710
You?

52
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,340
You really!

53
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,260
What are you girls doing?

54
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,570
I told you loud and clear, if you fight again

55
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,790
I will strip you naked and chase you out of the neighborhood. I'll kill you.

56
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,490
Mother, there's nothing uncomfortable, right?

57
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,170
- Then, please sleep comfortably.
 - Yeah, yeah.

58
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,650
- Go.
 - Yes.

59
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,920
I'll seriously kill you both.

60
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,960
Seong Deok Seon, know that you are alive because of Grandma.

61
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,600
Grandma, what was Big Uncle like? Was he smarter than Dad?

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,740
When it came to book smarts, your dad was much smarter.

63
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,640
That's how he went to the best vocational high school in Gwangju.

64
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,340
Your Big Uncle

65
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:16,010
had to get a job very young so he could support his little siblings.

66
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,920
But now, Big Uncle is the richest. He even lives in America.

67
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,610
Do think it's so easy to have a dry cleaning business in America?

68
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,340
He says that he can just afford to put food on the table these days.

69
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,310
When I think of your Big Uncle,

70
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,110
I still feel a stabbing ache in my heart.

71
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,540
Then who's a better son? My dad calls you every morning.

72
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,230
Why measure such a thing? They are both filial sons.

73
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,880
Your Big Uncle and your dad never fought, not even once.

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,920
Do you think they were like you two?

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,350
That's because Unni picks a fight first.

76
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,440
Hey!

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,170
- Aigoo, again.
 - What?
 - You, really!

78
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,940
Come out.

79
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,060
 Perfect.

 Today's Historic Showdown 

82
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,780
Be careful.

83
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,310
But what is so urgent

84
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,010
that you have to go back so soon? Since you've come up here,

85
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,720
isn't it good to spend one more night?

86
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,640
Aigoo, I have to hurry and go down and dry the peppers.

87
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,540
Really, there are so many things to do.

88
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,900
Grandma, I'll visit you when winter break starts.

89
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,390
- Until then, be healthy.
 - Okay, my child.

90
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,190
But what about Bo Ra? Where did she already go?

91
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,940
She went to the library early. College students these days study really hard.

92
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,330
What library? She probably went to put up protest posters.

93
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,600
Oh my. Are you going to throw this away?

94
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,570
- Huh?
 - Yes. You can't use this anymore, Mother.

95
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,130
It looks totally fine. Give it.

96
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,620
- Yes.
 - Let me see.

97
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,250
I'll take this and use it as an umbrella container.

98
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,480
Mom.

99
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,130
Why do you take that when there are so many things to carry.

100
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,200
When I go to the countryside I'll buy you something better than that.

101
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,700
Aigoo, why waste money like that?

102
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,500
I can just use this.

103
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,480
You'll be late for work. Let's hurry up and go.

104
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,160
- Hurry.
 - Really.

105
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,590
- Good bye.
 - Have a safe trip.

106
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,250
I'll carry them.

107
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,240
Mom, please give this to me. I'll carry it.

108
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,370
Since there's a lot of that, give them to me.

109
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,250
- Don't worry about me and go.
 - Give it to me, I said.

110
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,970
Give what? Give me that.

111
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,240
Why are you holding all of it? Hurry up and go.

112
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,890
- Ah, really.
 - So bothersome.

It's only 45%. I think our love would not come true.

You fool! You wrote it wrong.

143
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,830
- How? 
- You wrote your name first. It means that you only like Oppa Byeon Jin Seob at 40%.

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,170
Really? Let me do it again.

What are you doing? Are you making noodles? Is that chewy noodles?

156
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,720
I said it's spaghetti!

157
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,490
Alright. Don't open your eyes like Kim Wan Sun ( singer ). It's so scary that I could die.

158
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,730
But then, why is the celebration for Taek's victory held in our house?

159
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,040
What food would his widowed father prepare? I just told him to bring chicken. Taek is also coming.

160
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,520
Is that so? I get to see Master Choi's face after a while.

161
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,890
If I had a daughter how nice would it be to have him as a son-in-law.

162
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,980
I have dibs on Taek. He's going to be my son-in-law.

163
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,300
Isn't Bo Ra coming today? All the kids are coming.

164
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,880
She's joined some academic society at school, so she's late every Saturday. She won't be home until after midnight.

165
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,040
 Mom! Where are you? 

166
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,600
Bo Ra?

167
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,420
What is that? Why did she come back so fast?

168
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,300
 Mom! 

169
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:24,500
Eight, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

170
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,280
How old am I?

171
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,190
18. You have two more to go.

172
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,570
Seventeen, 18.

173
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,180
It's over if that breaks. If that breaks your love will not come true.

174
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,080
Hey! Don't even dream of love before you take those braces off!

175
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,680
Be quiet. The fate of my first love depends on this.

176
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm going on an MT (membership training) today.
 (An MT is a trip for college students to foster friendships between seniors and freshmen.)

177
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,550
I will be going after I pack my things.

178
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,530
W--W-Why an MT all of a sudden?

179
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,220
I don't know. A '84 class sunbae got paid for tutoring so he wants to go to Dae Sung Ri.
( Koreans count class by entry year )

180
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,680
He's such a crazy bastard! Why does he do whatever he wants?

181
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,860
Mom, the thing that was here...

182
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,070
haven't you seen my leggings?

183
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,130
I washed them this morning so I hung them up. They're probably dry, so I'll bring them to you.

184
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,460
Never mind. I'll just wear these pants.

185
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,600
But then Mom, I don't see that.

186
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,930
You know... My jacket.

187
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,090
Where's my jacket?

188
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,780
My baseball jacket.

189
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,410
Ah... That... I took it to the cleaners.

190
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,040
No, no. My denim jacket.

191
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,080
Oh? Where's my denim jacket?

192
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,610
It was here for sure. I even saw it this morning.

193
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,850
Where is my denim jacket?

194
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,730
T-That... Y-Y-You see, Bo Ra...

195
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,770
It was here for sure this morning! Why is it not here now?

196
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,980
Where is my denim jacket?

197
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,220
Ahh... Did I wash it? Wait.

198
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,880
Where is my denim jacket?!?

199
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,760
Seong Deok Seon! I'm going to kill you!

200
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:35,390
 The men's track racing will now begin.  

201
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,930
 Representing the U.S., it's Carl Lewis. 

202
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,110
 It's track and field athlete from Canada,  Ben Johnson. 

203
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,150
I think the family downstairs is more fun than this.

204
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,740
Let me use your phone! And your directory.

205
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,340
 Yes, this is Ssangmoon High School. 

206
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,750
Ryoo Dong Ryong's da— no, may I speak to the Dean of Students.

207
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,630
Yes, this is the Dean of Students.

208
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,020
Dong Ryong's dad, please put No Eul on the line.

209
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,660
Yes, hello.

210
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,270

 Ben Johnson comes in first. 

219
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,580
 Ben Johnson comes in first.  

220
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,320
Is he on drugs? He's on drugs. 
( Ben Johnson was later disqualified for doping. )

221
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,390
Aish! What am I going to wear? I'm going to kill Seong Deok Seon!

222
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,370
Seong Deok Seon, where did you go!

223
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,310
Aigoo. Where would she go? She would be in school.

224
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,920
I sometimes wonder how she got into Seoul National University.

225
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Here she comes.

226
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,350
Deok Seon.

227
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,080
Where are you going?

228
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,640
- To kill Seong Deok Seon.
 - It's right here.

229
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,010
It was here.

230
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,740
I forgot.

231
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,760
I'm back from school.

232
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,610
You're here, Deok Seon. You came really early.

233
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,360
It's Saturday. So I didn't go to C.A. (Club Activities) today and just came home.

234
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,150
Hey, Seong Deok Seon.

235
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,650
What?

236
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,960
Did you go to school dressed like that?

237
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,910
Of course I was. Would I be naked?

238
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,860
Deok Seon, hurry and wash up. Let's go to Jeong Hwan's.

239
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,700
Today we are having Taek's victory party. Jeong Hwan's mom is preparing some American noodles.

240
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,970
This is all wet! What am I supposed to do?

241
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,980
Should I dry it with a hair dryer?

242
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,170
When would you finish drying this?

243
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,380
Why did you wash it without telling me?

244
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,670
What am I supposed to wear today?

245
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,270
Hey! Grow up, will you?

246
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,230
What did you just say?

247
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,700
Grow up, I said. And stop bothering Mom.

248
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,520
You, seriously! You grow up! Always coming in last place!

249
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,210
I'm not in last place! There are still 400 people behind me!

250
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,350
That's something to brag about!

251
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,560
And also, why would a college student who just eats and plays need clothes? Just wear whatever!

252
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,170
So ugly, who would look at you?

253
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,670
Okay, right. I held back so much today. Today is your death anniversary.

254
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,820
Are you pretty, then? Your nose is as big as Namsan Mountain.

255
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,730
Seriously!

256
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,570
I'm back... going to school.

257
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,200
You think I'm a pushover? I'm your Unni. You think you're my friend?

258
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,080
You disrespected me first!

259
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,680
You want to die?

260
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,370
You crazy bitch!

261
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,460
Don't talk to your sister like that.  Try it once more and you will really die.

262
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,890
Hey! Let go!

263
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,870
Say it again! Huh? You really!

264
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,280
 This decision will change the next ten years of your life.

He's not your oppa. He's two years younger than you.

You came home early today.

I shouldn't be late on a day like this when Taek's dad is going to buy us food.

280
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,750
And, what's today's menu?

281
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,690
I made spaghetti.

282
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,360
Ghetti, ghetti... What is that?

283
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,060
Spaghetti. It's American noodles.

284
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,360
But how do you eat this?

285
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,430
What do you mean 'how do you eat this'? Everyone eats the same.

286
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,800
But why isn't Taek's dad coming? The noodles will swell.

287
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,720
Isn't Taek's dad this neighborhood's Jo Yong Pil?

288
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,010
The superstar normally comes at the end.

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,100
Superstar came.

290
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,290
The door is open. Why is he ringing the bell?

295
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,730
Why did you come now? My neck was about to break from waiting.

296
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,640
You should close up your jewelry shop on a day like this.

297
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,140
Your son earns so much money, you are being silly.

298
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,600
How is that my money? It's Taek's money.

299
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,520
What would Taek spend money on? You just sock it all away.

300
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,130
You should live using some of that money.

301
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,070
Oh, I brought this.

302
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,800
Wow, you even bought two. Honey, put that in the kids' room.

303
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,250
Okay.

304
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,130
Is Taek coming? It's been a long time since I saw him.

305
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,330
He will come.

306
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,700
He doesn't go to school, so he only has friends in this alley.

307
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,830
He wants to rest his head for once.

308
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,620
 - Mister Choi, say hello to this.
 - Oh my. 

309
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,700
What is that?

310
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,280
Taek's father, wave your hand once.

311
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,180
Aigoo, forget about me.

312
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,010
Then, Bo Ra's father can say something.

313
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,170
How about a word from this town's Ugly Sisters?

314
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,730
- It's a camera!
 - It's from the broadcasting station.

315
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,640
It films movement.

316
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,980
Where's the ahjumma? There was the most beautiful ahjumma among the three.

317
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,240
Have you perhaps seen our cheetah?

318
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Here she was.

319
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,310
Take that down at the count of three. One, two, three.

320
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,220
You thought I'd take it down, right?

321
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,160
Really! Aren't you going to put that away?

322
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,710
My eye almost fell out.

323
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,070
So scary, how can I live?

324
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,040
- We've come.
 - We've come.

325
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,380
Come in.

326
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,830
What about my Seon Woo?

327
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,650
He's coming behind us.

328
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,740
Hello. I've come from school.

329
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,420
Did my son come?

330
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,090
Our Seon Woo, you know that I love you, right?

331
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,960
Yes.

332
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,330
Why isn't my friend coming?

333
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,810
Who?

334
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,040
Aigoo, President Seong!

335
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,920
Aigoo, President Kim!

336
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,290
This is really great to meet you. It's great to meet you! Great to meet you!

337
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,860
Great to meet you!

338
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,620
Deok Seon, thank you for accepting it.

339
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,860
I understand. I know, too.

340
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,280
These two are being ridiculous.

341
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,340
- But why isn't Taek coming?
 - Why?

342
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,210
He's a star for sure. He's very late.

343
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,320
I told him to borrow some comic books.

344
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,580
Wow... Deok Seon has a huge liver (is brave).

345
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,730
She treats the Great Master Choi like her slave.

346
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,270
He's only a star outside, do you think he receives nice treatment between them?

347
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,460
They've been friends since they were little kids.

348
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,000
Hello.

349
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,860
Aigoo, Taek, welcome.

350
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,350
Oh my, has Master Choi Taek arrived?

351
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,810
You personally came to a lowly place.

352
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,580
You're really an honor to the family, what a happy occasion.

353
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,940
And say hello to our family's son-in-law.

354
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,510
How can you say that? I'm going to marry Jin Joo to him.

355
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,840
We're first, right, Taek?

356
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,560
Nice to meet you, I'm your new mom.

357
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm your new dad.

358
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,890
Forget it. Stop. Taek, hurry up and go in. The kids are waiting for you.

359
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,270
Enjoy your meal.

360
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,520
Taek is all grown up now.

361
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,690
Aigoo, how does he seem like such an adult?

362
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,600
After seeing Taek, our kids seem like babies.

363
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,550
He's still a child.

364
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,710
He only know how to play Baduk. He doesn't know anything about the world.

365
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,860
Come on. All of the world's logic is contained in Baduk.

366
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,940
Do you think Taek doesn't know that? And he's even the best Baduk player in the world.

367
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,210
His nature is probably better than us adults, even.

368
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,120
But how much did Taek receive as his prize money this time?

369
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,940
I heard that it was the biggest competition in Korea.

370
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,510
Fifty-million won ($62,500).

371
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,160
Taek is probably going to have to treat the kids to something big today.

372
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,200
I have no words.

373
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,950
That's so nice. I envy him.

374
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,180
Fifty-million won ($62,500)?

375
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,850
Spicy rice cakes.

376
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:04,960
Spicy rice cakes. Spicy rice cakes! Spicy rice cakes!

377
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,060
Spicy rice cakes! Spicy rice cakes! Spicy rice cakes!

378
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,210
- Spicy--
 - Hey, eat some fried chicken.

379
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,780
I'm fine.

380
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:18,000
Hey, look at your pale face. Exercise, and don't always stay in the association ( Korea Baduk Association ).

381
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,880
Look at this. Is this your stomach or your back? You are so thin.

382
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,160
Forget it.

383
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,470
Hey, Taek, you're going to China again, right? When are you going? Are you going before your birthday?

384
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,210
Why? Are you going to give Taek a birthday party?

385
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,690
No. To ask him to steal us a bottle of alcohol.

386
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,630
Mom!

387
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,010
Why are you like this?

388
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,380
Why do you ask Taek to get that? Buy it yourself.

389
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,520
He's on a different level than we are. He always receives expensive alcohol whenever he goes to China.

390
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,310
Hey, Choi Taek, don't give it to your dad this time, and give it to us.

391
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,560
Hey. Where are you going?

392
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,850
To get some juice.

393
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,160
You better not tell.

394
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,970
Okay.

395
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,180
Hey, Special Forces. Only bring juice. Don't eat the ham.

396
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,800
It's Hyung Jeong Bong's

397
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,990
I'm not going to eat it.

398
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:08,140
Land. Land is the best. Buy land no matter what, Taek's Dad.

399
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,160
These days Ilsan ( ref. Ilsan New City, Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province ) is on the rise.

400
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,580
If you don't know anything, don't say anything.

401
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,140
What is there to see in Ilsan? It's all rice paddies.

402
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,100
If you have a substantial sum of cash, the safest thing is to just put it in the bank.

403
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,120
Bank interest is not much...

404
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,050
Yes, the interest has dropped, so it's only 15% now.

405
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:34,610
But you still constantly get interest. There's no place safer than the bank.

406
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,370
Why stash 50 million won ($62,500) in the bank?

407
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,060
Taek's dad, buy an apartment.

408
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,800
The best apartment in Gangnam. What do you call it. Eum Ma apartment.

409
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,240
Eun Ma. ( Because of different dialect, people from different provinces pronounce things differently )

410
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,050
Eum Ma. Eum Ma apartment.

411
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,530
Eun Ma. Eun Ma.

412
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,280
That's what I said. Eum Ma. Eum Ma. The Eum Ma ( sounds like mom in Korean ) apartment costs about 50-million won (about $63K).

413
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,620
That's crazy. How can an apartment cost as much as 50-million won?
 ( Eun Ma Apts sold for $600K in 2013 )

414
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,870
The parcel price is 30 million won ($37500)...

415
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,960
How about near Bundang-gu... ?

416
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,780
Ham. Ham.

417
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,720
Do you think such things would happen to us?

418
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,140
Ham.

419
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,630
Anyway, Taek's Dad, I congratulate you.

420
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,320
Yes, thank you.

421
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,720
My kids are busy spending money.

422
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,430
I wonder what kind of luck Taek's dad was born with.

423
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,240
Jeong Bong's Dad, why don't you hurry up and come here. It's not done yet?

424
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,280
So what if he's rich? He doesn't even know how to use his expensive things.

425
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,110
If it doesn't work, give up and come sit here.

426
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,570
Why are you fussing with turning on music in the afternoon?

427
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,890
Then, let's first toast among us!

428
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,130
Congratulations!

429
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,670


430
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,720
Jin Joo.

431
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,080
Does it taste good?

432
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,630
Can you give me just one bite?

433
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,590
Here, here. It's here. It's all still here.

434
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,630
Who is it?

435
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,830
Who is it? I think someone came.

436
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,760
Taek's Father, what did I tell you to buy?

437
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,970
What did I tell you to buy if you get money?

438
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,650
Apartment.
 (Yoon Soo Il - Apartment)

439
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:00,430
Get up. Everyone get up!

440
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,200
Come alive! Come alive!

441
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,740
♫ The starlight flows

442
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,670
♫ as we cross this bridge

443
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,230
♫ and we pass by the windy reed forest

444
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,370
♫ pass pass

445
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,410
Close the door tightly.

446
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,640
They're at it again.

447
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,000
- Who is today's guest singer?
 - The people who usually come.

448
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,370
- It's my mom
 - And my dad.

449
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:42,110
♫  With my longing heart, I call you 

450
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,990
Hello? Hello?

451
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,730
♫  Your beautiful voice 

452
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,960
Yes! Yes!

453
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,630
♫  Always, to me, always, to me 

454
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,370
♫  in your apartment 

455
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,330
- Good!
 - Yes!

456
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,420
Taek, do you have anything you want for your birthday?

457
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,240
That's right. Tell us before you go to China.

458
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,790
Do you even listen to music?

459
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,660
He only listens to Deulgukhwa's music.

460
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,560
That's right. Jeon In Kwon ( lead vocalist of Deulgukhwa ) released a solo album. Should we at least buy you that?

461
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,410
Hey, Kim Jong Pal, you heard, right? Buy it.

462
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,350
No thanks.

463
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,560
Hey! Brazil Spicy Race Cake might close. It closes early on Saturday.

464
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:34,670
♫  Today, because of foolishness and regret 

465
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:41,020
♫  I came to meet you again

00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,130
- Where are you going?
 - To eat spicy rice cakes.

467
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,270
♫  no one is here 

468
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,210

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,200
Good bye.

00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,620
 October, 1988
Yesterday at seven o'clock pm,  

472
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,760
 the closing ceremony at Jamsil Stadium marked the finale of the Seoul Olympics. 

473
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,170
 In this Seoul Olympics, in which a total of 159 countries participated,  

474
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,700
 the Soviet Union took first place with 55 gold medals, 

475
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,030
 East Germany got second place with 37 gold medals. 

476
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,310
 And Korea got fourth place in the combined medal rankings with 33 gold medals,  

477
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,830
 which was the best Olympic result in history, for Korea. 

478
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,650
Hey! Hurry and get up!

479
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,520
Why does he always drift to the floor every day?

480
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,540
Get up, Seong No Eul! You have to go to school.

481
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,580
What time is it, Noona?

482
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,620
It's 6:30. Hurry up and eat and wash up.

483
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,910
Hello? Mom.

484
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,270
 Did you get up? What about food? 

485
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,980
We're eating right now. What about Grandma? Is Grandma okay?

486
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,160
 She's not well. I have to stay here few days more. Did you pack your lunch? 

487
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,160
I did. What about Dad? Is Dad okay?

488
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,840
 He's okay. He's doing well. 

489
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,300
 Did you wake Unni up?Today's the day she goes to school early. 

490
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,230
I don't know. She'll probably wake up on her own.

491
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,670
♫  Young. I have bookmarked with.  ♫
 (Lee Sun-hee - Young)

492
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,810
Big Noona, get up. Eat breakfast.
♫  a gingko leaf that's faded away  ♫

493
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,820
Aish, really. Bam. You want to die?
 ♫  Can't wait to see. Young   ♫

494
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,930
She said she's not eating.

495
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,310
Tell her, "I told you to eat for sure."

496
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,390
She said, "I told you to eat for sure."

497
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,400
Aish!

498
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,930
Tell her to stuff herself.

499
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,610
She told me, "Stuff yourself."

500
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,100
Tell her if she's not going to eat, I'm going to wash up first.

501
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,460
Really... So annoying.

502
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,630
She told me to say that if you're not going to eat, she's going to wash up first.

503
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,570
Tell her if she wants to die then do it.

504
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,440
Okay.

505
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,530
If you want to die, then do it. If you want to die, then do it.

506
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,120
Is it funny? Is it funny? You said die?

507
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,320
Ah! Really! You are both mental patients!

508
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,010
Mom...

509
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:20,030
Really!

510
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,650
Is there no rank in this house? Why do you wash up first?

511
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,120
You didn't wash up! I'm late, too!

512
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,540
Did I tell you yesterday that I'll wash up first or not?

513
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,560
Then you should've woken up first and washed up.

514
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,340
- What? "You"?
 - She thinks that she's a king or something.

515
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,430
- "She"!
-That's right. "She, she!"

516
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,120
You crazy girl, you!

517
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,670
You come here.

518
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:51,320
Let go, let go!

519
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,200
What? You say 'she' to your unni?

520
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,990
I'm going to tell Mom!

521
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:03,230
Did you say 'you' and 'she' to your sister? 'You'?

522
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:07,160
- Hey!
 - Let go. Let go!

523
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,590
Don't forget what we planned for this evening.

524
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,730
What?

525
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,520
Look at him acting like he doesn't know. We said that we'll go to the Samyang Movie Theater.

526
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,940
Ah...

527
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,680
Michael saw it and he said that it's totally better than "Two Moon Junction" ( an erotic movie ).

528
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,200
Isn't it too much? What did your mom make?

529
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,730
It's not even fully cooked.

530
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,850
It's better than just bringing instant black bean noodles!

531
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,980
Hey, you know about lunchtime, right?

532
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,770
About what again?

533
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,470
Soccer, you bastard.

534
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,500
I won't play with Crazy Dog again. Do you want me to break my ankle again? And his cursing.

535
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,060
He only has a go with me. He's a total psycho.

536
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,990
It's okay. He's nice.

537
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,700
With what evidence?

538
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,650
He doesn't smoke.

539
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,070
- Does that make him kind?
 - Yeah.

540
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,000
- Simple bastard. Are you an amoeba?
 - We already told him that you're playing.

541
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,070
Whatever. I'm going to sleep during lunchtime.

542
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,900
Crazy guy. Why do you sleep at lunchtime when we have math, physics, and everything else?

543
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,490
Jeong Hwan said that he'll cover everything for you. Seon Woo, Seon Woo.

544
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,670
Without you, who's going to score the goals? Who's going to?

545
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,640
I don't know. Whatever.

546
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,280
Seon Woo...

547
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,670
I'm going to waste you.

548
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,020
 High School English II 

549
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,450
Stop reading HR ( high teen romances ), you people.

550
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,410
Aren't you sick of high teen romance?

551
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,130
What is this?

552
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,420
"An Officer and a Princess?"

553
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:13,150
The captain quickly moved in the direction of her lips.

554
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,180
And he deeply coveted her lips.

555
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,400
She started becoming excited.

556
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,050
What excited her was not his rough lips, but

557
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,720
his sculpted, bronzed, bare chest.

558
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Are you working out your frustrations with this?

559
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,310
What are you talking about? Hurry up and give it.

560
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,800
Hey, get a hold of yourself. There is no such guy in reality.

561
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,390
Sculpted, bronzed, bare chest, my butt.

562
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,200
Hey, Ben Johnson.

563
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,430
Ben Johnson has the greatest body.

564
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,980
Hey, get them no matter what.

565
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,670
Push them whenever the referee isn't looking. Understand?

566
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,080
Yes.

567
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,070
If you guys lose again, I'm going to bust your heads.

568
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,830
- Yes.
 - Let's, fighting!

569
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,270
- Yes.
 - Yes.

570
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,050
Why aren't those bastards coming?

571
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,210
Aren't you going to hurry up and come?!

572
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,720
You take care of Crazy Dog. You know that I hate those kind of bastards, right?

573
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,090
That nerd bastard.

574
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,130
Get ready.

575
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,550
Pass! Pass!

576
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,630
Come here.

577
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,060
Goal!

578
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,190
I put it in.

579
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,670
Ah, really!

580
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,030
Did you see that? The referee is not looking?

581
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,440
Here, here!

582
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,260
Here, here...

583
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,720
This one was pretty weak. They only kiss.

584
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,020
Throw it away.

585
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,600
Don't disappoint me, please?

586
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,450
Show me your naked skin.

587
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,880
Deok Seon, the teacher is looking for you.

588
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,800
Hey, what should we do?

589
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,950
If you get caught, say that I looked at all of them.

590
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,520
You just delivered them, okay?

591
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,920
Deok Seon.

592
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,790
Yes, Teacher.

593
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:19,170
Answer the phone. It's your family.

594
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,740
What?

595
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,200
Hello? Who is it?

596
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,410
If it wasn't for Crazy Dog, we would have won, 5:0.

597
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,420
No, 10:0.

598
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,240
Hey, Dong Ryong, what time is the movie? We just have to skip late-night studies, right?

599
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,890
Three o'clock.

600
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,260
Crazy bastard. We should still attend class before we go.

601
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,210
I meant, Crazy Dog bastard at three o'clock.

602
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,040
Move aside.

603
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,500
You guys are really close.

604
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,470
Yes, Hyung. They're my neighborhood friends.

605
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,650
Hey, Student Class President.

606
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,960
You play soccer well. You be the striker from now on.

607
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,420
I said you should be the striker from the next game.

608
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,010
He's so scary. Look at his glare.

609
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,710
I mean... What are you going to do if you glare at me like that, huh?

610
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,200
Are you all that if you're class president?

611
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,590
What is this? Is it a necklace?

612
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,580
Take it off, you bastard. A student shouldn't wear necklaces to school.

613
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,370
A class president should be a role model, right.

614
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,120
Take it off, you bastard. Take it off.

615
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,940
Take it off!

616
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,990
Are you deaf?

617
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,700
Take it off, you bastard!

618
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,620
Hey, next class is drill practice. We're dead if we're late.

619
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,080
Let's go.

620
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,690
This idiot.

621
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,720
See you next time. You're going to die.

622
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,010
Something dropped.

623
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,790
Aish. Let's hurry up and go. We've got that class taught by the dean of students.

624
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,100
Hey, can't you just take it off for a moment?

625
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,930
How can I take it off when it's a keepsake from my dad?

626
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,340
Why can't you take it off? You can just take if off for a moment and put it back on.

627
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,020
So frustrating.

628
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,840
 Don't cry. Pack your bags well and come. 

629
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,600
Unni...

630
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,010
- Unni...
 - It's okay. Stop crying.

631
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,660
 Grandma probably went to a good place. 

632
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,710
 I talked to your teacher, so pack your bags and hurry home. 

633
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,760
Unni...

634
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,370
 No Eul will come too. We have to make it to the last bus, so we don't have time. Hurry and come. 

635
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:27,780
Unni...

636
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,450
 Seoul to Gwangju
Gokseong 

637
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,700
Hey, hurry up and sleep.

638
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:59,010
It's going to take a long time to get to Gokseong ( Gokseong County, a stop along the bus route and where Grandma lives ). If you get there, you won't be able to sleep.

639
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:54,180
I understand. I won't cry.

640
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,560
Are you more sad than Dad?

641
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,680
You shouldn't cry either. A son has to comfort his dad.

642
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,880
Let's go.

643
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:53,930
Is this a mourner's house? It seems like a party house.

644
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,470
This is Grandma's house, right?

645
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,950
Bo Ra.

646
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,780
Did you come? Eat.

647
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,190
Where is Dad?

648
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,350
There are only our aunts.

649
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,210
Is Dad sick somewhere?

650
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,980
Hey, Bo Ra.

651
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:43,840
Dad...

652
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:48,240
What are you doing? Say hello.

653
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,200
Elder, this is my first child, Bo Ra.

654
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,970
She's a student of the best college in Korea, Seoul National University.

655
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,150
Hello.

656
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,680
Oh my, oh my. You are Bo Ra?

657
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,600
When did she become a lady?

658
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,130
When she was little she was so smart and good at studying.

659
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,400
It's not as if I had the money to send her to tutoring academies

660
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,210
or give her private tutoring like other fathers.

661
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,810
But she studied well herself.

662
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:21,070
And she got into Seoul National University.

663
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,030
That's great.

664
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:26,590
And, this is our second daughter, Deok Seon.

665
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,450
She is the one who came out on television during the Olympics.

666
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,830
You are Deok Seon?

667
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,270
I saw you on television.

668
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:39,610
Take a picture with us later.

669
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,980
Yes, let's do that.

670
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,820
From what I heard from her,

671
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:50,560
the picket holding? The competition was very fierce.

672
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,020
Of course, you are on television when the whole world is watching.

673
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:59,640
So from what I hear, it's only one out of hundreds, no thousands of competitors.

674
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,630
That is amazing.

675
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,170
She's great.

676
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:08,520
And, the last guy is our youngest, No Eul.

677
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:14,190
Unlike how he looks, he is such a filial son.

678
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,440
He looks like such a good person.

679
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,830
Hyung, it's me, Jae Yong.

680
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,970
How big your grief must be.

681
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,180
Oh my! Oh my! Jae Yong! This punk!

682
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,520
How long has it been?

683
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,070
You look so much better than before.

684
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,990
Oh, Hyung-nim.

685
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,560
Let's sit somewhere and have a drink.

686
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,350
Yes, I'll sit over there, Hyung-nim.

687
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:42,970
Unni. Maybe Dad is a cyborg?

688
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:45,450
How could he not shed a single tear?

689
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:49,000
Eat up.

690
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,330
It been a really long time.

691
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,310
It has been.

692
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,830
Isn't the soup good? It's thick.

693
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,740
Are adults usually like that? They don't get sad?

694
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,100
Be quiet and just keep frying the patties.

695
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,640
The aunts are the same too. It's their mom. It isn't time to be bragging about rings.

696
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,240
This is white gold.

697
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,650
White gold is plated. Pure gold is the real thing.

698
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,430
Just look at the design.

699
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,640
I pity Grandma.

700
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,430
Aigoo. Hey, go get the younger ones and go sleep first.

701
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:24,030
I cleaned up the room over there.

702
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,720
But isn't Big Uncle coming?

703
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,250
You called him when Grandma fell ill. He wasn't even able to see her go.

704
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:34,870
He'll probably arrive tomorrow. It's not like America is somewhere nearby.

705
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,590
And if he can't come, there's nothing we can do.

706
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,410
Grandma is pitiful.

707
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:46,280
Stop crying. I'm trying to go easy on you, but...

708
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,130
What? I can't even cry when I want to?

709
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:51,270
Seriously!

710
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,740
Keep it down. There are people watching.

711
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:06,000
 Subway Exit  
 ( Mia Station on the #4 line )

712
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,750
 

713
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,040
But then, what are we going to do if there are police?

714
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,790
The policemen in the Republic of Korea are so busy, why would they come to a movie theater out here?

715
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,470
That's nonsense.

716
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,550
 Sam Yang Theatre 

717
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:40,970
 Sam Yang Movie Theater 

718
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,870
The police... ? A thief must have broken in.

719
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,030
It's because it's the first day of the movie. It will be okay tomorrow.

720
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,720
- We're coming again tomorrow?
 - Well, aren't we?

721
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,670
- Let's go.
 - Where? You want to go back to night study?

722
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:59,790
Am I crazy? Taek's room.

723
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,270
Why?

724
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:07,250
The sweet honey-like love story that happens beneath the mulberry tree. "Ppong 2." ( mulberry=bbong ) I borrowed that (videotape).

725
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,410
Taxi.

726

00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,250
Seon Woo.

740
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,450
You're going to be late for dinner, right?

741
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,700
Yeah. Mom, when are you going to Gokseong (County)?

742
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,360
Gokseong(County)? I'm going tomorrow.

743
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,900
I'm planning to go together with the neighbors.

744
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,260
Seon Woo, this will be cold by dinnertime so eat it with cup ramyun. How much is it?

745
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,440
Just give me 500 won (63 cents).

746
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,610
Lunch box.

747
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:32,520
Eat it with cup ramyun. How much is it?

748
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,240
10,000 won ($12.50).

749
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,170
Do you want to die?

750
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,650
I'm going.

751
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,960
Mother, just give me 100 won (13 cents).

752
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,900
If I have 100 won I could play with the Olympic Heroes for the whole day.

753
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,790
Study.

754
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,670
Mother, please give me 100 won.

755
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,680
Look at you, here like this.

756
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,770
Oppa, get up so that you can eat breakfast.

757
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,030
Hurry and wake up. Eat.

758
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,640
Eat some.

759
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,820
Eat this.

760
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,660
Mix the rice with the soup.

761
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,380
My...

762
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,650
Haven't you made cockles? Or fried patties? How about some oysters?

763
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:11,340
- For breakfast?
 - It's warm so mix it together.

764
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,360
You know I like it.

765
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,560
The spicy beef stew is cooked really well.

766
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:25,870
Wow. As expected of a nouveau riche family's son.

767
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,560
Here.

768
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:31,230
Kimchi.

769
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,750
What is that? You only have kimchi?

770
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,040
Nothing besides kimchi.

771
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,950
Curry rice.

772
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,460
Then you should eat what you will have for dinner.

773
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:47,240
I was going to. I also ate curry for breakfast.

774
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,160
Here.

775
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,430
There's no side dish.

776
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:58,380
Would there be soup?

777
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,730
None.

778
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,900
Then...

779
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,590
Kimchi fried rice.

780
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,720
Hey, hey. Let's eat mine together.

781
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:12,660
Aigoo! Sausage. It's difficult to make this taste bad.

782
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,070
Let's try this once.

783
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,940
So salty!

784
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,900
What does your Mom make every day?

785
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,680
I think it's okay.

786
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,660
It's eggshell. It's okay.

787
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:34,020
At his house, his family environment makes it so there's no way to gain weight.

788
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,950
So salty.

789
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,680
You both know about the second try tonight, right?

790
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,600
I think the police will still be there today.

791
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,220
Hyung's (referring to himself) already prepared for it.

792
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,660
You guys have brains for studying, but you do not possess the wisdom of life.

793
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,240
But what about dinner? And our lunch boxes?

794
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,240
It's all eggshells and sausage, anyway.

795
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,070
I will be buying today. Hamburger, call?

796
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:13,070
Of course, it's call. There's no time so hurry and strip.

797
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,350
We are three soldiers.

798
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,360
Salute.

799
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,130
Wait. I need to go to the restroom.

800
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:44,700
What? Already?

801
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,240
Crazy punk!

802
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:53,750
♫ Stretch, stretch, stretch, perk, perk

803
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:57,300
♫ Stretch, stretch, perk, perk, perk...

804
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,570
Seon Woo.

805
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,850
You're asked to come, too.

806
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:35,080
Did Uncle (husband of aunt) come to play go-stop? Because it's not his mother?

807
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,360
Hey, the daughter is like that so what more can you expect from the son-in-law?

808
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,700
These punks, you've done so well! So well!

809
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,200
These seniors who only have a few days before the college entrance exams, huh?

810
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,540
Have you punks gone crazy? Huh?

811
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:52,470
Can you still be considered student leaders? Can you? Can you?

812
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:57,230
You are not in your right minds! How could you be here!

813
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,310
Seriously, these punks!

814
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,020
Punk.

815
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,760
Aigoo. Who do we have here? Isn't this my son?

816
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,470
You must be very busy so what brings you here?

817
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,190
- Hello, Father.
 - Yes, yes.

818
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,020
I was just enjoying cultural life—

819
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,320
What do are you spouting? What cultural life, you punk!

820
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,590
Instead of studying!

821
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,000
- This crazy!
 - Father! Father!

822
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,760
Who? Who is your father?

823
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,550
Your father has died since his insides exploded because you give him so much stress, you punk!

824
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,550
If you're not good at studying then at least you should not cause trouble.

825
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,240
I will kick you, you kid!

826
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,500
Punk. Aiyoo. Aiyoo.

827
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:48,860
Know that you are all saved because of Seon Woo. Got that?

828
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:52,440
You all come to my office after your morning assembly tomorrow.

829
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,830
- Yes.
 - You understand?

830
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,130
- Yes.
 - Understand?

831
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,040
Yes!

832
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,750
I will see you later at home—

833
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,710
Don't even think about coming home tonight! You punk.

834
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:08,420
Father, I respect you.

835
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,200
Hey, Class President.

836
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,250
See me for a bit.

837
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,760
Hey. Hey.

838
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,770
Thank you. How should I repay this debt?

839
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,100
- Hyung, that's not it—
 - Keep quiet.

840
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,030
Hey, great Class President. I said I'm thankful.

841
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,250
Look at this bastard. His senior is talking.

842
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,810
What is this?

843
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,500
Didn't I tell you to take that off?

844
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,610
Take it off, you bastard!

845
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,760
Bastard!

846
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,620
That... is Seon Woo's father's.

847
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,540
That was a keepsake given when his father passed away.

848
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:31,560
So what?

849
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,430
What do you want me to do?

850
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:37,900
Are you allowed to do this to your senior just because you don't have a father?

851
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,350
Are you bragging that you don't have a father?

852
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:43,920
Are you parading around just because you don't have a father, you bastard!

853
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,840
Has this Crazy bastard lost it?

854
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,580
Do you spew whatever you want just because you have a mouth?

855
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,340
Watch what you say, bastard.

856
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,310
It seems like Big Uncle is not going to come. It's almost ten.

857
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:26,650
The funeral cortege is tomorrow, so if he can't come today then he's not coming.

858
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:43,280
Dad, get some sleep.

859
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:50,520
Aigoo. My pretty and kind daughter.

860
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,820
Your dad is fine.

861
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,430
I'm fine.

862
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,470
Dong Il.

863
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,120
Dong Il.

864
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,270
Dong Il.

865
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:15,760
What should we do about our poor mother, Hyung?

866
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:19,350
Our mother is so pitiful. What should we do?

867
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:23,300
For what was she in such a hurry to go so soon?

868
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:27,020
What's the hurry!

869
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,400
Now we can't see our Mom!

870
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:34,300
We can't see our Mom anymore!

871
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,950
Oppa! Why did you just come now?

872
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:40,300
Why did you come so late?

873
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:46,070
We waited so much! You didn't even get to see her for the last time!

874
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:49,700
Mom earnestly looked for you, Big Oppa!

875
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,470
 Adults are just enduring it. 

876
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,410
Our pitiful mother!

877
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,460
Why did you come now? Why now?

878
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,970
 They are just busy doing things as an adult,  

879
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:07,090
 and they are withstanding the weight of their age by pretending to be strong. 

880
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:12,100
I don't need things like this. What's the use
 Adults also hurt. 

881
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:17,700
I can't live! I can't live without Mom!

882
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,250
Oppa!

883
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,540
Mother!

884
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:26,780
You didn't even get to see Oppa!

885
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,950
Come here.

886
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:49,130
Sit down.

887
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,610
Give me your hand.

888
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:04,100
♫  Will it leave someday, this green youth?  ♫
(Kim Feel + Kim Chang Wan - Youth)

889
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:09,900
♫  Like a flower which wilts and blooms again  ♫

890
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:18,100
♫  With the bright moonlight streaming through the window  ♫

891
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:30,100
♫  The love song of my youth is sad  ♫
   Han Il Bank, 20 Years, Seong Dong Il 

892
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,860
I'm off.

893
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,770
Jeong Hwan, can't I sleep at your house tonight? The dean of students lives in our house.

894
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:52,400
Do you think he won't know you're at our house, you idiot.

895
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,610
What are we going to do about that necklace?

896
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,620
I can just not wear it anymore.

897
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,240
But what do we do about your face?

898
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,820
Just worry about yourself.

899
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,570
I'm going.

900
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:18,560
Go.

901
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:11,750
 But still sometimes, it's okay to be deluded. 

902
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:15,760
 If we can make Mom believe that she is a cooking queen 

903
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:20,940
 then we can just eat the incredulously horrid tasting lunch box without complaints. 

904
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,170
I'm back.

905
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:29,010
Oh, you're here, my son.

906
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:32,300
- Aigoo, my child
 - Mom, I will be washing up first. You can sleep first.

907
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,900
Okay.

908
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:40,430
My Seon Woo. You finished your lunch. Was it delicious?

909
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,200
Yeah! It was delicious.

910
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:48,040
 We don't need to rashly insert truth into happy delusions. 

911
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:52,320
 Sometimes we have to be deluded to be happy. 

912
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:58,110
 Choi Taek 6-Dan (rank in Baduk) has scored another victory in China. 

913
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:01,980
 Yesterday at 6 PM, the Shangri-La Hotel in Beijing 

914
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:05,130
 was the place of the Tong Yang Cup competition with participants from three countries. 

915
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,320
 Choi Taek 6-Dan defeated Jeo Bi Pyung 9-dan of China, 

916
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:13,530
 after 343 moves, and claimed victory. 

917
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:17,410
 Choi Taek 6-Dan returned to Korea at Kimpo Airport this morning. 

918
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:22,770
 In addition to his victory, to celebrate his 18th birthday... 

919
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:26,280
Taek's mother must be happy even in heaven.

920
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,620
Can there be another woman like her in this world?

921
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:34,880
Person, if you die, that's it. What's use of being a filial child to a dead person?

922
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,800
You have to be good to them while your parent is still alive.

923
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,860
Is it a black out?

924
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:49,280
I think the glowstarter switch must be out. I'll go buy it. Give me money.

925
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:55,690
While you go out buy 200 won (25 cents) worth of bean sprouts so I can make soup tomorrow morning.

926
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:04,060
- Don't drink alcohol.
 - I understand.

927
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,860
Aigoo, Master Choi!

928
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,350
Did you get off work now?

929
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:24,650
Hello.

930
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:34,300
Right, Taek, I think you have to be my drinking buddy today.

931
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:05,090
Our Taek has already become an adult.

932
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:09,260
When did you mature?

933
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:13,690
You're all grown up now.

934
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:18,820
Ahjussi.

935
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,990
I heard that your mother passed away. I couldn't go ...

936
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:31,840
I'm sorry.

937
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:38,510
Why do you bring that up? I might cry.

938
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:46,420
That's right. Whether she's alive or dead,

939
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:50,400
the person you want to see the most is your mom.

940
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,830
Gosh, I miss my mom.

941
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:05,400
Our Taek, when do you miss your mom the most?

942
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,160
Every day.

943
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:32,550
I miss her every single day.

944
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,920
 A mature child just does not voice his complaints. 
♫    Together let's    ♫

945
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,530
 He only becomes used to being in a situation where he has to look mature. 

946
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:03,400
 He just becomes used to the expectant gaze of others. 
 ♫   All of your hurt memories, all  ♫

947
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,900
 A mature child is still a child. 

948
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:11,740
♫  bury it deep in your heart  ♫

949
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,000
 Delusions are short but misunderstandings are long. 

950
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:19,070
 Therefore, delusions could be freedom, but misunderstandings should be forbidden. 

951
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:24,420
♫  Let the past be the past.  ♫

952
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:31,520
♫  That's what it means.  ♫

953
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:38,460
♫  To those who have left, let's sing.  ♫

954
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:45,400
♫  Tell them that you loved them without regrets  ♫

955
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,870
♫ Happy birthday.

956
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:53,000
♫ Happy birthday!

957
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,310
♫ To our beloved Taek.

958
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:58,070
♫ Happy birthday!

959
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,690
Please come home earlier.

960
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:07,080
Hey, hey, look.

961
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,040
Wear something different, bastard. Are you a grandpa?

962
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,860
We were going to die from hunger from waiting for you. We even called the baduk academy.

963
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:16,200
- Hurry up and blow. The candles are going to burn out.
 - One, two, three!

964
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,030
Hey, hey, here's your present.

965
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,880
- It's finished right?
 - Where is it?

966
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,160
Show it. Take it out.

967
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,590
Hey, hey. Do this later. Where is it?

968
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:32,960
I want to watch Saturday Night Movies. Let's watch that.

969
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,410
Hurry up and take it out.

970
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,730
Hey, look at me.

971
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:41,780
- Lower the volume!
 - You're not going to eat all of this, right? I'm going to take some home.

972
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,780
Look at me. Where is it?

973
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:45,500
- Hey, it's probably inside his bag!
 - Bag, bag!

974
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,710
Bag, bag. Open the bag.

975
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,680
There! There! There!

976
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:53,550
Oh, oh, oh! Fruit alcohol! You did well.

977
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:56,080
Mom! The kids are drinking alcohol!

978
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,740
Lower the volume!

979
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,770
Mom, the guys are drinking!

980
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:07,200
 Taek moved to this block last.

 (Deulgukhwa - Hyehwa-dong)

983
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:41,080
♫  that he will be leaving far away tomorrow  ♫

984
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:45,810
 After Taek's mother passed away, Taek left his hometown,  

985
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,100
 filled with the memories of his mother, and came to Seoul. 

986
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,570
 I don't know why this shy father-and-son pair came to this neighborhood, of all neighborhoods, but 

987
01:16:55,570 --> 01:17:02,360
 one thing for sure is that the four mischievous kids in this alley gained a new friend. 

988
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:10,070
♫  riding a bumpy subway and finding my way back  ♫

♫  so many things we have forgotten, as we live  ♫

990
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:27,350
♫  When we were young, this narrow alley looked so wide  ♫

991
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:36,060
♫  My beloved old friend runs to greet me  ♫

992
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:40,190
 From the time Taek was young, he didn't say much and was quiet. 

993
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:46,880
 So he might have found his unusually boisterous neighborhood friends to be too much for him. 

994
01:17:53,140 --> 01:18:01,290
♫  The big world full of hope that we dreamed about together, he wants to meet it  ♫

995
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:10,480
♫  Tomorrow he will leave far away  ♫

996
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:18,770
♫  Someday on the day that he returns, let us meet again with wide smiles  ♫

997
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:28,020
♫  Tomorrow he will leave far, far away  ♫

1002
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:06,000
 Still, Taek was always together with us. 

1003
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:13,000
 Even though we did mischievous or pathetic deeds, he was always by our sides. 

1004
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:20,250
 Of course, although he always had a dour, emotionless expression, he was always with us.

 The alley can create friendships just with time. 

1007
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:36,580
 That is how a quiet kid and four loud kids became friends, and 

1008
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,220
 that was how we became five. 

1009
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:07,320
You've only had this much, and... I thought you all drink so well.

1010
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:16,170
Hey... Try it once. You'll die.

1011
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,760
What do you see me as?

1012
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:37,660
Hey!

1013
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:46,850
Sh*t!

1014
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,170
Hey, what should I do?

1015
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:13,910
She's so pretty, Wang Jo Hyeon. (Joey Wong.)

1016
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:22,230
In reality, there is no such woman.

1017
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:26,060
These days who is the prettiest?

1018
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:32,480
Wang Jo Hyeon.

1019
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:38,690
There are no such woman in reality. But I am infatuated with a girl from Jeong Hee Girls' High School.

1020
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:42,380
- She has a bob haircut with pale skin?
 - She has a bob haircut with pale skin?

1021
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:44,580
How do you guys know that?

1022
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:47,560
All the kids who ride the 20-2 probably know her.

1023
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:52,900
Then, there was another girl at the library. She was a senior in high school and had long hair.

1024
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:57,660
- She goes to a specialized high school for the arts.
 - The noona who wears a white cardigan?

1025
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:03,560
- You bastards don't study and only look at women!
  (He's imitating his dad) 

1026
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:11,360
- She has a beautiful face no matter what. And...
- That's right
 -You have more?

1027
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:18,290
Don't you think Deok Seon became a bit cuter these days?

1028
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:26,350
Yeah... A little bit?

1029
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:32,170
Hey... Taek, what about you?

1030
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:36,310
Yeah...

1031
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:44,440
- Hey, Jeong Hwan.
 - You are crazy. All of you guys are crazy! Are you drunk?

1032
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,830
After drinking such expensive alcohol...

1033
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:53,550
Hey! This bastard farted! Why are you like this?

1034
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:57,740
Stop farting so much already!

1035
01:22:57,740 --> 01:23:00,180
Why are you coughing?

1036
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,830
What is this?

1037
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:05,940
Oh yuck! Yuck!

1038
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:26,060
 Seong Deok Seon 

1039
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:28,530
- You read it, right?
 - What?

1040
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:30,920
- My diary!
 - I didn't read it.

1041
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:34,170
- You read it!
 - I didn't. Be quiet.

1042
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:36,660
I'm using my mouth to speak. What is it to you?

1043
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:38,330
- Be quiet.
 - Did you read it?

1044
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:41,420
- I didn't read it!
 - Mom!

1045
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:55,590
- You read it, right?
 - I said be quiet.

1046
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:59,440
- You did.
 - I didn't read it.

1047
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,530
"That time when everything is dressed in black."

1048
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:16,510
"That time when I become more lonely."

1049
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,980
"At this hour even the field flowers have gone to sleep,

1050
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:22,620
but my heart for you will not rest so easily..."

1051
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:26,300
- I will kill you!
 - "They say love is about expression."

"So today I'm going to be brave and to him—"

1053
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:32,570
- Really!
 - Mom, Deok Seon has a crush on someone!

1054
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:36,250
She gave him chocolate!

1055
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:46,950
With what mind did I write this?
    

1056
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:50,710
I want to throw it away but I have no place to throw it away.

1057
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:55,240
I can't throw it in the trash, because I'm afraid that someone might read it.

1058
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:59,640
If someone reads it, I'll be so embarra—

1059
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,460
You were a cheeky little thing.

1060
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:08,430
Why is a high school student so into boys already?

1061
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:12,850
You read my diary, right?

1062
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:19,320
Wow... Really... What the?

1063
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:23,380
- You read my diary, right?
 - No...

1064
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:25,980
- You read it!
 - I didn't read it.

1065
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:29,630
Hey, tell me truthfully.

1066
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:32,060
What is with the 'hey' to your husband?

1067
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:36,010
You say 'hey' to me, so why can't I? You read it, right?

1068
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:38,460
I didn't read it.

1069
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,910
Who did you give the chocolate to? I didn't receive it.

1070
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:48,220
Really...

1071
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:52,530
Why do you read someone else's diary? Why did you read it?

1072
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:54,760
- Who did you give it to?
 - I gave it to you. To you.

1073
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,040
Wow... Do you want to die? It was not me.

1074
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,640
It is. It's not you?

1075
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:03,750
It was you, for sure.

1076

I'm going to smoke a cigarette.

1077

- It was you!
 - It was not!

1078
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:32,610
It's definitely him. He must have forgotten because it's been almost thirty years since.

1079
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:36,990
He used to be really smart a long time ago.
