 Brazil Spicy Rice Cakes 

22
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,380
Why are you here? You didn't go to the picket girl practice?

23
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,610
- Then why are you guys here?
 - Hey.

24
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,170
Our school is closer to here.

25
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,010
- Jeong Pal, I'm going to order spicy rice cakes, too.
 - Okay.

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,810
Please add four servings of spicy rice cakes!

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,000
- Jeong Pal, we're going to order, too.
 - Hey!

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,450
That means he's fine with it.

29
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,420
Please give us one more serving of spicy rice cake!

 - Okay.

31
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,370
I guess you don't have any picket girl practice. You've been practically living in the Hyochang-dong Stadium.

32
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,690
I have to eat and go. I have late night practice.

33
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,410
Hey, Special Forces.

34
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,550
Be quiet. Who is Special Forces?

35
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,540
Didn't she turn and look behind immediately?

36
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,770
Did you practice a lot for the school trip? I heard that you're doing Sobangcha.

37
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,020
That's right. When are you going to do all that?

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,450
Picket girl is probably really hard, too.

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,600
- Ramyun is here.
 - Yes!

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,090
Deok Seon, do you want ramyun? Should I get you one?

41
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,530
Hey!

42
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,750
I'm not going to eat it!

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,430
Deok Seon, we're going first. Jeong Pal paid for everything.

45
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,180
How much did you stuff yourselves?

46
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,950
I'm leaving.

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,670
Aren't you going to eat it? It's free.

48
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,000
He's Ssangmoon's class president, right?

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,080
Who? Seon Woo? The tall one? Why?

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,870
What should you do?

51
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,470
What?

52
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,690
I think he likes you.

53
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,780
He kept looking only at you the moment he came in.

54
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,330
No kidding. I saw it, too.

55
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,950
Why does he ask for water from you? He should ask the server.

56
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,360
And, when you said that you're practicing Sobangcha,

57
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,150
did you see his concerned face?

58
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,040
I saw it, I saw it. I really saw it.

59
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,160
And the last crucial evidence.

60
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,080
'Do you want some ramyun?'

61
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,830
Congratulations, Deok Seon.

62

What is it?

67
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,630
Can you lend me some white-out? The liquid type.

68
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,080
White-out? I don't have white-out.

69
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,250
You're doing well. What student doesn't have any white-out?

70
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,430
Noona, hello.

71
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,840
Seon Woo, don't play with her. You'll become stupid, too.

72
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,170
- Be quiet!
 - Look at you!

73
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,050
Hey, hey. Forget it. I'll just borrow it from Jeong Hwan.

74
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,660
I'm leaving. Noona, I'm leaving.

75
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,200
Okay. Go.

76
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,570
Eat.

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,860
Did a second Korean War break out?

78
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,770
Why is there only potato, potato, potato? Is it an emergency food supply?

79
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,680
Are you going to be like this?

80
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,170
You bought a box of potatoes because you pitied the bus station ahjumma.

81
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,960
When did I? I should rip your voice box out.

82
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,130
You're putting on quite a show.

83
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,400
I'm good at acting, right?

84
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,890
Does money spoil?

85
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,230
Do you want to use money because we have leftover money? Please, please!

86
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,700
The kids are watching.

87
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,310
And do you know how good potatoes are for the body?

88
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,980
I bought a lot for my children's health, and you don't even know that?

89
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,870
Your hand is so spicy.
  (i.e., it stings when you hit me.) 

90
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,080
And, Deok Seon, isn't it time for sports news?

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,090
Turn on MBC.

92
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,480
It's MBC right now. It's not time for sports news.

93
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,230
Really?

94
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,390
I really like Anchor Kang Seong Gu.

95
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,730
He looks so gentle, he looks like a movie star. He's so tall, too.

96
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,920
Are you serious? All he does is sit in that chair and talk!

97
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,430
Have you seen if he's tall or not?

98
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,610
 There's a wiretap in his ear, everyone.
 - What is that? 

99
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,140
 There's a wiretap in his ear, everyone! 

100
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,070
 I live in Garibong-dong, 136-35... 

101
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,840
Oh my, oh my. Something about wiretaps came and went, right?

102
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,000
Did only my eyes see that?

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,670
Weird things happen.

104
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,890
 Deok Seon! 

105
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,320
 Seong Deok Seon! 

106
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,980
Our Seon Woo might wear out the doorway.

107
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,530
Seon Woo Hyung, a broadcasting accident happened! Hurry up and come here!

108
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,530
Seon Woo, hurry up and come here and eat some food.

109
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,240
And Deok Seon, hurry up and scoop out some rice for Seon Woo

110
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,070
Oh my, she was here a second ago. Today a bunch of things passed by so quickly.

111
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,940
- Wow, look at how flustered he is.
 - He looks so surprised.

112
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,030
This is the first time in my life seeing such an accident during the news.

113
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,220
Weird things happen.

114
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,070
- Hello.
 - Seon Woo, you came? Hurry up and eat dinner.

115
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,990
Come here and eat a bowl.

116
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,720
No. I'm going to eat ramyun in Taek's room—

117
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,190
Aish! It's more shocking than the broadcasting accident.

118
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,800
Where are you going dressed like that at this hour?

119
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,890
To go eat ramyun.

120
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,920
Let's go, Seon Woo.

121
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,870
 In the summer of 1988, 

122
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,990
 Seong Deok Seon's very first love in her life. 

123
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,000
 First love begins now. 

124
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,830
 Five hundred won 

125
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,280
 Episode 3: One Law for the Rich, and Another for the Poor 

126
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,290
 Ji Gang Heon and others, convicts accused of severe crimes have escaped, 

127
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,150
 so all of Seoul is uneasy and frightened. 

128
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,280
 October 1988, Seoul Dobong-gu Ssangmoon-dong
Last August, on their way to another jail, 

129
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,160
 the convicts. including Ji Gang Heon. broke through a police blockade. 

130
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,340
 They are near the vicinity of Anam-dong and Haengdam-dong in Seoul, and are said to be creating hostage situations. 

131
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,420
 The police do not yet know where they are 

132
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,290
 and are revealing weaknesses in their investigations. 

133
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,200
Hyungnim, I'm scared.

134
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,510
What if they come to our neighborhood, too?

135
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,190
Worry is also fate. What is there to steal in this neighborhood?

136
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,830
There's a lot of expensive stuff in her house!

137
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,840
She has a record player, microwave, rice cooker, and

138
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,450
and also 500 charcoal briquettes.

139
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,150
A robber will never come inside our house.

140
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,370
Why?

141
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,040
There's already a robber inside.

142
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,150
If a human eats food but doesn't do what he has to, isn't he a thief? Am I not right?

143
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,190
This is good. This is it.

144
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,210
You have a lot of greed. Jeong Bong's father is really faithful and shrewd. I've never seen him waste money.

145
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,630
You can have him.

146
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,590
- Why? You're going to give him to someone else?
 - Yes.

147
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,870
If there's someone who'll take Jeong Bong's father, I'll also give them this house.

148
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,260
Me, me! Give him to me. I want to.

149
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,530
I want to marry again at this late age.

150
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,710
Oh my, what is this?

151
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,830
Hyungnim, your ex-husband is already getting off work.

152
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,030
Mi Ran. Mi... Ran.

153
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,480
- Stop it, really.
 - Why do you do this to only me?

154
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,580
- I told you to stop!
 - Okay, okay. I won't do it.

155
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,160
Darn... Were you having an interesting conversation?

156
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,260
Ah... Hyungnim said that you're a thief.

157
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,360
Thief?

158
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,910
Of course. Am I not this person's bellybutton thief?

159
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,630
Then, this bellybutton thief will take his leave.

160
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,430
Everyone. Long life to you! Sheck-sheck-sheck!

161
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,220
So are you the first person in line?

162
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,690
I'm going to live alone. I have to be loyal to my first husband.

163
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,310
What is this? I only see thieves today.

164
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,080
Look at Bora's father. Looks like he looted a shop.

165
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,250
Are you coming now?

166
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,800
What did you buy again today?

167
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,240
What is it? What did you buy again?

168
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,610
See when you come in.

169
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,910
Eat some sweet potato before you go. What's in that dark home that you're in a hurry?

170
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,910
Hyung-nim, Bo Ra's father is really in a hurry.

171
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,970
He probably wants to hurry up and have it over and done with  before the kids come.

172
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,220
Give it. Why did you buy this again?

173
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,920
Aigoo, it's bracken. Bracken. I heard that it's bad for men's virility.

174
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,500
You don't know what you're talking about. Maybe he's so virile, he needs that to decrease it.

175
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,130
- Let's talk when we get it.
 - What is this again?

176
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,770
He's in a real hurry.

177
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,450
Ah, really!

178
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:12,670
Why do those women prattle for 365 days?

179
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,380
I hate seeing them, so we better move away.

180
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,240
What is all this?

181
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,100
You person, can't you know from seeing? It's all vegetables. I bought a little after getting off work.

182
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,920
Is this a little? Is this a little?!

183
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,550
You know there's a wallpaper shop nearby.

184
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:37,370
In front, there was a grandma kneeling down selling vegetables. She looked exactly like my mother.

185
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,960
That person was kneeling and selling them. Seeing her,

186
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,130
I thought that she wouldn't be able to go home if she didn't sell it all.

187
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,710
So how can I, a humane person, just pass by?

188
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,620
So I bought a little bit.

189
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,220
To speak bluntly, how much do these root vegetables cost, anyway?

190
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,650
People having a tough time should help each other out.

191
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,390
Are we in a condition to help strangers?

192
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,920
At our age, we live in a half-basement, and we can't even buy brand-name sneakers for our children.

193
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,420
Look at your wife. Can't you see her wearing socks with holes? What do you do with your eyes, Look! Look!

194
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,990
Oh my, since it has holes, it must feel cool with the wind blowing in.

195
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,250
Aigoo, are you serious now? Are you serious?

196
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,420
You are so obsessed with money. Sometimes people have money, and sometimes you don't. That's how money is.

197
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,950
Aigoo, if I ever had any, I would know to miss it when I don't. I don't even know that.

198
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:41,220
You, really! What bracken bundle should I prepare first?

199
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,010
Two.

200
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,990
Three.

201
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,480
Four.

202
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,340
You thought it was four, right?

203
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,760
Five.

204
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,620
Are you joking? Did you only buy five when there are four in the family?

205
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,910
One per each person. Two for you.

206
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,070
Honey, please. Let's please live now like normal people.

207
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,810
Mister Kim Seong Gyoon, let's spend like other people and let's live like other people.

208
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,450
What about the way we live?

209
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,500
Just think about three years ago. We couldn't dream of oranges like this.

210
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,710
We didn't even have rice, so we had nothing but dough soup.

211
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,140
Whenever I think about how I used to carry that metal delivery food case, I feel like we're living in a dream right now.

212
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,010
Again, again, again! Those past memories!

213
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,630
If you like the delivery food case, then carry the delivery food case!

214
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:58,150
Oh, you. What is the use of having money, when you can't rise to that occasion?

215
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,460
I'm worried that the kids will take after you. I'm worried!

216
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:08,060
What are you going to do about Jeong Bong? He resembles you so he's timid and frugal.

217
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,390
Is he going to do well when he goes out into society later on? Aren't you even worried?

218
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,650
He'll change when he goes to college.

219
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,940
He has to study in order to go to college!

220
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,940
Our Jeong Bong is always studying in his room these days.

221
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,100
Do you want to bet?

222
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:13,020
Look. Is that studying? Are you studying right now?

223
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,630
No.

224
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,610
The  scholastic ability test is not far away. Are you not going to college?

225
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:27,380
President Roosevelt said, "You learn more things in stamps than in school."

226
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,910
Your mother also said,

227
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,980
has there been such a useless son of a b**ch? You son of b**ch!

228
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,190
This damn bastard. After failing the college exams five times, if he has a brain at all, if only to consider his mom and dad,

229
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,000
he should consider himself dead at his desk and study until he gets sores on his butthole!

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,850
You son of a b**ch with no conscience!

231
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,580
That's right. What's so important about studying? Just keep on doing what you're doing.

232
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,390
Yes.

233
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,260
Vegetables are good, so consider the vegetables your main course.

234
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:28,610
You bastard, why do you keep on pushing the table?

235
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,080
- I didn't push it.
 - Then does the table have legs to move toward me?

236
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,340
The table is pressing on my stomach so I can't even move.

237
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,480
Dad. Can't you buy me that Ah-Ha? I'm the only in my class that doesn't have it.

238
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,740
Ah-ha! Your sister has one. Why don't you share it?

239
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,850
- Mine's is broken. Buy me one too.
 - Then we must buy it.

240
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,720
Forget it. I didn't even expect anything.

241
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,650
Eat vegetables. I bought it for you.

There's a guy known as Ssangmoon High School's Park Nam Jung (Korean version of Michael Jackson) who's really good at dancing.

257
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,800
You probably met him at the spicy rice cake restaurant. The one with the glasses.

No thanks. Open the door, it's hot.

00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,500
That scared me. Since when were you playing baduk over there?

300
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,670
Taek, you should have said earlier that you're here already. I've been wanting to eat ramyun since earlier.

301
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,990
Taek, five ramyuns.

302
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,870
Hey! Hey, I will cook it. You don't even know how to cook it.

303
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,840
 Hey, Il Hwa! Dong Il is here, your husband! 

304
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,280
What's with the flattery this time?

305
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,350
What did you buy this time? You bought something again.

306
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,210
Seriously. Your husband, Dong Il, is here.

307
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,610
What did you buy this time?

308
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,620
Ta da!

309
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:29,890
Seriously, as you live life, there are a lot of people who live in hardship.

310
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,540
You know that person who came to us and sold insurance last summer.

311
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,670
Ajusshi's paternal first cousin once removed cousin's daughter's hometown friend.

312
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:45,560
After sending off her husband to the afterlife, she has a boy about Jin Joo's age and lives a really hard life.

313
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,660
After hearing that, I got tears in my eyes.

314
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,010
So what is that?

315
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,410
What do you mean what? It's prenatal education tape.

316
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,370
What? So we should have another baby when we are struggling?

317
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,930
No. She said that if I bought just this one it would take care of one meal.

318
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,330
After I heard that, how could I just pretend not to care?

319
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,160
And she is paternal first cousin once removed Ajusshi's cousin's daughter's hometown friend. She's not a stranger.

320
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,860
She's a stranger! Stranger. Please get your head together!

321
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,300
I can't live because of you, seriously!

322
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:30,370
 While being transferred to a rural prison, 12 prisoners on trial have escaped, shocking the citizens of Seoul. 

323
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,180
 The citizens are afraid that they may commit more crimes, and are spending their days full of fear. 

324
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,600
 Today, the police arrested one of the escapees, Kim Dong Yeon. 

325
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,090
Aigoo. What has the world come to?

326
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,650
 The police learned that he was planning to meet the other escapees in Hooham-dong... 

327
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,140
I'm going to rip that up!

328
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,280
It's still wearable. There aren't even any holes either.

329
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,290
Who wears undershirts until there are holes in them these days? Throw it away right now.

330
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,740
Do you know what's the scariest thing on earth is?

331
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,700
When a person who has nothing helps others. Are we in a position to be helping others right now?

332
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,970
Seriously, you're always talking about money. Are you obsessed with money?

333
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,470
Oh my! I'm the strange one?

334
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,620
Go and ask anyone on the street if someone who lives in a half-basement helping anyone out is normal

335
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,850
or a person who struggles and lives hard to take cares of his kids first?

336
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,800
What's wrong with this half-basement?

337
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,820
What did you say?

338
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,070
It's cool in the summer and warm in winter so it's nice.

339
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,560
Alright then!

340
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,800
If it's so nice to live in a half-basement then live your whole life in here!

341
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,390
I can't live like this anymore!

342
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,290
And also, do you know that Deok Seon is going on a school trip?

343
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,040
Are we going to send the child on a field trip without any money?

344
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:58,430
We should at least send her with about 20,000 won. But this month, we only have 30,000 won left over from our living expenses this month.

345
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,490
What are you going to do? Say something, huh?

346
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,250
Let's just stick to the first verse, darn it.
 (Just say things once) 

347
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,320
Where are you going?

348
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm going to borrow money from paternal first cousin once removed Ajusshi's cousin's daughter's hometown friend.

349
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,370
Aigoo! Good for you!

350
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,590
Hey.

351
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,730
You're all going for a school trip tomorrow?

352
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,400
What's with you, remembering such a thing?

353
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,360
 School Trip Information Sheet 

354
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,820
Seon Woo, I got it from your bag because there was nothing else to put the pot on.

355
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,810
It's Gyeongju. Your school, too?

356
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,190
Yeah. We're going to Gyeongju too.

357
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,410
You're jealous, right?

358
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,170
That's why I told you not to quit school. How can you just graduate middle school?

359
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,390
Jeong Pal. Taek earned 100 million won ($125,000) last year.

360
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,240
But still, I think you would want to go to Gyeongju. You haven't been there, right?

361
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,100
Yeah.

362
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,350
Hee Dong, where did you say your competition is tomorrow? 
 (Hee Dong, a character from Dooly cartoon) 

363
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,100
Tokyo.

364
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,770
Hyung-nim! I have steamed some potatoes. You're still not asleep, right?

365
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,460
Yeah. Come in!

366
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,480
Prenatal education tape? Seriously.

367
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,910
Who would know how I feel?

368
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,100
We fought a round because of that.

369
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,850
We don't have money and he's going around doing all those good things by himself.

370
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,150
What would you do about a person being so good? It's just that he can't bear to ignore them.

371
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,630
Doesn't he notice his children? I really am getting allergic to him.

372
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,390
But you're still better off than me.

373
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,820
Our home's enemy is still not able to move out from the time we lived in that single-room house.

374
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,080
He still doesn't know how to spend money.

375
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,200
It's just because he's shrewd.

376
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,590
And Jeong Bong's father is the one who lived in this neighborhood with the most difficulty.

377
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,230
It's not like that habit will disappear after a day.

378
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,810
If he has lived so poor for a long time, then he should learn how to spend by now.

379
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,420
I'm so embarrassed of everyone watching.

380
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,560
He will change slowly. Slowly.

381
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,100
You got hit by the lighting of money overnight, so it's not like a person's mind would change that fast.

382
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,150
But still, I envy you the most in this world.

383
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,590
Aigoo. When will I live without having to worry about money?

384
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,400
But then, what brings you here late at night?

385
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,290
Well, it's nothing, but...

386
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:54,040
What is it?  Between us, is there anything we can't talk about?

387
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,160
Hyung-nim, I'm always sorry about it.

388
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,370
Hyung-nim, I...

389
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,000
It's about the money you borrowed before, right?

390
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,750
Forget it. Give it to me next time. Repay it slowly.

391
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,540
I'm newly rich. I have a lot of money.

392
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,670
Have a drink.

393
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,590
What are you doing?

394
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,570
No, nothing.

395
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,370
Is that money?

396
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,520
It's student fee. I gathered student fees.

397
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,820
You got a lot of student fee. Your class really has over seventy students, right?

398
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,350
Yeah...

399
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,160
Hey, be careful of that. The student fees were stolen from even Seon Woo's class's  leader.

400
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,070
Oh... That's what happened. I'll be careful.

401
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,600
- Sleep first, Noona. I want to get some fresh air.
 - Okay.

402
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,650
Why?

403
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,530
Noona is going on a field trip tomorrow.

404
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:49,580
♫  Let's go somewhere far   ♫

405
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:56,860
♫  Let's try to erase our loneliness  ♫

406
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,030
♫  Let's go far away  ♫

407
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,770
Why don't you stop fooling around and sleep?

408
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,030
Go ahead and sleep first.

409
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,920
I'm going to give you five minutes until I turn off the lights.

410
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,730
Are we in the army? What's five minutes about?

411
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,240
I don't know what might happen five minutes later.

412
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,780
Do you know how steel becomes tempered?

413
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,120
Not in Nikolai Ostrovski's novel, but in reality

414
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,260
it gets hit to be tempered.  It has to be hit!

415
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,980
What nonsense are you saying again?!

416
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,220
Hey, I told you to stop fooling around and sleep! I told you to sleep, huh?

417
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,370
Stop messing around!

418
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,130
 Mom! 

419
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:52,160
Look at Unni!

420
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,010
Stop being noisy.

421
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:04,050
Bo Ra's mom. Bo Ra's mom, are you sleeping?

422
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,830
Come out for a moment.

423
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Hyung-nim, what are you doing here at this time of night?

424
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,240
My relatives sent us some corn.

425
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,810
Aigoo, really? It must taste good.

426
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,320
I'm going to go. Sleep.

427
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,920
Yes. Go, Hyung-nim.

428
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,130
 Deok Seon is going to the school trip tomorrow, right? 

429
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,070
 Add this to her allowance, Jeong Bong's mom. 

430
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,020
Aish...

431
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,320
Here it is.

432
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,260
And promise.

433
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:34,650
You promised that you'll never lose the camera.

434
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:39,160
If you lose it, you are eternally my 'dog daughter' (rebellious daughter - Reply series).

435
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,450
And I may even kill you.

436
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:46,440
Girl, act carelessly or lose it and I will kill you with my own  hands.

437
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,510
Never. I will never lose it.

438
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,790
Dad, what about the film? Give me the film also.

439
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,170
I feel a little bit uneasy.

440
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,240
Give it.

441
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:03,050
Anyway, I will specially give you two thirty-six count rolls.

442
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,670
So don't just take any picture and be frugal about every shot.

443
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,820
I understand. Don't worry.

444
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,880
That's right. Use it carefully.

445
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,980
But is there any film left in here? Should I try to see if it works?

446
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,730
Hey!

447
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,530
Do you want to die?

448
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,780
I'm leaving!

449
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,240
Does she like it that much?

450
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,180
Of course. It's her first school trip. How happy she must be.

451
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:48,040
On a day like this, she'll probably smile even if her sister hits her.

452
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,890
I'm really leaving! Expect presents!

453
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,510
Hey! Deok Seon! The kimbap!

454
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,280
Right.

455
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,440
♫  the voice calling me from the blue ocean  ♫
  (Song: When Tomorrow Come) 

456
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,950
♫  your image, coming towards me like the waves  ♫

457
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,890
♫  in the new, abundant hope  ♫

458
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:37,220
♫  my heart flutters  ♫

459
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,680
Jin Joo, Oppa will come back.

460
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,970
I'm leaving.

461
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:45,840
Go.
 ♫  Only that feeling is in our hearts.   ♫

462
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,810
♫  Someday I will tell you   ♫

463
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,660
♫  When tomorrow comes   ♫

464
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,590
♫ In your two beautiful hands  ♫

465
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:05,480
♫ I will pour my dream fully in there  ♫

466
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,340
♫ in your lovely dreams  ♫

467
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:16,840
♫ I'll run to you any time  ♫

468
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,960
Let's eat.

469
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,160
Yes.

470
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,610
 Ssangmoon High School - School Trip Information 

471
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,530
 Gyeongju Station 

472
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,200
Hey, Deok Seon!

473
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,430
Take out the camera. We should take one photo before we ride the bus.

474
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,580
- Okay.
 - Wow...

475
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,230
It's nice. It's my first time coming to Jeolla Province.

476
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,750
This is Gyeongsang Province.

477
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,400
Is that important?

478
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,350
What are you looking for?

479
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,180
Are you looking for the camera?

480
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,760
Perhaps...

481
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:37,220
I want to go backkkkkkkkkkk!

482
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:01,480
 Busan 

483
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,130
Go buy a new jacket.

484
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,620
This is still new. I can wear this for ten more years.

485
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,120
Do you want to see each other in court later?

486
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,720
Don't buy a bunch of cheap ones, but buy

487
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,760
just one that is expensive, good, with a brand name. Understand?

488
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,120
Deok Seon, it's okay. You can lose a camera, it happens.

489
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:40,370
It's our family's treasure. My mom might kill me.

490
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,480
Teacher, can't I just go home now?

491
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,770
I don't think I'll be able to have fun because I'm scared.

492
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,890
Should I call your mom for you?

493
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,200
Really?

494
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,330
This is Seong Deok Seon's home, right?

495
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:14,640
Hello, Mother. I am Deok Seon's homeroom teacher.

496
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,410
Yes.

497
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:22,460
Mother, it's nothing much but, Deok Seon left the camera on the train.

498
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,080
What should we do...

499
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:32,810
Mother. M-mother? Mother.

500
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:37,700
Yes. The child is crying a lot.

501
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,950
This is a one-in-a-lifetime school trip, isn't it?

502
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:46,480
I don't want this school trip to be full of fear and terror.

503
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,870
That is so tragic.

504
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:57,520
Thank you, Mother. I will give the phone to Deok Seon. Yes.

505
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,210
Mom...

506
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:12,830
 Deok Seon, it's okay. Have fun and come back. 

507
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,340
Really? Really, Mom?

508
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,360
 That's right. Really. 

509
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,610
 Don't worry about the camera, and have fun with your friends. 

510
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,550
Mom!

511
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:33,590
♬ I'm lost in your charm. You're stealing my heart.

512
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:40,790
♬ Let's dance to my beat.  Let's dance to my beat.

513
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:48,400
♬ Do it with a lot of gusto.  Please don't stop.

514
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,540
♬ The dance is in the beat

515
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,640
♫ Dance to the beat.  Dance to the beat.

516
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,460
♬ We have a lot of gusto.

517
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,930
Hey, should we have not done Sobangcha and have done Kim Wan Seon? I think she'll get first place.

518
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,250
You only have to do well. Only you. You didn't forget the choreography, right?

519
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,820
Hey, I can do it right after I wake up.

520
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,600
♫ Why don't you know that? Hooh! Bam, bam bam!

521
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,340
But what do we do if after all this we don't get first place?

522
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,710
I think you'll cry if you don't get the MyMy.

523
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,300
Hey, unless you don't break your legs and arms suddenly, we are first place for sure.

524
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,070
Do you want to bet?

525
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,270
Hello?

526
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:28,860
Aigoo. Hello, Teacher. Why are you calling our house?

527
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,790
Did No Eul cause some trouble?

528
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:37,630
 It's not something big, but No Eul got caught doing one day cafe by the school. 

529
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,110
What? One day cafe? What is that?

530
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:47,480
 It's something popular among students these days. They sell drinks and do meetings. It's something like that. 

531
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,030
 He probably did that to go somewhere with his girlfriend. 

532
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,800
 For now, I think one of the  parents needs to come to school. 

533
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,220
Aigoo... Yes, Teacher.

534
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,500
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

535
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,140
Aigoo... Really...

536
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,820
 Gyeongju Kim Yoo Shin Youth Hostel 

537
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:08,870
How long are you taking washing up? Hurry up and come so we can practice!

538
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,330
What are you eating again when we're going to sleep?

539
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:14,950
Hurry up and come. I'm going to dance Sobangcha.

540
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,600
Which school is that? The lights are the best.

541
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,660
Hey, it's Ssangmoon High School. Ssangmoon High School naturally has group sound.

542
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,290
Ssangmoon High School has a talent show today? Why do they do it so early?

543
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,280
Is another high school's talent show important?

544
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,320
Our school has the talent show tomorrow. When are we going to practice?

545
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,280
Hey, where are you going?

546
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,600
To Ssangmoon High School's dormitory.

547
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,340
- Are you crazy?
 - We're going!

548
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:00,900
Hey! Hey! Hey!

549
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,960
- We're leaving. 
 - Bye!

550
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,500
That MyMy.

551
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:39,320
That MyMy is what Deok Seon likes most in the whole world.

552
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,850
Honey, go to No Eul's school tomorrow.

553
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,080
What is that about?

554
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,770
No Eul got caught doing one day cafe or whatever.

555
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:57,100
In order to go somewhere with his girlfriend, he tried to make money like that.

556
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:02,480
Aigoo, I can't go to school because I'm so embarrassed. You go to school.

557
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,040
Okay. I'll go. I just need to go.

558
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,630
And guys can do that while playing around.

559
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:15,690
It's not like that he beat someone up or he stole money.

560
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,350
You worry about weird things.

561
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:25,350
Aigoo, I don't know why you have so many concerns?

562
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,880
Grandma, give me all those vegetables today.

563
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,300
And hurry up and go home.

564
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,030
Hurry up and go home...

565
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,670
Did you really buy that?

566
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,640
Of course I bought it. Do you think I stole it?

567
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,730
How is it? Does it look good on me? They say that this is the most popular color.

568
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:05,580
That's right. How nice is it? Your face looks much better.

569
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,320
How much did you pay? This must have been really expensive.

570
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,920
150,000 won. (About 150 dollars) It was originally 200,000 won, but he gave me a discount of 50,000 won.

571
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,120
It turns out that he's my friend.

572
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,630
Really? Friend, who?

573
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,750
You'll know if I tell you. Wait, let me first take off my jacket.

574
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,150
Because this is a brand, it's really warm.

575
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,700
As expected, expensive clothes are different—

576
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,680
What's wrong with this?

577
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,650
This.

578
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,770
Originally, this clothing

579
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,170
is supposed to be taken off like this.

580
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,080
Which friend? Give me the name.

581
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,790
He's not my friend. It was my first time meeting him today.

582
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,060
Which friend?! Aren't you going to hurry up and tell me?!

583
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,770
How can a friend scam a friend?

584
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,880
Are you a dummy?  Are you a pushover?

585
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,120
How much did you seem easy that a friend scammed you?

586
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,600
Look at this.

587
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,580
Why does a horse have six legs?

588
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,980
And what is this trident?

589
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,020
Just looking at it, it won't even cost 10,000 won (about 10 dollars).

590
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,010
But you gave 150,000 won? And also for  defective clothing?

591
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,360
That friend is ignoring you because you are nouveau riche.

592
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,600
He's not really my friend. I got confused.

593
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,200
Are you taking his side because he's your friend?

594
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,670
Which friend is it?

595
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,860
I said he's not my friend.

596
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:55,140
You said that I know that friend! Why can't you tell me?!

597
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,630
The legs are like this!

598
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:10,360
Deok Seon, we'll earn money and get you a MyMy.

599
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,930
If I tell my dad, he'll buy you one.

600
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,630
Shut up.

601
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,630
They say that you can be released.

602
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,710
Mi Ok, you can walk, right?

603
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,820
Of course.

604
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,570
You two, only stay inside the hotel. You are forbidden to go outside.

605
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:41,330
What about the talent show? They have to go to the talent show with me.

606
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:47,370
Talking about talent show nonsense. In this condition?

607
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,350
I heard that you're going to dance to Firefighter. Do you want to ride the ambulance again?

608
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,640
No, Teacher. I have to do the talent show.

609
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,060
So how can you dance in this kind of condition?

610
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:03,370
Anyway, I won't take you guys off of the sign up sheet. So Deok Seon, try your best alone.

611
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,190
I just have to fill the stage no matter what, right?

612
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:10,760
Why? Are you going invite a singer?

613
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:18,780
 Now 2nd grade, class 14 will gather! 

614
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,280
Hey, let's take a picture. A picture.

615
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,560
- Hurry.
- Here it is.

616
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:31,070
Now, one, two, three!

617
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:39,970
♫   Meeting you accidentally, my heart is lost in your image ♫ 

618
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:47,820
♫ Meeting you accidentally,  your eyes have captured my heart.  ♫

619
00:52:47,820 --> 00:53:00,250
♫  I have something to say to you but why don't I have the nerve?   ♫  

620
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:06,610
 Soondheon High School 
♫   I want to say something to you,   ♫

621
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:10,680
 Gwangju Speer Girls' High School  
 ♫  but without any confidence, my heart is going  pit-a-pat  ♫

622
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:18,390
 Baemyeon  High School Field Trip  
  ♫ My stifled heart is flying away in the wind.  ♫

623
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,810
 Ssangmoon High School  Juniors Room 1  

624
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:34,740
 Ssangmoon High School  Juniors Room 16  

625
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,560
Where are you going?

626
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,780
Seon Woo. Come here for a moment.

627
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,150
Yes.

628
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,290
We're here.

629
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,850
Hey, Kim Jeong Pal.

630
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,620
- What?
- Keep this for a moment. Our bags our going to get checked soon.

631
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,540
Are you crazy?

632
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,500
Twelve o'clock. Come to the front of the hotel iron gate.

633
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:08,870
If you don't come out, you'll die. If you touch it, you'll die. If you lose it, I'll kill you.

634
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,640
Hey! Kim Jeong Pal!

635
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,730
Jeong Pal! Hey!

636
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,010
Why?

637
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:24,530
Do Ryong Nyong! I only have you.

638
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,420
 Kim Kim Soo Ro Snack Bar 

639
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,400
Just once. Please save me just once.

640
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,430
Still, how can we go out to a girl school's talent show?

641
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:43,100
Last year without putting in a formal application I came out to your school's Sound Group.

642
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,880
We won second place.

643
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,700
Still, no.

644
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,910
Dong Ryong, please bring the kids.

645
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,280
Really. MyMy.

646
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,140
No. I have woman allergies.

647
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:06,360
I have a friend called Wang Jo Hyeon.

648
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,310
Her real name is Wang Ja Hyeon.

649
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:15,310
but because she looks exactly like Wang Jo Hyeon   (Hong Kong acress Joey Wang) we call her Jo Hyeon.

650
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:22,020
There's another one and her name is Jang Man Ok.   (Hong Kong Actress Maggie Cheung) 

651
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,130
 Hurry up and get well 

652
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:41,290
 Hury up and get well Beauty Jo Hyeon 

653
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,610
How do we bring bastard, Jeong Pal? And even Seon Woo?

654
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:49,230
- Seon Woo? 
 - He's also a student president so he doesn't want to get in trouble.

655
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,860
He'll come. Seon Woo will come.

656
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,540
What are you talking about?

657
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,260
Say that I asked him. Sell me.

658
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,580
Sell what?

659
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,750
And to Jeong Pal, say one word.

660
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,920
What?

661
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,740
- Something special.
- Something what?

662
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,710
See you later at nine o'clock in front of Kim Yoo Shin Youth Hostel gate.

663
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:18,060
 And next in order is 'tonight the girl's eyes is scarier' 

664
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:23,210
 Ssangmoon Girl High School, Chae Jin Ahn! 

665
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,890
Chae Jin Ahn!

666
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:37,610
♫   Dance to the beat.  Dance to the beat.  ♫  

667
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:40,690
♫  There's a lot of gusto.  ♫

668
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,020
I don't think they're going to come.

669
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,790
Deok Seon, just give up now.  I'd be embarrassed and not come if I were them.

670
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,790
They came. There.

671
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,650
Hey, what is this?

672
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,300
- I don't know.
- We came even without discussing it.

673
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,070
Hey, it's not that. Come here. Hey. It's not that.

674
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:07,210
Hey.

675
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,640
   
 The news says that it's bad, 

676
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:14,130
but truthfully because one day cafe is so popular nowadays, there's no one that doesn't do it.

677
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,880
We have to prevent them from going astray, so we gather the parents.

678
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,390
Truthfully, you don't have to worry too much about it.

679
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:23,200
But we're really, really sorry.

680
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,540
I will call No Eul and scold him until he cries.

681
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:30,470
No, no. Don't do that, Father. No Eul is kind. He also has great relationship with his friends.

682
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:35,000
Just please guide him into not doing this again.

683
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,420
And

684
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,940
because it's the rule, starting from today and ten days onward we will tell him to clean the bathroom.

685
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,270
Don't feel upset.

686
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,250
Aigoo, what is just bathroom cleaning?

687
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:51,250
I'll just tell him to clean all the toilets of Ssangmoon-dong.

688
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,850
It's about time No Eul finishes cleaning. Take him and go home, Father.

689
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:59,190
Teacher, I'm sorry. Thank you.

690
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:00,480
No, it's okay.

691
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,200
 Ssangmoon High School 

692
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,270
If he comes, I'll kill him.

693
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,750
Dad!

694
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:13,820
Dad, I'm sorry. I won't do it again. I promise. Please forgive me once.

695
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,910
Gosh, you punk!

696
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,120
If a guy plays he can do that. Why are you so afraid?

697
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,360
It's okay!

698
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,250
Straighten your back!

699
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,250
Pretty bastard.

700
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:35,650
This. I caught a few carp   (Bread in the shape of fish)   for my son to eat.

701
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:38,060
Don't take the bones out, and just eat them.

702
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,480
Dad, too.

703
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,410
It's okay.

704
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:50,970
But then, those who run the one day cafe,

705
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:54,610
are you really close with them?

706
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,910
Hey, Seong No Eul!

707
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,700
Yeah. They have been my friends since middle school.

708
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,390
You probably know them.

709
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,160
Tae Joo and Hong Yi.

710
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,150
- No Eul! 
- You still meet with those guys and hang out?

711
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:09,130
We are in different classes but we meet every day.

712
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,850
We eat our lunch box together, play soccer together

713
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,360
and sometimes study.

714
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,900
Oh right. Your mother's neck will probably fall off waiting.

715
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,680
Seong No Eul! Hey! Half basement!

716
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,050
Half basement! Wait!

717
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,320
- Hello.
- Hello

718
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,010
- Come here.
- What's that?

719
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:33,410
Dad, wait a minute.

720
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:37,570
So petty, eating all by yourself.

721
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:40,450
Want to have some? My dad bought it.

722
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,660
Give me.

723
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,840
I will eat the tail first.

724
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:06,120
Yes. Tonight's last contestant.

725
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,230
I will just read as to what is written here.

726
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:21,350
Contestant number 10. From Ssangmoon High School, Firetruck's Last Night's Story!

727
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:02,020
Sobangcha! Sobangcha! Sobangcha! Sobangcha!

728
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:07,850
♬ Last night, I hated you.

729
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:13,160
♬  Last night, I didn't like you.

730
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:19,330
♬  While I look at the lights which are spinning around and around

731
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:24,440
♬  I all by myself am heart broken.

732
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:36,400
♬ Every time my friends dance holding your hand

733
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:47,260
♬  Why can't I see your tormented image

734
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:57,410
♬  Did you also feel very lonely at last night's party?

735
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:04,600
♬ I can't change you even for the whole world.

736
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:10,530
♬  You. Don't you know why you are it?

737
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:16,260
♬  Last night, I hated you

738
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:21,420
♬  Last night, I didn't like you.

739
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:27,800
♬  While waiting for the incessant sound of the music to stop

740
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:33,120
♬  I was depressed all by myself

741
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:46,990
Sobangcha! Sobangcha! Sobangcha!

742
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,160
Hey, we're going.

743
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,870
Yeah. Thank you, Seon Woo. You were the best!

744
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,590
You like it that much? You're going to have it taken from you by your sister.

745
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:14,580
Are you crazy? Just you dare tell my family.

746
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,820
Deok Seon, we have something to talk about, right?

747
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,800
Guys, say hi. They are my friends.

748
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,040
- Hello.
- Hello

749
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,690
She is Jang Mi Ok. Among us we call her Jang Man Ok (Maggie Cheung).

750
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,360
Yes, hello.

751
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,030
She is Wang Ja Hyeon, among us Wang Jo Hyun (Joey Wong).

752
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,040
Hello.

753
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,500
Yes, hello.

754
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,120
Deok Seon, what are you among yourselves?

755
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,630
Me? Lee Mi Yeon (Korean actress, who plays the older version of Deok Seon).

756
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:46,850
Do you want to get hit?

757
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:50,110
How dare you say her name with that dirty mouth of yours.

758
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:54,890
You all saw each other in the ddeokbeokki store, right? Talk casually. We're the same age.

759
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:56,550
Should we?

760
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:59,640
Hey. You really danced very well.

761
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,410
The best.

762
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:04,420
No, no Ma'am. I'm not a good dancer.

763
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,920
What are you talking about? Let's talk casually.

764
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,770
You're Ssangmoon-dong's Park Nam Jung, right?

765
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:11,360
Hey, you danced better than Park Nam Jung.

766
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,750
Huh?

767
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,110
You are exaggerating.

768
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,290
No. I'm sorry.

769
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:19,750
That... I think we need to go. Kids, let's go.

770
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,220
Deok Seon, you know that we have something to talk about later right?

771
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:24,920
Then, we will be going.

772
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,160
- Hey, Deok Seon come here.
- Hey, talk as we go.

773
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,100
Me?

774
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:38,760
How could she be Joey Wong?

775
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,150
Hey but it's too late so I think we will be caught by the Dean.

776
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:43,620
How did she become Jang Man Ok?

777
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,820
Never mind.

778
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,780
Hurry and give it to me.

779
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,100
What do you keep on asking?

780
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,570
Liquor.

781
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:51,430
Oh, right.

782
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,370
Hey!

783
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:57,400
Right, liquor. I really had it with me earlier in the day.

784
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,380
I was holding on to it until earlier.

785
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:05,610
 Later at 9, in front of the Kim Yoo Shin Youth Hostel gate. 

786
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,390
 Oh! I think your bus is leaving. 

787
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:10,360
 I'm going! 

788
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,430
 Let's go together! 

789
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:33,000
 King Kim So Ro snack bar. (The actor's name is Kim So Ro) 

790
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,480
Seriously! Seriously! Leaving it to you!

791
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,310
I'm the crazy one! Seriously!

792
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,950
The Dean! Dean! Run!

793
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,030
Isn't that Ryong Nyong's father?

794
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:47,780
Teacher! Ryong Nyong's father!

795
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,720
Are you crazy?

796
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,080
You punks, stop over there!

797
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:57,740
Won't you stop right there? Stop right there! These punks want to die!

798
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:14,050
These punks! Just look at them!

799
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:16,870
Hey! Punks! Stop!

800
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:19,320
Hey! Punks!

801
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,960
Hey! Good! Very good! You are being punished by heaven!

802
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,910
I knew you will be punished! Stop right there!

803
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:37,120
Dong Ryong, you will die tonight!

804
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,740
Are you alright?

805
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,430
Why?

806
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:44,830
Why is your father so fast?

807
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:50,020
Seon Woo. Do you have a big rock near you?

808
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,110
Why?

809
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:55,530
Make me faint.

810
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,030
Breathe quietly.

811
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,990
Keep quiet!

812
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,060
Sheesh.

813
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:41,020
Let's go. Hurry. Let's go.

814
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,720
That hurts, right? Let's go, you punk.

815
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,370
This punk!

816
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:48,870
A lot.

817
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,760
Where did that one punk go?

818
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,810
He should be nearby. Jeong Hwan.

819
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:23,490
Where did you go?

820
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,950
This punk.

821

01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,180
Dad!

832
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,020
Dad, Mom says to hurry and go home. Let's hurry and go home.

833
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:15,410
Okay. Just drink that and come home. I will be waiting.

834
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:20,220
Take this and go first.

835
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:27,460
I'm sorry. Sorry.

836
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,080
You didn't have this exchanged yet!

837
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:56,140
You need to have this exchanged tomorrow. Do you understand?

838
01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:03,310
I bought it from a friend so how could I go and have it exchanged? I will just wear it.

839
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:09,240
Friend? Friend, my a**. How do you call a person like that your friend?

840
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:23,810
What kind of friend is like that? Why are all of your friends like that?

841
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:29,470
When they heard the rumors that we hit the jackpot they wanted to have a hand in it.

842
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:33,720
While there was not even one call when we didn't have a single briquette and had the children sleep in the cold.

843
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,620
But then, what is that friend doing? You know when Jeong Bong was this big

844
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:45,270
and he caught a cold but we didn't have money to buy him medicine so we borrowed money here and there.

845
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:49,940
That... Your hometown friend. The one who came to Seoul together with you.

846
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:56,500
He came suddenly and drank soju with you.

847
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:03,570
I thought he was such a clueless person. In this poverty how could we have a guest?

848
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:07,630
I thought so, but then your friend, as he left

849
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:14,290
he secretly gave 50,000 won saying to buy something delicious for Jeong Hwan and Jeong Bong.

850
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:19,130
He lives with his pay day by day.

851
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,120
That time, 50,000 won.

852
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:28,910
That time, that friend seemed like god.

853
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:39,480
Just find a friend like that and not those who just hurt you.

854
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:46,370
Huh? Call him.

855
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:50,200
It's him.

856
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:57,740
That person is him.

♫  Let's  sing to those have left ♫  

875
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,700
 It was a hectic Sunday morning. 

876
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:37,250
 Four of the remaining fugitives and  earlier a fifth in a hostage's house which he entered have been captured. 

877
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:41,270
 While the hostage situation was bloody, it was brought to an end. 

878
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:44,190
 The drama of this escape leaves us with an infamous saying. 

879
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:46,670
  "There is one law for the rich and one law for the poor." 

880
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:50,310
 When you have money,  you are innocent.  If you have no money, you are guilty. 

881
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:53,270
 This case clearly shows the absurdity in our society. 

882
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:55,730
Aigoo. What a waste. 
 It ended with a tragedy. 

883
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:59,450
Aigoo. So pitiful.

884
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:05,010
What's so pitiful? Having no money is a crime.

885
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:07,780
Did you realize that just now?

886
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:12,850
Mom! Dad! I'm here! Tada! A gift.

887
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:17,370
This girl! Do you know how much that costs!

888
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,090
Mom!

889
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:35,210
Where do you leave your senses at!

890
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:39,360
I can't live because of you!

891
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,000
- Stop right there! 
 - Mom!

892
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,640
Mom! You said it was okay! What's wrong with you?

893
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,150
Then do I scold you when your teacher was right there?

894
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:52,710
Hurry and come here! Jeong Hwan move away.

895
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,370
We can just buy a new one, huh?

896
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:59,330
Deok Seon's mother, first calm down.

897
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:03,300
Jeong Hwan, get your head out of the way. I will end this with that girl! Move!

898
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,720
Mom! Mom! I was wrong. I won't do it again. Huh?

899
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:13,790
Such nonsense! Come here! Come here!

900
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,590
Oh my! I can't live seriously.

901
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:32,770
Who did that girl take after that she's like that! How much was that camera worth!

902
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:37,860
Oh my fate. My fate.

903
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:43,520
This person, then you could kill your child like that. We can just buy a new camera.

904
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,460
Just because she forgot the camera, you beat her up like that?

905
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:50,620
This is all your fault.

906
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:56,260
If you just earned a lot of money, would I be chasing that child around?

907
01:18:56,260 --> 01:19:00,200
If you hadn't served as a guarantor for other people's loans, we would be living in luxury like and apartment.

908
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,610
If only I had money I could become a better mother to the children.

909
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:10,080
It's because we don't have money that I feel it's so unfair. This is all because of you!

910
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:15,340
Where are you going again?

911
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,400
To earn money.

912
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:24,620
You said you want to live like them upstairs so I will go and hit the jackpot.

913
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:30,610
Don't bet. Don't bet, please! It's such a waste of money!

914
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:34,490
Do you think that luck would just fall on anyone!

915
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:53,530
 Three years ago.
 May, 1985 

916
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,090
 Wow! We have three side dishes. 

917
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:19,780
 It looks delicious. There's also tofu. Is today a special day? 

918
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:25,610
 Eat while I'm saying it nicely. 

919
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:28,060
 Yes. 

920
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:31,920
 Our Jeong Bong, what are you collecting these days? 

921
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:37,760
 Probably... probably you all remember. 

922
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:45,750
 September 30, 1981. We heard very good news from the small town of Baden-Baden in far away Germany. 

923
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:53,400
 The winning bid is Seoul. Wow 
(This was the time and place of the announcement of the site of the 1988 Olympics.) 

924
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:59,230
 Hyung is collecting lottery tickets lately. Olympic lottery. 

925
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:01,300
 Ouch! 

926
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:05,060
 Mom, I only buy one every month. 

927
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,470
 Mom, one only costs 500 won-- 

928
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:12,280
 Is 500 won a small amount? With that you could buy 3 briquettes! 

929
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,280
 Hyung they're drawing now. 
 Indeed, the main character 

930
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:19,080
 somewhere is the one who unknowingly purchased the winning ticket. 

931
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,500
 I will just watch until today. 

932
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,540
 We'll begin with the first number. Roll it. 

933
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:31,600
 We'll go from Group one  to Group five. 

934
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,650
Today's first lucky number in the  fifth place is one.

935
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:41,250
Next  the one in the one hundred thousand position

936
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,900
It is 10.  A one and a zero.

937
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:54,990
 Now the one in the thousands position is 2. 

938
01:21:54,990 --> 01:22:01,500
 Now what is in the  hundreds position? The hundreds place is 

939
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:06,480
 Three hundred and now the rest is tens 

940
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,230
 And ones place. 

941
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:18,860
 The tens place is 60 

942
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,750
 The end, ones place 

943
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:24,850
 ones place 

944
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:28,600
 - Perhaps 3? 
- It's 3. 

945
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:33,290
 Congratulations!
 102363 

946
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,360
 102363 

947
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:39,960
  Congratulations.  All again.  102363. 

948
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:44,010
 Again 102363 

949
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:47,700
 There has been just one winner. 

950
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,580
 Mom said to have some of this rice cake. 

951
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:55,390
 Dong Ryong. 

952
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:59,090
 We're moving. 

953
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,030
 Hyung! 

954
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,140
 Come here! 

955
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:50,810
 I want to go to college. I want a tutor too. 

956
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:52,490
 Aren't you hearing the chant? 

957
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:54,100
 Of course. What do you see me as? 

958
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:59,000
 - Where... just every thing you say!
- What crap are you saying. 

959
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:04,880
 - Everything I say, you just chew me out and make a big deal.
- Hurry and come out. Let's eat together. 

960
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:13,090
 - Do you want some juice?
- You drink some. 

961
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,610
 Father. 

962
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:24,550
♬  I'm saying I came to love you for a long time. ♬

963
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:29,080
♬ The only thing I can give you is this candy ♬

964
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:35,710
♬  Why do birds fly?  ♬

965
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:41,610
 You can just eat what's stuck on your face. Stupid. 

966
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,860
 Hey Do Ryong Nyong, why do you think it's like that? 

967
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:52,120
 What should I do? 

968
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:57,130
 What are you doing? Are you waiting for me?
