00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,050
Aigoo.

4
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,840
Stop eating at night. Are you trying to fart all night?

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,920
Anyway, now that the holiday is over,

6
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,960
just thinking of going to work tomorrow,

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,170
I just want to hit someone.

8
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,980
It would be nice if banks could have a vacation too. Right, Dad?

9
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,110
I think I can live since I don't have to go to school.

10
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,390
You're a sophomore in high school this year. Just try dropping below thousandth place this year.

11
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,510
Younger Noona too. Younger Noona is thousandth place.

12
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,000
Still Deok Seon never passed (below) thousandth place.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,050
She's better than you.

14
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:20,010
That's right. Why, last month Deok Seon jumped up ten places.

15
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,740
You don't even know anything. Anyway, where did our 989 go?

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,570
Doolie. To go buy crackers.

17
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,750
Oh my, that girl doesn't even have fear.

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,660
Do you know how scary human trafficking is these days?

19
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,850
 What's with you? 

20
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,410
Hey you scared me!

21
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,030
Why are you following me?

22
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,640
What do you mean I'm following you? This is my house.

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,180
At least make some noise!

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,520
Make what noise? Who makes noise while walking?

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,740
Hey, anyway, I was going to call you.

26
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Why were you walking so fast? Was someone following you?

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,710
You, you, you!! You were following me!

28
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,550
Who was following whom? I was going home!

29
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,690
- Why're you like this today? 
 - Whatever!

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,060
- Hey! 
 - What?

31
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,860
Sleep well.

32
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,540
 Predator 

33
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:09,290
♫  I received a call from my friends whom I've forgotten  ♫  

34
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:16,910
♫  Saying that they're going to leave to somewhere far, come tomorrow  ♫  

35
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:27,460
♫  They say to meet in the alley we used to play a lot when we were little  ♫  

36
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,930
♫  Saying that they're going to somewhere far, come tomorrow  ♫  

37
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,310
♫  Riding the rattling train  ♫  

38
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,460
Noona, did you buy it?

39
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,110
- Here. 
 - Thank you!

40
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,410
What about Seong Bo Ra?

41
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,010
Big Noona? She's on a date.

42
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,500
They didn't break up?

43
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,660
I think she's seeing him again.

44
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,950
So it's her first love, right?

45
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,160
There.

46
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,080
♫  My sweet friends are running toward me  ♫  

47
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,300
Wow.

48
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,910
Noona, who sings this? It's totally awesome.

49
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,670
It's Radio.

50
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,440
It's Zoo. Can't you tell just by listening?

51
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,980
What's the name of the song?

52
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,500
 It is Zoo's "Hyehwadong". 

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,300
 Starry Night family, I have welcome news. 

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,830
 Starry Night, which started in 1969, has become twenty years old. 

55
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:44,290
 So this Starry Nighter had a very cheeky thought. 

56
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,480
 You're curious, right? 

57
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,270
 Starry Night and the musicians who enjoy Starry Night, 

58
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,210
 are planning to have a Starry Night Jam Concert. 

59
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,010
 Right now, I can hear the Starry Night family's cheering all the way from here. 

60
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,310
 I hear it even at the Yeoido MBC. 

61
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,020
 As this is Starry Night's first jam concert, some of Korea's most popular musicians 

62
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,760
 will be gathering to celebrate Starry Night's coming-of-age. 

63
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,630
 First guitarist: Lee Chi Hyeon. 

64
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,000
 And on second guitar: Lee Moon Sae. Wow, yeah! 

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,380
- Oh... 
  - On the drums: Kim Soo Chul. 
 - Oh! Oh!

66
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,350
 Pianist: Woo Soon Shil. On synthesizer: Kim Chang Nam. 

67
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,830
 And this person was really hard to bring. 

68
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,680
 On bass, he is the oldest of the Masam Trio, 

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,790
 Lee Soo Man! 

70
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,100
 Wow... There is one more person. 

71
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,750
Did you listen? Lee Soo Man Hyungnim is the bass. The members are the best!

72
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,090
 Starry Night's cutie-pie rookie comedian, 

73
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,980
 Mr. Lee Kyung Kyu. 

74
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,660
Hey. Rookie comedian Lee Kyung Kyu is going to be there too.

75
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,250
Is Lee Kyung Kyu funny or am I?

76
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,950
Seon Woo, aren't you going to sleep?

77
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,900
The floor here is really warm.

78
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,030
Go sleep at home. Your house is warmer.

79
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,870
No matter how warm it is, can you sleep in the teacher's room?

80
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,080
I'm going to sleep.

81
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,700
My house is a teacher's room...

82
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,400
How can the school dean be my dad?

83
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,280
 Anyone who is a big fan of Starry Night is welcome. 

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,950
 Now, let's meet on January 11th 8PM, at the 63 Building convention hall. 

85
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,300
 Now that I've passed on Starry Night's proud announcement, this is our last song: 

86
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,370
 He is the big brother of Masam Trio, and at the upcoming jam concert 

87
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,730
 he stated he'll play the bass with strong conviction. 

88
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,170
 He has briefly gone to America to buy a bass. 

89
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,790
  Today's ending song for Starry Night is Lee Soo Man's "Happiness." 

90
00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:00,910
♫  While closing your eyes and turning away from what should be ignored  ♫  

91
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:08,240
♫  While considering the days which have passed ♫

92
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,400
♫  While longing for happiness,  I let it go today again.  ♫  

93
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:22,610
♫ Even remembering the emerging of the fresh petals ♫

94
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:29,760
♫  While whistling, while flying toward the sky  ♫  

95
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:38,960
♫  Happiness is crossing the ocean  ♫  

96
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,060
I don't see him today.

97
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,890
What's going on, being absent and all?

98
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,440
Taek! Where is your dad?

99
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,530
Hello!

100
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,380
Where did your dad go that he didn't sweep the alley?

101
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,700
To Kimhae.

102
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,890
His closest friend suddenly passed away.

103
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,280
Oh no...

104
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,520
Taek, come over then! Eat breakfast with us.

105
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,770
I made steamed marinated ribs!

106
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,750
Okay!

107
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,800
Me too!

108
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,990
Did your mom go somewhere?

109
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,290
No, I want to eat steamed marinated ribs.

110
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,210
Is our house a Red Cross?

111
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,530
What is a Red Cross?

112
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,390
A place where you donate blood.

113
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,720
But, Do Ryong Nyong, why are you here?

114
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,030
Just go eat your house. You're family is well off.

115
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,340
My mom went to work early in the morning. And Dean is making curry right now. How can I not come when it's steamed marinated ribs?

116
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,090
How did you know it was steamed marinated ribs?

117
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,630
I hear everything from my room.

118
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,870
Your dad went to Kimhae? Let's watch a video in your room.

119
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,560
Ahjumma!

120
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,740
Hey you're here. Eat with us!

121
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,670
It's okay. I already ate.

122
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,420
Tell your mom we ate your stir-fried noodles deliciously.

123
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,610
Right. Starry Night is doing a jem concert next week. Let's go together.

124
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,260
It's not jem, but jam.

125
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,090
You're so smart, really.

126
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,190
Hey, but anyway let's go. Lee Moon Sae, Lee Chi Hyeon, Lee Soo Man, and

127
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,600
"Naturally, ddyong. Ddyong", Lee Kyung Kyu.

128
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,240
- I can go. 
 -What about you?

129
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,310
I have a competition.

130
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,420
I want to go too, but I can't. I already made plans—

131
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,960
Forget about you. Do Ryong Nyong, let's go!

132
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,180
I go to Jeju Island next week. My fourth older brother.

133
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,230
What is this?

134
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,470
Then I have to go with Dog Jeong Pal? We'll just go next time.

135
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,630
I'm still going though.

136
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,350
Go. You said you like Lee Moon Sae.

137
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,730
Mom! Where is the rice soup?

138
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,870
But Seon Woo, didn't you buy concert tickets for Lee Seon Hee's concert?

139
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,070
Lee Seon Hee? The person who wears round glasses?

140
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,480
Oh... How do you know Lee Seon Hee? You only know Chamomile.

141
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,690
Seon Woo gave me some of the tapes. When is the concert?

142
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,630
The twenty-eighth.

143
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,080
- But you can't go. 
 - What?

144
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,250
I only have two tickets.

145
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,550
Who are you going with?

146
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,630
Thanks, Seon Woo.

147
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,600
What do you mean thank you? But you can't go either.

148
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,220
I already have someone I'm going with.

149
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,440
What are you doing here?

150
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,370
Noona, go to Lee Seon Hee's concert with me.

151
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,570
I don't want to. Why would I go there with you?

152
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,660
It's just a concert. It doesn't mean anything.

153
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,590
But I'm still not going with you.

154
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,850
I've been patient all this time because I know you are a good kid.

155
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,630
That's right. Because you're in puberty, you can like a noona from the same neighborhood.

156
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,390
That's why I let you go. But I'm not going to be patient anymore.

157
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,170
Don't fool around. You're just my younger sister's friend.

158
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,350
You're just Deok Seon's friend.

159
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,140
So don't cross the boundary anymore.

160
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,050
This is annoying and bothersome.

161
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:01,090
♫  Please come back  ♫  

162
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,830
 There is a room for sleeping
908-8356 

163
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,030
 Episode 9: Crossing the boundary 

164
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,900
 Starry Night 

165
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,300
It's awesome! It's awesome!

166
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,960
It's the most awesome out of all the concerts I've seen!

167
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,050
It hurts! Please!

168
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,250
- Why are you like this? 
 - It's so cold.

169
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,770
Yeah, so why'd you wear a skirt?

170
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,230
You don't have any common sense.

171
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,050
How are you going to live without me?

172
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,860
- Why are you like this again? 
 - You live to poke fun at me.

173
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,450
If a girl says that she's cold, a guy should take off his jacket for her!

174
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,320
Are you crazy? Why should I?

175
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,030
Excuse me. Sorry, but could you take a picture for us?

176
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,540
Ah, yes...

177
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,130
Here.

178
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,050
I'm going to take the picture.

179
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,110
One, two, three!

180
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,170
Thank you.

181
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,160
I'll take a picture of you two.

182
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
- No, it's okay— 
 - Yes, thank you.

183
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,140
Can you guys stand closer together?

184
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,750
I'm going to take it.

185
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,500
Just a little closer, just a little.

186
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,800
Please take it quickly...

187
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,390
I'll take it... One, two, three.

188
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,370
 2015 

189
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,370
Probably, starting from here he started liking me.

190
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,650
Look at his hand on my shoulder.

191
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,340
Look at his expression. He's dying from happiness.

192
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,490
At that time, she was pretty.

193
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,320
What about now?

194
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,940
You want a mirror?

195
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,840
Hey!

196
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,550
What's going on?

197
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,930
Why is it closed?

198
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,670
He's a guy to open the store on holidays.

199
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,820
Seon Yeong!

200
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,670
Come over so we can play Makgo.

201
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,930
Makgo. Makgo.

202
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,220
Hit a Makgo.

203
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:52,470
♫  Some day this verdant youth will leave  ♫  

204
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:59,600
♫  Like a flower that dries up and blossoms  ♫  

205
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,880
♫  With the bright moonlight streaming through the window  ♫

206
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,850
♫ The love song of my youth is sad  ♫

207
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,530
How can this happen? 
 ♫  I grasp at, grasp at, the days which are gone  ♫

208
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,920
That bastard and I promised to go to Jiri Mountain.
♫ In an empty gesture when I am saddened ♫

209
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,080
♫  is it better to turn away and let it go?  ♫  

210
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,290
Moo Seong.

211
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,520
Has our time has already come?

212
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,010
Is forty-five an age to die already?

213
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,060
What is going to happen to Sister-in-law?

214
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,780
Mi Yeon is just ten years old. Ten years old.

215
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,580
Is there a sequence to death? Life is like this.

216
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,310
What happens if you work so hard, when in just one night you just leave.

217
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:12,660
♫ The love song of my youth is sad ♫

218
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,980
Let's see. Let's see. That's right!

219
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,890
I don't see Jeong Bong these days. Did he go somewhere?

220
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,320
To the temple.

221
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,950
To the temple? Why again? Is he sick again?

222
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,760
No. He just went to have some fresh air.

223
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,990
I guess he wants to rearrange his heart.

224
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,190
He likes temple. He's the only Buddhist in our family.

225
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,330
Still. The food is probably insufficient.

226
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,940
Do you know what Jeong Bong likes the most after ramen?

227
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,290
Vegetables.

228
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,680
He goes crazy over wild vegetable bibimbap.

229
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,550
It's not easy to gain weight from eating vegetables.

230
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,150
Excuse me, Monk.

231
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,410
I will eat one more bowl.

232
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,440
May you attain Buddhahood.

233
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,950
Mrs. Kang Man Soon!

234
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,770
Is Mrs. Kang Man Soon here!

235
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,370
Excuse me.

236
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,680
Why are you looking for Mrs. Kang Man Soon?

237
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,790
Are you Mrs. Kang Man Soon?

238
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,090
No. I'm not Kang Man Soon, but I live here.

239
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,260
You live here?

240
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,950
What's your name?

241
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,080
- Kim Seon Yeong. 
 - Ah...

242
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,830
What's your relation ship with Mrs. Kang Man Soon?

243
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,010
She's my mother-in-law.

244
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,350
Please sign here.

245
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,490
Here.

246
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,780
 What does this mean? 

247
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,600
 My house is being foreclosed? What does this mean? 

248
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,780
 When Kang Man Soo got a loan from Chohong Bank, she put up mortgage on the house as collateral. 

249
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,750
What? What are you saying?

250
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,730
 Because Mrs. Kang Man Soon did not repay the bank her debt, 

251
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,770
 she is auctioning your house. 

252
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,390
 The amount is 10-million won. 

253
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:55,210
 If you do not repay 10-million won by first day of next month, the court will auction your house. 

254
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,410
 You have some time so if you repay by that time, we will stop the auction. 

255
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,510
I mean, why am I repaying the money I didn't borrow?

256
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,320
Stop saying this nonsense please!

257
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,820
Who is taking my house without my permission?

258
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,550
Forget about auctioning or whatever. Please cancel everything!

259
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,700
 The owner of the house is Mrs. Kang Man Soon. 

260
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,630
 Since Mrs. Kang Man Soon is the house owner, there is no problem with it. 

261
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,950
The house owner is only Mrs. Kang Man Soon.

262
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,500
This is  my  house!

263
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,820
This is the house my husband left me!

264
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,020
 You should talk about that with the person who loaned. I'll hang up now. 

265
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,740
Hello? Hello?!

266
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,160
What is this now?

267
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,930
Mother-in-law?! How can someone be like this?!

268
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,890
How am I to live now?

269
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,130
 Then, should I let your brother-in-law live in jail? 

270
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,810
 Are you saying you're a stranger now? 

271
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,280
 That fool is dying and if he doesn't come up with the settlement money, he'll end up in jail. 

272
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,750
 Will you be at peace once you've put a perfectly fine kid in jail? 

273
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,700
Still, you shouldn't touch this house. How can you do this?

274
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,560
 How is it that you don't even have 10-million won? 

275
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,650
 Where did you spend all of Seon Woo dad's insurance money? 

276
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,740
 It's none of my business if you have dance fever or you're going around meeting men, but 

277
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,170
 don't forget that was the price for my child's life. 

278
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,790
 You're really lucky. In my house receiving my son's money... 

279
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,620
 You're really living well. 

280
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,460
 Anyway, I don't know. 

281
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,910
 When the house is taken over, send the kids to Hoehyeon-dong. 

282
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,710
 I can raise them much better than you. 

283
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,520
What is this?

284
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,810
What am I going to do?

285
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:53,250
What is this!

286
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,630
♫   I'm sure you know my empty heart   ♫

287
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,630
♫   I can hear you whispering in my ear   ♫

288
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,520
♫   Why does it make my heart cry so   ♫

289
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,580
♫   Why am I missing you so much   ♫

290
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,730
Ah, this is so hard. 
 ♫   Why can't I see myself   ♫

291
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,900
Wow, you really can't dance.

292
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,070
How could your body move like that?

293
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,200
You try!

294
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,150
♫   Why am I missing you so much   ♫

295
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,310
♫   Why can't I see myself   ♫

296
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,860
♫   I'm sure you know how I feel   ♫

297
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,130
Can't you do this?

298
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,350
Oh whatever!

299
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,040
Deok Seon, call Taek. If he is home, tell him to come over for dinner.

300
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,740
But still you should eat dinner

301
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,250
 It's alright. I don't have an appetite. 

302
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,290
Okay.

303
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,900
He says he's not going to eat!

304
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,440
He must be stuck in his room.

305
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,110
Leave him alone, Mom. If he wants to eat, he'll eat

306
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,840
 Don't go spilling it on the way over again. Tell him to eat it while it's warm. 

307
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,300
This relationship can be really bothersome.

308
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,650
Seriously, it's so bothersome.

309
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Where are you going?

310
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,760
You said you weren't going to eat dinner?

311
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,870
I want to cool my head a bit.

312
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,360
Is that for me?

313
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,410
Yeah, then come to eat with us at my house

314
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,900
Okay. Give it to me

315
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,240
Choi Taek, don't you know it's January?

316
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Why? What did I do wrong?

317
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,600
Aren't you cold? It's right there. It's fine.

318
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,920
Geez, I don't know if you're sharp or dull.

319
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,790
Come quickly!

320
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,830
Here.

321
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,770
Eat a lot

322
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,860
When is your father coming back?

323
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,780
Tomorrow morning he's coming back. He said he closed the shop for too long.

324
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,580
He must have been a really close friend, to close the shop for so long.

325
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,400
They were the Three Musketeers,

326
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,880
Dad, Uncle Tae Yeong, and the uncle who passed away.

327
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,060
Is that right?

328
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,440
- I'll eat well. 
 - Yes, do so.

329
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,830
Hello? Hey... Yeah...

330
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,050
Hey, what happened?

331
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,780
Oh, just wait a minute, I'll be right there.

332
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,930
I'll be right back. I'm going over to Seon Woo's house. Taek, eat a lot.

333
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,760
If you want to eat more, don't let Deok Seon—

334
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,520
I'm helping him. He doesn't eat a lot.

335
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,290
  Seoul Central District Court  

336
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,070
Your mother-in-law is too much.

337
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:05,220
They're her grandchildren. Does she want to see her grandchildren on the street or what?

338
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,600
She said she can raise them.

339
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,500
She said if I don't like that, I should sell the house and live in a smaller one.

340
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,590
What kind of person is this?

341
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,640
God, so annoying!

342
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,730
But where can you get so much money, 10-million won...?

343
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,890
You have to it remit to the bank by the end of this month?

344
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,670
By the end of this month, if I remit it to Joeng Bank,

345
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:35,390
the 10-million won, then automatically the auction will not occur.

346
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,880
It means for me to die.

347
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,670
I'm barely living on 30,000 won a month.

348
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,300
Where can I get 10-million won right now?

349
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,560
It means for me go and die.

350
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,840
If it's couple of million I can do something, but...

351
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,310
Last month, for Jeong Bong's operation, I spent a large sum of money.

352
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,880
Still, I'll try to gather some.

353
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,860
I have about 2 million that my husband doesn't know about.

354
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,570
Me too, I'll borrow from some people.

355
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,770
No.

356
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,400
Please don't do that.

357
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,780
I also have a conscience.

358
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,000
The money I've gotten from you over these years for this and that is probably about a million won.

359
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,810
This time I'll figure something out.

360
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:28,860
If I can't, I don't have a choice. I'll have to move.

361
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,580
Seon Yeong, it's alright.

362
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,800
You don't need to be embarrassed about getting favors.

363
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,430
It's alright to be downtrodden.

364
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,190
It's alright.

365
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,220
I'm...

366
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,810
It's really fine. I'll do this myself.

367
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,030
Hyungnim.

368
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:13,960
Life... This world is really unfair, don't you think?

369
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:22,480
Even if my heart were at ease living off you,

370
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,520
and I didn't have to borrow large sums of money,

371
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,880
and lived without being a huge burden on others,

372
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:40,840
what about my Seon Woo? He didn't want his mom suffering.

373
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,510
He didn't want me doing dishes and being a housekeeper somewhere,

374
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:51,070
so he never said one word about wanting brand-named sneakers.

375
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,900
He's a child who has never asked, at his age.

376
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:02,340
Where can you find a son like Seon Woo? He is like that because of the way you raised him.

377
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,160
I lived like that and yet...

378
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,670
I've lived tenaciously,

379
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:15,880
but still, in one blow, it looks like the three of us are going to be kicked out on to the street.

380
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,850
Seon Yeong.

381
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,830
Is life only hard for me?

382
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,250
Is it only hard for me?

383
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,720
 Mom, your son is here! 

384
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,520
My son is home?

385
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,570
You're hungry, right? Go and wash up. I bought some tangerines for you.

386
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,390
Okay! What about Jin Joo?

387
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,960
Jin Joo's already sleeping

388
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,610
You go ahead and sleep. I'll go to bed soon.

389
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,400
Is your wrist okay? I told you to go to the hospital.

390
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,720
It's okay, I'll go to the hospital.

391
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,340
You're just saying that.

392
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,710
Really, I'll go.

393
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,060
Don't worry so much.

394
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,570
Then, should I leave a tangerine in your room?

00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,700
Aigoo! When did you come?

408
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,880
Later tonight, let's have a drink!

409
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,930
Ah, it's already 6 pm. Faraway Jungle is on.

410
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,330
I wonder how time passes so fast on Sundays.

411
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:51,520
I am going out so you guys eat dinner and sleep.

412
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,590
You're going to drink again, right?

413
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,920
This person... It's not about drinking.

414
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,470
It's about someone who lost a friend so suddenly.

415
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,900
So I'm going to support this friend, but he wants to drink so...

416
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,470
You're excuses are good.

417
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,340
How can your excuses for drinking be different each time?

418
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,700
Wow. You know that takes talent, too.

419
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:18,350
I'm honestly just going to support my friend.

420
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,070
I will drink just one glass.

421
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,700
So you guys eat dinner and sleep early.

422
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,870
No Eul keep helping your mom, okay?

423
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,770
I wonder how big his scar is.

424
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,810
Goodbye.

425
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,300
I bet he's not in his right mind, either.

426
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,880
I'm here!

427
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,620
Hey!

428
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Hey!

429
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,860
Come to your senses!

430
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,130
Hey!

431
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,410
Come to your senses!

432
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,630
Mr. Choi!

433
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,880
It could've been much worse.

434
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,250
He scared me so much.

435
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,780
This person would've been in a vegetative state if you had been just 30 minutes late.

436
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,410
Oh my god.

437
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,050
But, now he is okay?

438
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,990
Yes. Fortunately he was found early, so there isn't a big problem.

439
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,960
Really, he could have died.

440
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,300
I heard surgery for cerebral hemorrhage is a major operation,

441
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,830
so I'm wondering if the surgery went well?

442
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,710
His blood pressure is already high, so he should've been careful,

443
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,090
but since it was cerebellar hemorrhage, it went well.

444
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,290
Thank you, sir

445
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,740
He will wake up soon.

446
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,950
We should still watch over him, but engaging in normal conversation and eating will be possible immediately.

447
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,870
His hand could start trembling.

448
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:17,770
This is just an aftereffect, so there's no need to worry.

449
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,410
If you take care of him well, there will be no problem.

450
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,210
Anyway, you are a life's savior.

451
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,770
It's really fortunate that you found him fast.

452
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,390
Aigoo, yes.

453
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,030
He is such a kind gentleman,

454
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,390
so this is all his fortunate luck.

455
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,230
Doctor, thank you.

456
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,790
Yes.

457
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,770
This is good.

458
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,240
Aigoo.

459
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,500
What should we do because of pity.

460
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,780
He doesn't have a wife, and can't get hold of Taek either.

461
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,390
Hey, you heard, right?

462
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,540
Alcohol saved him. Alcohol saved a person, I'm telling you.

463
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:10,950
So what if he said so? Hurry and give people a call.

464
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,470
- When are you leaving to the hospital? 
 - I'm leaving soon. What are those?

465
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,620
I made some white rice porridge. Everything else seemed too much.

466
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,120
They said he could start eating from today, right?

467
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,100
Yes, fasting ends starting tonight.

468
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,490
Really? Then next time when it's my turn I should cook fish.

469
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,450
Fish is better than meat, don't you think?

470
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,990
Our widower will be in luxury, eating yellow corvina and all.

471
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,870
By the way, Taek's father doesn't have a caregiver yet, right?

472
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,280
He'll probably not get one.

473
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,110
I don't know what he is planning to do with all that money he put away.

474
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,560
It would be fine just to have a caregiver during the day.

475
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,820
We can prepare the food, but helping him go to the bathroom will be very difficult.

476
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,070
It's because he is so used to being alone.

477
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,560
Taek would come by too, and he's a very independent man.

478
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,250
There's no need to worry.

479
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,300
This looks delicious.

480
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,150
- It's nothing. 
 - This looks good.

481
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,990
Aiyoo.

482
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,840
Choi Moo Seong? I will take your blood pressure.

483
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,550
Why are you sitting up? Aren't you dizzy?

484
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,020
Is your guardian not here?

485
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,740
For a period of time, your hands will shake and you may be very uncomfortable.

486
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,850
I do have one. I have a son.

487
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,320
Ah, the famous one? I heard he's very busy.

488
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,030
I heard he's meeting the doctor for the first time today.

489
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,270
Your father is a very lucky case.

490
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:07,090
Paralysis or speech impairment is a common affliction when a person has a stroke.

491
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:13,430
In your father's case, he was discovered fast, so there should be no problem.

492
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,970
The surgery went well, so he should be ready to leave the hospital in about a week.

493
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,270
Thank you.

494
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,300
The worst part has passed, so don't worry too much.

495
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,150
You just need to take care of him well.

496
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,170
Yes. Thank you, Doctor.

497
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,800
Also,

498
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,330
let me have your autograph, please.

499
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,140
Ah, yes.

500
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,680
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.

501
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,620
They said you almost died.

502
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,250
I almost became an orphan.

503
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,050
Your dad won't go anywhere leaving you alone so easily.

504
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,480
Everything ended well, so don't worry about me. Do your stuff well.

505
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,480
Hire a caregiver, Dad.

506
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,300
My arms and legs are fine, so why should I?

507
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,150
I'm going to China this week.

508
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,520
I won't be here, so how are you going to care for yourself?

509
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,720
The ahjummas come by once a day every day.

510
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,970
I'm fine, so worry about yourself.

511
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,300
But what should I do, Taek?

512
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,310
Director Lee can't go this time either, I'm told.

513
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,070
Then I should follow you to China.

514
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:52,210
It's fine. One of the assistant managers is coming with me.

515
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,860
It doesn't matter even if I go alone, either.

516
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,190
There should be someone to take care of you.

517
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,020
Worry about yourself.

518
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,230
Guardian? I request that you  take care of the hospital fees.

519
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,110
Okay.

520
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,450
-Yes? 
 - I'm here! Your life saver!

521
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,590
Go in!

522
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,420
It's been a while!

523
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,810
Aigoo! You came?

524
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,950
Is your body okay?

525
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,070
Are your hands still trembling?

526
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,940
I've gotten a lot better.

527
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,310
Mi Ran made you white rice porridge.

528
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,290
- Eat this with soybean paste stew. 
 - Thank you.

529
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,550
Ah, if you need anything, just tell me.

530
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:49,200
I will get you anything when I come back from the bank.

531
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,620
I have one thing.

532
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,040
For being my life saver, I would like to ask you for one more favor.

533
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,620
But why is she going

534
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,530
when there's Jeong Hwan and Seon Woo, too?

535
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,400
Deok Seon?! My youngest daughter?

536
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,090
989th place? You're talking about Deok Seon?

537
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:58,310
This time Taek is going to China.

538
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,580
I was wondering if Deok Seon can go with him?

539
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:06,890
Whenever he goes out of the country for competition, the director or I would always accompany him, but

540
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,700
this time, neither of us can go.

541
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,120
If there's no one to take care of Taek, he'll become a corpse in his room.

542
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,720
He doesn't come out, so she just needs to feed him.

543
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,790
Oh my... I don't think you're in your right mind.

544
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,370
She doesn't know anything. She is a total quack.

545
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,370
Deok Seon will do well.

546
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,120
Taek is most comfortable with Deok Seon.

547
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,760
Why not get Jeong Hwan or Seon Woo?

548
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,520
Those two are in their final year and they're studying—

549
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,050
Oh... That's not what I mean...

550
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,960
I thought it would be less—

551
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,010
Well... Okay, okay, what you're saying is right.

552
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:57,320
There isn't anyone else in this neighborhood who doesn't study other than Deok Seon.

553
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,230
That's not it.

554
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,420
I heard it takes longer for boys' passports to come out.

555
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,480
I heard it takes over two months.

556
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:11,690
But since Deok Seon is a girl, it'll only take 2 to 3 days to come if the club pushes for it.

557
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,840
So...

558
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,260
But if it's too hard you don't have to send her...

559
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,090
I was just asking.

560
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:28,560
No, it's not that... But I just feel bad for Taek.

561
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,480
Taek is scary when he gets mad, huh?

562
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,020
No.

563
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,680
Taek likes Deok Seon.

564
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,380
Those two will get along well.

565
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Taek will probably lose all of his matches.

566
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,790
Who's going to take care of who?

567
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,820
Deok Seon, where did you get that luggage?

568
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,080
I took it from Taek's room.

569
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,530
What about the camera?

570
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,060
It's Taek's!

571
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,640
Thief...

572
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,070
It's okay. He won't know. He's dumb.

573
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,910
How could you call your sister a thief?

574
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:17,210
 China, Guangzhou 
 Location for Asian TV Baduk Championship Finals 

575
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,930
Aiyoo, why do you have so much luggage?

576
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,530
All of these are yours?

577
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,830
Yes, this is the first time I've been overseas,

578
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:38,020
so I brought everything just in case.

579
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,410
Choi Taek's, 6-dan, friend?

580
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,350
Yes. Neighborhood friend.

581
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:49,690
Choi Taek has such a cute friend.

582
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,670
Girlfriend?

583
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,540
What? What are you talking about? I'm just a friend.

584
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,180
Are you also from the Baduk Club house?

585
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,710
Do you also play baduk?

586
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,130
They're both reporters.

587
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,900
Wow, your cameras!

588
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,640
This friend is an intern. It's his first time accompanying to cover a story.

589
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,110
It's your first time overseas too, right?

590
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,540
I went to Japan once or twice last time.

591
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,400
 Here are your room keys. You're checked in. 

592
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,180
Thank you.

593
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,920
We can stay in one room together.

594
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,720
This is for you Deok Seon. Room 403.

595
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,500
This is for Taek. Room 405.

596
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,810
I asked for a room facing each other, so it should be comfortable to walk across to each other.

597
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:39,030
This is Taek's room's extra key. You should hold onto it.

598
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,560
He fainted once in his room. You never know, so hold onto it.

599
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,790
Oh, okay.

600
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,300
This is your room key, 405.

601
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,820
We decided to have dinner at the restaurant down here.

602
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,370
Come down to the lobby by six.

603
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,170
I'm going to go up first.

604
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,210
I'll be going first.

605
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,300
I will come to pick you up by 5:55.

606
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:21,820
He won't come. He doesn't eat before a competition,

607
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,940
especially if it's a competition in China.

608
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,100
He can't digest nor does he have an appetite.

609
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,890
He's sensitive before a competition.

610
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:36,740
Excuse me. Do they sell tangsooyook (sweet and sour pork) here?

611
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,490
It would be delicious.

612
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,250
Okay.

613
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,120
Wow, what the heck! I can eat all of this?

614
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,790
Yeah, come sit.

615
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,530
Yes.

616
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,660
What about Choi Taek? He says he'll eat later!

617
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,230
I thought so.

618
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,000
Still, when his father was here, he at least pretended to eat.

619
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,420
This place is famous?

620
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,040
This hotel makes great food.

621
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,860
The ocean is near, so the seafood is great.

622
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,610
Where else is good?

623
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,470
I heard there is a famous fusion house nearby.

624
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,470
Ah, the place across the street? The sushi place?

625
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,720
That place is famous, but you can't go there.

626
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,510
Why not? Can't we eat dinner there tomorrow?

627
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:36,100
There are so many people, it'll take an hour to get in.

628
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,660
You eat well... You eat very well.

629
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,990
Can't eat because there are none to be had, that's all.

630
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,470
 Noona, who has that much money?! 

631
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:58,770
 That's so much, too much! Is she even a person?! 

632
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,720
 How can she put that house down as collateral? 

633
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,120
 Noona, should I come and flip everything over? 

634
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,780
It's fine. What good would that do anyway?

635
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,540
Anyway, you just eat well and drive carefully.

636
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,200
 Is it the time to worry about me? 

637
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,840
 Where can you get 10-million won? 

638
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,990
I'll figure it out...

639
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,400
And you, don't tell Mom about any of this!

640
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,420
Okay?

641
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,350
 Okay! 

642
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,560
I'm hanging up.

643
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,700
Seon Yeong, I made galbi (marinated beef short ribs).

644
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,850
When you go to the hospital, bring this. It's okay to eat this now, right?

645
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,370
Of course. I'll bring back all your empty containers, too.

646
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,850
Just look after Jin Joo for me.

647
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,690
Still, our Mr. Choi is hanging in there without a caregiver.

648
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,350
That widower is amazing.

649
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,190
Fighting!

650
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,160
I know.

651
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,170
Wow. It's galbi.

652
00:47:55,170 --> 00:48:00,480
I wonder if Deok Seon is doing well?

653
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,250
She's so excited.

654
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,910
Since I raised her strictly, there shouldn't be any big problem, right?

655
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:11,520
Maybe one or two small problems?

656
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,710
Bathroom BROKEN!

657
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,530
The whole night, the water was,  DUL DUL DUL DUL DUL!

658
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,490
I couldn't sleep at all! OKAY?

659
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:24,250
OKAY? OKAY?

660
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,150
The room is so cold!

661
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:31,200
I almost died of cold! My mouth went crooked.

662
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,890
It's something to fuss about.

663
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,660
I couldn't sleep at all either.

664
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,080
The sound of the bathroom water leaking was dul dul dul dul dul.

665
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,190
I almost froze to death. The window wouldn't close.

666
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,950
For a girl it would've been even more uncomfortable.

667
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,470
I think our entire floor was like that.

668
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,160
Then...

669
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,090
Aiyoo... So Master Choi's condition probably isn't great then.

670
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,890
They're being difficult to outsiders.

671
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,750
Really?

672
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,940
This is something that occurs often.

673
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,700
Master Choi's a little late. Did he sleep in?

674
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,990
The competition is on the 7th floor, right?

675
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,320
The Chinese reporters are probably all there.

676
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:41,100
Enough please.

677
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,170
 Choi Taek 6-dan Waiting Room 

678
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,940
 Choi Taek 6-dan Waiting Room 

679
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,090
We still have 30 minutes left.

680
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:26,290
Then, are we waiting here until then?

681
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,130
Before the competition he doesn't come out of there.

682
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,150
It's his time alone.

683
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,740
I'll go to the restroom.

684
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,320
Yes.

685
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,510
Mr. Choi 6-dan, please give a pose.

686
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:06,690
I'm sorry, but can you please go outside.

687
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,590
I'm sorry.

688
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,720
What did you just do! Are you in your right mind?

689
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,540
Aigoo! You oughta get hit!

690
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:22,100
Master Taek doesn't even drink water before a competition. The same goes for the rest.

691
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,740
This brat who's blood hasn't dried (meaning he's too young).

692
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,020
I'm sorry.

693
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,960
I'm sorry.

694
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,290
The competition is going to start. Please come in.

695
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,860
Thank you.

696
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,910
Hello.

697
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,420
Oppa. What's the matter that you called?

698
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:11,690
You heard from Tae Soo, right? He told you everything again.

699
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:16,550
Don't worry, I am already looking into it.

700
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,160
I know. I know that you don't have money. It's alright.

701
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,790
It's not like 10-million won is a child's name.

702
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:30,100
I know that too, that you have a rich friend.

703
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,940
I get it. I will try talking to him.

704
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,250
The person borrowing the money should be the one to personally say it.

705
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,470
I will talk to him so don't say anything to him.

706
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:45,360
It's for real. I will be the one to call.

707
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,070
Right, right. I understand, Oppa. Go on in.

708
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,940
Please come in.

709
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,300
Is it done?

710
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,950
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

711
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,980
I'm sorry.

712
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,030
Ahjussi, what happened to Taekie?

713
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,440
Blackstone won by half a point.

714
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,460
I mean, he won.

715
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,910
Then is it all done now?

716
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,770
No. Two wins out of three games. It's just the first game.

717
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:57,840
If he wins tomorrow then it's cleanly finished, but if not, he would have to go for the third.

718
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,780
Taek, you can get off. It's this floor.

719
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,220
Yeah.

720
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,570
Today's dinner is Korean cuisine. I will come and get you later.

721
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:29,910
I don't want to eat. Just wake me up at 7 tomorrow.

722
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,090
Okay.

723
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,260
He won't come.

724
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,670
What should I do?

725
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,650
What do you mean? He will probably eat something after the game tomorrow.

726
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,170
What should I do?

727
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,250
I think I will eat a lot, Ahjussi.

728
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,990
I'm so hungry.

729
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:02,930
 Seoul region's student council coalition and their entire delegation began their rally, 

730
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:07,520
 demanding the establishment of democracy in politics. 

731
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,120
 During the demonstration, there were dozens of injuries... 

732
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,710
Bo Ra... Did she come home early?

733
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,110
She came earlier.

734
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,860
 Tomorrow at the Gwanghwamun Gate area, five thousand university students from Seochongnyeon, 

735
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:22,720
 are expected to participate in a rally calling for unified membership in nationalism for the entire country. 

736
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,810
  Accordingly, the police... 

737
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:33,450
If that girl goes and protests again, I will shave all her hair off and put her in the temple.

738
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:40,860
But then, Jeong Bong went to the temple, right?

739
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,370
What temple is that?

740
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,880
It's a famous temple. A brand name temple.

741
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,150
Geez, you're an ignorant woman.

742
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:52,570
All temples would be the same. What temple is a brand name one?

743
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:56,070
There's one temple that's always on TV these days.

744
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:20,630
♫  In my small hand there is a candle, only if I can light up the night  ♫

745
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:29,890
♫  In my small mind, there is a candle, only if I can pray this night  ♫

746
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:39,020
♫  Let's celebrate the candle, we should celebrate the candle  ♫

747
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:47,890
♫  Let's celebrate the candle, we should celebrate the candle  ♫

748
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:56,720
♫  We should celebrate the candle, we should celebrate the candle  ♫

749
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:05,780
I wonder if he ate breakfast? The breakfast here is great.

750
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,120
I ate five bowls.

751
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,070
Very good.

752
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,740
Oh, here he comes.

753
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,420
He's here.

754
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,130
Sorry, but excuse us.

755
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:57,450
 Choi Taek, Rank 6 

756
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,670
Please enter.

757
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,200
Mr. Yoo, come in for a moment.

758
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,040
He's coming out.

759
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,420
Yes, I will bring him out.

760
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,050
Taek!

761
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,850
They said you can go in now.

762
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,360
Yeah.

763
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,830
- Are you going out? 
 - Yeah, to Jeong Hwan's.

764
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:35,610
Then can you bring the empty bowl on the way?

765
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:36,640
Okay.

766
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,180
It's on the table.

767
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,150
Hey, this.

768
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,420
- Mom, I'll leave it here. 
 - Okay.

769
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,690
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

770
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:53,270
Dong Ryong went all the way to Dobong-dong, and borrowed Paris Emma.

771
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:54,970
Let's wait in Taek's room.

772
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,600
Hey.

773
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,270
Wait. Wait.

774
00:59:58,270 --> 00:59:59,470
Why?

775
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,140
I will go and meet No Eul for a while.

776
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,480
Don't you dare bring No Eul. He's a total loose-lipped person.

777
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,180
Okay. Go on ahead.

778
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,110
Hurry.

779
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,470
Noona. Bo Ra Noona.

780
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,710
Noona is not in.

781
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,010
- Why? 
 - Huh?

782
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:26,950
I just wanted to ask something.

783
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:31,190
But then, where did she go?

784
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,680
To exercise.

785
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,520
She's going to be fine, right?

786
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:50,710
Of course. My sister is so good at running away.

787
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,020
Keep quiet!

788
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,150
Keep quiet!

789
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:04,180
Quiet down, you bastards!

790
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,370
Get in! Put your heads down!

791
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:14,480
Get In! Put your heads down!

792
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,930
Yes, is this First Real Estate Agency?

793
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:32,110
Th-That... Is there a house that is cheap these days?

794
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:35,450
At this rate, it would be nice if it's in Ssangmundong.

795
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,100
Is there a cheaper one?

796
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,830
Yes, yes. Please do give me a call.

797
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:47,960
Yes.

798
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,590
Seon Yeong.

799
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,980
It seems like you'll be the one to go today.

800
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,060
Mi Ran Hyungnim twisted her ankle.

801
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:01,550
- Did she twist it badly? 
 - She slipped on the stairs.

802
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:04,960
I need to take care of the meal for both house's men so you should go today.

803
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,650
I will feed Seon Woo and Jin Joo.

804
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:10,340
Of course, the youngest should be the one to deliver.

805
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:14,960
Anyway, Taek's dad called this morning asking to bring him his shampoo and conditioner.

806
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,660
Oh my, it's about time to wash his hair.

807
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,490
He hasn't been able to wash it himself.

808
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:22,390
He hasn't washed it even once since the surgery? it must be awfully hard to bear.

809
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:27,810
What do you mean? It would be like his usual style.

810
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:33,560
Why a wheelchair?

811
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:08,650
Oh right. Isn't today Taek's competition? Did he win?

812
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,430
I still haven't heard from him.

813
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,430
Thank you.

814
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,500
He's probably going to break his record.

815
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:32,010
Ahjussi. How could a person sit still for ten hours?

816
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:33,800
Is he a human?

817
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,430
He probably doesn't notice that ten hours have passed.

818
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,980
What the...

819
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:45,240
It's over.   You may go in.

820
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,590
Let's go!

821
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:05,470
Excuse me. Excuse me.

822
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,300
Ahjussi, did Taek lose?

823
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,280
No. He won.

824
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,310
Huh? But why is his expression like that? It makes a person confused.

825
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:14,520
That's Baduk etiquette.

826
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,130
You have to be humble in victory and keep manners in defeat.

827
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:21,660
That is Baduk etiquette.

828
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

829
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,420
What is that? If you're happy then you can just be happy about it.

830
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,250
How many are left?

831
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,120
Five?

832
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,130
Hey, get off.

833
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:53,350
Whoa. You're too much.

834
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,070
This is Nanjido.

835
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,630
Should we go to the police station?

836
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,140
Hey. Next, you.

837
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,420
Why are you speaking informally.

838
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,500
Do you know me?

839
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,010
 Baegyeon-ri, Gunnae-myeon, Paju-si, Entrance to Tongilchon Village 

840
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,100
Let's go out together so that I can get some exercise.

841
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,020
I'm not going.

842
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:07,230
I will go buy some carp bread outside while getting some fresh air.

843
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:11,900
I saw that they were selling it five pieces for 200 won on the way here.

844
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,830
I will go and buy some so stay here.

845
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,990
Is that Tae Yeong?

846
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:47,160
Right. It's me.

847
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:52,570
Aigoo. Seriously. What is this?

848
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,550
Why did you come? I'm fine.

849
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:59,410
What do you mean fine? Do you know how scary a hemorrhage is?

850
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:02,430
A person who knows that just came today?

851
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:06,760
I just came back from the factory in the countryside, you punk.

852
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,670
I knew that it would come to this one day.

853
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:16,030
A person who has a high blood pressure, as if he takes medicine or as if he controls what he eats.

854
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:23,130
In the future, you're going to take care of your health, right?

855
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:27,560
Moo Soeng, please live while taking care of your health.

856
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,800
Don't live just for Taek but live your life as well.

857
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,780
A life that's lived just once would just pass by.

858
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,740
Are you going to take all that money with you when you die?

859
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:44,250
Right. I will have it buried with me.

860
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:55,070
Punk. Since Jae Sang left, there are only two of us left as hometown friends.

861
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:58,140
So please take care of your health, okay?

862
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,800
Okay.

863
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,330
Stop nagging.

864
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:06,190
Oh, right. Moo Seong.

865
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:07,330
Right?

866
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:10,900
You... still haven't heard it, right?

867
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,950
What about?

868
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:15,360
Then you weren't told, I see.

869
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,850
What is it about? Who is it about?

870
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,120
 Boyfriend 

871
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:23,320
 Our house. House upstairs. 

872
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,640
 Wow. 

873
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,910
Eat a lot.

874
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,450
Yes.

875
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,430
 Neighbor. 

876
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:16,080
I ate so well!

877
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,190
I ate and got indigestion! Go! Go!

878
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:24,130
The dean has become cute!

879
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:26,900
- Oh my! 
 - Go! Go!

880
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:31,560
Seriously, where did everyone go?

881
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:38,000
 House up front. (Seon Woo) 

882
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:59,250
Don't answer. Don't answer.

883
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,730
 Hello. 

884
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,610
Hello?

885
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,520
Who is it?

886
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,390
Hello?

887
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:27,280
It's me. Bo Ra.

888
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:30,100
It's me Bo—

889
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,250
It's Seong Bo Ra!

890
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,570
Congratulations.

891
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:38,210
Congratulations.

892
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:42,350
We will have a congratulatory party in the restaurant up front. Let's go together.

893
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:47,310
I'm tired so I will rest in the room with my friend.

894
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:49,890
Well, you probably couldn't sleep for the last two days.

895
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:51,760
You couldn't eat either.

896
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,730
But still, being young is good.

897
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:57,720
How could you hang in there without a meal?

898
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,850
You have good stamina.

899
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:06,460
This time, I really ate well. I didn't skip a meal.

900
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:15,260
I also slept well. The room was warm. I was in really good condition this time.

901
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,960
Pardon?

902
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,200
You are saying that you a-ate?

903
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,840
Yes. Didn't you buy it for me?

904
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,740
Me?

905
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,610
What?

906
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:35,890
 Thank you, Jang Pyo. 

907
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:39,090
Taek, I made a fried egg.

908
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:40,970
Jang Pyo, thank you.

909
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:43,970
Very good!

910
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:57,820
  Japanese Restaurant  

911
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:12,310
♫  Today, from a forgotten friend, I got a call  ♫

912
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:20,540
♫  That he will be leaving far away tomorrow  ♫

913
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,290
 The bathroom is broken. 

914
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:25,090
 The water is dripping dul dul dul dul all night. 

915
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,010
 I couldn't sleep a wink. 

916
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:29,010
 Okay? Okay? 

917
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:32,380
 The room is so cold. I almost froze to death. 

918
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,330
 My lips got twisted. 

919
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:39,910
 My lips got twisted, I said. My friend, is South Korea's treasure. 

920
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:43,810
 If you don't change the rooms, an international conflict might arise. 

921
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,890
 Okay? Okay? 

922
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,760
 Change the rooms. 

923
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,520
 Okay? Okay? 

924
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:55,750
♫  So many things we have forgotten as we live  ♫

925
01:14:55,750 --> 01:15:02,240
 Thank you. 
 ♫  So many things we have forgotten as we live  ♫ 

926
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:12,230
♫  When we were young, this narrow alley looked so wide  ♫

927
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:22,260
♫  My beloved old friend runs to greet me  ♫

928
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:59,130
 Seong Deok Seon! 

929
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:19,280
♫   So many things we have forgotten, as we live  ♫

930
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,420
Thank you. But this is burnt.

931
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:24,610
It's burnt. Look at the color.

932
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,640
You can eat it.

933
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,560
No, it's burnt I tell you.

934
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,140
You can eat it.

935
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:33,540
Okay. Okay, then this one. Give me another one.

936
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:35,560
Give me another one since this is burnt.

937
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,310
You can eat it.

938
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:39,520
Okay. Okay. Make one more please.

939
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,820
- Come on, come on. 
 - Thank you.

940
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:43,820
It's good to have a friend.

941
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:46,400
She's better than your father.

942
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,440
Oh right. I will go and make a call.

943
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,880
You worked hard. I'm fine.

944
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,540
The ahjummas come to the hospital every day.

945
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:02,920
What about Deok Seon? Did you buy her lots of delicious things?

946
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,040
Okay.

947
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:11,090
Rest well tomorrow. Right.

948
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:14,620
Food? The hospital food is alright.

949
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:18,040
You should take care of your meals.

950
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:33,550
Looks like only thin people live in Gangnam.

951
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:36,430
Even the carp bread is thin.

952
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:45,520
Why are you looking at me like that?

953
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,480
Is there something stuck on my face?

954
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,280
Seon Yeong.

955
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:58,860
You... Why didn't you tell Oppa.

956
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:02,990
My brother told you, right?

957
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:10,230
Girl. We live seeing each other every day but I had to hear it from Tae Yeong.

958
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:14,280
 Oh right. Moo Seong. 

959
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,400
 Yeah? 

960
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,910
 You... haven't heard about it, right? 

961
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:20,950
 What about? 

962
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:23,380
 I guest you weren't told, I see. 

963
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:26,760
 What about? Who is it about? 

964
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:31,400
 My younger sister, Seon Yeong. 

965
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,380
 Why? 

966
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:39,110
 I... I was supposed to tell you, 

967
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:44,510
 but she said I couldn't tell you and that she would be the one to tell you. 

968
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:03,800
Oppa. I am just so embarrassed, that's why.

969
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,510
This girl! What's so embarrassing. I'm your oppa, after all.

970
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:14,450
I'm not even a bit embarrassed of how I am now.

971
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:22,530
Seon Yeong, as we live,

972
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:27,760
it's okay to be troubled and be indebted to other people.

973
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,370
Other people live life like that.

974
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:35,380
Don't live bottling it up, all alone.

975
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:41,010
I... To you...

976
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:44,070
I want to show you that I am living well.

977
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:51,180
What nonsense! You are living well. How much better do you have to live than now?

978
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:56,610
Seon Woo, Jin Joo. You've raised them really well.

979
01:19:56,610 --> 01:20:03,330
That alone is a great feat. You do things well at home. You raised your kids well.

980
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:09,560
And also... You take care of this old hometown oppa very well.

981
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:18,880
Seon Yeong, if you didn't call me to Seoul back then,

982
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:24,380
I would still be unable to forget Taek's mom and would still be drinking every day.

983
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:32,260
Thank you... for calling me.

984
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:35,350
You're thankful for all sorts of things.

985
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,070
 Hello. 
  Fall 1977  

986
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:54,350
 Is this Seon Yeong? Where is Seoul that I would move? 

987
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:57,250
 I will just stay here. 

988
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:59,210
 Hurry and come here, Oppa. 

989
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:03,680
 If you stay there, you won't be able to move on from Unni Min Jeong. 

990
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:08,550
 It would also be better for Taek to grow up in Seoul. Hurry and move to our neighborhood. 

991
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:12,710
 It's not like Seoul is a place for people to live. I can't live in a place like that. 

992
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:16,190
 Oppa. This place is better than Gyecheon. 

993
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:21,370
 All the people are gentle, too. Trust me. The living should continue to live. 

994
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:23,830
 Until when will you hold onto Unni Min Jeong who has died? 

995
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:33,510
♫  The more we did that, the more we put love first ♫ 

996
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:40,310
♫  It was hard but we were walking together ♫ 

997
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:45,680
 Are you Taek? You're Taekie, right? 

998
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:52,150
 Wow. You look so pretty. 

999
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:56,900
 You don't look like your dad at all.  The Heavens helped you. 

1000
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:02,460
 Let's go. Let's eat dinner in my house. 
♬ Someday a good day will come ♬ 

1001
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:10,280
 Hurry on. 
 ♫  Because isn’t that what life is about? ♫  

1002
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:15,410
♫  It’s about breathing together ♫ 

1003
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:22,350
 For me, the best thing that I did was to move to Seoul. 

1004
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:27,260
This time, if not for the neighbors I would be dead by now.

1005
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:32,690
I am troubling people and am indebted to them. I am sorry for that but I won't mind it.

1006
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:37,750
As I live, I won't forget those things and will give back to them.

1007
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:46,580
You too, don't try to do it all by yourself. So what if you are indebted?

1008
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,380
Here, it's 10-million won.

1009
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:07,380
♫   It was hard but we were walking together    ♫

1010
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:11,420
Accept it, my arm hurts.

1011
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:16,510
No, Oppa. I... I won't accept this.

1012
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:20,550
This girl! What did you hear until now? Hurry and accept it.

1013
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:26,910
♫   Some day, a good day will come again     ♫

1014
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:31,120
I'm not giving it to you, I am lending it to you.

1015
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,680
You can just repay me later on. Hurry.

1016
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:45,060
♫   It’s about breathing together    ♫

1017
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:51,330
And this one, I'm just giving it to you. 
 ♫   There’s no sturdier wall than that    ♫

1018
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:57,870
Fix your wrist while I'm saying it nicely. I already told the doctor in charge.

1019
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:05,020
Whenever you come to the hospital, you can just go and register on the first floor and you can come any time.

1020
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:11,180
Make sure you go. Understand?

1021
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:15,440
Tae Yeong came here not worrying about me.

1022
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:20,370
He came and went worrying only about you.

1023
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:23,090
Stop making your brother worry.

1024
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:27,720
And now, be indebted to others.

1025
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:35,660
And if there is something hard, say that it is hard. Don't live so rigidly.

1026
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:37,470
Eat some carp bread.

1027
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:46,770
Here. 
 ♫   It’s about breathing together    ♫

1028
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:49,860
♫   There’s no sturdier wall than that    ♫

1029
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:56,540
But you, how many did you buy? How many are these?

1030
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:57,890
We can eat them all.

1031
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:02,200
Aigoo. Even from before.

1032
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,880
I will eat them all. I could bring them home, too.

1033
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:11,700
Is carp bread in Gangnam any different? How many are these?

1034
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:15,960
Gangnam carp bread is different.

1035
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:21,510
Let's take a picture.

1036
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:23,490
- Picture? 
 - Yeah.

1037
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:25,640
With Taek?

1038
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,700
Aigoo.

1039
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,860
Deok Seon, let's go up.

1040
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:34,320
Taek! Jang Pyo wants a picture with you.

1041
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,560
Your name is Jang Pyo? You've became friends.

1042
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,690
Yes, we became close while fighting.

1043
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,720
Hey! Smile.

1044
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,790
Okay.

1045
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:54,520
One, two, three. (in Chinese)

1046
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:57,950
Thank you.

1047
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:00,730
Thank you.

1048
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:03,910
Stand, you two. I will take a picture.

1049
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:06,610
- Us? 
 - Go on and stand together.

1050
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:08,540
Go on. It's okay.

1051
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,880
Sunbae really takes pictures that are masterpieces.

1052
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,110
Hurry and stand together.

1053
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:19,440
Hoy.  I'm not pretty today.

1054
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,370
- You're pretty. 
 - Really?

1055
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,050
Your clothes are pretty too.

1056
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:29,440
- Are my clothes fine? 
 - Yeah.

1057
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,370
It's yours.

1058
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:45,110
Now then, I'm taking it. One...

1059
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:49,060
Two... Three.

1060
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:58,360
- Honey, when was this? 
  December 2015 

1061
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:06,280
I told you to wear warmer clothes. You really don't listen.

1062
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,860
January 1989

1063
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:16,450
Wow.  You... remember all sorts of things.

1064
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:20,410
This day is probably the biggest day of your life, right?

1065
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,360
Right?

1066
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:29,290
How could you exactly remember something from 30 years ago?

1067
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:33,870
So you remember everything about me?

1068
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,020
Are you senile?

1069
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:41,830
The date is written below.

1070
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:48,270
You're embarrassed, right? You should be.

1071
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:49,650
Water?

1072
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:52,620
Never mind. You shove it down yourself.

1073
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,250
 Village Bus 

1074
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:27,050
Noona. Are you alright?

1075
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:41,960
The bus has stopped running so I called a taxi.

1076
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,820
It's going to take about 30 minutes.

1077
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,720
You're not hurt anywhere, right?

1078
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,650
No.

1079
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,070
What do you want to eat?

1080
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:03,690
There's nothing that you want to eat.

1081
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,200
Never mind. Just order anything.

1082
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:10,560
- Ahjumma .
 - Yes?

1083
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,980
Can you give us two soondae soup.

1084
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:33,160
But still, the soup is pretty alright.

1085
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,330
The young man asked so earnestly.

1086
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:48,020
Thank you.

1087
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:50,860
Good times.

1088
01:30:52,770 --> 01:30:55,330
I didn't say anything.

1089
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,370
Seon Woo, how old are you?

1090
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:02,650
Pardon?

1091
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:04,590
How old are you, I said.

1092
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:07,670
Eighteen. Why, all of a sudden?

1093
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,160
I saw you for eighteen years.

1094
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:15,410
For those eighteen years, have I ever got mad at you?

1095
01:31:15,410 --> 01:31:20,050
I make a fuss to the others, but I don't think I have done such to you.

1096
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:21,730
Right?

1097
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:24,190
Yes.

1098
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:27,330
You are really kind, you know.

1099
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:33,160
You are kind, upright and smart.

1100
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:41,640
I like you as a person.

1101
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:48,310
In the future too, can't we live like before?

1102
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:56,070
I don't want to break this kind of relationship with you. You understand what I mean, right?

1103
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,050
I don't like to though.

1104
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:11,720
I don't like having this kind of relationship with you. It's meaningless to me.

1105
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:29,930
Let's go to the concert together.

1106
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:41,050
Not as my friend's sister, but as a man and woman.

1107
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,950
 A line means it only ends there. 

1108
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:03,870
 Keeping the line means keeping the usual state. 

1109
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:11,300
  It means to maintain the boundary that has been set for their world, rules, and relationships.  

1110
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:14,770
 In the end, if you don't cross the line ,

1111
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:21,370
 it also means that you cannot meet the other world and  connection. 

1112
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:34,940
 If you are dreaming of a new connection, if you are dreaming of a new love; you will have to cross the line. 

1113
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:42,910
 The keep the line means that you and I can only go up to that point. 

1114
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:47,760
♫   I can't avoid this passionate love   ♫

1115
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:56,270
♫   My dear, come back to me   ♫

1116
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:06,730
 Of course, there are lines in this world that should not be crossed. 

1117
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,530
Excuse me.

1118
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:40,120
Right?

1119
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:43,940
Right.

1120
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:52,240


1121
01:34:59,830 --> 01:35:01,560
That person!

1122
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:05,610
That person! It's that person!

1123
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:10,290
It's him! Right!

1124
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:15,370
Hey!

1125
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:25,980
 Throw these away! 

1126
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:29,860
 As it is, return them. 

1127
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:33,740
 It's so fascinating. 

1128
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:35,000
 What's the reason? 

1129
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,420
 I don't know. I don't know, he doesn't know, nobody knows. 

1130
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:41,970
 But then, I haven't seen Jeong Bong the whole day. Do you know where he went? 

1131
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:44,500
 Oh my! 

1132
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,660
 Okay. Don't move. 

1133
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,440
 He's not that kind of child though. 

1134
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,310
 So bothersome. 

1135
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:59,430
 Don't worry about it. 

1136
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:04,310
 How would you know when and where you are going to meet the man of your fate? 

1137
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:08,360
 Hey, of course I'm a man. Then, am I a girl? 

1138
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,900
  I have something to say to you. 

1139
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:16,210
 Me? 

1140
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:19,990
 Yes, just for a while. 

1141
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:25,410
 What if he really likes me? What do I do? 

1142
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:28,780
  You two look good together. Good luck.  

1143
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,080
 What are you doing here? 

1144
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,720
 I have something to ask you. 

1145
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:36,560
 You see...
