Of course it took a long time.

He wants to watch a movie with Deok Seon.

148
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,610
It doesn't make sense that the stocks increased to 1,000.

149
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,880
That means you buy it on your shoulders and sell it on your knees.

150
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,640
Stocks are on the head, shoulders, knees,

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,050
But, my friend said...

158
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,170
What were they? Samsung Electronics, Hanmi Pharmacy,

159
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,890
and Pacific Chemicals. He said I should buy these three.

160
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,460
How much is that right now?

161
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,980
I saw in the news today that it's 20,000-30,000 won each.

162
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,700
Wow. It's really expensive.

163
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,910
It did increase a lot.

164
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,900
That's right. It increased, but increased too much!

165
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,750
It is over. It is over.

166
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,270
I'm saying that stock can't increase any more.

167
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,680
So Bong Hwang Dang,

168
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,790
just put it in the bank.

169
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,480
Then I will make you a banking account with 17% interest.

170
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,220
Do as I say. Understand? The bank.

171
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,440
Yes. Thank you.

172
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,610
Where?

173
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,040
To the bank.

174
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,240
- To where? 
 - To the bank.

175
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,220
Hurry up and go. I'll get scolded it I get caught by my dad.

176
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,750
I'll call.

177
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,730
You know, right? If it rings twice and hangs up, it's me.

178
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,670
Twice.

179
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:46,030
Then, I'll see you next Monday on your birthday.

180
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,740
That day is the school founding anniversary so I know that you don't go to school.

181
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,670
How did you know my birthday?

182
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,830
Through mind reading.

183
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,290
What?

184
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:03,250
One day, I got to have an ability of reading someone's mind.

185
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,830
If you really love someone, I guess you get special superpowers.

186
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,000
It's okay to smile big.

187
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:24,870
You prettier when you smile bigger.

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,110
♫  I don't know why I'm like this  ♫  

189
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,480
♫  Everything in the world is beautiful  ♫  

190
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,810
Miss Man Ok, do you perhaps like shell bread?

191
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,110
What is this?

192
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,720
I just baked a shell bread right now.

193
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Should I give you another one?

194
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,380
I kept on practicing.

195
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,170
It's shell bread. Take it and eat it.

196
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,880
I want to take it.

197
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,310
You can take it.

198
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,140
It doesn't hurt?

199
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,990
It doesn't hurt at all.

200
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,310
It looks so uncomfortable.

201
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,310
 Her favorite color is yellow. Her favorite season is winter. 

202
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,320
 Her favorite food is fried bread. 

203
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,220
 She doesn't have a favorite subject. 

204
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,560
 Deok Seon, a little slower. 

205
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,090
 Her birthday is April 3. There's not many days left. 

206
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
 What would be good? 

207
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,330
 You can't give any physical thing. There is nothing she doesn't have. 

208
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,290
 A gift from the heart. Girls fall for them. 

209
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,720
 A present from the heart? 
♬  I don't know what to do.  My heart is just racing.  ♬

210
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,620
♫  I don't know why I'm like this  ♫  

211
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,750
♫  The whole world looks beautiful  ♫  

212
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:08,970
♫  My heart is inflated like a balloon  ♫

213
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:14,880
♫  I don't know why, smiling girls are all pretty  ♫

214
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,100
Hyung, today I went to the hospital— 
 ♬   Probably for me also  it must have been when I was in love  ♬

215
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,130
What are you doing?

216
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,800
Nothing.

217
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,250
Forget it. I know everything.

218
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,930
You're dating Deok Seon's friend.

219
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,300
Did you hear from Do Ryong Nyong?

220
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,840
No it's not. Do Ryong Nyong doesn't know who I'm dating.

221
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,710
I heard from Deok Seon.

222
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,160
Does Do Ryong Nyon know too?

223
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,410
It happened.

224
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,480
I'm going crazy.

225
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,350
What's with the origami crane? What are you going to use that for?

226
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,140
Do you know the legend of paper cranes?

227
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,010
Do I need to?

228
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,910
No.

229
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,180
But I want to tell you.

230
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:13,230
If you fold one thousand of these paper cranes, it'll become a real crane and fly away.

231
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,130
And it'll listen to the person's wish.

232
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,950
Next week is Miss Man Ok's birthday.

233
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,040
Miss— Miss Man Ok?

234
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,650
Why Miss? You can just talk informally.

235
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,600
That is a bit too fast. I want to take it slowly.

236
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,930
As a birthday present, I'm going to fold one thousand paper cranes and give them.

237
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,320
And I will ask her wish and will surely fulfill it.

238
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,790
What if it's a weird wish?

239
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,070
Still, if it's her wish, I'll fulfill it unconditionally.

240
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,220
Wow. Our hyung is a really romantic.

241
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,930
Give it. I'll help you.

242
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,760
Is that a crane, Little Bro?

243
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,630
I only know how to fold an airplane.

244
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,500
Who is that? Is it me?

245
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,500
It's me and you.

246
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,510
You said that you want to become a pilot.

247
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,280
If you become a pilot, I'll be the first person to ride it.

248
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,060
I will be the first passenger on your plane.

249
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,020
It's a combat plane.

250
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,420
My dream is to become a fighter pilot.

251
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,230
Since when?

252
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,090
 Hankook University Hospital 

253
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,590
It hurts. Do it gently.

254
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,780
Aigoo, such a wuss.

255
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,920
Honey, Mi Ran, I heard that National Singing Contest came to our neighborhood.

256
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,910
How did you know?

257
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,980
Yesterday, Dean— I mean Teacher Ryu came.

258
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,940
I heard that a lot of students applied for it.

259
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,400
I really have no luck.

260
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,550
My wish is to go on that.

261
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,220
Even if it's not to the finals,

262
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,330
I want to show all my talent.

263
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,820
My back broke at this time.

264
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:06,070
That's right. You used to practice with Deok Seon to go out with her.

265
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,220
Mi Ran. I have a wish.

266
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,880
Not Jeong Hwan's younger sibling.

267
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,520
Not that. Something much easier than that.

268
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,690
What is it?

269
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,470
Don't you dance well?

270
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,770
Go out instead of me.

271
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,410
Five years ago, you prepared so hard

272
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,950
and got food poisoning suddenly and couldn't perform.

273
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,170
You don't know when it'll come to Dobong-Gu again.

274
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,570
It's my wish. My wish.

275
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,200
If it's with your skills, you will pass for sure.

276
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,270
Forget it. You're sick, too.

277
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,860
And when do I prepare for it? Forget it.

278
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,070
You have a large repertoire.

279
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,270
There's nothing to prepare. You are going to pass for sure.

280
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,050
Apply for it immediately.

281
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,450
Well...

282
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,220
Should I do Yoon So Il's "Wonderful Confession"?

283
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,350
Good!

284
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,390
You'll pass for sure with that.

285
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,190
This is for free.

286
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,810
You're studying already? And going to the academy?

287
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,160
 I'm behind compared to others, so I have to hurry up and catch up. 

288
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,020
 Still, let's meet Friday night at 11 o'clock on the stairs. 

289
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,570
It's fine, Noona.

290
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,420
You have a lot to prepare. We can meet slowly.

291
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,220
 Forget it. While studying in the library, I'll come on time. 

292
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,900
Yes. I understand. Sleep well, Noona.

293
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,320
 Okay. Hurry up and sleep too. 

294
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,680
Yes. Sleep.

295
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,380
What? Seong Bo Ra?

296
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,980
Really?

297
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,870
Then you're going to be a judge?

298
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,900
Of course. She could be a judge, prosecutor, or a lawyer.

299
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,840
It's her dream.

300
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,740
Oh...

301
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,370
Then are you going to a temple?

302
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,030
Shut up, girl.

303
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,830
Is she going to go to become a Buddhist nun? And this is not the 70's.

304
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,060
These days, there are good dormitories for bar examinees.

305
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,040
Next month, she will move to the dormitory.

306
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,910
Really? What should I do? I think I'll miss her.

307
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,340
Then I can use that room by myself? Whoa! What luck!

308
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,700
I'm going to come home on the weekends.

309
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,960
You girl, later on...

310
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,860
You would be crying every night because you miss your Unni. Just you watch.

311
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,960
How could you say such scary words? That's never going to happen.

312
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,220
But, Dad, don't you have another white shirt?

313
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,010
Why did you buy such a small one?

314
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,370
It's about to burst.

315
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,330
My. What are you talking about?

316
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,760
This is exactly my size—

317
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,120
It burst.

318
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,810
These days, it's the trend to wear fitted ones.

319
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,480
- I'm washing up.
 - Okay.

320
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,300
It flew over here.

321
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,100
The button flew far.

322
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,210
 Mom, I will go to the study room starting April. 

323
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,920
 Mom, can't I go to an academy? All the other kids go. 

324
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,860
 Deok Seon, instead of April can't you start going in May? 

325
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,770
 This April we have the study dorm fee and the moving expense to pay. 

326
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,590
 All the other kids registered already. 

327
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,880
 And No Eul, next month I will get a bonus 

328
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,510
 so I will send you to any academy that you would want to go. 

329
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,780
 Just bear it for this month, okay? 

330
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,210
I will eat the food well.

331
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,830
You weren't able to sleep last night, right?

332
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,750
What's with your face?

333
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,610
That's not it. I can just sleep during the day.

334
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,000
But then, did you make all of these?

335
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,190
No. Seon Woo's Mom brought it over.

336
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,210
I just set the table.

337
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,610
Ahjumma is working really hard.

338
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,550
Can we just mooch like this?

339
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:37,920
That's why I am always telling her how thankful I am.

340
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,840
Just with words?

341
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,200
That... Taek.

342
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,750
You know...

343
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,430
Nothing. Go ahead and eat.

344
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,870
What is it about? Go ahead and say it, Dad.

345
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,930
No. You don't need to worry about it. I will tell you next time.

346
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,690
Eat all of that.

347
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,930
 Ssangmun High School 

348
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,500
 Lunch box 

349
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,350
You guys, did you write up your desired university and major?

350
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,590
The teacher said to write it and hand it in today.

351
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,520
I wrote Seoul National University Department of Law.

352
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,920
Crazy bastard.

353
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,380
They said it's 'desired' university so I just wrote a desired university.

354
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,070
You do whatever you like, anyway your dad is the one who will read it.

355
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,820
The way I see it, this guy just looks for a beating.

356
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,770
Yeah. These days, the teacher is more pitiful.

357
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,500
Hey, you know that we'll go out tonight, right?

358
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,720
It's only for today.

359
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,150
- Where will you go?
- Teco.

360
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,670
Teco? Tower Hotel?

361
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,590
Are they having a dance competition today?

362
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,710
Do you know what the grand prize for the dance competition is?

363
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,840
What is it?

364
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,580
Hyundai Excel.

365
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,970
Whoa! Look at the scale.

366
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,530
As expected the national competition is different.

367
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,560
That's right. I can dance a bit.

368
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,750
What dance? What dance is that?

369
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,700
Hey, who does break dance these days?

370
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,390
Is that so? I changed these days.

371
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:40,590
Ho-sa! Ho-sa! Go, go, go, go.

372
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,850
Go, go, go, pak!

373
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,420
Your dance is from the ancient times when the tiger smoked.

374
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,300
You are so obsessed with motorcycles these days

375
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,820
that you know nothing about the dance trends these days.

376
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,660
These days...

377
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,430
It's the hip hop age.

378
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,710
Why are you relaxing your arms starting from here?

379
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,600
Wait up. Number 13?

380
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,220
It's the last. You said that the famous kids would be coming today.

381
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,100
This area is usually controlled by kids in Yeoido.

382
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,130
But then, there's a girl named Kim Seung from Yeouido Girl's High who dances really well.

383
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,880
Hey, you also dance well. You'll probably be in the top three.

384
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,920
Won't it be hard? All the kids from Gangnam are here.

385
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,670
What's wrong with you?

386
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,350
I am Ssangmundong's Park Nam Jung.

387
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:43,310
- Of course. 
- Hey, Yeouido is bigger than Ssangmundong, you know!

388
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,880
Friends, do you know what I'm worried about the most at this stage?

389
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,040
What is it?

390
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,540
How do I use the Hyundai Excel if I get it?

391
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,280
First, I stole Hyung Eun Ryong's license but it's still a big problem if I win first place.

392
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,180
- Hey, it's starting. 
- I'm hungry though.

393
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,430
Of course, let's watch the first and second, then get ramyun.

394
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,730
Their levels are probably about the same.

395
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,760
Okay!

396
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,590
 Teco Night Club
Dance Competition 

397
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,510
You won't do.

398
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,010
Hey! If this bastard was picked to go first,

399
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,430
he would have been so embarrassed.

400
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:38,290
Hey, the number one... What was his name?

401
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,990
Hyun Jin Young.
(he introduced hip hop to Korea)

402
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,100
He comes from the US and knew the dancing.

403
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,170
And number two was also a Jin Young.

404
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,380
Ah! Park Jin Young. 
(JYP Entertainment's producer)

405
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,680
Ah! Park Jin Young, he also has an American feel.

406
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,460
Did you memorize all their names in that short time? Good for you having good brains.

407
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,570
Where are you going?

408
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,090
Taek's room. Let's go watch "Dirty Dancing."

409
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,050
What are you doing? Let's go together.

410
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,170
 Ssangmun Girl's High School. 

411
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,890
 90 School Year Entrance Examination Desired University / Desired Major 

412
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,130
Joo Yeon.

413
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,750
Wang Joo Yeon.

414
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,790
What is your dream?

415
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,050
Me? A hair dresser.

416
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,120
Oh my! Your perm came out well.

417
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,750
Unni! Your perm came out well.

418
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,530
Huh? Unni! Hey! Namgoong Never!

419
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,930
Wake up and look. Your perm turned out well.

420
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,380
Get up and look at it!

421
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,060
Unni, the teacher asked you to come.

422
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:15,720
She said to bring 4 million won for the three years you've slept here. I should pull all your hair out.

423
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,500
What about you? What do you want to do?

424
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,400
It's not asking that.

425
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,320
They want you to write a university.

426
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,070
I know that too. I'm just asking.

427
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,980
And... I need to have something to write to fill this up.

428
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,190
Aren't you leaving the country tomorrow?

429
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,680
Should we watch somewhere else?

430
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,790
It's okay. I can just rest a bit.

431
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,480
Sheesh! I said let's watch together.

432
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,680
Jeong Pal, if you'd watched Dirty Dancing instead of Top Gun last year, you'd have been walking the same path as me.

433
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,300
Seeing Hyung Patrick dance, you would say you want to be a dancer.

434
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,170
I'm not going to the Air Force Academy just because I watched Top Gun.

435
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,540
What do you take me for?

436
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,680
We saw you right.

437
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,900
This bastard wanted to become a soccer player like Maradona when we were grade school.

438
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,460
In middle school, you liked Michael Jordan so you wanted to be a basketball player.

439
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,010
Did I? Anyway there's no secrets in this neighborhood.

440
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,310
This bastard saw Top Gun last year, that's why.

441
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:21,070
If it was Come Come Come Upward, then you would have made a fuss about shaving your head and becoming a monk.

442
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,190
At least, like me, you should dream big.

443
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,090
Being in the newspaper? In the headlines?

444
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,300
Of course. I will become more famous than Taek.

445
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,500
Have you decided?

446
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,950
Yeah. I will go to med school.

447
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,160
Why med school? Are you going to follow Michael?

448
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,920
Mom's wish.

449
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:54,100
I don't dislike it and I don't have something I specifically want to do.

450
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,610
So unlucky!

451
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,290
You don't have something you want to do specifically so you go to med school? Crazy bastard.

452
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,700
With these crazy bastards, what...

453
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,090
I suddenly miss Deok Seon.

454
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,300
Deok Seon, where are you? Do you hear my voice?

455
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,890
 Korea University Hospital
Baseball fans you have waited a long time, 

456
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:17,290
 1989 pro baseball starts on April 8, for 420 games. 

457
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:22,790
 The opening games of this year are held in three places at the same time including the Haitai vs. Bingurae game. 

458
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,950
 The winning team Haitai's Seon Dong Ryeol, Kim Seung Hwan, Lee Sun Cheol, are still active. 

459
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,110
 Also rookie Jo Gye Hyun and Lee Gang Cheol are recruited. 

460
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,600
 So again, they are the strongest candidate for the champion of this year. 

461
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,160
 By the way, the weakest, Tae Pyung Yang, recruited new director Kim Seon Dong, who is famous for Bali baseball 

462
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,510
 trying to get out of the weakest title, 

463
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:44,250
We should have a bet this year, too.  A year's worth bet.

464
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,660
What patient drinks alcohol?

465
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,670
We will be drinking this all so mind your own.

466
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,410
Aigoo. It's okay. I can just urinate it.

467
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,470
You're saying dirty things.

468
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,250
And yeah, right. We should do 50,000 this year, too.

469
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,700
You lost it all to Jeong Bong's dad last year.

470
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,170
Because Haitai won.

471
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,990
Anyway, this human does not know how to appreciate the competitive world.

472
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:14,920
No, if you take Seong Dong Ryeol, Lee Sun Cheol, Kim Seong Hwan and not win, you'd not be human but stupid.

473
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,860
These three people are bound to run so much even if you place them in the major league.

474
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,580
Aigoo, that's why, this time, let's take out the winning team, Haitai.

475
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,700
Let's take out Haitai and bet on the rest. How about that?

476
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,160
For me, this year Pacific Dolphins would

477
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,900
cause a commotion.

478
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,240
Last year, they were last though.

479
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,780
This year, they brought in Coach Kim Seung Goon.

480
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,260
Starting this year, they'll make it to the fourth place in the play-offs.

481
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,770
They would at least go to the play-offs.

482
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:49,440
Hey, President Kim. Did you get a brain surgery and not a back surgery?

483
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,560
How could a person be so idealistic?

484
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,570
No, how could the Pacific Dolphins go up like that?

485
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,430
No.

486
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:02,900
I'm right though. I get the feeling though.

487
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,890
Then, we could just bet on that,

488
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,420
if the Pacific Dolphins would get into the play-offs or not. How about that?

489
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,530
- I will bet that they will make it. 
 - Me too.

490
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,480
Then I... They will not make it.

491
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,920
If I win, I can just get all the money then.

492
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,930
- But...
- Fine let's bet.

493
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,060
That's right! That's right! Turn once.

494
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,060
Oohhh!

495
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,800
Pam!

496
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,840
You'll be first place.

497
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,780
That's right!

498
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:59,120
♫   As I get lost in thoughts of wondering what you are doing right now    ♫

499
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:05,130
Aigoo! How could you not sing and just dance?

500
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,840
That's right. You should get an instrumental tape.

501
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,730
You should practice how to sing also.

502
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,990
Aiyoo, don't say things I don't know.

503
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,890
The key to the National Singing Contest is talent or dance.

504
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,190
What's wrong with you? Just like amateurs.

505
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,560
And also, Teacher Ryu would get me an instrumental tape.

506
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,160
I can just practice singing with that.

507
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,740
But then, don't you think the tape has been too stretched out already?

508
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,710
You must have listened to the song a lot of times.

509
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,370
Right?

510
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,230
I'll just buy a new one tomorrow then.

511
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,450
Why? What do you need?

512
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,480
Jeong Bong, that's not edible.

513
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:09,010
Mother, if you get it out after 15 minutes, you can enjoy it as if it was new.

514
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,250
Aigoo. Jeong Bong is so smart.

515
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,160
Wow. Seriously.

516
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,360
Then.

517
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,320
There is nothing he doesn't know.

518
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,950
And that kind of person took the test seven times.

519
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:34,450
He doesn't need to know these things, so I just wish he knew the correct answers to the test questions.

520
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,870
Oh yeah.

521
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,740
- Hey! I can't see!
- Move, please.

522
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:31,190
It's eleven. I should go home since night study is done.

523
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,610
- I'm going too.
- Me too.

524
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,960
Go.

525
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,760
We're going.

526
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,710
Hey! Why are you coming out from there?

527
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,780
You didn't go to night study, right? You played hooky?

528
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,470
MOM!!!

529
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,190
Are you a dog? A person? A dog?

530
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,490
Why would you bite a person? My hand.

531
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,860
I'm going.

532
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,260
Me too. See you tomorrow.

533
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,490
What is that? Oh yeah! Carp bread, a fat one. See you tomorrow, Special Forces.

534
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,630
Who are you calling Special Forces!

535
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,110
Yes, come in.

536
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,860
Hey. Carp bread.

537
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,520
Thank you.

538
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,450
Hey, did you watch a video? You watched a racy one again, right?

539
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:38,910
No. We watched Dirty Dancing. We didn't even get to watch half of it.

540
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,100
It's true.

541
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,570
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

542
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,090
Night flight.

543
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,330
Okay. Go safely.

544
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,360
You said it was on Saturday, right? Don't forget.

545
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,670
I will call after the match on Friday.

546
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,830
Department Head Lee and Assistant Director Yoo are also going, right?

547
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,010
Yeah. They're all going. Don't worry.

548
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,170
Why would I worry about you?

549
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,090
Deok Seon.

550
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,800
Give this to Jeong Hwan. He left it.

551
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,930
Anyway, he always says stuff about me.

552
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,390
I'm going Master Choi. Bye.

553
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,660
- Go.
- Yeah.

554
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,080
 Hey, dog Jeong Pal! Your wallet. You left it in Taek's room. 

555
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,120
 Yeah. Thanks. 

556
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,450
Chopsticks.

557
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,480
Sheesh.

558
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,450
She's not dead, right?

559
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,190
She's breathing.

560
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,020
But what is that?

561
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,870
This...

562
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,840
Tonic,

563
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,110
vitamins,

564
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,810
and medicine good for the eyes.

565
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,720
You guys have it. I have a lot at home.

566
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,450
Is your family running a pharmacy? Is your dad a pharmacist?

567
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:53,430
No. My dad bought them in case my stamina goes low because I'm now a senior.

568
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,980
He says that if one is low in nutrition then one can't study well.

569
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,720
Hey, aren't you over nourished?

570
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,320
How many fried breads do you eat per day?

571
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,640
If you won't be able to go to college, you would be in big trouble.

572
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,810
Don't all your older brothers go to college?

573
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,290
What should you do? Didn't you say you were 1300th place?

574
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:14,420
Hey! What do you take me for? It's not even almost to that extent yet.

575
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,510
1280th place.

576
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,740
This morning my dad said that I should anticipate a gift.

577
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,960
I get a feeling that a pack of tutors will come.

578
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,920
I think even a tutor would be of no use.

579
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,690
- Hey!
- Okay.

580
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,410
I made a big mistake.

581
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,490
I'm going.

582
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,340
She's just so disgustingly strong.

583
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,210
 Music 

584
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,720
Oh yeah! Music time.

585
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,360
Teacher, it's not time for Korean. It should be music.

586
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:06,580
  Independent Study 

587
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,610
Hush!

588
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,860
Starting from today Music, French, Home Economics and P.E. will be replaced with an independent study period.

589
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,660
You're now seniors, you should study.

590
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,110
Hurry and get your books and study on your own.

591
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,430
Kids, even though it's hard now.

592
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,180
You guys, when you grow old and have kids,

593
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,510
you will think how this time is the best.

594
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,340
Yes.

595
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:47,290
That's right. You won't know what I mean now.

596
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,800
How good this time is,

597
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,470
how would all of you know now?

598
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,650
Study.

599
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,420
Hey! Quiet!

600
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,720
Let's study. Please!

601
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,220
  Lee Seo Hyun 

602
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:10,910
Oh, so you're going to block me like that?

603
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,960
What is this? Did we learn this?

604
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:26,610
How are you solving it? It seems like it's my first time seeing it.

605
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,640
Is it a drawing?

606
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,230
Is it art?

607
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,140
 Always in First Place 

608
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:00,660
We had to bring a recorder today, right?

609
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,290
I didn't bring it!

610
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,160
  I brought mine. 

611
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,130
  Music 

612
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,390
You must have practiced a lot.

613
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,670
I'll just get hit once then.

614
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,080
 Now, next. 

615
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,020
I'm even tired of hitting now.

616
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,810
Hey. You should just sing a song and sit back down.

617
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,290
What?

618
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,620
What are you doing?

619
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,790
Teacher, I'd rather get hit.

620
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,870
My arms are sore. Just sing a song and go back to your seat.

621
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,670
Should I ask the classroom next door for a cudgel?

622
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:07,150
Sing! Sing! Sing!

623
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,750
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not expecting much,

624
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,700
so just sing a song quickly and go back to your seat. Now clap.

625
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,440
Taek didn't leave yet, right?

626
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,290
Yeah, he's studying in his room.

627
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,160
What is this?

628
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,300
I made some abalone porridge.

629
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,750
I got my wages yesterday.

630
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,100
I went shopping, and I saw some fresh abalones, so I bought some.

631
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,890
You should give some to Taek before he goes to the airport, and put the rest in the refrigerator

632
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:09,810
and heat it up in the microwave before eating it.

633
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,650
Feed it to him when it's warm.

634
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,210
We'll eat it well.

635
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,780
Taek didn't eat breakfast or lunch

636
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,570
and didn't want to eat dinner. I was wondering what to give him. This is great.

637
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:30,730
You should eat here too. Tell Jin Joo to come.

638
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:34,870
No, it's okay. I'll be leaving now.

639
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,660
Say there, Taek.

640
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:05,790
There is something I want to say.

641
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,330
Dad. I'm not a kid.

642
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,340
It's okay, so just tell me comfortably.

643
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,820
Okay.

644
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:27,320
I want a good friend next to me, like you.

645
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,100
Nothing is decided yet,

646
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,790
but Seon Woo's mother became a good friend of mine.

647
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,620
While we are friends,

648
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,010
I just want to spend the rest of my life with her.

649
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:06,430
Taek, but if you don't want me to,

650
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,590
I wouldn't ever make her my friend.

651
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:21,200
I don't want you to be uncomfortable. 
 ♬  There was always pain in our memories  ♬  

652

Then, this is just...
 ♬   Whether it was something which wounded you and me  ♬

653
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:33,050
This is what I thought by myself, 
♬    Or whether there were days  ♬

654
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:37,200
but nothing is set yet.

 ♬   Which we had to accept as they were so that we put love first  ♬

656
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,480
just wanted to tell you first 
♬   Although it was hard  ♬

657
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,270
and get your permission. That's why I asked.

I

663

 ♬   For  you to overcome the many difficulties  you will face  ♬

668
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,660
If you are happy, I am fine with anything.

669
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,950
Finish eating.

670
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,010
Okay.

671
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,400
Mom. What time is it right now?

672
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,900
Let me see. It's 7:50-

673
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,900
Here we go!

674
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,620
Hey, you're late!

675
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:34,470
How can you kid around like this? Grow up!

676
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,630
You're late too. How can you scold me?

677
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,920
Give it to me.

678
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,070
Thank you.

679
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,900
Hey. Can I have a bite?

680
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,460
What is your blood type?

681
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,320
I don't want it.

682
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,500
Here.

683
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:19,360
Taek must have arrived in China by now, right? What are you doing tomorrow?

684
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,820
Tomorrow? Saturday.

685
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,890
I could see Taek.

686
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,970
I hope Taek wins today. Right, Deok Seon?

687
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,730
What are you saying? Stop doing that to Taek.

688
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,820
Does he win every day? He could lose, you know.

689
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,630
He is going to win today, no matter what.

690
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,460
Give me your backpack.

691
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,170
Thank you.

692
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:52,100
You think Taek is good at baduk because he's smart, right?

693
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:57,840
Of course, that plays a role, but there is another reason why he wins.

694
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,260
What?

695
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,140
He's competitive.

696
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,400
That plays a big role. There are two people in our town who are really competitive.

697
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,580
Jeong Bong. When he gets into something, he falls deep.

698
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,160
Kim Jeong Bong and Choi Taek. There is a famous story behind those two.

699
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,520
Galaga.

700
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,770
Before Jeong Bong got into Bubble Bobble, he used to be obsessed with Galaga.

701
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,060
He went to play that game every day,

702
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,270
while fighting with elementary school kids for seats.

703
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,640
How embarrassing. I didn't see him for a while because of that.

704
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,360
At the end, he became first place.

705
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,520
  Galaga. One game is 50 cents 

706
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,300
  Two people can't play at the same time to cheat. 

707
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,100
- Your bag. 
 - Thank you.

708
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:18,110
Then one day. I went to the arcade and  written big,

709
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,560
a different name was posted in first place.

710
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,350
Clearly the night before that Hyung Jeong Bong had earned first place.

711
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,860
So  he went at dawn of the next day.

712
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:37,590
  First: 929890 C. T.  
 Second:  899880 J. B.   

713
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,580
 Dae Gwang Computer Game Store 

714
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,960
"C. T."?

715
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:34,080
When Taek has free time, he  really  has free time.  Then I guess he must have had a lot of time.

716
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:40,370
That day.  It was the finals of the Gooksoojeon Competition.

717
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,920
Crazy bastard.

718
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,400
Me? Me?

719
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,420
It's not, right?

720
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,990
Yeah. Choi Taek.

721
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,300
He is a crazy bastard.  Even if he dies, he can't be in second place. Spiteful kid.

722
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:55,820
What do you mean spiteful?  He's just a child.

723
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:00,970
Anyway, Taek will definitely win today.  He has formed a goal.

724
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,750
Because he has a goal, he is going to win today no matter what.

725
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,660
Wait and see.

726
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:14,380
 Hailun Hotel, Shanghai, China 
Finals of  the Fifth ING Trophy 3 country Competition 

727
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,380
Still, I'm thankful for Teacher Ryoo He even obtained the instrumental tape.

728
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,320
I'm grateful but if I lose to Teacher Ryoo's son, how will we live in this neighborhood. It'll be so embarrassing.

729
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,450
Ryoo Dong Ryong is participating too?

730
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:02,120
He is going sing a pop song.

731
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,850
Don't you even worry.

732
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:09,350
The National Singing competition is all about the dance. Pop song is a joke.

733
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:14,700
Don't you worry. You will definitely beat  Salamander (  in Korean Dorongnyong ). It will be over.

734
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,230
Neon~

735
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,900
Again. Again. Once again you lost it.

736
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,700
You should listen correctly and begin.

737
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,950
That was about right.

738
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:51,740
No, it wasn't. You must match the beat, no matter what.

739
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:56,200
Mi Ran, it's here. I got the signal. Signal.

740
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,640
Gosh...

741
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,910
- Is it urgent? Does it feel like it's going to come out? 
 - It feels like it's going to come out.

742
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,230
Oh boy.

743
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:09,870
Ow... please...

744
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:13,620
  Bongwongdang  

745
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,160
You're here.

746
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,290
Aigoo, Oppa. Alright, give her to me.

747
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:38,290
It's alright. I'll take her. Let's go.  I'll put her to bed.

748
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,110
Did Taek call?

749
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,930
He hasn't yet. He'll probably call soon. Go on inside.

750
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:12,670
You should get going.

751
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:18,680
Ah...Seon Yeong.

752
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,290
Yes, what is it?

753
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,590
Never mind. It's alright.

754
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,680
I'll be going.

755
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,380
Mi Ran, my teeth!

756
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:23,030
Your tape is stretched out. You must've heard it so many times.

757
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:27,620
What are you going to do? Isn't tomorrow the preliminary audition? Where will you get a new one?

758
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,280
Stay here.

759
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,570
Yeah, yeah... yeah...

760
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,140
This is basic.

761
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:55,480
Wow... I live with a genius.

762
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,110
Go inside. I put the mat down.

763
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:00,790
No, no. I'm going to sleep after watching the late night news.

764
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:05,500
Isn't today ING Cup World Baduk Championship finals for Taek?

765
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,150
Hello?

766
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:55,030
 It's me, Man Ok. 

767
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:57,860
Yes, I know.

768
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,790
Did your night study end well?

769
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:04,070
 Yes. Deok Seon already came home, right? 

770
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:08,670
I don't know. She probably is. I don't care.

771
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:09,840
 What did you say? 

772
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,650
Nothing.

773
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:15,540
Is your father asleep? Is it alright to talk?

774
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,200
 Yes, he just left for work. 

775
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,990
 No. He has an appointment so he went out. 

776
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:26,580
- You didn't forget our appointment for Monday, right?
 - Yes. 

777
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:32,410
Man Ok, I will wait at the bus stop in front of your house with a happy heart.

778
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:37,840
 I think I would be late since it's my birthday and I would need to eat breakfast and spend time with my family. 

779
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,130
 Hello! Who is this bastard! 

780
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,210
 Dad! 

781
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,480
 -I'm back from school.
- Mom, I'm home. 

782
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,750
 - I'm home.
- I am home and the Dean too. 

783
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,500
 Be quiet! I'm not the Dean anymore, punk! 

784
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,830
 Yes. Yes. 

785
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,280
Oh my.

786
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,170
Wow.

787
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,220
It's already April. April.

788
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:31,120
Anyway, Bo Ra still hasn't come home?

789
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:36,080
These days, she studies in the library until past 12 midnight.

790
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,470
Going home late... This would be the last time.

791
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:47,160
Oh right. You, come home directly after your work in the bank.

792
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,400
Still, you should see her leave the house.

793
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,840
This person, it's not like Bo Ra is going to emigrate. She's just going to a  study dorm.

794
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,770
Why are you annoying people?

795
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:05,620
And I am busy in the bank tomorrow. I might not see her, just so you know.

796
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,890
With just that.

797
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,650
Mom, you even bought new blankets?

798
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:15,110
Yeah. Of course. She's going to live on her own now.

799
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:22,210
If it would be as I want, I would want to go eat out and give her some tonics.

800
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,880
Sheesh. But did he win or not? There's not even a call.

801
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:36,170
It is finished. You can go inside.

802
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:46,780
Who's the winner? Choi Taek? Or Chang Hao?

803
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:54,130
Congratulations. Korea won this time too.

804
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,840
Choi Taek, 6-dan, won.

805
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,700
Oh right! He won. right?

806
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,510
- Yeah. 
 -Thank you.

807
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:07,530
Condition wasn't bad

808
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,330
I mixed fighting method and psychological method.

809
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,600
 Finally, Choi Taek 6-dan has won in the completion of ING Cup.  

810
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:19,380
 The ING Cup Finals held in Shanghai, China 

811
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:25,860
 Korean 6-dan Choi Taek won the championship after three wins in a row against 9-dan Chinese Chang Hao. 

812
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:29,340
 The two finalists' game was a close fight from the beginning. 

813
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:36,410
 At first Choi Taek was at a disadvantage in a game which see-sawed.  In a decisive attack the stones spread  ...  

814

Noona. It's okay. Why are you running?

828
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:39,050
I'm really okay.

829
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,660
I said I'm okay.

830
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:09,420
Honey! Mi Ran!

831
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,600
Should I tag along?

832
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:23,990
Where will you tag along with that back? You stay home for a while. I'll be back.

833
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:29,280
Dear, even if you get disqualified you can't run off somewhere just because you're embarrassed.

834
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:34,950
Come home right away. I would need to poop. And eat too.

835
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:38,910
I can't live without you.

836
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:41,100
Okay.

837
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:45,340
Hyungnim! Are you ready? Let's go together.

838
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:48,160
Yes, come in!

839
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,130
Aigoo. Jeong Bong's dad.

840
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:53,540
Hyungnim, let's hurry on. I will be your manager today.

841
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:56,590
There's still time. And I need to do my makeup, too.

842
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:58,560
 Egg is here. 

843
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,160
The eggs are here. I need to buy some.

844
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,240
Wait a minute.  Let's go together.

845
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:09,720
 We also have boiled eggs. 

846
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,980
Money. Thank you.

847
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:15,480
 One egg 70 won. One tray 2,000 won.  
Goodness. Today you put the makeup on so skillfully.

848
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,560
I will come again.

849
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,600
- Ahjussi. 
 - Yes, welcome.

850
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,360
Give us a tray of eggs too.

851
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,190
Divide it in three bags please.

852
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,140
I will drink this well.

853
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:33,230
You're going to buy for us three?

854
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:37,620
Let's see.

855
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:42,100
Aigoo, Ahjussi. Change your tape, you earn a lot.

856
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,740
It's all stretched.

857
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:49,330
I have money but I don't have time. When would I find a time to record this again?

858
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:52,120
Why would you record it again.

859
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,140
Give it to me. I will handle it for you.

860
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,400
Aha!

861
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:05,810
Just wait for 15 minutes.

862
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:10,800
Then it would come out like fresh egg and sound fresh.

863
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,390
Really? That's really interesting.

864
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:16,460
I also found this out earlier.

865
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:20,310
Ahjussi. You saved money.

866
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:25,630
Then, while the tape is in the refrigerator I will go and sell some eggs.

867
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:28,190
Yes, go ahead.

868
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,930
Hyungnim, hurry, It's already late.

869
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,630
Aigoo, look at the time.

870
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:38,320
Let's go. Go.

871
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,000
I think I would look old.
- Aigoo, Hyungnim.
- I want to look fresh.

872
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,500
This is too lady-like.

873
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,760
Of course it's a lady.

874
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,620
Aigoo. Just wear anything. You look pretty whatever you wear.

875
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:01,470
I'm giving you a tray for free.

876
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:05,180
It's okay. A tray is expensive.

877
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:08,720
No. I'm rich with eggs.

878
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:12,450
Ahjussi! Your tape! You should take your tape.

879
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:15,260
Oh right! Where are my senses.

880
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,100
Seriously.

881
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,920
Thank you! Ahjummoni, may you be showered with luck!

882
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,060
- Go on. 
 - Bye.

883
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,580
This is too young lady like.

884
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,630
 National Singing Contest Preliminaries 

885
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:41,320
 KBS National Singing Contest (Do Bong district) 

886
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,350
 Preliminaries: April. 1 

887
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,310
Over here! Here, here!

888
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:59,350
Who is he?

889
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:02,450
Salamander! He's right before us.

890
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:06,100
Wow... it's hard for me to even recognize him.

891
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,050
Hello!

892
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:35,990
Chiquilla mía, somos como el temporal

893
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:42,900
Um... Next up is... Let's see, here.

894
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:48,580
Numbers 81 to 90! Those ten people, please come in.

895
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:54,410
I'm only saying this once! Numbers 81 to 90!

896
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,410
I'm so nervous.

897
01:13:57,410 --> 01:14:01,170
Hey, what about your instrumental track?

898
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,550
They have a pianist.

899
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:06,330
That's not very exciting, though!

900
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:09,830
Why isn't the person before you here? Number 92,  Right?

901
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:12,690
I wonder that too. Maybe they gave up?

902
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:24,680
 My dad, the dean.... and my mom, the Insurance Queen, yeah! 

903
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:29,160
Wow, you're so good! You'll go to the next round, for sure.

904
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,590
You really sing like a Westerner.

905
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:37,480
 It's not too late... If you'll come back to my side... 

906
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:46,030
 I'll love you... forever! 

907
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:54,340
You don't need to come out, Mom. I told you, don't.

908
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:58,400
Still, I still need to see you off.

909
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,530
- It's cold though!
- I can do what I want.

910
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:05,010
Hurry up and go inside. It's not like I'm doing something amazing.

911
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:06,550
I'm just going to speed away, all right?

912
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:07,860
Alright, alright. Hurry, go.

913
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:12,960
Oh, yeah. Also, your dad has a lot of work at the bank today. So he called me to tell me that before.

914
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,960
It's fine. Dad doesn't need to come.

915
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,110
I'm off.

916
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:19,460
I'll call often.

917
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,870
Sure you will!

918
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:24,290
Okay.

919
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:27,340
We can't call you, so make sure you do call us.

920
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:30,280
You don't have to call every day,

921
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,310
but call at least once a week. Okay?

922
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:34,960
Okay. I'll be going now.

923
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,160
Okay. Take care of yourself!

924
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:18,530
Mom, she's not going far.

925
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,500
Why are you acting like this?

926
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,840
What about Dad? He said he'd be late, even though it's Saturday?

927
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:35,290
He seemed to be really busy at work.

928
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:39,950
It would have been nice if he could have come home early on a day like today.

929
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:14,920
What are you doing here?

930
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,680
No, no... no need to get out.

931
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,960
This...

932
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,730
 For when your head hurts 

933
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:38,090
 For when you get body aches 

934
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,980
 When you have a bad cold 

935
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:53,950
♫  My dear, don’t you worry about a thing ♫ 

936
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:59,370
They sell medicine over there too! There's a pharmacy in Sillim-dong too!
♫  Let’s all sing together ♫ 

937
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,530
♫  All of your painful memories ♫ 

938
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:07,850

♫  Just bury them deep in your heart ♫ 

940
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:21,650
Buy and eat meat for yourself once in a while. It's not much.

941
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:26,330
Don't buy crappy 500 won cafeteria meals.
♫  Just let the past be the past. It’s meaningful in that way ♫ 

942
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:28,790

945
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:46,270
Dad, you go first.

946
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:50,400
Hurry up and go!

947
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,850
♫  Just let the past be the past ♫ 

948

Next up is you! Good luck, Salamander!

965
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:38,160
I guess number 92 really isn't here.

966
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,020
I guess they ran off. Even us, professionals, get butterflies after all.

967
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,870
How could they compete?

968
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:45,150
Yes, good work.

969
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:51,390
Okay... Next, number 92. Please step forward.

970
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,690
Number 92? You're not here?

971
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:58,210
They're not here. They ran off!

972
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:01,060
Over here. I'm here!

973
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:14,190
OMG. He looks like he's amazing at singing.

974
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:16,080
I wonder what song he'll sing.

975
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,420
A trot song, probably. It has to be a trot song.

976
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:22,750
Please tell us your name, and the song you'll be singing.

977
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:28,130
I'm Stevie Greg. I teach English

978
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:31,960
at a cram school in Banghakdong.

979
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:37,780
And I'll be singing Stevie Wonder's "I Just Called to Say I Love You."

980
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,600
Please, go ahead.

01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:19,090
May you be healthy.

984
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,240
Come back in.

985
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,630

01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,470
  Is anyone here? 

987

The door is open! Come in.

988
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:48,930
Is your wife here?

989
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:51,420
What's the problem?

990
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,410
Oh, well...

991
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:56,520
It seems like our tapes got switched.

992
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,380
What?

993
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:07,330
Hello.

994
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:13,330
I'm Jeong Bong's mother from Ssangmun. I'm Ra Mi Ran, a singing cheetah.

995
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:14,910
You are ready, right?

996
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:18,370
Yes. I'll start now.

997
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:50,110
  The eggs are here. The thick and fresh eggs are here. 

998
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:54,900
  We have eggs as well. 

999
01:23:54,900 --> 01:24:00,230
  The thick and fresh eggs are here. 

1000
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:03,380
  Eggs are here. 

1001
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:07,870
  We have eggs as well. 

1002
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:10,930
You worked hard. Next!

1003
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:13,710
No, no. I didn't go yet.

1004
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:18,690
How are you going to perform without the tape?

1005
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:23,410
It says here that you will be singing Yoon Soo Il's "Wonderful Confessional".

1006
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:27,040
I can do it! I can.

1007
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:44,460
You worked hard.

1008
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:48,950
♫ In the flaming street

1009
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:55,010
♫ Under the streetlight, you and I met

1010
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:59,540
♫ What are you doing right now?

1011
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:02,030
♫ I keep thinking

1012
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:06,520
♫ I miss that day

1013
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,510
♫ The burning eyes

1014
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:14,550
♫ Those dry lips

1015
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:17,990
  Don't Sleep Library 

1016
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,210
Hey. Let's go out.

1017
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:05,140
- Where?
- To play soccer.

1018
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:08,050
At this time? The field is locked.

1019
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:10,320
I know the back entrance to the  Yoogok Training Center..

1020
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,850
Just come out quickly.

1021
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:17,740
Hey. Come out.

1022
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,740
  Self-remedy for hemorrhoid and constipation  

1023
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:34,860
Did everyone from this neighborhood get disqualified?

1024
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:42,190
You got disqualified. Do Ryong Nyong got disqualified. Everyone got disqualified then.

1025
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,350
One person passed.

1026
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:48,170
Who?

1027
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:55,490
You can never judge a person. I didn't know he had that kind of skill.

1028
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,860
- No Eul. 
- What?

1029
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:05,480
No Eul passed. Even by singing a ballad.

1030
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:12,020
No Eul can sing?

1031
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,020
That's right.

1032
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:23,040
There is one person left, right?

1033
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,220
Yes. One last person.

1034
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:29,860
There was an issue because he applied on-site but because we didn't have any ballad today,

1035
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:34,980
I just let told him to come.   He seems to be quite old as well. I will tell him to come in.

1036
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:37,190
  I see. 

1037

Hey, can I not study? Am I not allowed to come here?

You didn't meet Taek? You guys decided to watch a movie together.

Taek said he can't come because he has an important appointment. He said he'll come tomorrow.

I'm leaving now.

Nothing ever works out in my life.

Taek normally won't do that. What's up with him?

I don't know.

Yeah. I have to go.
