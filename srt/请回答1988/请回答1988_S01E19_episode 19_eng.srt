00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,760
Who was the first to ask to date?
 2016 January 

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,930
That is...

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,800
Bit by bit?  Without realizing it, the relationship was gradual.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,410
Do you have to say that?

8
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,350
Yeah. That's how it is nowadays.

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,010
Before they ask to date outright,

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,390
no matter how you kiss and hold hands that's just called "some."

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,330
They even kissed?

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,100
That's how it is. I heard it from the kids.

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,870
Heol (Wow).

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,030
- You know how to say those words too? 
- I also heard it from the kids.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,120
Seriously.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,210
First kiss?

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,040
We... should we say it together at the count of three?

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,340
Stop watching TV.

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,620
Everyone says that.

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,600
Should we answer?

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,760
I will count to three so we'll say it together, okay?

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,210
One, two, three. 1989.
- 1994.

23
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,590
19...94. Beijing. I was right, right?

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,880
It's 1994 in Beijing, right?

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,830
I'll go to the bathroom first.

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,250
♬   In this wide world for a long long time  ♬

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,460
♬  among the countless people, I love only you  ♬

28
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,090
Wait for a moment.

29
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,580
 Bong Hwang Dang 

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,590
 Fall 1994
Seoul Dobonggu Ssangmundong 

31
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,700
 Tofu! 

32
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,620
I thought when you become Section Chief then you would have less work but it's the same.

33
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,360
Ask your subordinates to do them.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,020
This person, in the bank I am the oldest Section Chief.

35
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,540
All those higher than me the deputy department head, manager, department head, director

36
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,110
there are many of them.

37
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,850
If I, who only graduated high school, do not work hard,

38
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,400
who would give me money to be a section chief?

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,740
That's why, I will deal with my own work.

40
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,340
Don't worry too much. Not a bit.

41
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,340
And and when I talked about the voluntary early retirement, it was just nonsense that I said because I had a lot of work.

42
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,920
Don't worry about that too.

43
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,530
Wow.

44
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,830
My wife makes the best soybean stew in the world. Champion.

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,390
You can go in and sleep. It's still dawn.

46
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,630
You said it was the flight tonight?

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,020
Then you will go to Japan and stay for a day before going directly to Japan.

48
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,370
I didn't know there were that many Baduk competitions.

49
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,430
There are usually many games around the end of the year.

50
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,850
Then you should go to work late. Stay at home and rest for a bit.

51
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,810
We have a schedule in Beijing next week.

52
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,740
Top Unni would be able to meet her boyfriend. Isn't the Baduk Competition going to be in Beijing too?

53
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,990
I heard you're friends with the famous 9-dan Choi Taek.

54
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,090
But why aren't you dating?

55
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,220
Huh?

56
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,800
Top Unni said you are both so close. But why aren't you dating?

57
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,710
We are just friends. And childhood friends at that.

58
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,660
It's been almost 20 years since we knew each other.

59
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,500
Woah. Then you must be so close.

60
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,690
But why aren't you dating?

61
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,250
Huh?

62
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,020
Hey, where do you find friends between a man and a woman?

63
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,000
Friends? Bullshit.

64
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,570
Aigoo! That's right.

65
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,610
My husband is also so tired. A salad man is so tiring.

66
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,560
It's salary man.

67
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,080
That or that.

68
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,200
I... think Oppa Dong Geun is so sexy!

69
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,650
He is 10 years younger than you. Who are you calling 'Oppa?''

70
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,140
He would wake up in his sleep if he hears that.

71
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,570
If they are handsome then they are all 'Oppa' isn't it?

72
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,880
So, do you call Gil Dong, Oppa?

73
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,940
Isn't he handsome?

74
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,570
Seon Yeong, there's still something I don't understand.

75
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,680
What is it?

76
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,970
How could Gil Dong who has a cattle like face

77
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,630
have someone with the looks of Taek?

78
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,260
- Huh?
- That's true.

79
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,070
How could a son like Taek come from him?

80
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,220
Hyungnims. You're saying things you don't know about.

81
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,690
You haven't seen Taek's dad when he was young, right?

82
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,840
He looks just like Taek.

83
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,860
If you compare Taek's dad's picture when he was young and Taek now

84
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,890
you won't be able to differentiate them.

85
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,010
They are copies of each other.

86
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,820
- Seon Yeong.
- Yes?

87
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,640
You should go crazy gracefully.

88
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,690
Has the bean pod not fallen off from your eyes?
(Are you still blinded by love)

89
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,650
Do you think we don't know how he looks like when he was young?

90
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,190
He was young when he moved here too.

91
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,740
He looks just the same as he is now.

92
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,820
Is that so?

93
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,040
It's nice to look at both of you.

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,640
I thought why you weren't getting together at that time.

95
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,760
Aigoo. Dong Ryong's Mom, you also know how to look at it.

96
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,360
Director Jo, it's suffocating just staying at home, right?

97
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,090
It must be.

98
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:02,740
You have been working all this time so it must be suffocating just staying at home to watch your grandchildren.

99
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,470
No. It's okay.

100
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,020
Aigoo.

101
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,450
Aigoo, the kids must be up.

102
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,230
I will be going first.

103
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,880
I ate the sweet potato well.

104
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,460
Go on.

105
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,970
She will break.

106
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,990
How could someone who was good at working be also good with the household?

107
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,990
That's right.

108
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,420
You know that... I...

109
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,940
 Third Training Air Force Group 

110
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,960
 Republic of Korea Air Force 

111
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,970
Hey! Choi Taek! What's with you?

112
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,440
This bastard is crazy!

113
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,160
Where do you think this place is, crazy bastard.

114
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,800
I came to see you. You look really cool.

115
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,930
Did you decide already?

116
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,410
Say it. It's okay.

117
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,330
I have a condition... three of them.

118
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,310
What conditions?

119
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,920
If you say 'okay' to these three conditions then we will date again.

120
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,920
Aigoo.

121
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,190
If you don't want to then don't.

122
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay. Tell me.

123
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,400
First.

124
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,550
I will drop formalities.

125
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,090
If we are to date again, I would drop formalities (talk casually)

126
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,030
I won't call you Noona or use jondae (formal speech).

127
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,870
Okay. Next.

128
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,540
For the second...

129
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,660
What is first in your life?

130
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,020
- Me. 
- Now it's me.

131
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm not asking you to look at me like a child.

132
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,300
I also want to be an important part in your life.

133
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,390
Not an existence that you could throw away when things get hard.

134
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,030
I want to be one among the important things in your life.

135
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,780
I was so hurt.

136
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,140
Alright.

137
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,270
The last? What's the last condition?

138
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,150
The last is...

139
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,310
Noona, I am a very ordinary man.

140
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,120
Now, if I date I need to date with the next step in mind.

141
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,630
I am thinking until that stage,

142
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,700
so if you are afraid let's not start this.

143
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,640
Give me time to think.

144
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,310
Victory!

145
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,960
The kimchi stew is a work of art.

146
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,090
What brings you all the way to Sacheon? A person who has so many competitions at that.

147
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,700
Jeong Hwan.

148
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,350
I have something to say to you.

149
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,950
Before... you asked if I opened your wallet.

150
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,660
Honestly that time--

151
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,240
Aiyoo! Fool. It was so long ago.

152
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,340
Stop making people tired and go grab Deok Seon.

153
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,360
Aiyoo. Fool. So frustrating.

154
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,330
♫   Even if a memorable day comes    ♫

155
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,510
I didn't come to talk about that. Who said I came to talk about that?

156
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,150
Is that so?

157
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,730
If not, then fine. Let's eat.
♫   Though you used to love me    ♫

158
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,190
♫   Now we're living separate lives    ♫

159
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,130
♫   There's only sadness in the veiled place    ♫

160
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,660
Eat.

161
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,520
This place is good. They are.

162
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,440
They're good, this place.

163
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,690
I think I am on menopause. There has been no news for months.

164
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,060
We are indeed at that age.

165
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:03,130
Aigoo. That... is not ordinary. It's really difficult.

166
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,530
Aigoo. What's difficult? It has been so bothersome for thirty something years.

167
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,930
Now it's better this way.

168
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm going to face it head on.

169
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,370
Where is a good one. This one is good.

170
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,840
That is why... be careful from now on.

171
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,740
I could get mad all of a sudden.

172
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,930
I could just run away all of a sudden.

173
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,160
My body would ache and some people would even suffer depression.

174
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,090
I will cook but I won't do the dishes.

175
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,110
I will clean but I will not do the laundry.

176
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,970
- Don't worry. I will do it all.
- I will do it all, Mother.

177
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,210
Yes. So you should call her often.

178
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,380
 Okay. 

179
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,790
 Our mom is already at that age. 

180
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,070
 Okay, Hyung. I will call often. 

181
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,650
 But still, is there something we can do for her? 

182
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,840
 At times like this, a daughter would be best. We can't even pretend we know anything about it. 

183
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,120
 Can we just pass it over like this? 

184
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,660
Who is our mother? She's the best Ra Mi Ran, isn't she?

185
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,400
She will overcome it well.

186
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,940
Did my brother eat? Aren't you lonely over there?

187
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,240
 Taekie came down today. We ate together. 

188
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,360
All the way to Sacheon? Did something happen?

189
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,060
 Nothing happened. He just came to see his friend. 

190
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,720
 Hyung, I'm going to exercise. 

191
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,410
This late at night? My brother has a long night.

192
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,090
 What are you saying? Hang up. 

193
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,010
You know that it's Mom's birthday next month, right? Will you be able to come?

194
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,830
 Yes, of course. 

195
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,230
 I looked at the calendar and it's on a weekend. I have time. 

196
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,570
Sleep well, my brother.

197
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,520
Goodnight.

198
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,410
 To page press 1. To record a voice message press 2. 

199
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,190
Yes, hello. Aren't you sleeping?

200
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:44,210
 I just talked with the girls after a while. It's been 6 years. 

201
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,790
Congratulations.

202
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,560
 We are meeting at the deokbeokki place tomorrow. Deok Seon has time too. 

203
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,980
 We agreed to meet at Brazil Deokbeokki. Everyone probably became so pretty, right? 

204
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,280
 What if I can't recognize them? 

205
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,110
Deok Seon and Ja Hyeon hasn't changed.

206
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,810
I have confirmed that recently.

207
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,310
 No. I heard Deok Seon became prettier. 

208
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,830
Who said? 
 - Ja Hyeon. 

209
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:15,150
Those two live comforting each other like that.

210
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,750
Probably... Deok Seon and Ja Hyeon wouldn't be able to recognize you. That's what I'm worried about.

211
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,740
You should go and wear a name tag on your chest.

212
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,340
But then... When will we be able to see each other?

213
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,260
We can see each other next week, right?

214
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,040
I... will treat you to a tasty rib eye.

215
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,560
 Rather than rib eye, samgyupsal (pork belly). Buy me samgyupsal. 

216
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,880
Deal!

217
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,150
If my Man Ok wants it, not just samgyupsal

218
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:51,160
but I will cut the meat in my body and cook it on the grilling plate.

219
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,760
 Seriously. 

220
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,590
I... went overboard with my joke.

221
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,950
Then, hurry and sleep.

222
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,960
See you... in my dreams.

223
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,320
 See you in your dreams. 

224
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,990
 Brazil Deokbeokki 

225
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:27,810
♬  Like the many stars in the wide wide night sky  ♬

226
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:33,520
♬   We all became intimate friends  ♬

227
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,760
♬   Holding each other's hands  ♬

228
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,640
Hey! This place has totally changed.

229
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,840
Is this really the Brazil Deokbeokki that we used to go to?

230
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,960
Hey! Would it have changed as much as you?

231
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,420
Man Ok, did you get plastic surgery in the States?

232
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,960
Why did you become so pretty? What the heck

233
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,520
What the heck! I took the braces off.

234
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,760
You became pretty also, wench!

235
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,520
That is really Man Ok. Seeing how her mouth is rough.

236
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,720
Hey! How could you not call even once! Bad wench! 
♬   Friends forever  ♬

237
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,620
Tough wench.

238
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,190
We must be nothing to you. Were we the only ones who thought we were close?

239
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,190
How could you not contact us within 6 years? You bad wench.

240
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,180
If I called, I might miss you.

241
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:35,460
If I heard your voices, I was afraid I might want to come to Korea.

242
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:47,280
I get so teary eyed when I look at our pictures, so how could I call?

243
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,540
That's why I couldn't call you bad wenches!

244
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,280
Here's your soondae ( blood sausage spicy rice cake ).

245
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,660
I placed a lot of ears, lungs and intestines.

246
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,610
Hey, it will bloat.

247
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,960
Man Ok is so pretty.

248
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,480
I too will vouch for that.

249
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,090
Hyungnim, here's the cabbages.

250
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,730
Why cabbages?

251
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,310
Seon Yeong went to the market at dawn

252
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,230
and bought them cause they were so good.

253
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,410
Wow! It's really good cabbages.

254
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,500
Mi Ran, if you make fresh vegetable salad (geotjeori) it would be so tasty.

255
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,680
I will do it. I make really good geotjeori.

256
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,070
Aigoo. You're great. There was that method too.

257
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,040
I should have done the same.

258
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,680
But why is Dong Ryong so busy?

259
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,360
Dae Ryong is going to open a second restaurant in the three way intersection.

260
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,880
Looks like business is doing well.

261
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,200
Dong Ryong is so good in business.

262
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,690
He is managing the second restaurant.

263
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:03,420
He pleased the wedding hall boss, so the wedding hall meal is on him too.

264
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,760
Aigoo. What's the use of sending our kids to Seoul National University.

265
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,620
Just wait and look, Dong Ryong will be the one to live best of all.

266
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,220
Excuse me.

267
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,370
Ah, yes?

268
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:21,190
That, if it won't be rude, may I ask for some sesame oil.

269
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,950
Yes.

270
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,070
Jeong Bong! Sesame oil please.

271
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,490
Yes, Mother!

272
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,700
Principal, you're not going to school? It's still not vacation though.

273
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,480
Refreshingly, I took a two weeks leave.

274
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,440
Why? Is there something wrong at home?

275
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,620
Nothing. Just to rest a bit.

276
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,180
Yes. You did well. You should work while resting a bit too.

277
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,980
Yes, yes.

278
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,270
Here it is, Teacher. You could use it all.

279
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,030
But then, I heard Dong Ryong is managing the second restaurant.

280
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,680
I heard they also have a wedding hall.

281
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,320
Oh my. Has the rumors reached here?

282
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,360
My Dong Ryong did something big.

283
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,740
Anytime during the day, you could go to the restaurant in the three way intersection to have some galbi   (beef ribs). 

284
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,700
I will give you regulars' meal coupons.

285
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,560
But then, young couples would prefer buffet and not kalbi. Would that be okay?

286
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,680
My Dong Ryong has a lot of ideas.

287
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,820
He was always watching videos, then he got an idea from watching an American video.

288
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,720
In the US they have evening dress or morning dress or what

289
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,460
they wear that and go around the guests.

290
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,240
We wouldn't know.

291
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,170
Anyway. They would stand wearing that dress

292
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:37,320
After the bride and groom pay respects to the parents, they wear it then go and greet the guests during the meal.

293
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,280
They have the three tier wedding cake and have music playing too.

294
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,610
It's all fuss but young couples really like it.

295
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,570
He's using his brain well. He's great, Dong Ryong.

296
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:54,770
Now that I think about it. I regret scolding him in high school for not studying.

297
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,760
He's doing everything that he can.

298
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,240
But not anyone can do that.

299
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,140
It's because Dong Ryong is kind and smart.

300
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,160
But then, what's with the sesame oil? Is there no one at home?

301
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,020
No. They're at home.

302
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,790
Just to visit, I should run an errand.

303
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,850
Then, I will go now.

304
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,210
Thank you.

305
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,870
Here.

306
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,530
Go on.

307
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,610
The Principal is always bright.

308
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,240
We've been living in the same neighborhood for tens of years but I haven't seen him with a sour expression not even once.

309
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,520
I've never seen him frown.

310
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,120
Look who's talking.

311
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,700
Aiyoo. These days, it's hard.

312
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,600
Aigoo. You're lying.

313
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,530
It's true.

314
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,360
I'm here.

315
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,600
I'm here.

316
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,160
Big Noona, what's the matter?

317
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,750
It's the weekend.

318
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,150
Since when did you come home on weekends?

319
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,470
Shut up.

324
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:42,980
♫ I'm saying to come back again to me who am still waiting only for you.  ♫

325
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,390
I'm here.

326
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,030
Hey! I'll be washing up!

327
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,810
Okay.

328
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,210
The pretty one is here.

329
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,850
No one like that lives here.

330
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,730
Hey!

331
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,460
 You have one message. 

332
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,380
 it's me. Come out. You know where it is, right? 

333
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:47,940

334
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:53,740
♬   and I can't get close as much as I would like  ♬

335
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,780
Where did Deok Seon go?

336
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,760
I don't know.
- What about Bo Ra?

337
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,590
I don't know.

338
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,480
Mom. I... have this suspicion from the start.

339
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,020
What?
- About big noona.

340
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,580
Why? What about Bo Ra?

341
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,460
It seems like she's dating these days.

342
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,720
Is that so? Why? What did you see?

343
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,970
Aigoo. That girl.

344
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:26,690
She didn't want to go on marriage dates so I was worried she had no interest in men.

345
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,430
Who is it? Who do you think it is?

346
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,370
He's in this neighborhood.

347
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,910
She always comes home recently.

348
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,510
And she's getting dressed up. I even smelled perfume a while ago.

349
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,890
You get the feel, right?

350
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,010
Who could it be?

351
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,720
First... Hyung Jeong Pal is in Sacheon so he's disqualified.

352
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,980
Why? Jeong Hwan is good. Younger guys are good too.

353
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,660
If it's not Hyung Jeong Bong...

354
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,260
What? Jeong Bong?

355
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,070
Hyung Taek?

356
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,360
Taekie!

357
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,820
Hey! I like Taekie the best.

358
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,960
- Me too! 
- Right?

359
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,970
But Taekie is scared of Bo Ra.

360
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,650
That's right.

361
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,410
Then Hyung Taekie is also disqualified.

362
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,720
Then Hyung Dong Ryong... God help us!

363
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,210
Doesn't he have a girlfriend?

364
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,020
That's right. That tall and young girl.
(Actor who plays Dong Ryong is dating a young model)

365
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:27,170
Then there's just one person left. I think this hyung is the most probable one.

366
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,080
Not Seon Woo.

367
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:41,220
It can be anyone but not Seon Woo. You know the reason why, right?

368
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,080
Hey! Aren't you going to hurry and come?

369
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,850
Hey! What would you have done if I said I didn't want to for you to come and kiss me right away?

370
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,010
Then you should have come out without wearing the necklace.

371
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,210
When did you see the necklace?

372
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:31,750
You had two buttons undone so how could I not see it?

373
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:43,090
Seon Woo. Seong Seon Woo. Thank you.

374
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,930
I love you.

375
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,310
Woah. I'm touched.

381
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,830
Hey! It's been 6 years! We're dating again after 6 years! Is this a dream or reality?

382
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,090
Hey, you know how hard it has been for me this past 6 years, right?

383
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,690
You know, you bastard! How bad was it that I even sneaked some sleeping pills from you.

384
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:49,150
But why is your reaction like that? What's wrong?

385
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,730
Perhaps... our family's Seong Bo Ra?

What did that crazy bastard saying?

Hey you... That wasn't a one sided love? You guys really dated?

388
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,610
He said the  dated  and they are  dating !

389
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,370
Hey! Seong Seon Woo! Crazy bastard! Get hold of yourself crazy bastard!

390
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:18,110
Hey!  A crush? Then all this time you had a crush on Noona Bo Ra?

391
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,150
Hello? Is this Jeong Pal? Where are you, Jeong Pal?

392
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,990
Hey! Noona Seon Woo and Noona Bo Ra, no, Seon Woo and Noona Bo Ra are dating.

393
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,230
 What? 

394
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,910
Hey! Seong Seon Woo, come here. Come here.

395
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,390
So you are saying you dated? No, you are dating now? No.

396
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,790
You are dating each other now?

397
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,130
Hey, hey, Deok Seon. Just a moment!

398
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,090
I will explain slowly. So sit down. Sit down.

399
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,690
- Suddenly, I have a headache. 
 - What headache? Where are you going?

400
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,450
Woah! How could you deceive us for 6 years? Six years? Wow! Really!

401
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,050
 Hey! Didn't Seon Woo just have a one-sided love? 

402
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:00,850
 Bo Ra Noona likes him back? No, that bastard liked her one-sidedly. 

403
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,710
 Hey, isn't Noona Bo Ra crazy? 

404
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:09,290
Stop right there. Hey, hey, why was I the only one who didn't know?

405
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:14,210
How could you do this to me? Nevermind! Forget it you bastard!

406
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:22,350
Hey, Seong Seon Woo! I was the only one who didn't know. Am I not your friend? Huh!

407
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,790
What nonsense is that bastard complaining about?

408
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,330
I don't need anything! Nevermind, bastard! You're not even a friend!

409
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,950
Dong Ryong, I didn't know too. Me too.

410
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,570
Don't lie!

411
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,710
Does it make sense for you not to know then Seon Woo comes in and says those things to you?

412
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,990
I'm not a fool to that extent.

413
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:47,830
Why do people lose to you in Baduk. Don't laugh. I saw you laugh just now.

414
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,670
I did?  When?

415
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,950
Right now! Right now!

416
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,450
Woah! Seong Bo Ra is dating Seon Woo.

417
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,290
Hey! Wait. Talk to me. Don't bother Bo Ra.

418
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,710
Bo Ra?

419
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,070
Bo Ra?

420
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,110
- What the heck! 
- Let's go!

421

Hey! Hey!

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,310
Hey! Taek! Where are you going?

424

Hey!

425
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,270
Bo Ra is too much! It's not right!

426

429
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,730
There are a lot of reporters. Mr. Yoo Ram said we could go.

430
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:41,400
Me too! I have never seen a Baduk competition before.

431
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,570
I need to get 9-dan Choi Taek's signature.

432
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,500
You probably can't. He doesn't meet anyone.

433
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,830
You said tomorrow is the end of the competition.

434
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,130
Maybe we would see him if he wins.

435
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,070
If he wins, he would fall over and sleep. He's a corpse.

436
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,850
Right, Deok Seon?

437
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,190
9-dan Choi Taek's force...

00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,570
Oh! Honey!

439
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,310
Oh! Mr. Yoo Ram.

440
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,150
- Ms. Deok Seon.
- Hello.

441
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,310
How about Taekie?

442
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,950
He's in his room.

443
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,810
Usually, because the third round is very important, he is on edge today and tomorrow.

444
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,710
These days he's in good condition so it's better than usual.

445
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,130
Did he eat anything?

446
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:29,570
It's rice gruel. I just sort of made it.

447
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,470
This... you brought this from Korea?

448
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,580
Anyway it's close to China.

449
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,340
You are great. It would be so sorrowful without a friend.

450
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,690
But then, you should give it to him personally.

451
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,070
He would like it a whole lot more if you gave it to him rather than me.

452
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,570
You said tomorrow would be an important competition.

453
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,610
What if he ruins the competition because his heart would flutter when he sees me.

454
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,030
You can just give it to him.

455
00:35:54,030 --> 00:36:01,850
Right. That could happen. Master Choi really likes you.

456
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:06,710
If he sees your face, he can't be distracted before a competition.

457
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,150
This... I will give it to him.

458
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,390
Pardon? I was just joking.

459
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:16,350
Is that so? I was sincere though.

460
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,050
 The news recently is an increase in voluntary early retirement at the banks. 

461
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,590
 In order to adopt to rapid changes in the finanicial industry, 

462
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,690
  ithe opening of domestic markets, and the introduction of the ATM, 

463
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,490
 the banks are ramping up efforts to cut the flab. 

464
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:53,350
 Voluntary early retirement pay is two times more than the existing severance pay and 

465
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,770
 70 to 100% of base salary is received for the years remaining to retirement age 

466
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,410
 as an additional special retirement allowance is received. 

467
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,110
 A financial industry official who is not performing at a satisfactory level, however ... 

468
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:08,930
They are giving double the retirement pay? Won't that be about alright?

469
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,970
Anyway if you try to earn that much money,  when this opportunity is there, this is the opportunity to do it.

470
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:18,070
What's an opportunity? They just barely turned 50.

471
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,890
You want them to loiter at home at a young age? Even if I was given an enormous amount

472
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,150
I would stay in the office.

473
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,710
But still, Honey. Our Section Chief Seong is holding out well.

474
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,970
He was always saying things about quitting and all.

475
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,670
Who would know what anyone really feels?

476
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:39,040
Everyone may be deceived.  It might be rapidly spoiling and rot.

477
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,730
 Also the applications for voluntary retirement received 

478
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,350
 and being processed by Hanil Bank is increasing. 

479
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:01,690
The entire banking industry including Hanil, Chohan, Commercial, Seoul Trust Banks, etc.,  is  increasing the numbers

480
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,290
forced to retire by  targeting employees who were promoted relatively later than colleagues,

481
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:13,530
  high level assistant managers and section chiefs and employees on extended leaves. 

482
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:21,300
This person... what if he just walks out of the bank.

483
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,100
 Chunlan Cup Finals 3rd Round  

484
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,310
Director.

485
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:49,450
Doek Seon, have you come to see Master Choi?

486
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,850
But why is it so quiet? Haven't the finals started yet?

487
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:56,630
It already started.  Everyone is in the review room.

488
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,110
Review room?

489
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,890
You can watch it directly on a monitor in the review room.

490
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,130
You don't have to wait in the hallway.

491
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:12,650
 Review Room 

492
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,250
Manager Lee.

493
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,620
I can't watch it because I'm nervous.

494
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,640
Call my room immediately when the competition is finished.

495
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,210
My room number is 503. Please.

496
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,770
I understand. Go in your room. I'll call you when they finish.

497
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:18,250
From the beginning of today, Master Choi's condition was good.  The Finals will probably be over early.

498
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:23,050
From my watching a number of the moves, it seems he's already got a number of counter-attacks.

499
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,790
Still you need to go till the end to see the results in Baduk.

500
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:32,520
Aigoo. our Deok Seon  already has become a Baduk player.

501
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,570
Deok Seon, I'm going to be with Yoo Ram.

502
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,290
Hello.  Manager Lee, is it over?

503
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,180
Did Taek come out? Did he win?

504
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,420
 It's me, Taek. 

505
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,320
Oh, Taek. You've worked hard.

506
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,750
Are you alright?

507
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:22,020
 Yeah. I'm fine. I finished and I'm in the room right now. 

508
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,500
Does your head not hurt?

509
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,160
 It hurts a little. I just took some medicine. 

510
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,200
Why didn't you take it after you ate food?

511
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,780
Hurry up and sleep. Why did you call?

512
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,330
 I'm hungry. 

513
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:41,020
 I'm hungry. Deok Seon, let's eat together. 

514
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,160
 See you in the lobby downstairs. 

515
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,960
Okay.

516
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,080
Let's go.

517
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,680
Oh! Master Choi, you came out!

518
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,540
Deok Seon!

519
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,420
We're going to eat dinner right now too. Let's eat together.

520
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,410
Let's go.

521
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,300
The grilled beef tripe.

522
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,160
Taek, eat crab porridge. Crab meat.

 - Yeah.

Chief Yoo!

538
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,590
- Get a hold over yourself!
 - Yes.

539
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,530
Take her and go upstairs.

540
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,300
Unni. Get a hold over yourself.

Let's go. Let's go.

542
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,940
There. Let's go. Sleep in the room.

543
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,750
Deok Seon, give me the room key.

544
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,680
Ah, yes.

545
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,780
Here.

546
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,440

Yes.

549
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,120

00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,090
The door is locked.  Top Unni must have fallen asleep.

You go in first. Hurry up and sleep.

I'm going to go after I get the key from the employee.

Sleep in my room.

I said sleep in my room.

563
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,760
Sleep in the room.

564
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,220
I could sleep here.

565
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,260
Forget it. I'll sleep on the sofa. You sleep in the room

566
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,840
You didn't even sleep properly.

567
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,920
How can I sleep if you sleep on the sofa?

568
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,350
If I take  medicine, sleeping here or in the room is the same.

569
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,710
Do you take this much these days?

570
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:04,430
I have tolerance now.

571
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:10,050
Hey. If you eat a lot of that, there's people who walk around at night like sleep walking.

572
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,380
What are you going to do if you do that?

573
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:16,880
Hey. I'm not there yet.

574
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:23,930
You never know. Lock your door before sleeping tonight.

575
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:27,620
You don't know what I'll do after taking medicine.

576
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,440
Why? You're going to kiss again?

577
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,780
I see it wasn't ... a dream...

578
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:11,830
Why did you lie?

579
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,550
I was scared.

580
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,160
We're friends.

581
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,790
What happens if we get awkward?

582
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,380
I can't imagine

583
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,850
getting awkward with you.

584
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,510
What about now?

585
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,300
It's still probably awkward.

586
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,850
But...

Right. You were a high school student then.

595
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,980
I don't know anything about school because I didn't attend school.

596
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,770
What if you're a senior then?

597
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,940
You're a public figure.

598
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:56,000
They will like it if a public figure had a first kiss with a high school student.

Hey, people think you're Buddha.

600
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,710
Should I ask them to erase it?

601
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,790
Why do you ask to erase it? Makes you look nothing.

602
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,870
Let's ask them to film that part again.

603
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,040
I'll ask them.
-Okay, okay. Let's do that.

- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

 Stop taking sleeping pills. 

606
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:25,090
 Okay. From now on, I'll take less.

 Okay.

 Why?

00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,890
 What's wrong? Did you dream? 

626
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,930
 Yeah. 

627
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,280
 It's a relief. 

628
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,560
 What is that? Did I come out in your dream? What dream is it? 

629
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,810
 It's nothing. It's a silly dream. You don't have to concerned. 

630
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,500
 Aigoo. 

631
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,820
 Right. What about Dong Ryong? 

632
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:23,730
 Him? I envy him the most. He's probably playing around in the hospital. 

633
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,810
 Hey. Wake up. Wake up! 

634
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:29,230
 You're so soft you're going to fall apart. 

635
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,320
 I'm leaving. 

636
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:07,850
♬  When I always wish I am  the person  you think of first in the morning   ♬

637
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:14,150
♬  when you open your eyes, I wish I always will be.  ♬

638
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:22,000
♬  As expected I hope you will be  the person also whom I  share anything good   ♬

639
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:27,900
Why are you like this? 
 ♬   Although you too will leave me  ♬

640
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:34,270
♬   Yes, I know.  Now for me  ♬

641
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:42,510
♬   I should avoid and be afraid of   love.  ♬

642
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:50,280
♬  If love is deepeing or you ask nervously  ♬

643
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,050
♬   Although  I  know there will be sadness ♬ 

644
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,400
It's okay to eat beef.

645
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,280
I like these kinds of places.

646
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,420
And meat is pork. Frozen pork.

647
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:07,130
Jeez! Even so much of my taste matches yours and predicts marital compatibility!

648
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,110
Then is it okay if I order?

649
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:12,930
Excuse me!

650
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,760
As thin as possible?

651
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,120
Yes. Frozen pork tastes good like that.

652
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,450
It'll probably roll up.

653
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,090
Then we can just unroll it.

654
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:30,110
Frozen pork tastes good like that.

655
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,080
Yes.

656
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,490
It's really thin.

657
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,020
Like

658
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,230
It's like a thin slice of bacon.

659
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,860
It's my favorite style.

660
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:57,580
I think you have definite philosophy of eating.

661
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:02,090
Why don't you stop learning law and learn this path?

662
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:09,360
Is there hope in learning this path?

663
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,580
Still the form of the bar exam is more ...

664
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,200
What is the form of the bar exam?

665
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,200
That stinks more.

666
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,980
And what is so bad about eating? One of the most important things of life is eating.

667
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:30,990
And Deok Seon said that the ramyun you make tastes the best.

668
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:40,610
Do what you like. Something you think of all night.

669
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:48,650
I studied in America fashion designer because my dad told me to do it even though I didn't like it.

670
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,180
But I wish you'd do something you like.

671
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,030
Wait.

672
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:25,590
Soondae, spicy rice cakes, and fried food?

673
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:28,400
Are they still selling fried bread there?

674
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,610
I understand, Dad. I'll buy it later.

675
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,220
How much is one?

676
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:47,640
If you make up your mind first, I'll match your price.

677
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,840
Still, I have to know the price.

678
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,570
Make a decision.  I think ten should be enough, right?

679
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:52,570
Yes. How much is it?

680
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:56,830
Our shop has everything which is woven.

681
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:09,480
Don't do it. Don't do it. My precious child should not do this. Go sit over there.

682
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,640
What's wrong?

683
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,700
You bought fries and soondae, right?

684
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:17,620
Yes.  The pojangmacha (street food vendor) was still open for business.

685
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,400
Did our daughter have a date?

686
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:29,640
- No.
- I don't think so. You wore a skirt.

687
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,820
Dad, can I date now?

688
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,160
Of course. You're not a high student anymore. I have to send you off to marry.

689
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:45,340
After you marry, I'll just quit business.

690
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:50,260
It's hard. I'll just spend the rest of my life cruising with your mom.

691
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:55,660
Wow. How much does my dad like money? Do you think that'll happen?

692
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:58,640
I heard that last month the 3rd shop in Namdaemoon did well.

693
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:03,320
Did your mom say that? That location is the best.

694
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:08,300
My voice there is a selling art.  That place is doing better than here.

695
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,580
You said that you'll quit business and go cruising.

696
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:17,460
A customer is here. Welcome!

697
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,520
Don't go. Play with me before going.

698
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,480
Okay. Don't worry.

699
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,720
What shall I show you?

700
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,300
- Will you customize? 
 - Yes, yes.

701
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:11,080
So scary.

702
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,720
Why are you sitting like this?

703
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:28,020
Bo Ra's father, why are you sitting like this?

704
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:31,740
Why? Did something happen?

705
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,680
Wife.

706
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:41,980
I applied for voluntary resignation today.

707
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,410
I'm sorry.

708
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:04,020
 ♫ Will it leave someday, this green youth ♫   

709
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:11,190
 ♫ Like a flower which wilts and blooms again  ♫  

710
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:18,420
 ♫ My heart which is empty without the places to which it was once attached  ♫  

711
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,500
 ♫ Is searching  for the old friendships  ♫  

712
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:29,610
It's okay. Why are you sorry?

713
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:50,690
It's okay. There's nothing for you to be sorry for.

714
01:03:54,420 --> 01:04:01,630
 ♫ Will it leave someday, this green youth?  ♫  

715
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:08,850
 ♫ Like a flower, which wilts and blooms again  ♫  

716
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:15,980
 ♫ With the bright moonlight streaming through the window  ♫  

717
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:23,520
 ♫ The love song of my youth is sad  ♫  

718
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,870
What are you doing sitting there not sleeping?

719
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:34,090
Don't turn on the light.

720
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:37,820
I can't sleep.

721
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:43,590
Honey, are you alright?

722
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,590
I'm not.

723
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,690
I'm not okay.

724
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:02,950
 ♫ Is it better to turn away and let it go  ♫  

725
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:10,170
 ♫ That is how time will pass  ♫  

726
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:17,520
 ♫ Will it leave someday, this green youth?  ♫  

727
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:24,520
 ♫ Like a flower which wilts and blooms again  ♫  

728
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,950
 ♫ With the bright moonlight shining through the window  ♫  

729
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:36,850
   

730
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,770
What?

731
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,280
Really?

732
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,160
Dad.

733
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:50,520
Your dad doesn't have to go to work. He graduated from the bank.

734
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:55,300
He just has to do the retirement ceremony next week and everything will truly be finished.

735
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:00,620
Voluntary retirement? Did you apply for it? Why?

736
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,040
I heard that if you apply for voluntary retirement now,

737
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,020
you'll get double and half severance pay.

738
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:12,000
Do you know how much your dad gets for severance pay?

739
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,440
He gets over two hundred million won.

740
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,360
That much?
-Really?

741
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,880
Yeah. When will we be able to touch such a large sum of money?

742
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,160
And in only three or four years he was going to retire anyway.

743
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,700
I heard that recently voluntary retirement is being received from many banks.

744
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,060
I didn't know you'd do it.

745
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,340
That's why I immediately grabbed it.

746
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:36,640
I thought that's 200 million won more easily earned.

747
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,900
You must feel sad since you worked at the bank for a long time. I'll come home more.

748
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,760
Nonsense. Sadness, shmadness.

749
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,220
Do you know what your dad's wish is?

750
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:52,440
My wish is to sleep as much as I want in the morning.

751
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,320
You should go on trips with mom

752
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,580
and exercise. Mom had a hard time last year.

753
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:02,140
Go eat delicious food holding hands.

754
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:07,300
We could go places together. But I don't know about holding hands.

755
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,560
It's a relief if you two don't fight.

756
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,820
Bo Ra's mother!

757
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:16,360
Oh my! Why are you here this morning? We're here!

758
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,740
Bo Ra's mother. Just three minutes.

759
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,860
Hwangdang hwangdang bonghwangdang!

760
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:37,840
After living so long, I get to see the Section Chief in broad daylight on a week day.

761
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,640
It's still awkward for me.

762
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,360
But are you still not getting proper food when you've been married for five years?

763
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,840
What's with the black bean noodle?

764
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:52,680
Madam Cheetah ordered some so I got a bowl of jajjangmyun. Let's eat it together.

765
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,380
I was just mixing it.

766
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,880
Oh my. Did you start delivering black bean noodles again?

767
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,600
I got kicked out of the house by my wife. She didn't want to see my face.

768
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,960
She told me to get lost.

769
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,840
Leave that. It's good to eat together after a long time.

770
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,700
Sit down.

771
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:29,840
When a woman gets menopause,

772
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,420
she hates everything in the world.

773
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:38,720
And the person she hates the most in the world is her husband.

774
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,460
I was so freaked out by my wife last year.

775
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,820
I never knew she had that kind of side.

776
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:51,560
I would have punched her if it wasn't for love. Just once more and I would have lost it.

777
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:08,720
Why did I get mad? He just put ice cream on the table.

778
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,420
That could happen.

779
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:17,160
I get irritated at Taek's dad a lot.

780
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,400
A fire started burning in me

781
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,940
and then I suddenly started crying.

782
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,560
It's not normal.

783
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,880
Jeong Bong's dad who just passing by got hit by it.

784
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:46,560
Why are you like this again? It's okay.

785
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,800
Sungnim, you're fifty-three years old now.

786
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,180
You don't even have a single gray hair on your head.

787
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:59,500
You're still young. You're still fresh.

788
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,460
It's because I'm like this already when I don't have gray hair.

789
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:11,350
You're enduring it well.

790
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:13,710
Our Il Hwa is great.

791
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:18,070
I'm not.

792
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:25,660
I still pour cold water on my head before sleeping.

793
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:34,700
I cry at least two times a night. Well, jeez ...

794
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:39,230
Still you had daughters so you overcome it well.

795
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:42,860
Our Mi Ran Sungnim doesn't have a single daughter.

796
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:48,100
Aigoo... You have to have a daughter during these times.

797
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,940
I should get one now.

798
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,140
I can't.

799
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:59,820
Drat. I can't even do a single thing I want to do.

800
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:05,990
Aigoo. It seems like you're getting better since you're joking.

801
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,030
It comes and goes.

802
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:13,090
But I envied Bo Ra's mom a little last year.

803
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,960
Really?

804
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:23,090
Well our dog daughters do have some affection. That's so.

805
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:26,120
Is that affection?

806
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,480
It's because they're daughters, they know their mothers hearts like ghosts.

807
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,470
Sons never know.

808
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:36,400
And even more, that Deok Seon doesn't have an evil bone in her body!

809
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:43,190
Aigoo, nowadays I want to have Deok Seon as my daughter-in-law like crazy.

810
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:49,410
 Last year, 1993 

811
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,640
Mom, let's go out. Hurry up and get up.

812
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,640
Let's put something on.

813
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,260
- Let's go out!
 - Why? Where?

814
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,840
Let's go out. Let's go out.

815
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,600
No, no.

816
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:07,470
Hurry up and come.

817
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:11,470
There's a new ______  shop in front of Ssangmun Station.

818
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:14,230
They say that the taste is really good.

819
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:17,670
Mom, aren't you cold?

820
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,910
There. Let's go.

821
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:21,830
Let's go.

822
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:31,720
  "Love is the Only Thing I Could Give You " by December 

823
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:39,050
♬  While walking on the unlighted street  ♬

824
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:45,600
Jeez.  If I am born again, I'm going to be born as a mother. I'm envious.

825
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:53,240
♬   I want to give you a bouquet of flowers.  ♬

826
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:59,580
♬  A whole field of sunflowers  ♬

827
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:03,190
♬ Why do birds fly?   ♬ 
 It's pretty.  

828
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,870
Can you erase it?

829
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:08,710
How can I go around like this?
-Why? 
 ♬   Why does the wind blow?  ♬

830
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:11,670
Don't go out!
 ♬   Why does the wind blow?  ♬

831
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:19,960
♬  Love is still the only thing which can lift my whole heart.  ♬

832
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,680
 It's expensive medicine. Make sure you eat it. 

833
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,760
 The Second Daughter Who is A Great Help In the House 

834
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:32,540
 ♫ Only love  ♫  

835
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:42,350
 Our country's 9-dan Choi Taek was victorious in the Chullam Cup World Baduk Championship in China. 

836
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:44,350
 In the third round finals, Choi Taek ... 

837
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,390
Taek won again.

838
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:49,320
I think he's crazy. He's not human.

839
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,080
Hello?

840
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,900
Oh, Hyung Taek!

841
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,150
Congratulations!

842
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:01,830
Did you come to Korea? When did you come?

843
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:04,470
Ah. Wait a bit.

844
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:06,070
Younger Noona.

845
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:09,150
Yeah.

846
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:11,810
Okay.

847
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:13,550
I'm going to Taek for a moment.

848
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,190
Hey, why don't you eat?

849
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:17,230
Taek.

850
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,540
Isn't something weird?

851
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,860
Is Younger Noona possibly ...

852
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:29,440
Eat. Eat. Do you still have so much curiosity?

853
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,640
When did you come?

854
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,520
Right now.

855
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,740
Aren't you tired?

856
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,120
I'm okay.

857
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,970
Aren't you cold?

858
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:06,020
I'm okay.

859
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:13,650
It's warm.

860
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:21,900
Tomorrow is Dad's retirement ceremony.

861
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,860
I'm already tearing up.

862
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:32,470
Can't I go too?

863
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:35,510
Forget it. Don't come.

864
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:41,760
If you come, it will get chaotic. And anyway they said only the family is invited.

865
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,840
I understand.

866
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:49,500
But can't I go for just a moment?

867
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:53,310
Forget it. If you come, you'll become the main person.

868
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:56,170
Tomorrow, my dad is the main person.

869
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:59,350
I understand.

870
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:02,750
Then, at least in the back.

871
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,820
Hey!

872
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:09,100
Listen to me. Okay?

873
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,770
Yes.

874
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,300
Put it on.

875
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:42,660
Bo Ra used her first pay check from the Judicial Training and Research Institute to buy this suit.

876
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:47,780
You cherished it so much, you didn't even wear it even once so it wouldn't  be damaged.

877
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:53,100
That's right. The words, if you cherish it it'll become poop, is right.

878
01:16:56,350 --> 01:17:00,230
This person, why are you crying again?

879
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:04,100
I quit receiving a lot of money.

880
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,100
It's okay. Don't cry.

881
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:15,740
Well, if dog poop is okay, then it's okay. It's always okay.

882
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,780
It's okay.

883
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,560
Aigoo.  Handsome.  Seong Dong Il, my husband.

884
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:54,910
You surprise people with odd things.

885
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,600
Aigoo. Thank you, Jin Joo.

886
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,990
Bo Ra's father, you suffered a lot all this time.

887
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:09,740
You suffered a lot.

888
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:12,480
Aigoo, with this...

889
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,660
Emperor Sun Xiu has been robbed. (  Reference to Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history )

890
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:18,860
Without General Ding Feng (  Jeong Bong in Korean )  guarding the door, calamity will happen.

891
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:23,200
What are you saying? It's not even the retirement ceremony of President of Korea

892
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,550
and you're fussing like this.

893
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:29,670
I said that I'll finish it in one hour.

894
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:34,450
Then finish in one hour and come.

895
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:38,160
When you come back we will have a warm drink.

896
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,480
Chief Seong, you've suffered a lot.

897
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:45,130
Ayy.  What are you.

898
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,470
We'll now change all our banks.

899
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:51,150
Bo Ra's father quit Han Il Bank. So why should we have accounts there?

900
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:57,340
Should we.  I am at the point of changing all my savings accounts at Hanil Bank. Down with Hanil!

901
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:01,660
Right.  Down with Hanil. Down!

902
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:04,660
Deok Seon is waiting.  Start going.

903
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:09,280
You never were tardy going to work so you shouldn't be tardy at the retirement ceremony.

904
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:14,880
From now on I'm unemployed in this neighborhood, so please take care of the unemployed.

905
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,340
Yes.

906
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,730
Dad, you're going to be late! Hurry!

907
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:22,770
Okay. I'm going.

908
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:25,670
I'm leaving. Thank you.

909
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,700
I'm leaving.

910
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:32,980
- Good bye!
-Yes, yes.

911
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,770
  University Hospital  

912
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,440
Hello? Yeah, Bo Ra.

913
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,440
 Yeah. Are you at the hospital? 

914
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,740
Yeah. Is something wrong?

915
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:58,420
Wasn't today Ahjussi's retirement ceremony? Did it end well?

916
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:02,750
 It did but I don't feel good. 

917
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:08,730
Comfort Ahjussi a lot. He's probably the most depressed.

918
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:12,190
 I didn't expect a big retirement ceremony 

919
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:16,310
  but even so it was so simple it was over in a flash. 

920
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:18,140
 Thirty people were retiring together. 

921
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:22,770
 There was no commonplace plaque of appreciation. They were only given bouquets. 

922
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:30,350
 For thirty years of employment I was on the verge of rage. 

923
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:32,910
Are you at home?

924
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:36,250
I'll see you there is a little while. Even if it's late, I will go.

925
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:40,740
 Yes. Home. I'll stay for a while. 

926
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:46,620
 Dad and Mom went out for some soju.  I can't believe how they are unusually getting along so well. 

927
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,590
That's good.

928
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,770
What about Deok Seon?

929
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:54,830
 I don't know.  She fumed for a while.  She hasn't even come home. 

930
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:57,010
Oh. I was startled

931
01:20:57,010 --> 01:21:01,390
 I can't leave things as they are.  No Eul too should come.  Just do as I say. 

932
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,170
 Seon Woo.  I will call you later. 

933
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:09,440
Unni, didn't you go to Seoul National?  Can't you write something besides that?

934
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,300
Hey, am I giving a course in Korean Literature?

935
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,960
Give it to me. I will write.

936
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,200
Write quickly.  This has got to be straightened out now.

937
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,340
I know.

938
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:26,110
You're starting off now?

939
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:30,150
 Yes, Hyung. Don't wait up for me. I'll probably arrive at dawn. 

940
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:32,310
Is that so? Drive carefully, okay?

941
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:35,110
 Yeah. How's Mom? 

942
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:36,340
I don't know.

943
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,930
 What? 

944
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:44,310
She seems good and sometimes not.

945
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:47,160
 This is why a family needs a daughter. 

946
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,560
 Just wait. The second daughter is coming. 

947
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:37,050
You're here, my son.

948
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:44,150
Yes.

949
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:48,250
Mom, are you alright?

950
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:52,570
Yeah. I'm okay.

951
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,280
I'm okay.

952
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:01,340
I'll be sleeping. See you later, Son.

953
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:44,090
Aigoo. Who do we have here, isn't it Lieutenant Kim?

954
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:45,790
Victory.

955
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,190
Look at your state.

956
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:52,170
If you came under me in the military you would be dead, you bastard.

957
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,630
Am I crazy to go under you?

958
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:57,010
But when did you come?

959
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:59,650
At dawn.

960
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:02,840
Let's have a drink. Taek said he would be done early today.

961
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,860
Today is my Mom's birthday. We will be eating out.

962
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:07,900
That's right. That's the reason you came up.

963
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,100
But did you make reservations somewhere?

964
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:14,320
I was going to get one with Hyung. Do you know somewhere good?

965
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,470
I'm not sure. I will think about it.

966
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:22,170
Is it going well with Noona Bo Ra?

967
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,500
I heard you're dating these days, you don't even know of a good restaurant.

968
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,900
You're younger than me but why don't you know any restaurants?

969
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,330
I came from Sacheon.

970
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:49,760
Hyung these days... is a housewife.

971
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,490
Yes.

972
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:59,870
Dong Ryong? What's the matter?

973
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,820
 Lieutenant Kim! What's your current location? 

974
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:03,410
What are you saying?

975
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:06,210
 The guest for the dining hall just bailed on me. 

976
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:11,460
 We prepared kalbi stew for 100 people but the bride fled with her first love this morning. 

977
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,450
What?

978
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:17,500
 We received the payment so it's okay. But the kalbi stew would be wasted. 

979
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,530
 Let's have an alley feast after a while. 

980
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:23,050
 Hey, starting from now, tell everyone you see to come. 

981
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:25,230
Hey! Do you have a cake too?

982
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:28,090
 Are you kidding? It's three tiers! Three tiers! 

983
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:30,190
 Today is Madame Cheetah's birthday, right? 

984
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:32,890
 Hey, you hit the jackpot today, bastard. 

985
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:36,380
 I will transform the wedding cake into a birthday cake. 

986
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,660
Hey, no. Nevermind. Don't change it. What time do we need to go?

987
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,860
 It's the last time so about 7. 

988
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:46,620
 Or you could starting coming now. The guests from before have left. 

989
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:50,160
 Anyway, call everyone in the alley. I'm treating you all big time. 

990
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,440
Thank you, Dong Ryong.

991
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:57,100
Hyung. I have a good way.

992
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:01,210
 Kam Po  Myeon Ok 

993
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:07,750
Hey. How many people are coming?

994
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:10,630
If everyone is coming about 20 people.

995
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:14,070
Deok Seon is going to come for sure. Jeong Pal too.

996
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:16,950
We will be seeing everyone from the alley after a long while.

997
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:20,780
Oh yeah, Dong Ryong. Mom is coming too.

998
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,380
Really? Is it over now?

999
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:26,580
They are heading straight here.

1000
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:29,080
This is all because of you.

1001
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:32,360
What about me, Punk!

1002
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,500
Excuse me.

1003
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,080
Is this the kalbi place of Boss Dong Ryong?

1004
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,220
We came to eat free kalbi stew.

1005
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:42,300
- You're here. 
- Hyung Dae Ryong, hello.

1006
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,410
Yeah. Your family is the first.

1007
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:47,990
Is this Dong Ryong's store... oh you. We'll just take one of this, right.

1008
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:50,450
Where?
- That way.

1009
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:52,510
We came for free kalbi stew.

1010
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:54,230
Hyung.

1011
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:55,850
- Hello.
- Hello Dong Ryong.

1012
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:57,350
Hello, Noona.

1013
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:59,990
Hello.

1014
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,740
Ahjussi! Two kalbi stews please.

1015
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:08,700
Woah! Seong Deok Seon you got prettier.

1016
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,200
Hey, your mom and dad are here. Come in.

1017
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,930
Okay

1018
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:16,180
- You're alone? 
 - With Top Unni.

1019
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:19,810
Is she the only close unni you know? I told you to call everyone.

1020
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:21,490
- Excuse me.  
 - Excuse me.

1021
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:23,830
I called them of course.

1022
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:27,260
Here. Man Ok, Ja Hyeon, say hi. He's my friend Dong Ryong.

1023
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,860
Hello.

1024
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,480
You... are him, right? Ssangmundong's Park Nam Jeong?

1025
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:35,300
Ssangmun High's Joey Wang?

1026
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,780
It's been a long time.

1027
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,190
What's this? Should I set you up?

1028
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:41,590
Shut your mouth. I probably have a girlfriend.

1029
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:45,650
I think my soup is about ready.  I need to check it.

1030
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:48,600
I will take care of my own so you take care of yours.

1031
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,650
Let's go.

1032
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:53,290
Must be tasty.

1033
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:57,070
Who didn't come?

1034
01:28:57,070 --> 01:29:01,080
This bastard caught the star disease so he's always late.

1035
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,620
- We're here. 
 - Hello.

1036
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:10,150
I heard you were giving free kalbi stew.

1037
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:11,940
Hello.

1038
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:16,850
I oughto! Why are you only here now? The kalbi stew is all cold now.

1039
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:19,010
I was the one who drove here.

1040
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:23,220
Then I can understand that. Have a bowl of soup.  Go on in.

1041
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:36,000
Hey.

1042
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,320
- Mom.
- Give us kalbi stew too!

1043
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,140
Mom, I cooked some kalbi.

1044
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:46,710
If you don't give me some, I'm going.

1045
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:51,070
You can have a hundred servings. Because you told me to do good deeds, come in.

1046
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:55,510
The Dean is here.

1047
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,750
Hello.

1048
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:02,030
Now, hands of who hasn't come.

1049
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:05,750
Jeong Pal! Madame Cheetah is still not here.

1050
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:10,040
Aigoo! President Kim is also not here yet.

1051
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:16,380
That's right. This bastard had me prepare all this then...

1052
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:20,090
Is anyone here?

1053
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:25,830
Is this the place of Dong Ryong who makes the best kalbi stew in the world?

1054
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:30,730
Perhaps, are you Ssangmundong's Madame Cheetah that I've only heard of?

1055
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:33,610
Come in.

1056
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,500
Hello!

1057
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:40,000
Hello.

1058
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,010
What are you doing and not coming here?

1059
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:42,500
Hey, ahjumma.

1060
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:27,300
Anyway, I was feeling depressed on my birthday so it's nice to have us all gather for dinner.

1061
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:33,220
What is there to be depressed on your birthday? It's the happiest day in your life.

1062
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:36,860
Mother, I congratulate you on your 52nd birthday.

1063
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:41,910
I will prepare a grand table later for our family.

1064
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:49,340
Son, I have no thoughts of getting congratulations on my 52nd birthday.

1065
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:51,580
Oh my! What to do! I'm so sorry.

1066
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:54,630
What should we do? I'm sorry.

1067
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:59,010
It's okay. It's alright.

1068
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:03,700
You need to change clothes. It will probably smell.

1069
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,710
Where do we find clothes here?

1070
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:11,210
That... we do have clothes here. Would you want to change into that?

1071
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:21,450
Please be careful. This way.

1072
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:28,900
Come this way.

1073
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:40,450
It's all set. The music?

1074
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:43,010
- Don't worry.
- The cake?

1075
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:47,110
It's ready. Jeong Pal, I invited someone else.

1076
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:58,770
Yes, Hyung you be the flower girl.

1077
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:00,750
Me? A flower girl?

1078
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:04,530
But my girlfriend is over there.

1079
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:06,250
Then should I do it?

1080
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:12,460
Honestly, my childhood dream was to be a flower girl. You didn't know, my brother?

1081
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,240
Yeah.

1082
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:18,610
Okay.

1083
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:20,870
Who would give the bouquet?

1084
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:23,420
- There is one who's not doing anything.
- Who?

1085
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:26,270
You. You give it to your mom yourself.

1086
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:29,610
When I play the music, you give it to your mom.

1087
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:31,000
I can't do things like that.

1088
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,600
Crazy bastard! You were the one who said to do this.

1089
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,420
Ahjumma, could you bring out Cheetah ahjumma please.

1090
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:47,170
Why? Are the clothes weird?

1091
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:07,050
As I live I'm wearing all sorts of clothes.

1092
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:10,210
Wow, it fits you well, Hyungnim.

1093
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:12,610
I'm glamorous you see.

1094
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:14,790
But would I be able to digest wearing this?

1095
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:18,150
Should I just take it off, I'm feeling hot anyway.

1096
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:24,100
Aigoo, Hyungnim you're pretty. When else would you get to wear something like this?

1097
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:29,450
Ahjumma, the first grade meat is out.

1098
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:32,690
Okay. We'll be out. Hyungnim.

1099
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:36,490
So pretty.

1100
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:40,600
That...

1101
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,000
Oh my!

1102
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,180
What's going on?

1103
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,300
What?

1104
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:54,640
Wow! So pretty!

1105
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,330
What's going on?

1106
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:59,510
They are telling me to wear this.

1107
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:04,730
I'm embarrassed.

1108
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:10,390
Wow!

1109
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,070
Oh my!

1110
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:51,240
So attractive.  Why are you crying?

1111
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:08,970
Groom and Bride march.

1112
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:43,040
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1113
01:36:48,510 --> 01:37:02,600
Kiss!
Do Ryong Nyeong! Do Ryong Nyong!

1114
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,560
What are you doing! Hurry and come to the front!

1115
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:11,470
One two three!

1116
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:27,710
Whose idea was this?

1117
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:30,810
Your daughter.

1118
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:33,870
What?

1119
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:39,480
Jeong Hwan, how did you know our picture was fake?

1120
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:43,130
I really thought we won't be caught for life.

1121
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:47,560
I knew it was edited the moment I saw it.

1122
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:54,100
Jeong Hwan, thank you.

1123
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:57,670
My menopause has flown away.

1124
01:37:57,670 --> 01:37:59,930
Thank you, Son.

1125
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:11,410
I didn't do this for this. Why are you crying?

1126
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:13,740
Keep quiet, Bastard.

1127
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:29,150
Why is that something to cry about? It's something good.

1128
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:30,790
Dad.

1129
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:34,050
We also have something to give you.

1130
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:35,810
Huh?

1131
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:41,660
Gift.

1132
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:45,790
What's with everyone?

1133
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:48,730
Did you all mature? What's with all of you?

1134
01:38:48,730 --> 01:38:49,890
What is this?

1135
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:53,090
We decided to have the retirement ceremony with the family.

1136
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:55,250
Dad, open it.

1137
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,040
Oh my.

1138
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:06,580
What is this?

1139
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:09,810
Isn't that a appreciation plaque?

1140
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:12,430
Wow! I will read it.

1141
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:15,340
- Don't read it.
- No.

1142
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:20,380
Why? It's still a gift from the children so it should be read while everyone is here.

1143
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:22,360
Don't read it, please.

1144
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:23,880
Don't read it.

1145
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,770
Aigoo. Everyone will cry. I will cry too.

1146
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:33,000
Ahjussi, but still, it's right to refreshingly read it and be cursed at refreshingly.

1147
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,290
Is that so? I became a new groom crossing the age of fifty.

1148
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:39,390
I should just get cursed at refreshingly then.

1149
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,740
Read it.

1150
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:45,890
Appreciation Plaque.

1151
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:53,640
For 26 years of contribution to the Hanil Bank,  to Section Chief Seong Dong Il.

1152
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:58,580
I think I can't read this.

1153
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:02,570
Appreciation Plaque.

1154
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:10,470
For 26 years of contribution to the Hanil Bank,  to Section Chief Seong Dong Il we give thanks for his effort.

1155
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:15,880
Although we can't call him Section Chief Seong Il Dong anymore,

1156
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:21,910
the unchanging fact is he is still the husband of Lee Il Hwa

1157
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:30,300
and the father of the three siblings, Seong Bo Ra, Seong Deok Seon, and Seong Na Eul.

1158
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:40,010
The things our father likes to say the most often are to hell with you and bullshit.

1159
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:46,750
Our father's most disliked words are forever an assistant manager and loan guarantor.

1160
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:56,770
What our dad does best is buying useless things and giving us kisses.

1161
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:06,190
His favorite food is seasoned clams and soju.

1162
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:17,010
And what my dad loves the most is our family.

1163
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:27,290
As dad's daughters and son... for not being able to say even one warm word...

1164
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:33,370
for not being able to share a drink which you like so much...

1165
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:38,260
For not being able to hug you first.

1166
01:41:40,490 --> 01:41:43,750
For not being able to tell you we love you...

1167
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:53,690
And for the weight of the name 'Dad', for not being able to fathom that,

1168
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:59,790
We are sorry.

1169
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:11,560
Despite that, you are like a tree who gives without reservation.

1170
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,330
A dad that is respected by Bo Ra.

1171
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:22,610
A dad that is like a friend to Deok Seon.

1172
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:28,580
And to No Eul... a dependable Dad.

1173
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:36,790
We gather our deep gratitude in this plaque.

1174
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:45,300
1994 November 5th. From your children.

1175
01:42:56,370 --> 01:43:01,950
Damn you girl. Why did you read that?

1176
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:19,160
Do something about this atmosphere! Damn it.

1177
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:22,790
Aigoo.

1178
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:26,750
Hey. Put it on.

1179
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:30,470
What do I put on?

1180
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,190
Oh!

1181
01:43:45,190 --> 01:43:52,340
Ra Mi Ran! Ra Mi Ran! Ra Mi Ran!

1182
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:55,470
Ra Mi Ran! Ra Mi Ran! Ra Mi Ran!

1183
01:43:55,470 --> 01:44:02,390
Ra Mi Ran! Ra Mi Ran!

1184
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:08,510
♫   The streets burning with neon, the streetlights    ♫
♫   A Mesmerizing Confession - Yoon Soo Il    ♫

1185
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:11,740
♫   Underneath those lights, you and I have met at some time    ♫

1186
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:12,860
Ha! Ha! Ha!

1187
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:20,920
♫    As I get lost in thoughts of wondering what you're doing right now   ♫

1188
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:26,000
♫   I endlessly long for that day    ♫

1189
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:33,430
♫   The blazing eyes, those thirsty lips    ♫

1190
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:39,550
♫   Even the stars fall asleep, let's stay this way forever    ♫

1191
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:45,730
♫    I only love you - those blissful words   ♫

1192
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:51,650
♫   It's still not too late, if only you will come back to my side    ♫

1193
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:03,170
Wife. Have you heard of 'Every flood has it's ebb'?

1194
01:45:03,970 --> 01:45:07,170
Yeah. I heard of it.

1195
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:13,590
Even the chrysanthemum matures and the red petals vanish in ten days.

1196
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:21,180
This time, I want to get to my senses and do something. But that seems to be a luxury too.

1197
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:31,130
At this rate, my life has already gone.

1198
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:37,300
Time does not only pass for us.

1199
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:43,980
It also passes for them. It's not some unfortunate story.

1200
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:48,390
That's how it is.

1201
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:55,990
Today, I... really realized something big.

1202
01:45:57,390 --> 01:45:59,030
What is it?

1203
01:45:59,030 --> 01:46:04,320
I thought it was the end when the flowers bloom.

1204
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:11,870
But then, after that flower blooms, the fruit would sprout.

1205
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:15,710
I forgot about that.

1206
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:20,930
Just because my flower has bloomed, I was regretful and sad

1207
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:25,040
I... didn't see that.

1208
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:30,300
I may have been cut from the office

1209
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:38,310
but as much as raising my kids, I really did a good job, didn't I?

1210
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:50,150
Aigoo. But then... Who knows, they would also make us upset.

1211
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:54,800
Is that so? I went ahead this time again.

1212
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:58,080
But still though.

1213
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:07,630
This heart of a parent, the kids will reply to it someday.

1214
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:09,990
'Thank you'

1215
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:13,370
Let's go in.

1216
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:32,830
Did you say you will work at the counter at the Gwangseon Supermarket?

1217
01:47:32,830 --> 01:47:37,340
- Do you mean as a  cashier? 
 Yes.

1218
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:40,690
You are great.

1219
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:45,610
I got trained yesterday and today then I will start tomorrow.

1220
01:47:46,690 --> 01:47:51,110
She's always been working so she would get sick if she just stays at home.

1221
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:53,850
Dong Ryong's Mom, did you go somewhere?

1222
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:57,420
I haven't seen you for a while.

1223
01:47:58,790 --> 01:48:03,190
I... ran away from home.

1224
01:48:03,190 --> 01:48:04,770
- Huh?
- Why?

1225
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,910
Why? Where? Why?

1226
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:11,900
Well... it was 2-3 weeks ago.

1227
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:17,400
I ran away and came back yesterday to eat kalbi stew.

1228
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,320
Why did you run away suddenly?

1229
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:25,860
I... my life...

1230
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:33,650
didn't like being called 'Dong Ryong's mom,' 'Dae Ryong's mom'

1231
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:39,580
My name is Jo  Soo Hyang.

1232
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:53,900
I was looking at my grandchildren then I suddenly felt stuffy in my chest

1233
01:48:55,400 --> 01:49:00,040
I thought 'what am I doing here?'

1234
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:07,710
I thought I would go crazy.

1235
01:49:07,710 --> 01:49:15,030
When my grandchildren slept, I just went to my younger sister's house in Daejon.

1236
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:22,040
So that's why Teacher Ryoo was always at home. To do the household chores.

1237
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:25,420
That person is so understanding.

1238
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:30,600
In case I would be worried, he never called once.

1239
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:36,870
 Yeah. It's fine as long as she's well. 

1240
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:38,770
 No, don't wake her. 

1241
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:41,320
 Brother-in-law, do you want to come and take Unni? 

1242
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,940
 No. Let her rest some more. 

1243
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:48,560
 If your sister gets better call me. Then I will pick her up. 

1244
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:52,690
 What about the kids? What about your food? School? 

1245
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:56,090
 I will take care of it. Just take care of your sister. 

1246
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:58,220
 Go on. Okay. 

1247
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:02,500
 Ah chu chu chu. 

1248
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:05,200
Peek a boo.

1249
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:10,010
Aigoo. The principal is a real man.

1250
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:15,340
Oh my. But he never gave us a hint.

1251
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:20,820
If we knew, we would have helped, right?

1252
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:22,640
Mom! I'm here.

1253
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:25,520
Oh! My eldest daughter is here.

1254
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,300
Yes, Bo Ra come in.

1255
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:32,200
Bo Ra, greet the ahjummas.

1256
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,720
Hello.

1257
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:38,520
This, have some sweet persimmon. My mom likes them.

1258
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,520
Then have a good time.

1259
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:49,860
Bo Ra's face is shining.

1260
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:53,660
But then, isn't it time for her to get married. Is she not dating?

1261
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:57,740
Dating... I think she is.

1262
01:50:57,740 --> 01:51:00,280
Mom!

1263
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:04,140
Since he was on his way home, I told him to buy some carp bread.

1264
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:07,660
Do carp bread business. How many do you eat per year?

1265
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:10,020
You're here.

1266
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:11,340
Hello.

1267
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:15,090
Here. I bought carp bread.

1268
01:51:15,090 --> 01:51:17,920
Enjoy.

1269
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,780
I will be going.

1270
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:22,100
Goodbye.

1271
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:25,760
You should have fun.

1272
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:40,150
 But what is this? Among people who always see each other. 

1273
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:42,600
 It's true. There is something strange between them. 

1274
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,760
 You're saying nonsense! 

1275
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:50,090
 Are you doing that for you to see your mom collapse? 

1276
01:51:50,090 --> 01:51:52,660
 Our Seon Woo seems to have many troubles. 

1277
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:54,960
 He will deal with it fine. 

1278
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,900
 Are you confident? 

1279
01:51:56,900 --> 01:52:00,680
 Mom... please let it slide this once. 

1280
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:06,410
 I have confidence not to change. Don't you? 

1281
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:11,210
 That's absolutely no for you. 

1282
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:18,260
 Did you do it for me to get mad on purpose? 

1283
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:23,800
 You never know a person's life. 

1284
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:26,520
 The bride will enter. 

1285
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:29,580
 Bride, enter. 

1286
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:37,610
