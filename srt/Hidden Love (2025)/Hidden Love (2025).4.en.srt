00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 4=

4
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,510
Strange.

5
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,960
Madam Ping can't keep her mouth shut.

6
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,840
I'm afraid if she sees us,
it might cause a misunderstanding.

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,150
That wouldn't be good.

8
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,120
Where's the Kapok hairpin I gave you

9
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,630
before I left for the front?

10
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,910
Why aren't you wearing it?

11
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,689
Who are you?

12
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,840
Go away.

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,990
Why are you just getting up?

14
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,689
Mr. Zhen has already departed.

15
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,960
He left this for you.

16
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,630
My shougongsha mark...
(*Virginity mark)

17
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,280
It's getting late.

18
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,910
I'm heading back to my room.

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,390
(Chu,)

20
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,790
(do you truly like him?)

21
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,670
(I can't go on like this.)

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,830
(Since this is a doomed fate,)

23
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,790
(I should end it now.)

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,879
So

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,600
you're interested in

26
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,880
General Li?

27
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,759
Mother,

28
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,089
hurry and send a matchmaker
to propose marriage?

29
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,209
Why the rush?

30
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,209
You're a lady.

31
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,759
You should be restrained.

32
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,529
Besides,

33
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,409
Li Zhen may be promising,

34
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,390
but his family is below our station.

35
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,039
If a proposal is to be made,

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,070
they should do it.

37
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,559
Don't worry.

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,089
All right.

39
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,320
Yes, Mother.

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,720
Mother,

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,879
I like the second young lady
of Li Family.

42
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,390
Please allow us to be together, Mother.

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,630
You mean

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,910
that illegitimate daughter?

45
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,200
She's the illegitimate daughter
of Li family.

46
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,830
The second young lady, Li Chuchu.

47
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,529
(This girl...)

48
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,390
(Why does she look familiar?)

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,319
(I think I've seen her somewhere)

50
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,040
(long ago.)

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,529
Taking her in as a concubine

52
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,910
would be acceptable.

53
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,209
But her face

54
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,560
is somehow irritating.

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,440
I'd like to

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,600
make her my principal wife.

57
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,230
Have you lost your mind?

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,849
As long as I'm alive,

59
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,759
you're not deciding

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,480
your marriage.

61
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,440
Chu,

62
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,950
what am I supposed to do with you?

63
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,470
Zhen, do you really have to go to war?

64
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,969
I don't want you to leave.

65
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,390
Once I win,

66
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,710
I'll return.

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,830
Chu.

68
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,240
Zhen,

69
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
take this hairpin back.

70
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,719

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,680
right?

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,630
You're so heartless.

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,920

79
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,630

82
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,120

Why can't you find a way to help?

128
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,120
Or do you only think of yourself

129
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,030
and not of our mother?

130
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,470

you and Madam?

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,969
Since you're not pure anymore,

133
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,399
