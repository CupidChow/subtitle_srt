=Episode 19=

4
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,419
Someone.

5
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,619
Apprehend Miss Qianqian

6
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,000
and send her to the woodshed.

7
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,670
You!

8
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,240
What are you doing?

9
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,449
I need to see Mother.

10
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,920
I need to see Mother!

11
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,569
Miss Qianqian,
if you want to blame someone,

12
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,670
you should blame Miss Chuchu
for not dropping the matter.

13
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,800
Madam has no choice either.

14
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,419
She can't just allow you
to spout nonsense outside

15
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,209
and implicate the entire family.

16
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,390
Take her away.

17
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,699
Let me go!

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,539
Let me go!

19
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,800
Let me go!

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,700
(Memorial tablet of
Lady Li of the Zhang clan)

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,339
Miss Chuchu,

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,089
you should at least eat something.

23
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,470
If this keeps up,
your body won't be able to take it.

24
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,000
How's the investigation?

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,280
Miss Qianqian has already
been locked away in the woodshed

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,430
as she awaits punishment.

27
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,889
Seems like Madam is bent on

28
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,550
making her the scapegoat.

29
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,920
I should've expected this to happen.

30
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,600
Find someone to tail Madam Ping.

31
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,990
After that...

32
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,609
General,

33
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,169
Third Prince has returned
to Anping County from Jiangling.

34
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,699
I'm sure he's the mastermind

35
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,670
behind the accusations
that were targeted at you.

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,699
Since he has made his move,
that means he's in a hurry.

37
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,219
The more impatient he is,

38
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,670
the more evidence he'll leave behind.

39
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,270
It'll be more beneficial to us as well.

40
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,889
But you've already been
suspended from your post.

41
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,729
And, we don't have enough evidence

42
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,360
to convict him of colluding with
our enemies and committing treason.

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,270
What if Third Prince
uses this opportunity

44
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,979
to take down our family?

45
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,990
If so...

46
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,800
Head to the capital personally.

47
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,430
You must deliver this
to Crown Prince yourself.

48
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,870
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,289
Chu.

50
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,169
Zhen.

51
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,099
Last time, you said you would
uphold justice for me.

52
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,830
Does that still count?

53
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,550
Zhen.

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,699
You invited me and my fellow elders

55
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,990
to the ancestral hall today.

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,080
I wonder what's going on.

57
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,169
Dear elders,

58
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,240
my mother suffered a terrible death.

59
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,080
It's because someone poisoned her.

60
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,419
(Ledger)
This is Jixiang Medicine Store's ledger.

61
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,539
It states that Madam Ping,
Mother's maidservant,

62
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,080
had purchased medicine there

63
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,920
three days ago,

64
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,240
Madam Ping.

65
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,080
What's going on?

66
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,289
Madam, I'm innocent!

67
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,009
Madam!

68
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,329
Back then, I was supposed to head out
to complete some tasks.

69
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,859
Miss Qianqian said
Madam Zhang was unwell.

70
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,009
She instructed me to buy her some herbs.

71
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm old,
and I know nothing about medicine.

72
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,379
I had no idea

73
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,859
that those herbs

74
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,870
would harm someone!

75
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,400
Madam Ping,

76
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,019
you're Mother's most trusted servant.

77
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,369
Why would you follow
Qianqian's instructions willingly?

78
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,339
Miss Chuchu, what do you mean by that?

79
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,369
Don't tell me

80
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,920
you're suspicious of me.

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,070
I dare not.

82
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,280
However, someone died because of this.

83
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,049
If we allow the culprit
to get away scot-free,

84
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,510
I'm afraid Madam Zhang

85
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,169
cannot rest in peace.

86
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,289
Such audacity.

87
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,430
Someone.

88
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,960
Slap her.

89
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,550
Mother, please be appeased.

90
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,019
Chuchu is still grieving over her loss.

91
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,659
That's why she couldn't control herself.

92
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,689
Why don't we bring Qianqian here

93
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,550
and confront Madam Ping?

94
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,430
Bring Qianqian here.

95
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,750
Miss Qianqian,

96
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,979
were you the one who wanted Madam Ping

97
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,960
to help you buy medicine
at Jixiang Medicine Store?

98
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,600
Were you the one
who fed her the wrong medicine

99
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,990
and caused her to die of poisoning?

100
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,809
(If you wish to survive,)

101
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,360
(your only way is to admit
that it was an accident.)

102
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,480
(If not,)

103
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,040
(you'll be sent to the underworld
together with your mother.)

104
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,480
Miss Qianqian,

105
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,840
did you hear Madam's words clearly?

106
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,600
Give us your answer.

107
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,019
Li Qianqian,

108
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,400
have you lost your mind?

109
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,400
I got the prescription wrong.

110
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,360
Madam Zhang died because of that.

111
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,960
Mother, elders, please punish me.

112
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,979
Miss Qianqian is still
young and insensible.

113
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,190
Elders, please go easy on her.

114
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,219
Since that's the case,
Miss Qianqian shall be sent

115
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,369
to the countryside estate
for her to reflect upon her mistakes.

116
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,070
She shall not return here again.

117
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,280
You guys are dismissed

118
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,400
No!

119
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,369
That's not the case!

120
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,899
The truth hasn't been brought to light!

121
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,190
That's just her testimony!

122
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,019
Wait! You guys can't just leave like that!

123
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,560
I'll report this
to the local authorities!

124
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,099
I'll let them investigate the case!

125
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,859
Chu,

126
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,019
you mustn't.

127
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,750
We can't afford to blow this up.

128
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,430
But why?

129
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,550
Do you believe them as well?

130
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,960
Do you think
I'm being unreasonable as well?

131
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,360
I, Li Chuchu, swear

132
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,400
that I won't let my mother
suffer a wrongful death!

133
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,579
You've spoiled Chuchu so much

134
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,190
that she no longer fears anything.

135
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,859
If this keeps up,

136
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,430
it won't end well.

137
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,400
Mother, I'm afraid you're the only one

138
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,840
who knows the truth fully well.

139
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,169
Please watch out.

140
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,400
You!

141
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:59,779
(Li's Mansion)

142
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,960
Li Qianqian.

143
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,169
This is the dowry Madam Zhang
had kept for you.

144
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,670
Take it with you.

145
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,310
Li Qianqian,

146
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,240
what exactly are you up to?

147
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,920
What has Madam Zhang done to offend you?

148
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,809
The worst thing she did

149
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,550
was adopting you.

150
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,659
Li Chuchu,

151
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,019
what goes around comes around.

152
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,800
I won't let you live in peace

153
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,440
as long as I'm alive.

154
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,820
(Memorial tablet of
Lady Li of the Zhang clan)

155
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,750
Sorry, Madam Zhang.

156
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,080
I was inept.

157
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,790
What are you doing here?

158
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,080
Chu,

159
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,489
let me explain myself.

160
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,440
There's nothing for you to explain.

161
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,009
You said you would support me

162
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,150
in avenging Madam Zhang.

163
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,889
In the end,

164
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,609
you sided with the murderer.

165
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,299
I should've known

166
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,179
that you would prioritize
the family's reputation

167
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,649
above all else.

168
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,179
Everything else

169
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,790
is expendable to you.

170
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,990
Chu,

171
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,979
I know you're upset.

172
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,080
But now, I have no choice.

173
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,009
I have to prioritize the bigger picture.

174
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,240
The bigger picture, huh?

175
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,080
If, one day,

176
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,150
my presence is endangering
your so-called "bigger picture,"

177
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,979
will you give up on me

178
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,390
without any hesitations as well?

179
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,910
Chu,

180
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,179
we've been through so much together.

181
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,840
We even made a vow
in front of our ancestors.

182
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,390
Have you

183
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,859
never trusted me before?

184
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,649
Zhen, are you able
to send your own mother

185
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,560
to prison, then?

186
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,080
I...

187

Miss Chuchu,

200
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,579
you look pale.

201
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,649
We should get a physician
to check on you.

202
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,840
I'm fine.

203
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,059
I'm just exhausted from handling

204
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,270
Madam Zhang's funeral.

205
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,299
Miss Chuchu,

206
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,600
are you okay?

207
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,990
I'm fine.

208
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,369
I think you haven't had

209
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,080
your period for the month.

210
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,150
Your Highness.

211
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,080
Your Highness.

212
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,990
Although I'm the one
handling the Duke's Mansion now,

213
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,179
I'm not officially in charge.

214
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,360
Is there

215
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,819
any way for me

216
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,560
to inherit the title
as soon as possible?

217
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,360
Why the rush?

218
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,649
The incident with your mother

219
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,150
had alarmed Father.

220
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,560
You should be grateful that
you retained your title as the heir.

221
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,059
Don't do anything unnecessary.

222
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,750
We should plan things through.

223
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,440
Yes, Your Highness.

224
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,150
Thank you for the reminder.

225
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,200
Your Highness.

226
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,179
This is ridiculous!

227
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,179
Your Highness,

228
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,409
what happened?

229
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,960
Crown Prince has dismissed
some members of my faction.

230
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,390
He even submitted a memorial
to strongly defend Li Zhen.

231
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,000
Now, not only has he been reinstated,

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,460
but he has also gained military command
over two more provinces.

233
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,320
This...

234
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,409
Your Highness,

235
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,560
General Qilin, Li Zhen,
seeks an audience.

236
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,009
Physician.

237
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,200
How is her condition?

238
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,960
She's pregnant.

239
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,129
The lady

240
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,440
has been pregnant for about a month.

241
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,680
It's just that...

242
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,080
What is it?

243
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,240
Her pulses are erratic.

244
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,080
It seems likely
that she'll suffer a miscarriage.

245
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,360
There's a high possibility

246
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,560
that she'll lose the child.

247
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,150
Greetings, Your Highness.

248
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,769
General.

249
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,200
Spare the formalities.

250
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,009
Initially, I wanted
to visit you personally

251
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,560
to congratulate you on being reinstated.

252
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,179
But you came to visit me first.

253
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,240
Your Highness, I have something

254
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,059
to ask you personally.

255
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,699
Please go ahead.

256
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,150
I shall tell you everything I know.

257
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,609
Mr. Lin, there's no need to leave.

258
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,440
This matter concerns
your family as well.

259
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,339
Three years ago,
during the Battle of Jiangling,

260
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,480
the defense deployment map
was leaked for no reason,

261
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,400
causing my father
to suffer a wrongful death.

262
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,750
Your Highness, I assume
you instructed the late duke to do so, right?

263
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,720
General, do you have any evidence?

264
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,720
I don't.

265
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,059
Someone.

266
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,240
Take him down!

267
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,440
Physician.

268
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,699
Please keep this a secret.

269
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,910
I'm begging you.

270
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,560
Understood.

271
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,649
What did you say?

272
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,219
Li Chuchu is pregnant?

273
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,409
That's right.

274
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,889
I saw Mingyue behaving sneakily
when I was observing her.

275
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,720
Therefore, I kept an eye on her.

276
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,790
Zhen has just been reinstated
not long ago,

277
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,790
and now, this is actually happening?

278
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,200
What should we do?

279
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,099
Madam,

280
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,080
you must hang in there.

281
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,440
We can't allow her to keep the child.
