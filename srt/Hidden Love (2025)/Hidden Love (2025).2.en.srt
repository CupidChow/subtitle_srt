=Hidden Love=

00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,858
=Episode 2=

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,230
Chuchu,

5
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,910
do you think our lives will improve

6
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,439
now that Zhen has been promoted
to General?

7
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,020
We're just

8
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,070
lowly illegitimate daughters.

9
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,719
If we don't find a way
to escape this cage,

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,799
we'll end up

11
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,100
as helpless pawns.

12
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,719
Miss Chuchu,

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,460
Madam is coming this way
with Miss Tiantian.

14
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,740
Mother.

15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,519
Mother.

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,439
It was my fault.

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,719
Please calm down, Mother.

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,109
How bold of you.

19
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,469
You disrupted the wedding.

20
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,660
And worse, you lied.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,879
Mother,

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,229
tonight should be a joyous occasion.

23
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,829
Please spare Chuchu.

24
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,990
Mother,

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,029
these concubine's daughters

26
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,719
need to be disciplined.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,630
Only beatings can make them remember.

28
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,260
Chuchu, help me.

29
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,540
Chuchu...

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,590
Stop.

31
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,380
It's only light punishment today.

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,999
Now that Zhen has been promoted.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,399
We'll be dealing with noble families.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,399
Keep them in check.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,910
Don't embarrass us.

36
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,790
Are you all right, Qianqian?

37
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,100
Does it hurt?

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,230
Chuchu, why didn't you
surrender just now?

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,860
The more we surrender,

40
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,230
the harsher the beatings will be.

41
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,700
Why?

42
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,399
Why must we be

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,309
daughters of a concubine?

44
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,190
It's not fair.

45
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,029
When I marry a powerful official

46
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,420
and become a noble lady,

47
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,510
no one will dare trample us again.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,719
(Mother has driven me into a corner.)

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,349
(I must act now.)

50
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,820
(I must find a way)

51
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,540
(to leave this mansion.)

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,349
Madam, the flower appreciation banquet at
the Duke of Lin's Mansion is coming.

53
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,999
Madam Qiao sent an invitation

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,029
to Mr. Zhen

55
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,230
and the three young ladies.

56
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,119
Mother,

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,630
I heard the heir, Mr. Lin,
is just of marriageable age.

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,140
I suppose they're choosing
a wife for him.

59
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,879
Prepare for it.

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,940
It'd be best
if we could become a family.

61
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,789
Zhen,

62
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,629
you're also of age now.

63
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,349
There are plenty of noble ladies

64
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,349
in Anping County.

65
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,789
But I think

66
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,839
the most compatible match

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,309
would be the daughter
of the Duke of Lin.

68
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,420
Mother,

69
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,470
I don't want to marry a noble lady.

70
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,750
I only want...

71
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,700
Miss Chuchu,

72
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,839
I made some soup for you.

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,509
It's in the kitchen.

74
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,469
Keep an eye on it.

75
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,910
Don't let it dry out.

76
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,510
Yes.

77
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,980
She's the second young lady
of the General's Mansion.

78
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,509
How could you make her
serve as an escort?

79
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,660
How dare you?

80
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,829
How could you speak to me
in such a manner?

81
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,270
From now on, you don't need
to trouble yourself with Chuchu's affairs.

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,060
I'll handle that.

83
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,950
(Duke's Mansion)
General Qilin, you grace us

84
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,150
with your presence.

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,740
You flatter me, Madam.

86
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,350
This is my daughter, Shuhui.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,659
Mr. Lin has arrived.

88
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,164
(Beautiful Land and Bright Minds)

89
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,150
Greetings, Mother.

90
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,230
Please be seated.

91
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,910
Madam, Mr. Lin, please present flowers
to the young ladies.

92
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,879
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

93
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,180
You're welcome.

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,470
The flowers suit you perfectly.

95
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,830
She's a fair lady.

96
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,919
Such a shame.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,420
She looks like trouble.

98
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:36,250
(Li's Mansion)

99
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,740
Miss Chuchu,

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,239
I fell for you at first sight.

101
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,540
I earnestly wish to marry you.

102
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,620
I appreciate that, Mr. Lin.

103
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,039
But marriage

104
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,149
isn't for me to decide.

105
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,860
We can't make such decisions on our own.

106
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,239
That sounds like

107
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,709
you're willing to marry me.

108
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,919
Don't worry, Miss Chuchu.

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,559
I'll ask my mother

110
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,300
to send a matchmaker
to propose marriage soon.

111
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,879
(Mr. Lin doesn't look like
a frivolous person.)

112
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,950
(The Duke is influential and powerful.)

113
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,590
(They could protect my birth mother
and Qianqian in the future.)

114
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,660
He's already gone.

115
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,590
Are you sad to see him go?

116
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,710
Are you acquainted with Mr. Lin?

117
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,470
We just met.

118
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,540
And you accepted his gift right away?

119
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,790
Give it back to me.

120
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,799
(But I'm afraid)

121
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,660
(Mother won't agree so easily.)

122
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,390
(Nor will Zhen.)

123
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,119
Who's there?

124
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,999
Mingyue,

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,119
is that you outside?

126
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,799
Chu,

127
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,860
it's me.

128
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,189
What are you doing here?

129
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,470
Go.

130
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,350
Don't be afraid.

131
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,660
I came here to bring you medicine.

132
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,540
What are you trying to do?

133
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,740
The venom must be removed now.

134
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,189
This snake is poisonous.

135
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,350
Bear with it.

136
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,599
Madam,

137
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,799
what brings you here?

138
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,949
Please wait a moment.

139
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,389
I'll inform Miss Chuchu.

140
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,540
Get out of my way.

141
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,599
Is there something

142
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,390
you need me to do, Mother?

143
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,660
Don't be anxious, Miss Chuchu.

144
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,189
I came here to apologize.

145
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,540
It wasn't my intention

146
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,710
over these years.

147
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,790
Please don't say that, Mother.

148
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,950
I dare not accept such words.

149
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,509
Thank you for saving me, Zhen.

150
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,359
But men and women
should keep their distance.

151
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,740
People might gossip.

152
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,900
If you don't have anything urgent
in the future,

153
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,839
please don't come by again.

154
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,549
Is this because of Mr. Lin?

155
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,550
I don't want my reputation ruined,

156
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,230
and I don't want Mr. Lin
to misunderstand.

157
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,380
Do you really have feelings
for Lin Ansheng?

158
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,260
Yes.

159
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,119
I won't marry anyone.

160
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,669
I'll stay with you forever.

161
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,780
Pinky promise.

162
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,380
So it was just a childish joke.

163
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,350
I'm the only one who takes it seriously.

164
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:09,400
♪Won't have to wither♪

165
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,908
♪Obsessive thoughts grow like vines♪

166
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:17,910
♪Feeding our illusions♪

167
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:22,957
♪I hold tight to the pain in my palm,
in your embrace♪

168
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,780
I don't care about

169
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,710
status or birth.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,830
I only wish for
a person who shares my heart

171
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,500
to spend my life with.

172
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,500
It's just a hairpin.

173
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,670
Why do you care so much?

174
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,550
As long as it's from someone I like,

175
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,190
I will cherish it dearly,

176
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,310
even if it's a stone.

177
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,860
(Could Zhen really...)

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,999
(No.)

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,310
(He won't.)

180
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,670
(He won't be so foolish.)

181
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,479
Madam,

182
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,860
Mr. Zhen is here.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,950
It's better to plan ahead

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,670
before things get worse.

185
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,550
Mother.

186
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,959
Zhen,

187
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,119
I'm not feeling well today.

188
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,600
Your grandfather in the southern part
of the city is seriously ill.

189
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,999
Visit him on my behalf.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,079
You don't need to rush back tonight.

191
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,550
Wasn't he getting better

192
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,500
a few days ago?

193
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,389
He's old,

194
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,149
and his condition is always relapsing.

195
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,500
I'll only feel at ease
if I check on him.

196
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,590
Yes, Mother.

197
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,500
Is everything set?

198
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,980
Don't worry, Madam.

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,509
I've carefully chosen

200
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,479
a fine marriage for Miss Chuchu.

201
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,670
The betrothal gift alone is generous.

202
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,860
Chu, are you in?

203
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,900
If you have something to say,
say it from the outside.

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,500
I'm traveling far.

205
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,199
Don't come out if you can.

206
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,269
If something comes up,

207
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,860
wait for me to return.

208
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,079
Chuchu,

209
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,839
don't be upset,

210
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,950
all right?

211
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,100
Zhen knows he was wrong.

212
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,629
Do it as I do.

213
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,830
Smile.

214
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,830
After all these years,

215
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,140
he's just like what he was.

216
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,550
Miss Chuchu,

217
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,389
Madam sends for you

218
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,980
for an important matter.

219
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,190
Mother, were you looking for me?

220
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,719
My dear Chuchu,

221
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,310
you've grown into a lovely lady.

222
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,900
Dear,

223
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,029
speaking of which, you're of age now,

224
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,629
but you're still unmarried.

225
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,549
That worries me very much.

226
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,590
(Could it be)

227
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,380
(that the Lin family has come
with a proposal?)

228
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,719
Thank you for your concern, Mother.

229
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,669
Luckily,

230
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,509
I've chosen a fine husband for you.

231
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,359
He may not come from a prominent family,

232
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,199
but he's rich enough.

233
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,470
Get ready.

234
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,959
You'll be married off tonight.

235
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,070
Mother,

236
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,860
I'm not in a rush to marry.

237
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,549
That's not

238
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,239
up to you.

239
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,029
Madam Ping,

240
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,909
prepare the bride properly.

241
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,950
Make sure her new in-laws are pleased.

242
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,260
No.

243
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,670
No.

244
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,100
No.

245
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,780
Mother!

246
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,900
Miss Chuchu!

247
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,100
Miss Chuchu!

248
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,550
Miss Chuchu!

249
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,000
Miss Qianqian, Miss Chuchu has been tied up
and forced into a bridal sedan.

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,629
What?

251
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,190
Are you sure it was her?

252
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,509
I only got a glance,

253
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,980
but I'm sure.

254
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,070
Well.

255
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,119
Try

256
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,550
to inform Zhen

257
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,879
without exposing yourself.

258
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,980
Otherwise,

259
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,350
we'll become the thorn
in the side of Mother and Tiantian.

260
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,980
We'll be even more trouble then.

261
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,230
Yes.

262
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,850
(Wedding)

263
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,710
The auspicious hour has arrived.

264
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,380
The ceremony starts now.

265
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,980
First bow.

266
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,860
Once again.

267
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,780
Third bow.

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:39,117
