00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 3=

4
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,219
(Wedding)

5
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,900
The auspicious hour has arrived.

6
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,500
The ceremony begins now.

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,170
First bow.

8
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,060
Once again.

9
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,010
Third bow.

10
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,440
(Memorial Tablet of Zhao Muwen)

11
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,379
(Jiang's Mansion)

12
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,530
General.

13
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,900
It just arrived.

14
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,520
(Li Chuchu is to be married tonight.)

15
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,509
Let's go.

16
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,349
Back home.

17
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,450
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,299
You're marrying me to a dead man?

19
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,219
Hurry up.

20
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,219
The groom is waiting for you
to be buried together.

21
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,069
If you're lucky,

22
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,219
you two

23
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,579
might catch tonight's last boat

24
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,700
at the River of Oblivion Bridge.

25
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,659
Anyway,

26
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,429
why are you so furious?

27
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,149
As long as the bride price
is high enough,

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,909
plenty of families

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,060
are happy to send their daughters here.

30
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,739
I won't marry!

31
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,130
Ghost marriage is strictly forbidden
in this country.

32
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,130
I'll report you to the yamen.

33
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,429
Why are you all standing there?
Grab her.

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,229
Beat her to death.

35
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,850
Beat her!

36
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,690
Mr. Lin.

37
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,389
You...

38
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,780
Why are you laughing?

39
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,060
How foolish you are.

40
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,460
Think about it.

41
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,269
With my looks

42
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,690
and the skills I've mastered,

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,269
selling me to a dead man

44
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,059
won't fetch more profit

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,620
than selling to the living.

46
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,850
You're quite a beauty.

47
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,019
If I sell you to that lecher,

48
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,970
the Marquis of Changping,

49
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,370
I could live comfortably
for the rest of my life.

50
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,300
You!

51
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,949
Fire!

52
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,060
Fire!

53
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,740
Miss Chuchu,

54
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,340
are you all right?

55
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,059
I can't go back to Li's Mansion.

56
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,850
I can't go back to Li's Mansion.

57
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,180
Zhen.

58
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,780
Zhen, where are you?

59
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,410
Miss Chuchu,

60
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,970
it's time to greet your guest.

61
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,050
Help!

62
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,380
Miss Chuchu.

63
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,490
Come.

64
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,530
Miss Chuchu,

65
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,580
you're awake.

66
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,970
Before you fainted, you mumbled that you
wouldn't return to Li's Mansion.

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,970
I had no choice

68
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,700
but to bring you to an inn.

69
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,220
You saved me again.

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,939
I don't know

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,940
how I can repay you.

72
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,940
There's no need to say that between us.

73
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,900
Miss Chuchu,

74
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,900
will you tell me what happened?

75
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,490
(Perhaps)

76
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,739
(Lin Ansheng is the one)

77
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,140
(who can help me.)

78
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,989
Mr. Lin,

79
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,730
why did you bring my sister
to an inn in the middle of the night?

80
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,869
Both of you are here alone.

81
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,220
What are your intentions?

82
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,939
You've misunderstood, Zhen.

83
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,850
Mr. Lin saved me.

84
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,619
Chu,

85
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,469
come with me.

86
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,700
General Li.

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,380
What did your family do to Miss Chuchu

88
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,699
to leave her wandering the streets

89
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,589
in a bloodstained cloak
in the middle of the night?

90
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,499
This is a family matter.

91
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,780
It's no place for an outsider
to interfere.

92
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,530
Who says I'm an outsider?

93
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,179
Miss Chuchu and I
are fond of each other.

94
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,259
Soon,

95
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,140
I'll propose marriage

96
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,780
to her.

97
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,650
As her brother,

98
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,379
without my consent,

99
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,850
this marriage

100
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,460
will never happen.

101
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,499
Why do you oppose it?

102
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,619
Speaking of family background

103
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,700
and character,

104
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,469
I'm one of the finest man

105
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,669
in Anping County.

106
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,700
Enough, Mr. Lin.

107
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,780
I've made up my mind.

108
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,460
Please leave.

109
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,220
Miss Chuchu, don't worry.

110
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,850
I won't give up on you.

111
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,170
Weren't you traveling far?

112
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,499
Why are you here?

113
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,530
Why?

114
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,619
Was I disturbing

115
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,490
you and Mr. Lin?

116
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,530
You shouldn't have come.

117
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,530
Chu,

118
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,460
don't be naive.

119
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,909
Lin Ansheng doesn't yet control

120
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,349
the Duke's Mansion.

121
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,170
It won't be easy for you

122
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,940
to become his wife.

123
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,819
Are you hurt?

124
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,970
Where?

125
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,650
Mr. Zhen,

126
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,259
Madam sent me

127
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,940
to escort you both back.

128
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,640
(Li's Mansion)

129
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,469
Mother,

130
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,669
you're still chanting

131
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,530
at a time like this?

132
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,869
Stay calm.

133
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,850
Next time,
she won't be able to get away.

134
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,220
Who won't be able to get away, Mother?

135
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,869
Are you here

136
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,850
to question me?

137
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,139
Zhen,

138
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,780
we only wanted to find Chuchu
a suitable match.

139
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,469
If anything went wrong,

140
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,050
it's her fate to blame...

141
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,700
You!

142
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,850
You actually slapped me
for that wretched girl?

143
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,700
You're hopeless.

144
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,179
Starting today,

145
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,739
you'll be under house arrest
for a month.

146
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,850
You're not allowed to leave your room.

147
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,900
Zhen,

148
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,619
Miss Chuchu is your half-sister.

149
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,410
You seem to be too concerned for her.

150
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,819
Qilin Army won a major victory.

151
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,220
Mother, are you aware

152
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,610
that how many officials will impeach me

153
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,290
for mistreating a concubine's daughter

154
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,939
if this gets out?

155
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,050
You...

156
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,490
Forget it.

157
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,499
I won't intervene

158
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,490
with Miss Chuchu's marriage anymore.

159
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,730
I hope you'll keep your word.

160
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,850
Don't disappoint me again.

161
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,580
He's insane.

162
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,460
Zhen lost his mind.

163
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,700
(If I wish to get out of here,)

164
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,090
(maybe marriage is my only way out.)

165
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,700
Chu.

166
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,130
Why are you here, Zhen?

167
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,899
What's this?

168
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,610
Rouge of Zuihong Pavilion.

169
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,370
Chu,

170
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,090
your coming-of-age ceremony
is in a few days.

171
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,019
What do you want for your birthday gift?

172
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,010
I want rouge from Zuihong Pavilion.

173
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,379
I heard it's rare and precious.

174
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,540
Very well.

175
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,829
Zhen,

176
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,060
this is bad!

177
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,010
Something happened to your father!

178
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,540
This gift is too valuable.

179
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,610
Please take it back.

180
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,130
Besides,

181
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,940
I don't like rouge anymore.

182
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,490
Now that Mr. Zhen has returned,

183
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,730
be more alert during night patrols.

184
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,349
Make sure no indecent affairs occur

185
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,300
that could disgrace
the General's Mansion.

186
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,420
Who's there?

187
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,450
♪Fallen into rumors,
a sweet dream is disrupted♪

188
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:48,370
♪I'm just a speck of dust,
stained with worldly attachments♪

189
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,589
♪If illusion and reality go on
year after year♪

190
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:01,260
♪My obsession is rekindled
by a dying kiss♪

191
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,120
♪Though withered grass leaves no trace,
