00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 16=

4
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:10,620
(Duke's Mansion)

5
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,709
(This crafty wretch,)

6
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,019
(she did all this just so
I could agree to their marriage.)

7
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,700
(What exactly is she up to?)

8
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,149
Mother,

9
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,429
you have to say something.

10
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,739
We can't just let them
fool around like this.

11
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,179
Madam, I think it's fine
to agree to it for the time being.

12
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,980
Let's deal with today's issue for now.

13
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,980
Since the marriage agreement is genuine,

14
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,659
the Duke's Mansion

15
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,629
shall acknowledge the marriage.

16
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,220
Off with you all.

17
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,340
Mr. Lin and I are deeply in love.

18
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,219
Since the marriage has been confirmed,

19
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,060
it's better to hold it early than late.

20
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,819
It's an auspicious date

21
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,930
ten days later.

22
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,780
Li Chuchu,

23
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,700
do not get ahead of yourself here.

24
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,370
Patience brings resolution.

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,140
Mother,

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,170
please give us your blessings.

27
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,860
Fine.

28
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,869
You'll get what you wish for.

29
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,530
The wedding will be held in ten days.

30
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,530
Mr. Lin,

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,429
I can finally be married to you now.

32
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,530
I hope that you won't blame me
for my recklessness today.

33
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,220
Chuchu.

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,499
You're only doing this

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,900
because of my incompetence.

36
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,460
Why would I blame you for this?

37
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,370
See you in ten days, then.

38
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,669
This is ridiculous.

39
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,530
That wretch, Li Chuchu,

40
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,460
how dare she coerce me into doing so?

41
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,930
With their ties, An mustn't marry her.

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,740
The heavens will punish them.

43
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,690
Madam, there's no need to be furious.

44
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,530
We still don't know if they can
hold their wedding smoothly.

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,389
Even so, we're the ones

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,829
who decide

47
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,810
if they can consummate or not.

48
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,829
By then, when
she arrives at our mansion,

49
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,250
you can have your way with her.

50
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,220
There are plenty of ways
we can make her disappear.

51
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,930
You're right.

52
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,650
Even if she's lucky enough
to marry into our family,

53
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,220
she has to have the luck to survive.

54
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,618
(Miss Chuchu and Lin Ansheng)

55
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:41,869
(will be married in ten days.)

56
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,370
(Is Chu going to marry Lin Ansheng?)

57
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,970
General.

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,709
Third Prince is starting to act.

59
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,740
It seems like
they're going to meet at Fengyue Villa.

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,060
(Zhen,)

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,850
(my plan)

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,530
(is going to work soon.)

63
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,530
Madam?

64
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,970
Do you need anything?

65
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,650
Are you sure you want to marry Mr. Lin?

66
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,909
I've already made up my mind.

67
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,699
But you two are blood siblings.

68
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,229
The heavens will punish
you two for incest.

69
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,429
Moreover, Zhen isn't at home.

70
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,109
If you act on your own whim...

71
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,469
Madam, don't worry.

72
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,900
I know what I'm doing.

73
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,700
Fine, then.

74
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,900
But I'm afraid

75
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,380
Madam will never agree to it.

76
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,940
Madam, you're wrong.

77
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,460
This is literally her wish.

78
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,380
Li Chuchu wishes to get married.

79
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,340
Just let her be.

80
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,580
Do not let anyone stop her.

81
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,020
It's better to part ways
with this jinx as soon as possible.

82
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,970
She can marry into
whichever family she likes

83
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,460
as long as she can
sever her ties with Zhen.

84
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,789
Yes,

85
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,940
Mother.

86
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,240
(Double Bliss)

87
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,650
Zhen.

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,379
Weren't you going to remain in Jiangling
for a few more days?

89
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,059
What's wrong?

90
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,939
Chuchu, you're getting married.
How could you not tell me about it?

91
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,059
According to the rules,

92
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,220
I should carry you to the palanquin.

93
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,939
You should leave now.

94
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,090
Chu.

95
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,909
You still have time to turn back.

96
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,109
Zhen, you're overthinking it.

97
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,880
(Li Mansion)

98
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,400
(Li Mansion)

99
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,380
Since I've made up my mind,

100
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,699
I'll never regret it.

101
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,699
What if...

102
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,050
That won't happen.

103
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,059
I've plotted for this for a long time.

104
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,229
It's impossible,
and I won't allow anyone

105
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,970
to jeopardize my efforts.

106
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,970
Have it ever occurred to you

107
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,780
that I didn't send you back

108
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,650
just for you to leave me again?

109
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,220
Zhen,

110
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,410
this isn't the time for this.

111
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,729
(Duke's Mansion)

112
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,560
(Double Bliss)

113
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,760
(Duke's Mansion)

114
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,499
Zhen.

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,700
Don't worry.

116
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,900
I know what I'm doing.

117
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,780
You should hurry and leave.

118
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,730
Zhen.

119
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,820
Once today's over,

120
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,909
I'll go back and make it up to you.

121
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,050
Okay?

122
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,320
(Duke's Mansion)

123
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,490
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

124
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,370
Bow to each other's parents.

125
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,180
My poor sister!

126
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,370
You suffered a wrongful death!

127
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,949
You were innocent!

128
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,989
- My poor sister!
- Who's there?

129
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,019
How dare you sabotage my wedding?

130
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,660
My sister was
the old duke's legitimate wife.

131
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,229
She was harmed by someone
from this family!

132
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,370
I came here to uphold justice for her!

133
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,090
Someone!

134
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,460
Chase him away!

135
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,180
Wait.

136
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,730
Madam.

137
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,540
Today's the wedding between
my sister and your son.

138
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,949
I ought to avoid suspicion.

139
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,739
But as General Qilin,

140
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,130
I have to listen to
the people's grievances.

141
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,940
Bring it inside!

142
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,340
This is my sister's coffin.

143
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,379
General, you may examine it right now.

144
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,349
The truth will be brought to light!

145
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,460
No!

146
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,869
Today's my son's big day.

147
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,709
How could you attempt
such inauspicious deeds?

148
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,829
General Li, although
you're stationed at Anping County,

149
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,709
such affairs

150
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,419
aren't under your jurisdiction.

151
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,139
You're butting in too blatantly.

152
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,370
Do you have an ulterior motive?

153
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,829
There are civil grievances.

154
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,730
Naturally, as the county prefect,
I shall make the call here.

155
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,580
Madam,

156
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,250
human life is above all else.

157
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,820
This old man said he was wronged.

158
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,820
I think it's better
for us to investigate the case

159
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,060
so that your family's reputation
won't be tainted.

160
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,619
Prefect Zhao, don't listen to that man.

161
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,660
He came here
to stir up trouble on purpose.

162
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,700
Why are you guys still standing there?

163
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,850
Kick him out!

164
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,250
Mister,

165
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,229
you have to think carefully.

166
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,619
If they remove the lid

167
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,829
and find nothing wrong with it,

168
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,539
then what you did today, barging into
the wedding of the Duke's Mansion,

169
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,539
will amount to a serious charge.

170
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,019
If I'm wrong,

171
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,019
I'm willing to bear
the responsibilities.

172
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,019
Enough!

173
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,309
You guys are speaking in unison.

174
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,349
Could it be that you guys
were in cahoots all along?

175
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,539
Are you guys trying
to embarrass our family here?

176
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,730
Madam,

177
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,139
everyone has witnessed this.

178
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,220
If news of this gets out,
and His Majesty wants to punish someone,

179
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,469
I'm afraid your family
will have no way out.

180
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,460
If so, we can talk about it
once the imperial edict is here.

181
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,580
Mother,

182
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,180
since our conscience is clear,

183
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,600
I think it doesn't matter
even if they examine the body.

184
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,180
Remove the coffin lid.

185
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,899
Before my sister died,

186
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,349
she swallowed this ring.

187
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,730
I'm sure it's her way
of testifying against her murderer!

188
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,220
That's fine.

189
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,420
We have our ledgers in order.

190
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,469
We can find out

191
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,709
who the ring belongs to

192
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,220
and when it was procured.

193
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,189
Madam

194
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,499
granted such rings to servants like us.

195
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,730
Madam Qi.

196
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,349
It was all my fault.

197
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,940
I hated that the ex-female head
had oppressed my mistress.

198
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,250
Therefore, I murdered her.

199
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,460
I never expected

200
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,349
you all to find me

201
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,250
after all these years.

202
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,730
Fine.

203
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,420
I'll bear responsibility for my actions.

204
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,220
I shall pay for her life

205
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,060
with mine!

206
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,660
Madam Qi!

207
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,010
You guys have investigated the case.

208
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,940
And, the culprit has been located.

209
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,370
Let her be laid to rest
as soon as possible.

210
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,869
Although she has confessed to her crime,

211
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,019
she's still one of
your family's old servants.

212
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,019
If we don't investigate
this case thoroughly,

213
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,869
people might gossip about you.

214
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,580
I have a clear conscience.

215
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,250
I'm not afraid of any gossip.

216
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,700
Madam, do you truly mean that?

217
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,619
Or are you saying that
because you have a guilty conscience?

218
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,109
Li Zhen.

219
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,460
What do you mean by that?

220
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,949
Are you saying
that my mother is the murderer?

221
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,060
Is that what you mean?

222
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,420
Mr. Lin.

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,469
Zhen is just worried that I might
be married to the wrong person.

224
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,890
That's why he's anxious.

225
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,540
Since Madam is innocent,

226
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,370
she doesn't need
to fear an investigation.

227
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,730
