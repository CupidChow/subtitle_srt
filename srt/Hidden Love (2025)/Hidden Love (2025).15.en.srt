=Episode 15=

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,380
Zhen, how did you know
that we cannot become a couple?

5
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,230
Do you know
that we aren't blood siblings?

6
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,710
Chu,

7
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,180
what did you say?

8
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,300
My biological mother

9
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,469
was Duke of Lin's original wife.

10
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,029
I was adopted by Madam after I was born.

11
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,540
She hid this secret for 18 years

12
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,510
in order for me
to establish a foothold here.

13
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,389
Chu,

14
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,460
why didn't you tell me about it?

15
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,790
I only found out some days ago.

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,710
Moreover,

17
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,910
plenty of things had happened lately.

18
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,189
Chu,

19
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,350
I...

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,430
I'm not dreaming, aren't I?

21
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,070
If I'm dreaming,

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,820
I don't ever want to wake up.

didn't you already have it

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,910
Chu, what are you saying?

37
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,070

You'll be going on
an expedition tomorrow.

43
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,239
Why do you have free time to visit me?

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,910
Chu, it's your coming-of-age ceremony.

45
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,910
I have to attend it
no matter how busy I am.

46
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,590
Did you drink?

47
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,070
Today's my coming-of-age ceremony.

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,980
There are quite a lot of guests at home.

49
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,470
Therefore, I drank some liquor.

50
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,399
This lady was affected by Goulanli.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,879
It's the most potent love poison.

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,719
It induces hallucinations.

53
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,399
If she fails to copulate soon

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,559
to dispel the internal heat toxin,

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,540
her very life could be at stake.

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,910
Are there any other methods
to rescue her?

57
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,230
There's one method that we can try.

58
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,910

(I was wrong about him.)

68
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,860
Chu, can you tell me

69
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,300
why you insisted on
coming to Jiangling now?

70
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,910
I came to Jiangling

71
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,830
to seek a person.

72
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,180
Who?

73
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,790
This person

74
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,270
might be related to my birth mother.

75
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,300
I only know that his surname is He.

76
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,230
He's over 50 years old.

77
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,230
He's from Anping County.

78
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,540
He sells herbs for a living nearby.

79
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,910
There are too few clues.

80
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,710
Although Jiangling is small,

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,740
it's literally impossible

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,709
to seek a person this way.

83
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,060
I understand.

84
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,860
But I won't give up

85
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,500
as long as there's a sliver of hope.

86
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,910
Let me help you.

87
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,740

Chu.

89
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,230
I found that person
you were looking for.

90
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,420
But he's not a herb merchant.

91
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,030
He's a herb gatherer.

92
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,980
Herb gatherer.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,300
Is anyone there?

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,060

96
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,030
Have we met before?

97
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,590
Sorry for the interruption.

98
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,879
I wish to ask you something.

99
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,709
Do you know

100
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,919
the third daughter

101
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,500

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,239
what happened back then?

114
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,439
It was the evil Madam Qiao.

115
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,189
She bribed the midwife

116
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,910
and murdered your mother

117
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,980
all because your father doted on her.

How could you let Li Zhen fool you?

189
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,239
I'm inept.

190
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,740
Your Highness, please pardon me!

191
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,070
Forget it.

192
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,719
If Li Zhen

193
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,749
is able to become General Qilin

194
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,959
and acquire Crown Prince's trust,

195
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,230
he must possess some
extraordinary qualities.

196
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,389
I've belittled him.

197
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,079
What about the negotiation
that will take place in five days?

198
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,070
Keep a close eye on Li Zhen.

199
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,199
Report to me if anything happens.

200
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,071
Yes, Your Highness.

201
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:49,079
(Duke's Mansion)

202
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,429
Who is that?

203
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,749
What do they intend to do?

204
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,430
It seems like a wedding.

205
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,220
This is so indecent.

206
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,160
Even if it's a wedding,
they don't need to do this.

207
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,669
Miss Chuchu of the Li family

208
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,959
is here to propose a marriage.

209
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,959
The Li family?

210
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,079
Which Li family?

211
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,860
Didn't you see the kirin symbol
on the chests?

212
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,430
Who else in Anping County

213
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,190
dare to use that symbol?

214
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,260
That's General Li's family.

215
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,029
A woman is proposing a marriage?

216
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,749
Doesn't this go against
the proper customs?

217
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,900
That's right.

218
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,959
Open the door.

219
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,430
The Li family is proposing a marriage.

220
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,549
Open the door!

221
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,726
- Open the door!
- Hurry!

222
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,749
- Yeah!
- Open the door!

223
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,380
Head of family, open the door!

224
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,310
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,140
Madam,

226
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,230
I, Li Chuchu of the General's Mansion,

227
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,980
am here to propose a marriage.

228
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,549
Miss Chuchu, what are you doing?

229
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,629
How could an unmarried daughter like you

230
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,020
propose a marriage
on other people's behalf?

231
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,550
Madam, you misunderstood me.

232
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,029
I'm not doing this
on other people's behalf.

233
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,599
I came here to propose a marriage

234
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,380
with Mr. Lin.

235
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,380
What did you say?

236
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,780
I, Li Chuchu,

237
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,900
request a marriage with Mr. Lin.

238
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,500
This...

239
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,500
She's truly thick-skinned.

240
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,719
Miss Chuchu,

241
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,509
are you spouting nonsense
because you're ill?

242
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,470
Come with me. Let's take a break inside.

243
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,879
Miss Lin, thank you for your concern.

244
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,549
But I'm fine.

245
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,710
Li Chuchu,

246
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,959
you're just an illegitimate daughter.

247
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,629
Do you think you can get your way?

248
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,599
Madam Qi.

249
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,319
Yes, Madam.

250
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,079
Tell our men

251
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,430
to chase all of them away.

252
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,099
Yes, Madam.

253
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,080
(Marriage agreement)
The marriage agreement is here.

254
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,199
Is the Duke's Mansion
trying to go against their promise

255
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,900
and cancel the marriage?

256
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,830
Impossible.

257
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,740
This marriage agreement
is definitely fake.

258
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,230
We'll know

259
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,389
if it's fake

260
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,830
if you bring Mr. Lin out.

261
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,480
I've already signed it
and put my thumbprint on it.

262
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,020
Now, you can rest at ease, right?

263
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:56,650
(Marriage agreement)

264
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,550
Even if it's genuine,

265
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,629
I'm sure you used your crafty ways

266
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,079
to dupe him into signing it.

267
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,670
It doesn't count.

268
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,380
Miss Chuchu isn't lying.

269
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,670
I did hand

270
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,429
this marriage agreement to her.

271
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,500
Shut up!

272
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,920
One's parents are supposed
to arrange their marriage for them.

273
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,029
- How could you fool around?
- Madam, I beg to differ.

274
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,959
The marriage agreement
existed before your knowledge.

275
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,040
After that, I announced
my intention in public.

276
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,560
Every single matter is in accordance
with the proper customs.

277
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,480
How could you say
that we were fooling around?

278
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,149
Mother.

279
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,319
Miss Chuchu and I truly love each other.

280
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,900
Please give us your blessings.

281
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,550
That's right!

282
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,079
They're a match made in heaven!

283
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,119
How could you separate them?

284
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,860
- That's right!
- Yeah!

285
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,429
The Duke's Mansion is actually
going back on their words!

286
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,719
They're bullying an unmarried lady!

287
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,959
They went overboard!

288
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,389
How could they bully her?

289
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,389
- Stop being a bully!
- Stop being a bully!

290
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,789
(This crafty wretch,)

291
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,199
(she did all this just so
I could agree to their marriage.)

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,900
