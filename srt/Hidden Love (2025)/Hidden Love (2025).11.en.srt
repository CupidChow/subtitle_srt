(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 11=

4
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,170
Tiantian?

5
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,819
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,060
Don't come here.

7
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,429
I beg you guys.

8
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,349
Don't come here.

9
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,420
Tiantian!

10
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,179
Tiantian!

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,019
Don't come here!

12
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,340
Leave me alone!

13
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,019
My poor daughter.

14
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,730
Who landed you in this state?

15
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,140
Don't come near me!

16
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,789
Someone!

17
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,219
Arrest everyone

18
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,429
in the Court Music Bureau

19
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,730
and interrogate them!

20
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,730
Tiantian.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,989
You're finally awake.

22
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,900
Do you feel unwell?

23
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,999
- I don't want to live anymore!
- Tiantian!

24
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:42,579
- I want to end my life!
- Don't do it!

25
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,739
You mustn't do it!

26
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,179
Tiantian!

27
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,659
- I don't want to live anymore!
- Tiantian!

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,429
Don't do it!

29
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,019
Don't do it!

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,700
Listen to me.

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,219
Madam Qiao has already sent her men here
to arrange for the marriage.

32
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,099
You'll be married to Mr. Lin soon.

33
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,930
You'll be the heir's spouse.

34
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,370
Tiantian.

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,370
Really?

36
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,810
When have I ever deceived you?

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,260
My good girl.

38
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,109
Forget this incident, okay?

39
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,869
Everyone who knows about the incident

40
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,229
has been locked up by your brother.

41
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,429
Just forget about it.

42
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,300
Think of it as a nightmare.

43
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,850
Mother.

44
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,930
I ended up like this

45
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,410
all because of Li Chuchu.

46
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,149
How dare you, evil wretch?

47
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,669
How dare you harm your sister
by colluding with outsiders?

48
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,549
Madam Ping.

49
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,130
Beat her up!

50
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,900
Mother!

51
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,900
I'm innocent!

52
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,459
I've always respected Tiantian.

53
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,690
Why would I do something like this?

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,899
Moreover, you need evidence
to convict someone of their crimes.

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,869
How could you guys

56
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,500
malign me like this?

57
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,530
How dare you still deny it?

58
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,389
Madam Ping.

59
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,019
Continue.

60
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,389
Beat her up.

61
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,179
Wait!

62
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,899
I have Third Prince's token with me.

63
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,389
If you guys dare to abuse me,

64
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,060
that means you'll be disrespecting him.

65
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,930
Do you guys wish to be executed?

66
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,149
So, you think you're all grown up?

67
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,669
You think I can't do anything to you

68
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,619
just because Third Prince
is backing you up? Huh?

69
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,250
I'll beat you to death!

70
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,850
You!

71
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,650
Mother.

72
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,900
The case has been solved.

73
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,779
Tiantian was the one
who plotted everything.

74
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,709
It has nothing to do with anyone else.
What nonsense are you talking about?

75
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,220
Why would Tiantian send herself
to the Court Music Bureau?

76
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,900
This is the testimony
of everyone involved.

77
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,339
(Testimony)

78
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,829
Tiantian's maidservant
has confessed as well.

79
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,850
She was the one
who arranged for everything.

80
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,060
Maybe her true goal

81
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,900
was to send someone else
to the Court Music Bureau.

82
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,669
It's a shame that the heavens are fair.

83
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,740
She just reaped what she sowed.

84
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,149
Come.

85
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,410
I'll send you back to your room.

86
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,050
That wretch.

87
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,650
You found out about the truth,

88
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,819
am I right?

89
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,970
Chu,

90
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,020
under such circumstances,

91
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,380
it's better for you
to leave the family as soon as possible.

92
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,460
Zhen, are you chasing me away?

93
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,050
No.

94
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,730
Too many incidents have occurred lately.

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,410
It's too dangerous
for you to stay outside alone.

96
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,940
But it's unsafe for you
to remain at home.

97
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,380
Therefore, I wish

98
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,730
to take you with me and stay
at the secondary residence for the time being.

99
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,050
Zhen, you're too naive.

100
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,000
You're my legitimate brother
while I'm your illegitimate sister.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,999
Now, you intend to establish
a separate family with me.

102
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,429
We'll be drowned

103
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,410
by the people's gossip.

104
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,900
Moreover, there are plenty of things
I haven't accomplished yet.

105
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,730
Chu.

106
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,700
What exactly are you up to?

107
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,090
Can you tell me about it?

108
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,380
You should go.

109
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,490
I need to rest.

110
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:34,887
♪I'll brave the worldly woes♪

111
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:39,010
♪Part the heavy clouds
to save a sliver of moonlight♪

112
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:42,089
♪With an all-or-nothing vow♪

113
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:48,290
♪That binds you and me, unwavering♪

114
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,240
(Dowry)

115
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,869
Madam, are you sure you want
to use all of these

116
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,020
as Miss Tiantian's dowry?

117
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,939
If so,

118
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,020
we will have no remaining fortune.

119
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,580
And, Mr. Zhen isn't married yet.

120
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,260
That's it.

121
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,410
The more dowry we offer,

122
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,580
the faster the marriage
can be confirmed.

123
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,530
I have no time for other things.

124
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,139
Why is that wretch, Li Chuchu,

125
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,819
still in our family?

126
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,410
Why aren't we getting rid of her?

127
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,220
Don't be impatient.

128
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,730
Don't be impatient.

129
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,379
We have plenty of chances
to deal with her

130
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,819
in the future.

131
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,029
Right now, our priority

132
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,260
is to confirm your marriage

133
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,340
to prevent further trouble.

134
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,650
Mother,

135
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,050
are you sure

136
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,140
people won't find out?

137
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,179
The marriage will be held in three days.

138
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,909
You have to stay composed.

139
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,490
Don't get yourself in trouble.

140
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,989
No.

141
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,940
I'll never marry Li Tiantian.

142
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,730
You don't get to make the call yet.

143
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,179
The dowry has already arrived.

144
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,349
You have to marry her in three days.

145
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,140
You have to marry her
by hook or by crook.

146
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,170
Mother,

147
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,140
this time, I'm afraid
that I have to let you down.

148
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,900
I only wish to marry the person I love.

149
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,220
If I report you to the imperial court
for your unfilialness,

150
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,380
not only will Third Prince
not pull you to his faction,

151
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,900
but it will also be difficult for you

152
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,900
to become the family successor.

153
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,220
You...

154
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,900
My child.

155
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,290
One day, you'll come to understand

156
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,900
why I did so.

157
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,429
Mr. Lin has arrived. He wants to see you.

158
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,580
Understood.

159
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,549
Miss Chuchu,

160
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,789
Mr. Lin and Miss Tiantian
will be married soon.

161
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,469
Why aren't you angry at all?

162
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,090
Why should I be angry?

163
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,410
I'm actually happy about it.

164
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,340
You should leave first.

165
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,300
Miss Chuchu.

166
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,890
Aren't you going to marry
my eldest sister soon?

167
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,890
What are you doing here?

168
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,220
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,130
I cannot do anything about that.

170
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,130
But I, Lin Ansheng, swear

171
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,730
that you're the only person I love
in this lifetime.

172
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,779
My love for you

173
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,989
shall persist eternally.

174
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,739
(Stop acting like
you're a devoted nobleman.)

175
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,589
(To you,)

176
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,469
(your title and power
are more important to you.)

177
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,540
Chuchu.

178
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,580
Are you willing to leave with me?

179
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,869
Let's find a place
to settle down outside.

180
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,300
I'll bring you home after I inherit
the title of Duke successfully.

181
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,060
Of course I'm willing to.

182
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,460
However,

183
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,370
this isn't the time.

184
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,220
Someone is spying on us right now.

185
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,730
Miss Chuchu, you truly have
remarkable foresight.

186
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,940
This is indeed the appropriate action.

187
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,250
But...

188
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,890
Chuchu, I'm sorry
that you have to endure this.

189
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,300
Mr. Lin, I'm fine with anything

190
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,250
as long as I can be with you.

191
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,940
Chu.

192
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,340
Sit down.

193
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,060
Zhen,

194
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,220
do you need anything?

195
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,770
Chu.

196
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,250
Wouldn't it be great

197
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,220
if we weren't blood siblings?

198
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,700
(What does he mean by that?)

199
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,060
(Could it be that he found out
about my background long ago?)

200
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,060
Zhen, you must be muddle-headed.

201
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,700
How could you
say something that ridiculous?

202
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,060
Chu, you're right.

203
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,660
I was muddle-headed.

204
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,060
How could I say something
as silly as such?

205
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,520
Just take it as if
the conversation never took place.

206
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,850
Chu.

207
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,090
Take care.
