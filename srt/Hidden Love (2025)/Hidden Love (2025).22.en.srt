=Episode 22=

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,450
Your Highness.

5
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,010
Don't you remember me?

6
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,010
At the spring banquet,

7
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,889
I was so smitten with you.

8
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,449
I thank you on behalf of my sister,

9
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,040
Your Highness.

10
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,480
Beauty,

11
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,480
who brought you here?

12
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,400
Mr. Lin.

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,480
If so,

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,009
I won't let you leave

15
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,890
with disappointment.

16
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,839
Miss!

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,689
Miss!

18
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,129
People out there drank drugged liquor.

19
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,409
Hurry up and leave.

20
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,409
What about you?

21
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,729
No one will find out it was me.

22
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,090
Miss, leave now.

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,440
(Chu,)

24
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,280
(upon my return,)

25
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,440
(I learned all that you had endured.)

26
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,250
(My heart broke.)

27
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,930
(As a general,)

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,840
(I'm willing to die for my country.)

29
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,250
(As a brother,)

30
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,000
(not a day passes
when I do not think of you.)

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,210
(But we are siblings,)

32
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,840
(my feelings for you
must forever remain hidden.)

33
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,409
(I wish you know my heart,)

34
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,449
(but I fear if you do,)

35
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,930
(you'll hate me.)

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,050
(I toss and turn every night.)

37
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,210
(I couldn't fall asleep.)

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,889
(But Chu,)

39
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,639
(no matter what,)

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,000
(you must believe)

41
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
(my love for you)

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,160
(is a flame that never die.)

43
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,400
(In this lifetime,)

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,090
(I wish to spend it)

45
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,370
(with you.)

46
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:24,155
♪If deep affection♪

(Duke's Mansion)

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,250
You're awake.

49
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,000
Mr. Lin,

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,250
why have you brought me here?

51
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,280
Li Chuchu,

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,039
didn't you claim to be so smart,

53
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,680
manipulating others as you pleased?

54
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,889
We worked together once

55
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,359
for our own benefit,

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,000
I believe

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,639
you'll still help me this time.

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,250
And both of us can get what we want.

59
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,810
What do you mean?

60
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,200
Did you...

61
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,609
My dear sister,

62
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,889
do you really think your tricks

63
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,170
can defeat my mother?

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,609
If I hadn't supported you from behind,

65
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,880
your little play
would've ended long ago.

66
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
If I say no, it's no.

67
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,809
As long as I'm alive,

68
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,929
nothing in this mansion

69
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,560
will be decided by you.

70
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,000
I didn't expect that brat
to be still alive

71
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,250
and has become the second young lady
of the late General Li.

72
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,929
It'd be best

73
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,569
to find a quiet place

74
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,009
and finish her off.

75
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,430
(Letter of Marriage)

76
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,670
(Funeral)

77
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,290
So,

78
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,250
it was you.

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,320
That's right.

80
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,199
I knew your identity.

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,490
Why didn't you tell me?

82
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,719
Tell you?

83
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,290
Why should I tell you?

84
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,370
I still need you

85
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,760
to deal with my scheming mother.

86
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,680
Why so quiet?

87
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,610
Cat got your tongue?

88
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,569
It feels terrible

89
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,250
being fooled, doesn't it?

90
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,080
How funny.

91
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,730
I felt guilty toward you,

92
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,440
but now I see I didn't need to.

93
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,930
You've lost your mind.

94
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,290
Fine.

95
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,730
If you want to kill me,

96
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,370
do it.

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,680
You have a death wish?

98
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,610
It won't be that easy.

99
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,730
After all the play I staged
in the General's Mansion,

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,319
I can't let you die now,

101
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,319
my dear sister.

102
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,719
What do you want, really?

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,170
As for what I want,

104
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,810
you'll find out soon.

105
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,759
Any movement from
the Third Prince these days?

106
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,930
No.

107
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,249
He probably thinks

108
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,889
we've gathered solid evidence,

109
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,730
so he's too afraid to make a move.

110
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,249
This man is cunning.

111
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,880
We mustn't lower our guard.

112
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,290
General,

113
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,250
you should go back and rest.

114
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,440
I'm fine.

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,199
General,

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,249
someone from home says

117
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,880
Miss Chuchu is missing.

118
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,079
Mr. Zhen,

119
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,370
were you looking for me?

120
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,930
Where did she go?

121
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,249
I have no idea.

122
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,639
I won't punish you.

123
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,080
Tell me.

124
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,049
Where is she?

125
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,730
I really don't know.

126
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,929
I didn't dare to ask,

127
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,369
and I couldn't bear to.

128
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,929
Miss Chuchu has been suffering.
Staying would only hurt her more.

129
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,889
I was wrong.

130
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,440
Please punish me, Mr. Zhen.

131
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,250
General.

132
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,569
How was it?

133
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,369
Any news?

134
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,489
As you ordered,

135
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,290
we've sent people everywhere,

136
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,850
but there's still no sign of her.

137
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,839
Li Chuchu,

138
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,519
you love Li Zhen,

139
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,319
but you've made me a fool.

140
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,489
You'll know soon

141
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,689
what it's like to lose the one you love.

142
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,850
Hold on.

143
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,370
Looking back at what Lin Ansheng said,

144
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,449
it seems more likely
he was trying to push Chu to leave.

145
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,569
Could it be...

146
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,199
Keep searching.

147
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,440
I'm going to the Duke's Mansion
to take a look.

148
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,199
(Duke's Mansion)

149
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,449
Hold there, General Li.

150
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,889
I'll inform Mr. Lin.

151
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,000
Scram!

152
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,880
General Li,

153
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,679
you got here fast.

154
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,679
Talk about perfect timing.

155
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,400
Saves me the trouble
of sending a messenger.

156
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,439
Chu.

157
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,520
Zhen,

158
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,919
leave me.

159
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,160
Go.

160
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,610
Leave me.

161
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,400
Chu is the Lin family's daughter.

162
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,039
Why do you have to kill her?

163
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,280
General Li,

164
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,559
if you do as I say,

165
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,889
hand over the thing
the Third Prince wants

166
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,970
and take your own life,

167
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,450
I assure you

168
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,570
I won't lay a finger on my sister.

169
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,399
Don't promise him.

170
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,129
Zhen.

171
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,089
No, Zhen.

172
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,490
Don't promise him.

173
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,690
All right.

174
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,970
I promise you.

175
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,039
Zhen.

176
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
No!

177
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,099
♪May the moonlight melt away the night♪

178
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,090
Chu.

179
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,570
Chu, are you all right?

180
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,400
I'm fine.

181
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,800
I'm fine.

182
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,439
Zhen, don't worry.

183
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,570
Zhen,

184
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,880
I didn't kill

185
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,570
the child.

186
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,850
I couldn't keep the child.

187
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,519
All right.

188
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,800
All right.

189
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,090
I'm taking you home.

190
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,849
Chu,

191
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,090
hang in there.

192
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,760
I'll get a physician.

193
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,330
