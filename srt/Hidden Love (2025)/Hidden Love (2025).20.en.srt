00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 20=

4
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,370
Your Highness, aren't you curious

5
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,530
as to what my investigation
in Jiangling had yield?

6
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,880
(15th day of the 4th month,
Fengyue Villa, Jiangling)

7
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,989
So, it's just a misunderstanding.

8
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,789
I was too hasty.

9
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,370
General, please don't mind me.

10
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,500
Your Highness, you're too courteous.

11
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,099
If so, I shall take my leave first.

12
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,500
Take care, General.

13
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,700
Your Highness,

14
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,989
why did you let him threaten you?

15
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,460
Li Zhen

16
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,220
has evidence
that could be used against me.

17
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,740
I have yet to accomplish my great cause.

18
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,340
I can't take the risk.

19
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,779
General, why did you alert him
to our presence?

20
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,829
Won't that make them put up their guard?

21
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,930
It's called "shaking the mountain
to startle the tiger."

22
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,899
When we deal with someone like
Ji Qingyun who's naturally suspicious,

23
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,269
we have to do the opposite.

24
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,530
We have to make him think
that we have the goods on him.

25
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,459
This way,
he doesn't dare to act recklessly.

26
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,880
General, that was a brilliant move.
I'm utterly impressed.

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,989
By the way, Miss Chuchu
sent someone here just now.

28
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,650
She wants you to head back immediately.

29
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,149
(Li's Mansion)

30
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,059
Miss Chuchu, have you truly
made up your mind?

31
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,690
Must you do this?

32
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,500
Since I cannot keep the child,

33
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,340
I will let those who deserve punishment

34
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,410
join him in the underworld.

35
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,530
Mother,

36
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,180
what are you doing here?

37
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,620
What are you doing?

38
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,300
No!

39
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,500
No!

40
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,850
Don't hurt my child!

41
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,180
The child has to go,

42
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,620
even if it means you have to die.

43
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,059
No!

44
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,179
I won't drink it!

45
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,900
You don't get to make the call here.

46
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,300
Feed her the medicine!

47
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,180
Stop!

48
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,090
Mother.

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,970
What do you mean by this?

50
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,460
Zhen!

51
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,899
Save me!

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,020
Save our child!

53
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,340
Child?

54
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,490
Chu,

55
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,020
what did you say?

56
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,940
Are you pregnant with our child?

57
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,699
It hurts.

58
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,170
It hurts!

59
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,869
We might lose our child.

60
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,170
Zhen,

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,290
don't blame me for this.

62
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,499
I'm doing this for your sake.

63
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,610
We can't afford to keep the child.

64
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,900
Why not?

65
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,299
What do you think
people will think about you

66
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,989
if she does deliver the child?

67
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,619
Do you still want a future or not?

68
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,619
Future?

69
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,499
You only care about my future

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,379
and the family's future!

71
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,299
You knew

72
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,580
that Chu and I weren't blood siblings.

73
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,970
We love each other deeply too.
Why can't we keep our child?

74
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,589
You tried to get rid of her

75
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,850
just because you disliked her.

76
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,939
But have you considered the fact

77
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,139
that her child is

78
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,469
also mine?

79
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,090
Her child will bring calamity
to the family.

80
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,259
It's a disgrace to the family!

81
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,989
I won't let her keep the child

82
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,139
as long as I'm alive!

83
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,220
Someone!

84
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,610
Send Madam back to her room.

85
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,299
She is not allowed to leave the room

86
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,989
without my permission.

87
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,669
What are you doing?
Zhen, I'm your mother!

88
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,939
Let go of me!

89
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,589
As for this evil servant,

90
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,259
flog her 20 times

91
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,970
and kick her out of our mansion!

92
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,059
Mr. Zhen!

93
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,229
Mr. Zhen! Please spare me!

94
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,989
Mr. Zhen!

95
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,989
I won't do it again!

96
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,140
Chu.

97
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,259
Chu?

98
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,410
Chu.

99
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,580
Mingyue!

100
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,229
Hurry and get a physician!

101
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,290
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

102
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,340
Chu.

103
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,940
Chu.

104
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,819
Chu,

105
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,139
wake up.

106
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,380
Let go!

107
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,490
How dare you guys do this?

108
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,299
Let go!

109
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,610
I'll deal with you all
according to the family rules!

110
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,469
I'm the female head
of the General's Mansion!

111
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,340
What gives you guys
the right to do this to me?

112
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,020
Someone!

113
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,290
This can't be.

114
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,989
Zhen would never do this to me.

115
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,109
I gave birth to him and raised him.

116
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,850
I'm his mother.

117
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:42,220
I saw him as my pride and hope.

118
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,650
Zhen.

119
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,170
I knew it.

120
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,469
I'm sure you can't bear to part with me.

121
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,789
You're here to release me,

122
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,970
right?

123
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,909
It's all the fault
of that wretch, Li Chuchu.

124
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,499
I'm going to kill her!

125
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,380
I'm going to kill her!

126
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,140
Mother,

127
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,260
even now, you still
don't realize your mistake?

128
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,780
What did you say?

129
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,650
You raised Chu to be
a courtesan in Yangzhou.

130
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,970
You made her entertain guests,

131
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,610
humiliated her,

132
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,900
and you even tried to kill her!

133
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,220
Let's not forget

134
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,349
that Madam Zhang died because of you.

135
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,349
Shut up!

136
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,940
I did everything

137
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,410
for your sake!

138
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,499
I did it for the family's sake!

139
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,549
What have I done wrong?

140
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,410
Stop finding excuses!

141
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,650
You did everything

142
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,410
for the sake of your vanity and pride!

143
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,340
If you actually
had my interest at heart,

144
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,299
you would never commit

145
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,179
one terrible crime

146
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,410
after another, just like what you did!

147
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,909
In two days, I'll instruct my men

148
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,490
to send you to the ancestral temple.

149
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,820
In the future, you will stay out

150
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,140
of the family's affairs.

151
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,700
Chu,

152
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,130
are you satisfied now?

153
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,970
Zhen, what do you mean by this?

154
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,970
You must've plotted for this
for a long time.

155
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,010
You told me to come back on purpose.

156
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,660
You made it so that

157
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,010
I could witness the scene where
Mother forced you to drink the medicine.

158
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,130
I don't understand

159
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,820
what you're talking about.

160
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,820
If you truly intend to keep the child,

161
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,180
why didn't you tell me about it earlier?

162
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,340
Why must you do it right before
Mother performed the deed?

163
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,770
Chu,

164
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,420
you're truly ruthless.

165
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,340
You sacrificed your child

166
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,820
for the sake of revenge.

167
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,250
The child

168
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,460
shouldn't have existed
in the first place.

169
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,490
So, you were lying to me all along!

170
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,610
Did you ever truly care about me?

171
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,700
Even just a little?

172
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,820
One cannot survive in this family

173
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,180
with a caring heart alone.

174
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,420
Zhen, you can treat it as if

175
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,180
I'm heartless.

176
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,340
So, it was just my wishful thinking

177
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,490
from the start, huh?

It's barely been a month,

yet you sob every day.

185
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,300

Madam Zhang at all costs.

with a caring heart alone.

201
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,370
Zhen, you can treat it

202
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,534
I'm heartless.

I loved you deeply.

206
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,970
But to you,

207
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,580

Miss Chuchu, you look much better

214
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,890
after resting for a few days.

215
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,610
Did something happen?

216
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,309
I heard that Madam has fallen ill.

217
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,229
She fell ill

218
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,379
just after a few days?

219
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,139
She's Mr. Zhen's after all.

220
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,539
The guards dare not be negligent.

221
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,130
They've already delivered the news
to Mr. Zhen in the military camp.

222
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,490
Since my mother is sick,

223
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,700
as her daughter,

224
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,660
I have to show her some concern.

225
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,610
Mother, you look energetic.

226
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,460
You don't look like you're ill.

227
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,610
I should've choked you
to death back then

228
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,370
had I known this would happen.

229
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,229
You see,

230
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,250
courtesans in Liangzhou
are trained to seduce men.

231
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,659
Your son

232
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,259
was seduced and ruined by me.

233
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,130
Isn't that reasonable?

234
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,700
What's so surprising about it?

235
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,370
You wretch!

236
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,499

237
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,490
for Madam Zhang.

238
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,180
This is

239
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,309
for myself.

240
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,660
You've committed
all those evil deeds all these years.

241
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,970
But you never showed
a hint of regret or remorse.

242
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,139
All those sins of yours can never
be cleansed by the sutras you chant.

243
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,700
Just wait for your turn.

244
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,220
You'll be sent to Hell soon.
