00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 17=

4
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,900
What is this?

5
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,019
I discovered
these three piercing silver needles

6
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,530
at the body's pelvic area.

7
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,450
They caused the lady
to bleed excessively.

8
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,170
Due to that, she died of blood loss
during childbirth.

9
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,220
If I'm not mistaken,

10
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,450
These are the 1,000-Feather Silver Needles
of the Qiao family from Xinglin.

11
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,760
The technique is only passed down
to female successors.

12
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,980
For this generation,

13
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,429
Madam, I assume you're the only one
who knows this technique.

14
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,099
Nonsense! The Qiao family's
1000-Feather Silver Needles

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,429
were invented to save people.

16
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,220
How could we use it to harm people?

17
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,220
That doesn't belong to the Qiao family.

18
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,290
There's a mark on the needles.

19
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,900
It's easy to verify it.

20
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,869
I remember now.

21
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,370
My family's silver needles
were once stolen.

22
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,059
So, you were the culprit!

23
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,869
You must pay for my sister's life!

24
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,179
Pay for my sister's life!

25
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,779
You were the culprit!

26
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,949
Pay for my sister's life!

27
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,869
Li Chuchu!

28
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,500
I'm going to kill you!

29
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,690
Mother!

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,989
Mother!

31
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,779
Mother!

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,499
Are you okay?

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,580
Mother!

34
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,339
Someone!

35
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,179
Take her away!

36
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,179
Mother!

37
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,109
Prefect!

38
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,549
Mother!

39
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,429
- You witnessed that yourself!
- Mother!

40
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,989
You have to uphold justice
for my pitiful sister!

41
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,370
Prefect!

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,060
Prefect!

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,370
(Mother,)

44
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,220
(I've finally avenged you.)

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,549
How's the situation
at the Duke's Mansion?

46
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,580
Was the wedding completed?

47
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,620
I heard that something cropped up
during the ceremony.

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,640
The dispute has even reached
the prefectural yamen.

49
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,090
Keep on making inquiries.

50
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,340
Yes, Madam.

51
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,370
Mr. Lin,

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,299
seems like we shouldn't
proceed with today's wedding.

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,370
I'll take Chuchu home first.

54
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,180
Let's go.

55
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,060
Wait!

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,850
General Li,

57
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,340
Miss Chuchu is already my wife.

58
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,180
You can't take her away.

59
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,130
Such a scandal broke out
during the wedding.

60
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,669
Even the local authorities were alarmed.

61
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,690
I can't afford to let my sister
be involved in a family like yours.

62
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,690
I'll definitely give
Miss Chuchu an account.

63
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,060
Trust me.

64
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,930
Mr. Lin, since you've said so,

65
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,949
you should clean up the mess

66
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,740
your family had made first.

67
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,410
After that, you can
apologize to Chuchu personally.

68
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,850
Let's go.

69
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,460
Time to go home.

70
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,349
Madam!

71
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,429
Madam.

72
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,179
How is it?

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,380
Mr. Zhen is taking Miss Chuchu home.

74
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,349
That means

75
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,900
the wedding isn't completed, right?

76
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,179
Thank goodness.

77
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,730
Thanks the heavens!

78
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,650
Chuchu is the duke's daughter.

79
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,699
If she does marry Mr. Lin,

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,050
they'll be punished
by the heavens for incest.

81
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,869
Luckily, it didn't go through.

82
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,260
That's fortunate.

83
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,380
(So, Li Chuchu)

84
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,050
(is Duke of Lin's
legitimate eldest daughter.)

85
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,170
(If so, that means I'm the only
illegitimate daughter of the family.)

86
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,619
(My status is the lowest)

87
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,900
(of them all.)

88
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,170
(Why does Li Chuchu
have the best of everything?)

89
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,970
(What gives?)

90
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,650
Madam Qiao didn't confess
and tell the truth

91
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,379
even though she was caught red-handed.

92
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,730
I assume she wanted to protect
the fortune of her two children.

93
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,020
She didn't want you
to return to your roots.

94
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,170
I don't care about my status
as the legitimate daughter of the Lin family.

95
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,050
They can have it all they like.

96
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,970
Chu,

97
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,780
do you still remember that you said

98
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,780
you would make it up to me?

99
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,989
Zhen, I shall
serve you personally, then.

100
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,530
Do you like that?

101
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,850
I do.

102
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,170
But Chu, you're wearing
a bridal dress today.

103
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,050
I don't think we should skip
the consummation process.

104
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,850
Are you drinking this or not?

109

One has to complete the wedding ceremony

110
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,020
before the consummation process
can take place.

111
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,900
You're right.

112
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,900
Let's get married later.

113
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,410
Later?

114
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,589
(Li's Mansion)

115
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,730
Chu,

116
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,900
will you marry me?

117
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,140
Yes, I do.

118
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,050
Excellent.

119
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,029
I'll find an opportunity

120
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,780
to tell Mother

121
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,739
about our wedding during her birthday,

122
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,220
which is in three days.

123
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,050
I'm afraid she won't agree to it.

124
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,940
Don't worry.

125
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,460
I'm here.

126
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,900
Once I redress my father's grievances,

127
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,909
I'll take you

128
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,820
to a place where nobody knows us.

129
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,170
We'll lead an ordinary life there.

130
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,869
Madam,

131
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,700
you're finally back.

132
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,909
I encountered
Marquis Wenyuan's spouse outside.

133
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,699
She kept chatting with me.

134
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,900
What happened?

135
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,020
That wretch.

136
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,290
I knew she wouldn't let Zhen off.

137
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,940
This won't do.

138
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,469
(If I head there now,)

139
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,380
(Zhen will definitely
protect that wretch.)

140
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,869
(Should tensions escalate,)

141
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,890
(there'll be no turning back.)

142
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,480
I can't just allow them
to continue fooling around like that.

143
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,280
An illicit affair between the legitimate
elder brother and his illegitimate sister.

144
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,419
If His Majesty hears about this,

145
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,700
not only will Zhen's future be ruined,

146
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,419
but everyone in the family
will become laughingstocks.

147
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,460
Madam, you're right.

148
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,229
But in my opinion,

149
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,709
the lass is crafty and cunning.

150
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,869
And now, Mr. Zhen is backing her up.

151
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,820
She's getting harder
and harder to deal with.

152
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,010
To prevent Zhen
from drifting apart from me,

153
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,540
for this incident,

154
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,019
we should strike
with someone else's hand

155
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,060
and deliver a fatal blow.

156
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,989
How are you still in a drinking mood?

157
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,869
Think of something

158
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,890
and rescue Mother from prison.

159
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,539
The case is already a done deal.

160
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,320
Even the deities
can't do anything about it.

161
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,180
There's no need to waste our time.

162
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,349
If you're not going,

163
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,660
I'll go there myself.

164
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,890
Why are you back?

165
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,540
Your Highness.

166
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,220
What are you doing here?

167
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,700
