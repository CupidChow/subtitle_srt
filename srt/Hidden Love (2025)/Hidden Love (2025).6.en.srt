=Episode 6=

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,150
Watch out!

5
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,240
It's actually him?

6
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,240
Who are you?

7
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,880
Let go!

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,999
Chu.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,799
What should I do

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,150
for you to trust me?

11
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,630
How do you expect me to trust you again?

12
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,630
The trust between us
was supposed to crumble long ago!

13
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,529
I hate you!

14
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,350
I hate you to the core!

15
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,320
Miss Chuchu.

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,049
Miss Chuchu, you've been down lately.

17
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,880
Do you feel better today?

18
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,910
I'm fine.

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,320
What's the matter?

20
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,760
Someone wrote to you.

21
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,000
You may leave first.

22
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,320
(Miss Chuchu, may these words
of mine represent me.)

23
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,649
(We had parted ways,)

24
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,040
(and I've missed you.)

25
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,390
(I heard that you've been down lately.)

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,200
(Therefore, I wrote this to inform you
of my latest condition.)

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,720
(I hope it'll soothe your heart.)

28
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,230
(I'm trying to convince my mother
to permit me to ask for your hand.)

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,110
(I've been making good progress.)

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,510
(Mr. Lin is truly sincere toward me.)

31
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,129
(Should I tell him)

32
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,040
(the truth?)

33
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,400
Miss Chuchu, this is bad!

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,369
I heard that Mr. Zhen was attacked
in the military camp

35
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,480
and that he was seriously injured.

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,350
What?

37
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,950
Hurry and take me to him.

38
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,390
What are we doing here?

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,559
Mr. Zhen has bled a lot. The physician said
he needs to rest and recuperate.

40
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,350
We shouldn't move him elsewhere.

41
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,950
Miss Chuchu!

42
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,599
Everyone only has that vixen, Li Chuchu, i
n their sights.

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,350
No one is paying any attention to me.

44
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,790
Dear daughter,

45
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,689
don't get so worked up.

46
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,440
Don't be angry, okay?

47
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,969
I promise you.

48
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,879
That thorn in our flesh

49
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,790
will be removed soon.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,160
Really?

51
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,969
I will never let anyone

52
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,350
jeopardize our family's future.

53
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,880
It's almost time.

54
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,350
Madam Ping.

55
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,279
Let's go.

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,160
Time to catch the show.

57
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,599
Who are you?

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,999
Why did you dupe me into coming here?

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,999
Miss Chuchu,

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,689
what are you saying?

61
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,910
Weren't you the one who invited me here?

62
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,039
Li Chuchu,

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,009
you're something else!

64
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,920
How dare you engage
in such adulterous behaviors?

65
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,030
Madam, please spare me!

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,799
Miss Chuchu was the one who seduced me!

67
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,279
She said she would steal and
present the family fortune

68
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,089
to me if I could take her away
from the residence.

69
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,799
Madam!

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,880
Mother!

71
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,969
He's uttering nonsense!

72
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,830
I don't know him at all!

73
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,030
Madam!

74
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,159
Look!

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,009
I dare not lie!

76
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,119
Miss Chuchu handed this pouch

77
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,150
to me just now.

78
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,359
Someone!

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,279
Tie up this

80
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,760
unscrupulous wretch

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,200
and lock her away at the ancestry hall
as she awaits punishment.

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,569
General,

83
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,510
according to the leads we've obtained,

84
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,329
Duke of Lin

85
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,200
should be just a puppet.

86
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,679
The mastermind

87
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,849
is someone else.

88
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,009
The biggest beneficiary
of the battle at Jiangling

89
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,710
should be Third Prince.

90
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,599
Not only did he obtain military command

91
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,950
over the 12 southern provinces,

92
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,390
but he also received the support
of plenty of officials.

93
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,030
If he's the mastermind,

94
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,649
he'll be a tough nut to crack.

95
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,200
No matter who the mastermind is,

96
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,920
if he dares to do anything to
jeopardize the country and its people,

97
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,409
I, Li Zhen,

98
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,390
will never let him off.

99
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,030
General, Miss Lin from the Duke
of Lin's Residence seeks an audience.

100
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,760
Dear elders,

101
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,529
I can't believe such a scandal
had occurred within our family.

102
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,769
As the female head of family,

103
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,679
I'm truly ashamed of myself.

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,710
Regarding this incident, you all

105
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,599
must administer strict punishment

106
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,200
to uphold our family rules.

107
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,200
According to the family rules,

108
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,480
those who don't uphold the virtues
of a proper wife and have adulterous affairs

109
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,000
should be cast into the pig cage

110
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,799
and drowned.

111
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,799
Madam!

112
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,950
Madam!

113
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,240
Madam!

114
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,089
Madam!

115
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,009
I failed in educating my daughter!

116
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,849
Please spare Miss Chuchu

117
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,240
on account of the late lord!

118
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,849
I know you love your daughter dearly.

119
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,360
However, this wretch
has disgraced herself.

120
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,920
We have irrefutable proof
of her indecency.

121
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,160
The adulterer has already
ended his life in fear of punishment.

122
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,799
There's no way she can deny this.
Someone!

123
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,529
Drag Li Chuchu to the backyard!

124
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,630
Drown her in the pond!

125
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,209
No!

126
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,200
Chuchu!

127
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,159
Chuchu!

128
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,799
Madam!

129
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,599
Chuchu!

130
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,760
Madam!

131
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
Chuchu!

132
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,950
There's no salvation for Chuchu.

133
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,009
Do you want her to drag me down as well?

134
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,969
Madam?

135
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,120
Madam?

136
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,599
General Li,

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,039
I've picked up
a new dessert recipe from our cook.

138
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,769
Please give it a try.

139
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,449
Miss Lin, there are distinctions
between men and women.

140
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,030
And, we merely met by chance.

141
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,159
It's inappropriate for you

142
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,760
to do so.

143
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,719
However,

144
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,449
hasn't your family

145
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,769
already made
an official marriage proposal?

146
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,089
Madam Li also said that she wanted your family
to pick a date as soon as possible.

147
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,150
She intends to deliver
the betrothal gifts in person.

148
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,030
Is that so?

149
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,390
Chu!

150
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,390
Forget it.

151
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,560
She's a member of
the Li family after all.

152
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Don't let her suffer too much.

153
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,510
Madam, you're kind-hearted indeed.

154
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,679
I hope Miss Chuchu

155
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,009
can appreciate your kindness

156
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,510
and be reincarnated into
a good family in her next life.

157
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,999
Elders, sorry for the trouble.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,280
Please enjoy a meal with us in the hall.

159
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,119
Chu?

160
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,280
Chu!

161
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,640

Zhen was a kind child

168
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,449
since young.

169
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,680
The two of them have a deep bond.

170
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,078

I'm afraid Miss Chuchu
won't be able to make it.

179
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,599
You should come here.

180
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,680
Scram!

181
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,990
Chu,

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,089
please wake up.

183
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,399
Please wake up!

184
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,830
I'll do anything

as long as you can stay alive.

186
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,809
Zhen, Miss Chuchu deserved the punishment
as she broke the family rules.

187
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,479
By doing so,

188
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,639
you're disrespecting the elders.

189
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,830
Mother.

190
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,289
Both you and I

191
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,800
know the truth fully well.

192
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,470
If you insist on dealing with Chu today,

193
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
dignity means nothing to me.

194
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,999
Let's clarify things in front

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,449
of the elders today!

196
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,560
Shut up!

197
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,639
I'm afraid there's something off
with the incident.

198
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,160
We have to investigate the case.

199
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,479
Send Miss Chuchu to her room first.

200
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,399
Come and see me

201
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,830
once you get yourself changed.

202
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,990
You scoundrel!

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,680
Have you lost your mind?

204
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,929
You actually intended
to forsake the Li family

205
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,160
for the sake of that vixen?

206
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,479
An incestuous relationship like this
is a huge scandal!

207
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,639
If people hear about this,

208
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,999
the Li family will be ruined!

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,160
Mother.

210
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,209
Chu isn't a vixen.

211
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,950
I was the one who fell for her!

212
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,830
You're still as stubborn as always.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,969
How will you explain yourself
to our ancestors?

214
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,750
How will you explain yourself
to your late father?

215
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,830
(Zhen,)

216
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,049
(I'll entrust you with the mission of)

217
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,870
(clearing the Li family's name)

218
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,680
(and bringing honor to the family.)

219
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,399
Will you only be happy

220
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,479
if I die in front of you?

221
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,680
Is that so?

222
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,830
Mother, as long as you let Chu off,

223
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,400
I'll do whatever

224
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,640
you want me to.

225
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,680
If you still intend
to practice filial piety,

226
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
you better sever your ties
with Li Chuchu

227
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,830
and marry Miss Lin.
