=Hidden Love=

00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 14=

4
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,420
You...

5
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,090
You slapped me!

6
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,650
You're going to get Chuchu killed!

7
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,170
It was Chuchu who seduced Zhen!

8
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,019
I told no lies.

9
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,739
Quiet!

10
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,730
Fine.

11
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,980
Go ahead.

12
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,530
Do it!

13
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,730
So, Chuchu is more important

14
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,179
to you

15
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,170
than I am too.

16
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,010
Why?

17
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,299
Why does everyone

18
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,219
love Li Chuchu?

19
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,299
What am I, then?

20
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,370
No...

21
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,570
- It's not like that, Qianqian.
- Don't touch me!

22
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,730
Qianqian...

23
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,220
Qianqian...

24
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,900
Qianqian!

25
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,410
Qianqian!

26
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,740
From now on,

27
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,810
you have only one daughter.

28
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,090
Her, or me.

29
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,810
Make your choice soon.

30
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,530
Qianqian!

31
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,930
Qianqian!

32
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,530
Did something happen?

33
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,220
Fenglin,

34
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,779
take Chu and go.

35
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,019
I'll handle things here.

36
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,869
You go ahead, sir.

37
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,709
I'll cover the rear.

38
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,690
That's an order from your general.
Don't disobey it.

39
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,459
No, Zhen.

40
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,060
If we leave, we leave together.
If we die, we die together.

41
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,499
Don't be afraid.
I won't let anything happen to you.

42
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,669
No more talking!

43
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,410
None of you are getting
out of here alive today! Get them!

44
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,020
Zhen!

45
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,140
Zhen!

46
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,220
Kill them!

47
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,380
Zhen!

48
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,850
Zhen...

49
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,050
Are you all right?

50
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,020
Don't be scared, Chu.

51
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,380
I...

52
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,650
I...

53
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,730
I'm tough.

54
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,379
Your Highness.

55
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,800
Li Zhen and his sister were
severely wounded and are now missing.

56
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,869
But if you ask me,

57
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,580
the chances of survival are slim.

58
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,440
(Li Zhen departed for Jiangling today.)
Why didn't Lin Ansheng mention

59
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,170
that Li Chuchu went with him?

60
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,380
No matter.

61
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,170
My journey has been rather dull.

62
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,299
A beauty like her
would make fine company.

63
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,549
I've investigated.

64
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,170
On the surface, Li Zhen stayed
out of political factions,

65
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,499
but in truth, he's closely aligned
with the Crown Prince.

66
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,059
If he finds out what Your Highness
is really up to on this trip,

67
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,820
he could give us serious trouble.

68
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,260
Li Zhen may be talented,

69
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,900
but unfortunately for him,

70
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,530
he has a father
who doesn't know his place.

71
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,499
Better to act now

72
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,780
than wait

73
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,580
and risk losing the advantage.

74
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,379
Physician,

75
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,580
how is he?

76
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,139
This young man's injuries are severe.

77
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,379
He's lost a lot of blood.

78
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,869
Fortunately, he's strong.

79
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,029
If his fever breaks tonight,

80
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,730
he should pull through.

81
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,050
Thank you.

82
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,460
Go, Chu!

83
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,050
Chu, go!

84
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,290
Run!

85
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,819
Get out of here...

86
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,589
(I meant more to him)

87
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,580
(than his own life.)

88
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,340
Cold...

89
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,140
So cold...

90
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,340
So cold...

by blood.

109
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,700
Zhen,

110
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,180
I can fool everyone else,

111
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,180
but I can't lie to myself.

112
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,770
Zhen.

113
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,060
What are you doing?

114
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,370
Chu,

115
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,010
I know you did this to help me.

116
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,420
I'll leave you to dress up.

117
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,220
I'll get us some food.

118
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,300
Who's really behind this attack?

119
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,869
Who'd dare

120
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,820
to ambush the Qilin Army?

121
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,540
If my suspicions are right,

122
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,890
it has to be the Third Prince.

123
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,370
Third Prince?

124
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,229
Chu.

125
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,619
I've long suspected

126
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,250
he was behind Father's death.

127
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,829
I came to Jiangling to uncover the truth

128
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,540
and expose him.

129
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,659
Right now, we're in the open
while he hides in the dark.

130
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,090
You must be careful.

131
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,779
Avoid all contact with him.

132
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,619
All right.

133
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,890
Got it.

134
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,490
It sounds lively up ahead.

135
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,010
What are they doing?

136
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,370
It must be the Flower Goddess Festival.

137
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,300
Legend has it that couples who receive
the Flower Goddess's blessing

138
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,379
will stay together forever

139
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,660
and grow old side by side.

140
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,499
You are a beautiful couple.

141
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,139
You must be here
to seek the blessing too?

142
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,109
You misunderstood.

143
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,779
We're actually...

144
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,850
That's right.

145
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,379
We're newlyweds from out of town.

146
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,779
I was wondering if you happen

147
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,180
to know someone named...

148
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,490
Let's welcome them!

149
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,460
Madam.

150
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,370
Well?

151
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,619
I looked into it thoroughly.

152
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,869
Mr. Zhen did go to Jiangling

153
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,189
on official business.

154
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,989
But no one knows when he'll be back.

155
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,419
So it wasn't an elopement?

156
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,069
You need not worry, Madam.

157
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,779
Mr. Zhen is always careful
in his actions.

158
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,220
He wouldn't do anything reckless.

159
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,469
But whenever Li Chuchu is involved,

160
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,539
it's as if

161
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,090
he loses all reason.

162
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,850
Chu.

163
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,220
Why did you lie earlier today?

164
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,820
We're not husband and wife.

165
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,820
And we never will be.

166
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,060
How do you know we won't?

167
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,890

we may not be siblings at all?
