(Li Chuchu,)

00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,780
(just you wait.)

(Account book)

8
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,780
Why is there so much extra spent
this month?

9
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,780
Where did it all go?

10
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,059
Mr. Lin,

11
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,499
Miss Lin used it to help Madam,

12
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,570
so...

13
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,930
This is ridiculous!

14
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,370
From now on, without my permission,

15
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,419
she's not allowed to use the money.

16
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,530
Yes, Mr. Lin.

17
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,979
Mr. Lin,

18
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,570
a letter from the Third Prince.

19
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,340
(If you want to inherit the title,)

20
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,410
(kill Li Zhen.)

21
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,240
(Duke's Mansion)

22
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,060
Mr. Lin,

23
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,609
how do you fare?

24
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,609
Who are you?

25
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,090
Your old acquaintance.

26
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,699
Seeing how you've worn out,

27
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,220
I came to see you.

28
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,410
You hid your face.

29
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,900
What do you want?

30
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,850
Just one question.

31
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,289
Do you wish to know

32
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,220
who ruined your wedding?

33
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,139
And who caused the Duchess

34
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,810
to be imprisoned?

35
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,340
Mr. Zhen.

36
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,569
Mr. Zhen,

37
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,090
Mr. Lin is here.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,580
Tell him to wait in the front hall.

39
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,729
I'll be there shortly.

40
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,900
Yes.

41
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,180
General Li.

42
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,460
Mr. Lin, I wonder what brings you here,

43
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,169
despite your busy schedule.

44
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,530
I came to take my newly
wedded wife home.

45
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,690
No.

46
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,489
I've told you

47
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,650
that your marriage didn't count.

48
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,659
Miss,

49
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,859
Mr. Lin has come.

50
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,060
He says he's taking you back.

51
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,810
If I can't bring her back today,

52
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,580
I won't give up.

53
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,530
Mr. Lin, please leave.

54
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,220
Everything that happened was all my fault.

55
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,220
You and I

56
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,659
are never meant to be.

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,820
Why not?

58
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,650
Was all your feelings for me fake?

59
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,260
I...

60
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,580
Li Chuchu,

61
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,019
do you truly think

62
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,050
you can fool everyone however you like?

63
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,820
Even now,

64
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,380
you won't give me a reason.

65
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,410
Do you take me for a fool?

66
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,970
Forgive me, Mr. Lin.

67
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,050
I have my reasons.

68
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,940
Reasons?

69
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,380
What reasons?

70
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,050
That you're my blood sister?

71
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,970
So obvious.

72
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,380
Yet I never noticed that.

73
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,779
Li Chuchu,

74
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,689
why do you enjoy

75
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,339
seducing your brother?

76
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,580
First your blood brother, that's me.

77
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,090
Then Li Zhen who treats you
as if he was your brother.

78
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,820
Do you enjoy

79
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,260
incest that much?

80
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,090
Why are you looking at me?

81
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,099
Do you think

82
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,019
no one knows

83
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,650
about your affair?

84
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,220
Listen up.

85
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,700
If you don't hand Li Chuchu over to me,

86
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,530
I'll expose what's between you two.

87
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,780
Let's see how you're going
to face everyone in Anping County.

88
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,820
Are you threatening me?

89
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,380
Even if everyone finds out

90
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,850
and I'm stripped of my title,

91
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,900
I won't let the Duke's Mansion off.

92
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,530
Very well.

93
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,140
Very well.

94
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,650
Let's see

95
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,460
which side

96
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,380
justice stands on.

97
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,970
Mr. Lin.

98
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,579
Stay out of this.

99
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,850
I'll handle it.

100
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,859
Mr. Zhen.

101
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,689
Miss Chuchu.

102
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,659
This is bad!

103
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,780
Mr. Lin is making a scene at the gate.

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,080
(Glory and Loyalty)

105
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,480
(Li's Mansion)

106
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,020
This vile place

107
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,700
is unworthy of this imperial plaque.

108
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,900
Come!

109
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,170
Remove the plaque.

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,200
(Li's Mansion)

111
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,700
Stop.

112
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,290
Move aside.

113
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,580
Lin Ansheng,

114
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,859
is this all you know? Lowly tricks?

115
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,050
Lowly?

116
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,220
The mighty General Qilin

117
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,780
is having an affair with his sister.

118
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,249
Isn't that lowly?

119
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,859
Do I need better tricks

120
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,260
to deal with you people?

121
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,970
Are you even worth it?

122
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,780
If you have a problem,

123
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,650
come at me.

124
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,410
You think I don't dare?

125
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,050
These three punches

126
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,650
are the payback you owe to Chu.

127
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,380
Payback?

128
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,380
You think you deserves that?

129
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,859
Lin Ansheng,

130
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,660
listen up.

131
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,850
I've been with Chu
for more than a decade.

132
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,180
I'm more qualified than anyone
to be with her.

133
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,420
I won't allow anyone

134
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,009
to hurt her,

135
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,859
humiliate her,

136
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,220
or trample on her.

137
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,220
Li Chuchu,

138
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,179
you love Li Zhen,

139
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,220
but you've made me a fool.

140
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,180
You'll know soon

141
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,850
what it's like to lose the one you love.

142
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,460
(Lin Ansheng,)

143
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,370
(I'm sorry.)

144

Miss,

145
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,420
are you really leaving?

146
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,700
As the matter stands,

147
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,940
if I stay,

148
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,060
I'll only drag Zhen down

149
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,060
and bring shame and trouble
to the General's Mansion.

150
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,700
You tried so hard to approach me.

151
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,090
What are you really after?

152
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,890
You want to be Duchess?

153
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,220
Mr. Lin,

154
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,060
you think far too highly of yourself.

155
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,820
A mere duchess

156
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,060
doesn't tempt me.

157
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,460
You don't want to be Duchess?

158
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,459
Are you aiming
for the Crown Princess instead?

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,250
why not?

161
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,090
Besides,

162
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,460
if I win the Third Prince's favor,

163
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,660
I might help you,

164
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,370

165
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,010
