00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 10=

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,350
Miss Chuchu,
I shall grant you this jade pendant.

5
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,430
Take it

6
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,630
as a token of apology.

7
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,559
If you encounter any trouble,

8
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,639
you may find me using this pendant.

9
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,430
No one will be able to stop you.

10
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,270
Thank you, Your Highness.

11
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,879
Your Highness, let me thank you

12
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,540
on Chuchu's behalf as well.

13
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,910
Your Highness.

14
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,430
Your Highness.

15
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,309
You promised me

16
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,270
that you would
come to my residence for tea.

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,389
Sure.

18
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,740
I'll join you right now.

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,790
Miss Chuchu,

20
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,070
don't worry.

21
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,660
Please wait for me.

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,940
Mr. Lin, I'm willing to wait for you
no matter how long it takes.

23
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,119
There are too many people here.

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,230
You should head back first.

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,030
Chuchu, congratulations on receiving
Third Prince's recognition.

26
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,350
Let's head back for now.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,029
Chuchu,

28
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,140
let's have a chat.

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,349
(She's seducing all the men.)

30
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,399
(She put a spell on Zhen)

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,589
(and seduced Mr. Lin)

32
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,559
(And now, she's trying
to approach Third Prince.)

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,679
(Li Chuchu,)

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,940
(why must all men pay attention to you?)

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,260
(How am I inferior to you?)

36
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,140
I've arrested the perpetrator.

37
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,070
He said he was only completing his job.

38
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,589
The incident was
plotted by someone else.

39
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,420
If she dares to act in such a way,

40
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,070
that means she's sure
that we cannot locate her.

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,820
Do you know who the mastermind is?

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,820
Please disregard my rambling.

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,189
Qianqian is still waiting for me.

44
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,189
I shall head back first.

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,230
Wait.

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,909
Third Prince isn't a good person.

47
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,789
Do not get too close to him.

48
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,230
It might backfire on you.

49
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,350
Zhen, to you,

50
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,380
I assume all men who approach me

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,070
have sinister intentions.

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,030
Chu,

53
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,910
I know that you've swallowed
plenty of grievances.

54
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,420
I assume you're approaching Third Prince
in order to find a reliable backer.

55
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,910
However, this is dangerous.

56
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,790
You shouldn't jump from one fire pit

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,860
to a deeper one.

58
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,660
I chose this path of my own accord.

59
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,030
Even if I were to suffer,

60
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,230
I won't regret it.

61
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,470
The Li family from Anping County

62
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,030
has plenty of
extraordinary talents indeed.

63
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,660
Now, Li Zhen is
at the peak of his glory.

64
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,030
Both her sisters
are extraordinary as well.

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,860
This is quite interesting.

66
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,520
Your Highness, even if
you do intend to recruit someone,

67
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,180
why must you recruit the Li family?

68
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,910
Although I'm not as talented,

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,790
I'm willing to serve you as well.

70
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,149
Based on my ties with the late duke,

71
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,620
naturally, Mr. Lin,
you'll be my first choice.

72
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,039
I need to head to Jiangling

73
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,629
in a few more days.

74
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,749
Keep an eye on Anping County
on my behalf.

75
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,390
Report to me if anything happens.

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,350
Your Highness, don't worry.

77
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,790
General, please remain here.

78
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,350
Miss Lin, what do you need?

79
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,350
May I know when you're planning
to visit my family and ask for my hand?

80
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,980
General, what are you doing?

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,660
I have a hidden illness.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,660
Miss Lin,
I'm not a good candidate for you.

83
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,830
I don't wish to ruin your bright future.

84
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,829
Therefore, our marriage doesn't count.

85
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,470
Please pardon me for this.

86
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:40,650
(Li Mansion)

87
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,300
Say, what have I eaten for me

88
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,790
to experience such severe diarrhea?

89
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,590
I'm wondering the same thing.

90
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,239
However, Mingyue was the one

91
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,500
who got the congee for me last night.

92
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,540
Mingyue?

93
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,060
(Initially, Li Tiantian was supposed
to attend the spring banquet.)

94
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,830
(In the end, she had rashes.)

95
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,180
(Unfortunately, I had diarrhea as well.)

96
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,540
(Chuchu was the only candidate.)

97
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,420
(She stole the spotlight
upon arriving there.)

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,860
(She even left an impression
on Third Prince.)

99
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,790
(She's my good sister indeed.)

100
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,060
Tell someone to keep an eye on An.

101
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,149
Third Prince is a member
of the imperial family.

102
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,829
We mustn't be careless.

103
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,390
Madam, don't worry.

104
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,030
I've already relayed
my instructions long ago.

105
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,309
Mother,

106
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,030
I don't want to marry Li Zhen anymore.

107
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,359
You lass.

108
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,180
What exactly happened?

109
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,679
Li Zhen may look like someone decent.

110
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,180
But in reality, he's...

111
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,660
What's wrong with him?

112
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,269
He's just for show.

113
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,999
He can't do the deed.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,559
I don't want to live like a widow.

115
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,710
Fine, then.

116
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,660
You can drop the marriage if you want.

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,389
(Why don't I ask for Li Tiantian's hand)

118
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,590
(on An's behalf?)

119
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,189
(This way,)

120
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,540
(I can prevent the vixen Li Chuchu
from scheming again.)

121
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,629
Tiantian.

122
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,999
What are you doing here?

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,389
I came here

124
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,300
just to tell you something.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,189
That wretch, Li Chuchu.

126
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,980
How dare she plot against me?

127
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,030
But what can we do about it?

128
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,509
I think we should forget it.

129
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,390
After all, Chuchu is
under someone's protection.

130
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,999
We can't afford to be reckless.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,030
Zhen has sent more bodyguards

132
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,710
to protect her after the spring banquet.

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,540
Not necessarily.

134
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,590
Tiantian.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,149
Were you looking for me?

136
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,350
Chuchu.

137
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,470
The city is holding
a lantern festival tonight.

138
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,860
We should go out and shop together.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,749
We can buy some trendy clothing

140
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,420
using this opportunity.

141
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,359
Tiantian, thank you
for your kind intentions.

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,269
It's just that...

143
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,559
Chuchu, are you not willing to join me?

144
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,710
That's not it.

145
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,830
Why don't we depart now?

146
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,620
Have a seat.

147
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,550
Have a seat.

148
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,860
You look more beautiful like this.

149
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,100
Let's go.

150
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,879
Chuchu,

151
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,879
there's a great clothing shop ahead.

152
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,230
Let's go and check it out.

153
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,199
Sure.

154
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,260
Let's go.

155
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,350
Tiantian, wait.

156
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:02,999
What's wrong?

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,269
There's something on your face.

158
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,269
Give me a second.

159
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,380
Is that so?

160
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,429
Let's go.

161
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,620
Let's go now.

162
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,079
Madam.

163
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,749
We received a report.

164
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,319
It is said that Miss Chuchu

165
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,219
was abducted by someone

166
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,840
and that they were headed in
the direction of the Court Music Bureau.

167
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,749
Got it.

168
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,230
Let her be.

169
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,710
Why don't we

170
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,389
send someone to notify Mr. Zhen

171
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,550
so that your ties with him
will remain intact?

172
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,590
Amitabha.

173
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,310
Send someone to his military camp

174
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,860
in four hours, then.

175
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,719
Beauty.

176
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,789
Time to wake up.

177
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,950
Beauty.

178
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,079
Who are you guys?

179
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,740
How dare you!

180
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,430
This is the Court Music Bureau.

181
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,429
You'll understand the joy
of being here later.

182
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,900
You guys abducted the wrong person!

183
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,140
No way.

184
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,669
You see,

185
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,710
we were targeting the person
with this hairpin.

186
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,830
How could this be?

187
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,749
Let me go!

188
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,389
I'll pay you guys plenty of money!

189
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,359
Money?

190
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,070
Let me enjoy myself first!

191
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,470
You mustn't go inside!

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,320
Where's the lady who was abducted
by the Court Music Bureau?

193
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,719
She...

194
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,620
She's entertaining our guest inside.

195
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,310
Tiantian, wait.

196
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,319
What's wrong?

197
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,599
There's something on your face.

198
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,719
Give me a second.

199
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,860
Is that so?

200
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,269
All done.

201
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,430
Let's go.

202
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,830
Please deliver a message
to the General's Mansion.

203
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,269
Tell them that Miss Chuchu
was abducted by the Court Music Bureau.

204
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,020
Tell them to rescue her.

205
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,950
Tiantian,

206
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,550
I've already given you a chance.

207
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,240
It's a shame that you didn't cherish it.

208
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,310
Tiantian?

209
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,350
