=Episode 8=

4
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,219
Who are you all?

5
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,140
We're here to end you.

6
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,530
Speak.

7
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,509
Who was the one

8
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,860
who instructed the duke
to leak our defense deployment map

9
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,010
and pushed the blame on General Li Yun?

10
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,450
General, please spare me!

11
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,500
I have no idea!

12
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,980
You have no idea?

13
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,420
I...

14
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,509
I remember now!

15
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,459
On the night before
we departed for Jiangling,

16
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,810
I think I saw

17
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,869
Third Prince

18
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,659
and the duke

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,260
having a private chat in the study room.

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,900
What did they talk about?

21
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,379
I didn't dare to eavesdrop on them!

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,789
Even if you were to kill me now,

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,920
I would have no way
to tell you what they talked about.

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,930
General.

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,939
Misters,

26
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,780
I have no grudges against you two.

27
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,429
Why are you guys trying to silence me

28
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,810
in broad daylight?

29
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,090
Could it be

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,170
that someone has
ordered you two to do so?

31
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,629
Lass, you're pretty smart.

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,549
It's a shame

33
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,900
that you have to carry your wit
with you to the underworld!

34
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,179
Miss Chuchu,

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,300
are you okay?

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,549
Mr. Lin, thank goodness
you made it in time.

37
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,460
If not,

38
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,850
I would've become a vengeful spirit.

39
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,299
Don't be afraid.

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,650
As long as I'm here,

41
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,900
I won't let anyone bully you.

42
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,780
However,

43
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,269
it's obvious
that these two came prepared.

44
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,780
But who else would know about

45
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,810
our secret meeting?

46
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,690
Could it be...

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,780
Miss Chuchu,
have you made any discoveries?

48
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,410
Actually,

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,829
I ordered my maidservant

50
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,900
to deliver a letter
to your residence yesterday.

51
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,709
It's a shame
that she was a bit clueless.

52
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,650
She didn't deliver it to you personally.

53
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,949
I'm afraid

54
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,059
that someone else
had intercepted my letter.

55
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,500
What?

56
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,300
I'm sure it was Mother.

57
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,220
I never expected her

58
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,850
to commit such a ruthless deed.

59
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,340
Mr. Lin, the duchess wields absolute authority
over your family.

60
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,460
If she dislikes me,

61
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,869
no matter how you insist upon on courting me,
I'm afraid it won't amount to anything.

62
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,020
Chuchu,

63
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,850
in the end,

64
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,500
I'm the family's official heir.

65
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,339
Once the three-year
mourning period is over

66
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,090
and I inherit the duke's title,

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I will make the call.

68
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,899
For this letter,

69
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,580
just deliver it
to a random servant of the mansion.

70
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,410
As for this letter,

71
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,179
you have to deliver it to Mr. Lin.

72
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,500
Make sure he arrives there
before the Hour of Wei.

73
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,650
(Seems like)

74
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,460
(Madam Qiao has discovered my identity.)

75
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,780
(If not, she wouldn't need
to act this hastily.)

76
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,970
To hell with you!

77
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,140
Zhen?

78
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,220
Chu.

79
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,490
Are you okay?

80
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,730
Mr. Lin.

81
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,090
Are you okay?

82
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,050
Miss Chuchu.

83
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,739
Just now, I...

84
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,340
It was an urgent situation.

85
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,170
Luckily, Zhen came to
our rescue in time.

86
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,939
We shouldn't stay here any longer.

87
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,739
Mr. Lin,

88
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,109
you should head back.

89
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,220
All right.

90
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,340
You must wait for me, then.

91
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,640
(Duke's Mansion)

92
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,460
I've already promised
to marry Li Chuchu.

93
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,429
Mother, why did you try
to get rid of her?

94
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,469
I did so for my own reasons.

95
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,290
We can't afford to let her stay alive,

96
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,340
not to mention let her join our family.

97
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,020
But why?

98
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,020
I need to know why!

99
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,850
Why?

100
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,900
No means no.

101
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,170
As long as I'm alive,

102
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,299
I'm making every call

103
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,900
in the family!

104
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,730
Mother.

105
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,380
You're ruthless.

106
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,989
Do you think you're able

107
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,179
to become the heir

108
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,020
if I wasn't ruthless in the first place?

109
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,170
We should hire a physician
to examine you when we get back.

110
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,650
Your wound might get infected.

111
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,530
Why did you ask Lin Ansheng to meet you
in such a desolate place?

112
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,460
Do you like Mr. Lin that much?

113
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,730
So what if I do?

114
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,460
Chu,

115
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,340
it's fine if you get yourself
a worthy husband.

116
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,490
However, Madam Qiao of the Duke's Mansion
is arrogant and overbearing.

117
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,819
Lin Ansheng isn't reliable as well.

118
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,460
If so, Zhen, in your opinion,

119
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,220

after that incident.)

confirmed yet?

136
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,780
Initially, it was about to be confirmed.

137
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,669
However, it seemed as if
Madam Qiao was upset with

138
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,379
the relationship between Miss Chuchu

139
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,739
and Mr. Lin.

140
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,020
Therefore, she didn't agree
to the marriage.

141
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,589
Li Chuchu is truly a vixen.

142
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,460
She loves to seduce men.

143
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,669
If I must say,

144
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,139
why don't we just sell her
to the Court Music Bureau?

145
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,699
She can have all the men she desires

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,610
My lady, you should
stop worrying about her.

148
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,939
You should think about how to show off
your skills during the spring banquet.

149
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,869
Mr. Lin

150
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,650
might change his mind by then.

151
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,900
(Right now, I'm all alone.)

152
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,580

(not only will I fail to seek revenge,)

154
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,349
(but I might end up
cornering myself instead.)

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,499

Anping County safely in secret.

He will appear at the spring banquet.

159
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,530
This is the best opportunity
for us to approach him.

160
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,309
All right. Go and make
the necessary arrangements.

161
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,460
