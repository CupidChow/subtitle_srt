Miss Chuchu,

74
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,680
you have a guest tonight.

75
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,050
She got held up at the moment.

76
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,930
You may meet later.

77
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,920

88
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,890

124
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,840

with Battalion Commander Liu.

Even if I had,
what could you have done?

131
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,450
You were too far away to help me.

132
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,130
