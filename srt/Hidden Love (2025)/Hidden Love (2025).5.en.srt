=Hidden Love=

00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 5=

4
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,000
Was this

5
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,860
left by my father before he died?

6
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,629
Yes.

7
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,019
The late General Li
warned again and again

8
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,349
that the one behind held great power.

9
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,099
This could only be entrusted to you

10
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,860
when you were strong enough.

11
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,090
(Zhen,)

12
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,549
(the mission
to clean the Li family's name)

13
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,299
(and restore our honor)

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,789
(now falls to you.)

15
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,930
(If not,)

16
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,219
(I won't rest in peace.)

17
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,420
Father,

18
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,220
I will not fail you.

19
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,429
General,

20
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,730
Miss Chuchu is here.

21
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,260
You're all dismissed.

22
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,450
Clear the guards at the door.

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,869
Don't let anyone in.

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,010
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,069
Chu,

26
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,220
you...

27
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,450
Zhen,

28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,219
I want to leave the General's Mansion

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,810
with my mother and Qianqian.

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,620
Please let us go.

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,709
Chu, no need to kneel.

32
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,709
Get up.

33
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,220
Unless you agree,

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,220
I won't get up.

35
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,500
Didn't you say

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,970
you were fond of Mr. Lin?

37
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,250
Why are you leaving now?

38
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,370
I've thought it over.

39
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,389
You were right.

40
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,780
Marrying into the Duke's Mansion

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,109
as a concubine's daughter

42
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,709
is never easy.

43
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,549
Mother and Tiantian

44
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,530
have always seen me
as a thorn in their flesh.

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,970
Rather than stay and suffer,

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,650
it's better that I leave.

47
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,930
(I'm carrying a deep revenge now.)

48
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,740
(If anything goes wrong,)

49
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,900
(the entire family could be executed.)

50
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,370
(Maybe letting her go)

51
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,220
(is the best choice.)

52
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,060
Zhen,

53
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,500
please help me.

54
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,090
I beg of you.

55
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,220
Zhen.

56
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,530
(I can't believe this is true.)

57
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,900
(Incest between siblings is a disgrace.)

58
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,619
(If exposed,)

59
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,500
(the entire General's Mansion
will be doomed.)

60
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,179
(What if Zhen lashes out at me)

61
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,580
(in shame,)

62
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,740
(what will I do?)

63
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,780
Zhen.

64
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,180
At dawn,

65
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,949
I'll take you and Qianqian

66
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,900
to a side courtyard for some days.

67
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,740
Then, I'll send someone
to fetch your mother

68
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,170
and escort you all away.

69
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,170
Thank you, Zhen.

70
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,580
No need for that between us.

71
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,700
In this world,

72
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,379
I wish to see you happy

73
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,220
more than everyone.

78
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,780
Go rest.

79
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,730
Yes.

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,909
(She's taking me and mother away)

84
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,410
(from Li's Mansion?)

85
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,050
Qianqian,

86
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,580
are you asleep?

87
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,050
No need for that between us.

88
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,610
In this world,

89
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,170
I wish to see you happy
more than anyone.

90
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,730
You're up, Zhen.

91
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,469
I made some pastries.

92
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,700
Try some and see if you like them.

93
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,020
Just like always.

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,109
As long as you like it.

95
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,260
Chu.

96
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,490
After today,

97
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,020
take good care of yourself.

98
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,730
Don't worry.

99
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,460
I will.

100
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,819
(After today,)

101
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,179
(we'll be oceans apart.)

102
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,699
(May we never meet again.)

103
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,850
Zhen.

104
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,850
Come in.

105
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,379
Zhen,

106
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,650
Mother is here.

107
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,730
Mother,

108
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,340
what brings you here?

109
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,789
I heard the concubine fell ill
at the estate,

110
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,229
so I had her brought back last night.

111
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,869
Miss Chuchu and Miss QianQian,
you should go visit her.

112
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,170
Thank you, Mother.

113
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,850
Mother,

114
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,650
how did you know

115
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,780
Chuchu and Qianqian were
at the military camp?

116
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,669
Didn't you send someone

117
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,499
to inform me?

118
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,179
You're so forgetful.

119
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,499
Well. You must be busy
with military affairs.

120
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,020
I won't interrupt you further.
I'll take them back.

121
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,669
Investigate

122
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,139
who passed the message back.

123
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,340
Yes, sir.

124
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,650
Greetings, Madam.

125
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,220
Mom.

126
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,140
Mom.

127
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,290
Mom.

128
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,139
I'll give you some privacy.

129
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,619
If you need anything,

130
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,349
instruct the servants.

131
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,850
Thank you, Madam.

132
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,139
Mom.

133
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,970
Let me take a look at you.

134
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,340
(That wretched trollop)

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,229
(actually convinced Zhen
to elope with her.)

136
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,140
(Looks like I must do something to her
quickly.)

137
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,739
Everything is well.

138
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,090
Send a matchmaker to the Lin's Mansion

139
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,259
and request a marriage with Miss Lin.

140
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,730
Zhen's marriage must be settled soon.

141
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,130
You're thoughtful, Madam.

142
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,419
You must've suffered a lot here.

143
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,739
You're sick.

144
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,540
Weeping too much will harm your health.

145
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,989
Why are you looking at me

146
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,220
like that?

147
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,259
Dear,

148
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,820
I was told a young master
had taken a liking to you.

149
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,779
It's just gossip from the servants.

150
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,220
Don't take it seriously.

151
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,660
Miss Chuchu,

152
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,739
it's a good thing to have a rich suitor.

153
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,539
You'll have a better life in the future.

154
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,340
If he gives more betrothal gifts,

155
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,010
you could save some
for Qianqian's dowry.

156
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,540
Is that the reason

157
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,580
you talk about my marriage?

158
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,869
No.

159
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,090
Chuchu,

160
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,940
she didn't mean that.

161
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,820
I'm tired.

162
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,340
I'm heading back.

163
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,130
Miss Chuchu.

164
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,619
Deliver this to the General's Mansion,

165
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,490
and the money is yours.

166
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,890
What more

167
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,229
do you want from me?

168
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,340
Chu,

169
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,970
I didn't scheme this with Mother.

170
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,580
I looked into it.

171
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,259
An army cook's wife was ill,

172
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,220
so someone bribed him to send the news.

173
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,989
Who?

174
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,250
The cook said

175
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,300
this person didn't show their face.

176
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,090
Their identity is unknown.

177
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,820
Chu,

178
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,469
I'd never lie to you.

179
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,730
Believe me.

180
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,180
Believe you?

181
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,949
That's the problem.

182
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,989
I thought you were at least

183
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,300
honest with me.

184
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,890
But I was wrong.

185
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,770
Watch out!

186
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,220
