The past Li Chuchu is dead.

From now on, you're the legitimate son
while I'm your illegitimate sister.

6
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,700
Do not say such words again.

7
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,620
Our ancestors will scorn us for this.

(Father,)

20
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,180
(I can't bear to part with Chu.)

21
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,620
(If you wish to blame someone,
blame me for it.)

22
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,300
(I'm the stubborn one.)

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,650
(I'm the one who insists on
making Chu my partner.)

(If you wish to blame someone
for being unfilial,)

25
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,300
(you should blame me alone.)

26
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,289

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,499
Today's the spring festival.

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,930
Why is Tiantian having rashes now?

30
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,989
Miss Tiantian always had
a weak constitution.

31
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,779
Spring is usually
when most allergies occur.

32
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,850
Maybe she's allergic to something.

33
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,620
Tiantian.

34
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,850
Mother!

35
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,829
How could this happen?

36
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,109
Seems like you cannot
attend the spring banquet.

37
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,800
I've prepared so long
for this day to arrive!

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,340
You want my effort to go down the drain?

39
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,989
Since our family
has received an invitation,

40
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,339
we have to attend it somehow.

41
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,389
Madam, should we send Miss Chuchu there

42
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,020
or Miss Qianqian there?

43
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,740
Madam!

44
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,299
Madam, we're in trouble!

45
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,970
Miss Qianqian is experiencing
vomit and diarrhea. She's terribly ill.

46
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,229
It's just a minor stomach upset.

47
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,829
You should report this
to the housekeeper.

48
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,580
You didn't need to report this
to Madam at all.

49
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,530
Yes, madam.

50
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,020
I understand now.

51
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,690
(At this moment too?)

52
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,250
(Isn't this too much of a coincidence?)

53
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,669
Mother.

54
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,810
Tiantian.

55
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,340
Today's the spring festival.

56
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,989
Tiantian is having rashes.

57
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,779
Qianqian is ill as well.

58
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,740
You have to attend it
on our family's behalf.

59
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,700
Mother,

60
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,989
I was never presentable.

61
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,989
I'm not as elegant as Tiantian.

62
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,379
If I do attend it

63
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,460
and disgrace myself somehow,

64
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,429
people will badmouth our family instead.

65
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,499
Since you know your weaknesses,

66
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,780
you should stay humble and prudent.

67
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,610
Come back after showing your face.

68
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,789
Yes, Mother.

69
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,669
I understand.

70
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,139
Put this on.

71
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,020
Don't embarrass the family.

72
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,820
Chu?

73
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,050
What are you doing here?

74
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,380
Why can't I be here?

75
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,970
The spring banquet is the
most important event in Anping County.

76
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,970
I'm General Li's daughter.
Of course I can attend it.

77
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,440
(Li Mansion)

78
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,290
Chu,

79
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,340
you've been acting off lately.

80
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,260
What exactly happened?

81
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,580
Zhen, your marriage with
Miss Lin will be held soon.

82
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,260
Of course I have to
keep up with your pace.

83
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,349
I might encounter a better
husband candidate than Mr. Lin

84
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,730
during the spring banquet.

85
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,819
Let me go.

86
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,020
Listen closely.

87
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,989
I will never marry Lin Shuhui

88
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,850
or anyone else.

89
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,499
It's because I promised

90
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,460
a certain girl that I would

91
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,589
keep her company forever.

92
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,789
Zhen, your marriage

93
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,140
has nothing to do with me.

94
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,020
Chuchu!

95
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,340
Qianqian is here.

96
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,020
Chuchu.

97
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,940
Qianqian.

98
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,029
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,499
I thought you were sick.

100
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,499
Zhen,

101
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,619
Chuchu,

102
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,020
I've never attended
the spring banquet before.

103
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,340
Please take me there.

104
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,260
Can your body withstand it?

105
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,589
I've almost fully recovered.

106
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,619
Chuchu,

107
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,050
please take me there.

108
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,170
Depart.

109
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,610
(Plenty of noblemen
will attend the spring banquet.)

110
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,140
(This is my best opportunity
to carve out a path.)

111
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,020
(I can't afford to miss out on it.)

112
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,040
(Radiant Sun)

113
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,460
It's my honor to attend this event.

114
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,610
You deserve your slot.

115
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,170
Greetings, Third Prince.

116
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,619
I'm Li Zhen.

117
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,780
You may rise.

118
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,499
I've long heard of General Qilin's name.

119
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,819
Now that I'm seeing you in person,

120
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,940
I can tell
that you're extraordinary indeed.

121
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,080
Your Highness, I've also heard about you

122
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,020
from my father constantly
some years ago.

123
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,379
I was truly impressed.

124
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,349
Oh?

125
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,530
Is that so?

126
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,170
During the Battle of Jiangling,

127
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,530
my father was framed by someone
for leaking intel to the enemies.

128
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,020
Your Highness,
what do you think about it?

129
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,499
General Li, mind your words.

130
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,170
If His Majesty hears about this,

131
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,340
I'm afraid

132
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,530
he'll hold a grudge against
your family again.

133
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,250
Your Highness,
thank you for the reminder.

134
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,460
Beyond the willow-lined path
in a red skirt,

135
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,850
by the apricot tower
adorned with colorful ribbons,

136
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,970
her waist is as slender
as the moon in flight,

137
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,610
and her body so light,
it seems ready to ascend to the sky.

138
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,259
I've never expected to see
such a beautiful view.

139
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,010
This trip is truly worth it.

140
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,890
Are you okay?

141
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,540
I'm fine.

142
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,899
Who is bold enough

143
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,770
to do this?

144
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,730
How dare they attempt this
in broad daylight?

145
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,779
Who's there?

146
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,850
Stop right there!

147
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,259
Chuchu,

148
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,540
are you okay?

149
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,379
Miss Chuchu,

150
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,010
why does your outfit
have a phoenix pattern?

151
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,019
The phoenix is a symbol of nobility.
It's only meant for the empress.

152
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,770
How dare Li Chuchu
provoke her in public?

153
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,770
Her Majesty is Third Prince's mother.

154
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,730
Li Chuchu is too bold for her own good.

155
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,010
Third Prince is here.

156
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,130
This is a grave offense.

157
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,220
According to the law,
she should be flogged to death.

158
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,589
Chu is my illegitimate sister.

159
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,989
She's young and ignorant.

160
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,660
Your Highness,
if you wish to punish someone,

161
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,180
you may punish me.

162
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,610
She's just your illegitimate sister.

163
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,419
But General Qilin,
you do care about her, huh?

164
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,499
It's a shame

165
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,899
that I'm always strict
about rewards and punishments.

166
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,180
She has committed the crime.

167
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,540
You cannot be punished for it.

168
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,970
Your Highness, you're right.

169
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,539
I've committed a crime.

170
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,940
I deserved to be punished.

171
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,250
However,

172
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,340
everyone, please take a look.

173
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,180
This isn't the pattern of a phoenix.

174
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,180
It's the pattern of a peacock.

175
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,469
I assume Miss Lin

176
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,180
was mistaken.

177
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,659
(She harbors sinister intentions.)

178
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,180
(I assume she's going to
make me offend Third Prince.)

179
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,660
(If so,)

180
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,700
(why don't I use this to my advantage?)

181
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,659
I was hasty.

182
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,309
Miss Chuchu, I was wrong.

183
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,499
Miss Chuchu,

184
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,010
were you startled?

185
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,989
Your Highness, you're
a filial son to Her Majesty.

186
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,499
I'm very touched.

187
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,850
I'm not startled at all.

188
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,700
Darn it.

189
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,180
She got away with it again.

190
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,730
Madam, please be appeased.

191
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,589
She's just lucky.

192
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,540
She won't be that lucky next time.

193
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,709
Are you sure the men you hired are reliable?
Do not let Zhen find out.

194
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,779
Don't worry.

195
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,770
