00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 13=

4
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,850
(This time, both the Li and Lin families
were thoroughly disgraced.)

5
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,779
(You could say
they finally paid a small price)

6
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,490
(for what they've done.)

7
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,970
(Now,)

8
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,210
(it's time to investigate
what happened to Mother back then.)

9
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,059
It's a beautiful day today.

10
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,970
Miss Chuchu, would you like
to go out for a stroll?

11
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,520
I already have plans.

12
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,619
Miss Qianqian,

13
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,009
Madam is thirsty.

14
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,210
Aren't you going to pour her some water?

15
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,210
That won't be necessary.

16
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,049
I punished you

17
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,729
because you made a mistake.

18
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,539
But now that the punishment is done,
things will return to normal.

19
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,360
You won't be mistreated.

20
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,210
Thank you, Mother, for your guidance.

21
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,569
Now that Tiantian has returned
to the countryside,

22
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,169
I find myself rather lonely.

23
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,010
I'll treat you
as if you were my own daughter.

24
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,240
Just remember to be prudent

25
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,960
and know your place.

26
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,360
Thank you, Mother.

27
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,330
You and I

28
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,210
are of one heart, always.

29
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,360
Miss Chuchu.

30
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,960
Mr. Lin.

31
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,290
I waited for you all day that day.

32
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,050
I thought you weren't coming.

33
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,010
There was an incident at the wedding.

34
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,859
I'm truly sorry.

35
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,099
I thought

36
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,379
you had changed your mind.

37
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,960
Why would you say something like that?

38
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,569
If I ever had such thoughts,

39
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,729
may lightning strike me down.

40
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,450
Why make such a harsh vow?

41
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,080
I believe you.

42
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,699
I care about you too much.

43
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,360
I was afraid you'd doubt me.

44
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,960
Lately, I've been under strict watch.

45
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,890
There's always someone following me.

46
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,800
We might not have much time to talk.

47
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,979
That's all right.

48
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,400
We have a long road ahead of us.

49
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,240
For now,

50
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,379
tell me about your childhood.

51
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,889
I want to know you better.

52
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,050
All right.

53
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,280
(After the Battle of Jiangling,
General Qilin was accused of treason.)

54
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,650
(The biggest beneficiary was the Third Prince,
who wrested military power)

55
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,310
(from the Crown Prince
and gained support at court.)

56
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,890
The Third Prince is extremely
cautious and cunning.

57
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,330
Back then,
all the witnesses and evidence

58
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,360
mysteriously vanished.

59
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,939
After all this time,

60
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,050
we still have no solid leads.

61
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,570
We'll have to wait for them
to make their next move.

62
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,809
Sir.

63
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,369
Our spies have discovered

64
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,840
that the Third Prince secretly went
to Jiangling yesterday.

65
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,010
Jiangling?

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,480
What business does he have in Jiangling?

67
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,520
Fenglin.

68
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,370
Go make the preparations.

69
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,019
I'll go there myself.

70
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,040
Yes, sir.

71
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,210
Jiangling.

72
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,520
I never imagined you'd be
such a troublemaker as a child.

73
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,489
Those old servants at your mansion

74
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,659
must run and hide when they see you.

75
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,040
My mother dismissed

76
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,210
all of them years ago.

77
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,960
Fortunately,
we still have the registry records.

78
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,659
Once I officially take over the mansion,

79
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,689
I might be able

80
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,210
to bring some of them back.

81
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,729
My mother's been keeping
a close eye on me lately. I should get going.

82
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,859
Don't worry about me.

83
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,210
Wait for me.

84
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,280
(If I can get my hands
on that registry,)

85
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,400
(I might be able to find)

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,550
(the midwife who delivered
my mother's baby back then.)

87
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,779
Miss Chuchu,

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,570
we've found what you were looking for.

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,240
(On the 18th day of the 6th month,)
(There's a good chance)

90
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,000
(Qian Erniang entered the Lin mansion)
(this midwife's the one this midwife's the one)

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,330
(for a delivery.)
(this midwife's the one)

92
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,700
(who helped deliver Mother's baby.)

93
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,049
I heard there was a break-in?

94
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,480
Don't worry, Madam.

95
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,859
Nothing valuable was taken.

96
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,169
Just some old registries

97
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,210
from over a decade ago.

98
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,250
It all seems too convenient.

99
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,010
Almost like someone planned it.

100
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,690
We can't be too careful.

101
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,930
Nanny Qi,

102
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,720
go take care of something for me.

103
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,040
Yes, Madam.

104
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:53,659
(Libation)

105
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,809
Greetings.

106
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,810
Excuse me, is Madam Qian home?

107
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,369
Greetings.

108
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,369
Excuse me, is Madam Qian home?

109
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,859
You've come at a bad time.

110
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,489
She passed away just yesterday.

111
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,809
She's dead?

112
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,520
There are plenty
of good midwives out there,

113
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,779
but lately, people have been

114
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,539
coming around asking for Madam Qian.

115
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,370
Even from out of town.

116
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,690
Out of town?

117
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,770
Do you know who?

118
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,809
It was about a year ago,

119
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,480
I think.

120
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,840
Their last name was He.

121
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,160
They even asked
about the birth of the Duke's wife.

122
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,370
They left an address.

123
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,219
Said if she remembered anything,

124
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,640
she should write to them.

125
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,690
He?

126
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,040
(My birth mother's surname was He.)

127
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,520
(Could this person be from her family?)

128
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,810
Could you give me that address?

129
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,659
Only Madam Qian in her coffin
would know that now.

130
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,450
But she did mention this once.

131
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,049
A medicine peddler from Jiangling
who comes every year

132
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,450
during the Flower Goddess Festival
to sell remedies to newlyweds.

133
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,400
Thank you.

134
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,169
(All my leads have dried up.)

135
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,289
(But if I can find this He,)

136
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,979
(there might still be a breakthrough.)

137
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,779
(Alas, it's a long journey,)

138
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,729
(and I'm sure Madam
will try to stop me.)

139
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,200
Make sure to pack more warm clothes.

140
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,729
The weather in Jiangling is cold.

141
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,169
The general may be away
for quite some time on this trip.

142
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,250
Understood.

143
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,409
You had Mingyue send word
saying you needed to see me.

144
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,480
Why are you here drinking alone?

145
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm in a good mood.

146
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,960
What's the happy occasion?

147
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,210
Careful.

148
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,760
I heard the Flower Goddess Festival

149
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,859
in Jiangling is one of the most
breathtaking sights in the world.

150
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,699
I've never had the chance
to see it for myself.

151
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,840
I happened to overhear Deputy Feng

152
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,529
mention you're going to Jiangling.

153
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,290
Would you be willing
to let me come along?

154
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,960
This is an official mission.

155
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,219
Didn't you say

156
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,450
you still owed me a birthday gift?

157
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,080
I don't want rouge or powder.

158
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,720
I want to attend
the Flower Goddess Festival.

159
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,210
Chu.

160
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,650
You've had too much to drink.

161
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,530
I'll take you back to your room.

162
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,530
Chu.

163
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,480
You're not in your right mind right now.

164
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,050
You don't even know what you're asking.

165
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,410
Zhen,

166
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,880
don't go.

167
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,530
Stay with me.

168
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,210
Stay...

Chu,

185
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,720
wherever you want to go,

186
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,050
I'll go with you.

♪How much will fate honor this promise?♪

190
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:52,170
(Li's Mansion)
Let's go.

191
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,129
Madam,

192
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,570
what brings you here?

193
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,050
You wretched woman!

194
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,480
This is the daughter you raised?

195
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,979
She eloped with her legitimate brother
behind our backs!

196
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,240
Don't tell me you knew nothing about it!

197
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,870
(Mother, I will be taking Chuchu
with me to Jiangling.)

198
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,369
Madam.

199
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,939
I had no idea about this.

200
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,179
There must be

201
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,339
some kind of misunderstanding,

202
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,360
Madam!

203
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,409
No wonder the wedding between Zhen

204
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,729
and Miss Lin was called off.

205
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,410
Turns out this little wench
was behind it all!

206
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,859
That's not true.

207
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,050
It can't be.

208
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,579
Miss Chuchu and Mr. Zhen
grew up together.

209
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,179
They've always been close.
They're siblings.

210
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,330
Nothing more...

211
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,530
Mother!

212
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,859
Mother,

213
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,650
this has nothing to do with her.

214
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,240
I saw it with my own eyes.

215
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,880
Chuchu and Zhen were together.

216
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,080
They're the ones who crossed the line.

217
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,240
How long have you known?

218
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,410
Rest assured, Mother.

219
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,570
I know how serious this is.

220
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,810
I won't breathe a word.

221
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,810
His Majesty holds propriety above all.

222
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,880
If word of this gets out,

223
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,699
the entire Li family will be finished!

224
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,170
None of us will survive it!
