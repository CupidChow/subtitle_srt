00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 12=

4
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,739
Miss Chuchu,

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,250
Deputy Feng is here.

6
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,739
Miss Chuchu.

7
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,010
Deputy Feng.

8
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,730
Do you need anything?

9
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,890
Miss Chuchu.

10
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,459
This is

11
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,099
General Zhen's entire savings.

12
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,560
You have to keep it well.

13
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,400
Why are you giving this to me?

14
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,190
(Ministry of Revenue's
Official Bank Notes)

15
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,290
(That's a lot of money.)

16
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,200
(What does he mean by this?)

17
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,369
Madam Ping.

18
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,000
Tie her up.

19
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,610
Madam Ping, what do you mean by this?

20
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,529
Madam Ping,

21
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,419
today's Tiantian's wedding day.

22
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,240
I still have to join
the bridal escort later.

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,329
Madam said

24
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,979
that today's

25
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,209
Miss Tiantian's wedding day.

26
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,899
No incidents must occur.

27
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,369
Keep a close eye on her.

28
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,250
Do not let her leave.

29
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,102
Yes, Madam.

30
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:38,790
(Li Mansion)

31
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,770
Have you arranged for everything?

32
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,739
Miss, don't worry.

33
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,120
This time, she'll suffer for sure.

34
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,459
Take it easy on her. Don't kill her.

35
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,209
Once I return gloriously
as the heir's spouse,

36
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,050
I'll do it myself.

37
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,720
Yes, Miss.

38
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,089
General,

39
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,930
I've handed it to Miss Chuchu.

40
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,210
(Chu,)

41
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,090
(with that sum,)

42
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,369
(you and Lin Ansheng)

43
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,700
(won't need to worry about
living expenses for a few years.)

44
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,770
(Once you leave,)

45
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,440
(you shouldn't come back.)

46
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,090
(If not, I won't let you go again.)

47
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,090
Let's go.

48
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,750
(Li Mansion)

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,840
Amitabha.

50
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,610
The heavens, you must bless us.

51
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,000
Please make sure
the wedding proceed smoothly.

52
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,459
I have an uneasy feeling about this.

53
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,120
Look after the mansion.

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,810
I'll monitor Tiantian's wedding myself.

55
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,739
This year's early spring is cold.

56
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,929
Miss Chuchu, take care
not to catch a cold.

57
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,720
Let me set a fire for you.

58
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,120
Burning charcoal
with the windows shut, huh?

59
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,000
Tiantian is truly concerned about me.

60
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,899
(Duke's Mansion)

61
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,320
Bow to Heaven and Earth!

62
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,520
Bow to each other's parents!

63
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,440
Bow to each other!

64
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,089
Look.

65
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,410
Isn't that the new prostitute
in the Court Music Bureau?

66
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,930
How is she Mr. Lin's bride?

67
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,849
Everyone,

68
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,729
that's the prostitute
from the Court Music Bureau.

69
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,899
I saw her

70
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,560
serving two guests myself.

71
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,930
Who's bold enough
to spout such nonsense?

72
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,440
Prostitute?

73
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,059
Today's the wedding between
the Lin and the Li family.

74
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,930
How dare you guys...

75
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,059
Madam.

76
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,059
These people

77
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,849
are just jealous of our
marriage alliance.

78
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,729
That's why they're framing us.

79
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,080
You mustn't trust them.

80
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,499
Naturally, I believe in

81
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,139
Miss Li's character.

82
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,649
However,
there are plenty of people here.

83
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,850
I'm afraid things will be
difficult to handle

84
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,930
if I don't give them an account.

85
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,930
Madam, you mean...

86
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,320
The nanny can examine Miss Li's body.

87
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,209
Madam,

88
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,019
this is merely a makeshift solution.

89
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm just doing it for show.

90
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,019
Madam Li,

91
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,880
you mustn't overthink it.

92
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,810
Tiantian?

93
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,819
This...

94
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,560
What's wrong with Miss Li?

95
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,089
Dear guests,
please head to the other venue.

96
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,290
- Please.
- Please.

97
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,290
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

98
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,290
Let's go.

99
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,059
Stop right there.

100
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,410
Where do you think you're going?

101
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,290
Don't think that I don't know
what's on your mind.

102
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,459
No matter if your wedding with Miss Li

103
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,699
is completed or not,

104
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,080
you're not allowed to meet Li Chuchu.

105
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,680
Li Chuchu!

106
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,409
It's all your fault.

107
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,850
You landed me in this plight!
I'm going to kill you!

108
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,560
Tiantian, why are you furious?

109
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,730
Could it be

110
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,680
that the Lin family
canceled the wedding?

111
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,899
You wretch.

112
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,930
I'm going to chop you up

113
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,059
and feed you to the dogs
near the mass grave.

114
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,810
Even if you kill me, do you think you're
no longer the Court Music Bureau's prostitute?

115
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,440
Now, no one will marry you.

116
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,000
Even so,

117
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,320
I'm going to kill you
to appease my rage!

118
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,520
Tiantian, calm down.

119
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,059
I've already
vented your frustrations for you.

120
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,290
What do you mean by that?

121
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,089
Mr. Lin said he would elope with me

122
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,139
after his wedding.

123
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,290
Look.

124
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,930
I didn't join him.

125
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,899
I abandoned him.

126
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,209
Shouldn't you be appeased by now?

127
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,560
Li Chuchu,

128
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,320
I'm going to kill you!

129
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,410
Tiantian, you're a noble lady indeed.

130
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,440
You don't even know
how to target one's vital spot.

131
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,059
Why don't I teach you how to do it?

132
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,080
Stop right there!

133
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,049
Zhen. Chuchu has lost her mind.
She was trying to kill me.

134
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,899
Li Chuchu,

135
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,739
what are you doing?

136
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,120
Have you lost your mind?

137
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,210
Send Tiantian back to her room.

138
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,649
Let go!

139
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,809
I'm going to kill her!

140
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,689
Li Chuchu,

141
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,099
I'm going to kill you!

142
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,490
Let go!

143
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,899
Mother, you saw it yourself.

144
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,859
I wasn't trying to kill Tiantian.

145
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,450
She was the one who tried to kill me.

146
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,099
Why would she need to kill you

147
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,739
if you behaved yourself
in the first place?

148
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,649
Mother, I beg to differ.

149
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,379
Madam Ping tied me up
and locked me in my room.

150
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,139
She even shut all the windows.

151
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,859
I never left the room.

152
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,120
Isn't that enough?

153
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,570
Mother,

154
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,219
judging from
Tiantian's current condition,

155
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,330
she shouldn't remain in Anping County.

156
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,099
It's best to send her back

157
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,880
to the ancestral temple for now.

158
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,800
Pack her things.

159
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,210
Send Tiantian to
the ancestral temple tomorrow.

160
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,120
Yes, Madam.

161
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,250
This is better
for Miss Tiantian as well.

162
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,529
There'll be quite a stir

163
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,330
in Anping for a while.

164
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,049
If she remains here,

165
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,040
her mental state
will break down eventually.

166
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,490
I know that all too well.

167
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,610
It's just that Tiantian

168
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,730
has never left my side

169
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,880
since young.

170
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,760
Madam, don't worry.

171
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,379
Once enough time has passed,

172
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,280
people will forget about the incident.

173
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,040
We'll be able to bring
Miss Tiantian back eventually.

174
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,000
Li Chuchu was truly crafty
this time around.

175
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,120
And, no one got the goods on her.

176
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,730
I've underestimated her.

177
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,610
No matter how crafty she is,

178
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,280
she has to rely
on the family to survive.

179
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,400
As long as she remains here,

180
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,400
she cannot survive
without following your rules.

181
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,880
I must make her pay

182
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,040
for what she did to Tiantian.

183
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,040
Let me do it.

184
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:34,911
♪May the moonlight melt away the night♪

185
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,160
Wait.

186
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,690

Chu,

207
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,449
don't you intend to leave?

208
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,400
Mother and the rest have no time
to pay attention to you for now.

209
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,450
Where should I go?

210
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,219
Since you're not leaving,

211
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,690
you should rest well.

212
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,850
Mother, were you looking for me?

213
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,760
Tiantian was sent back to our hometown.

214
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,250
I've just heard about it as well.

215
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,690
I'm sure Tiantian was framed.

216
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,049
It's all your fault!

217
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,090
I don't know what I've done wrong.

218
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,730
Mother, please practice wise judgment!

219
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,800
How dare you still say that?

220
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,450
Don't think that I don't know
you persuaded Tiantian

221
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,259
to join you in dealing with Li Chuchu.

222
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,529
That's why she took the wrong path

223
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,120
and had her reputation ruined.

224
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,610
Mother.

225
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,400
I had no idea
why it turned out like that.

226
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,090
I just couldn't accept the fact

227
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,090
that Chuchu
had plotted against Tiantian.

228
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,259
I wanted to teach her a lesson.

229
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,570
But what happened in the end?

230
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,049
In the end,
Tiantian was ruined because of you.

231
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,090
Is that how you teach her a lesson?

232
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,760
Mother,

233
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,250
I know my fault now.

234
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,400
You can punish me however you like.

235
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,250
But please don't be angry.

236
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,099
It'll affect your health.

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,929
Since you know your fault now,

239
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,570
you should kneel here

240
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,880
and make amends to Tiantian.
