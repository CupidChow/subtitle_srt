00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 7=

4
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,700
Chu,

5
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,220
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,530
I failed to protect you.

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,980
Am I still alive?

8
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,930
Miss Chuchu.

9
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,099
You're finally awake.

10
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,069
Thank goodness.

11
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,860
You had a fever for two days straight.

12
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,220
Didn't they drown me in the pond?

13
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,850
How did I return here?

14
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,389
Miss Chuchu, don't worry.

15
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,680
The mystery has been solved.

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,600
The maidservant, who served as a messenger,
admitted that she took a bribe

17
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,829
and duped you into heading there.

18
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,040
She was the one who stole
the jewelry and money as well.

19
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,620
The arrangement was
well-thought-out indeed.

20
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,530
They even found a scapegoat.

21
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,130
I supposed they did
put in a lot of effort.

22
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,429
Miss Chuchu,

23
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,669
actually, another major event

24
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,499
occurred in the family
while you were away.

25
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,339
Duke of Lin's spouse visited our family

26
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,930
to discuss the marriage between
Mr. Zhen and Miss Lin.

27
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,299
Got it.

28
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,690
You may leave first.

29
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,149
Duchess, you had to come
all the way here personally.

30
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,690
We're truly ashamed.

31
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,899
As custom dictates,

32
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,899
we're supposed to pay a visit in person.

33
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,739
Madam Li,
you don't need to be courteous.

34
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,299
We'll be a family in the future.

35
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,850
What's mine is yours.

36
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,459
Duchess, you're right.

37
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,650
We'll be a family in the future.

38
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,619
(I wonder who has the ability)

39
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,090
(to make our madam bow down.)

40
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,370
By the way,

41
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,669
Madam, there's one more thing

42
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,690
I wish to mention.

43
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,900
What is it?

44
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,989
My son, Ansheng, has taken a liking
to the second daughter here.

45
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,300
He insisted on marrying her.

46
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,370
If you don't have any objections,

47
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,650
I'll send a carriage here

48
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,780
and take her with me in a few days.

49
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,370
About that...

50
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,459
Who's there?

51
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,620
Show yourself!

52
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,220
Madam.

53
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,690
It's me.

54
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,709
Madam.

55
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,869
I'm here to serve our guest some tea.

56
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,410
You can leave it here.

57
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,429
Darned lass.

58
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,109
Are you blind?

59
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,779
Huh?

60
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,709
You better watch out.

61
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,690
I might sell you to a human trafficker.

62
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,379
Leave!

63
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,610
Madam, please pardon me.

64
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,090
I'll get a new set right now.

65
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,379
The girl lacks exposure to the world.

66
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,410
Madam, sorry for the embarrassment.

67
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,730
Madam,

68
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,259
may I know about

69
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,700
Miss Chuchu's hour of birth
and Eight Characters?

70
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,460
I think it was the 8th day of the
4th lunar month in the Year of Guiyou.

71
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,299
Madam.

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,460
You...

73
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,090
I suddenly remember
that I have other things to attend to.

74
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,260
I shall bid farewell for now.

75
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,669
Regarding the marriage with Miss Chuchu,

76
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,140
we should forget about it.

77
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,900
I don't think their Eight Characters
are suitable for each other.

78
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,380
How could this be?

79
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,349
Back then,

80
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,140
he was just
the overlooked son of a second wife.

81
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,619
But now, how did he
inherit such a noble title?

82
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,229
Madam,

83
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,580
what happened?

84
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,700
Chuchu,

85
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,739
you mustn't marry into
the Duke of Lin's Mansion.

86
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,460
You mustn't marry Lin Ansheng.

87
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,780
But why?

88
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,580
It's because

89
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,020
you're a member of the Lin family.

90
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,220
You and Lin Ansheng

91
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,610
are blood siblings.

92
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,260
Madam.

93
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

94
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,699
How is that possible?

95
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,290
I'm not spouting nonsense.

96
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,170
If I lie,

97
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,050
the heavens will punish me.

98
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,850
Your biological mother

99
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,050
was Madam He, was
the late duke's original wife.

100
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,020
I served her as a dowry maid.

101
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,700
The current Duchess of Lin

102
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,220
was merely a concubine back then.

103
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,970
Madam,

104
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,220
you'll definitely be fine.

105
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,530
Madam Qiao is ruthless.

106
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,290
She won't

107
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,140
let my child off.

108
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,940
This is everything I have.

109
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,220
On account of our ties,

110
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,850
you should escape with her.

111
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,610
The further you go, the better.

112
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,700
Madam!

113
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,090
Madam!

114
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,490
After that, I ended up
becoming General Li's mistress.

115
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,700
He brought me back to his residence
after I was pregnant with Qianqian.

116
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,179
Even the female head thought

117
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,380
that we gave birth to you
outside of the residence.

118
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,669
Initially, I wanted to let you

119
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,059
lead a peaceful life.

120
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,699
But after 18 years,

121
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,140
you and the Lin family
are once intertwined again.

122
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,060
(I was dragged down by my title
as an illegitimate child all my life.)

123
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,940
(But in the end,)

124
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,700
(it was merely a cruel joke.)

125
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,010
(The heavens,)

126
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,180
(do you know how unfair you are?)

127
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,379
(Why are you allowing evildoers
to enjoy fame and fortune)

128
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,069
(while the innocent)

129
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,700
(have to struggle
in a living hell like this?)

Chu, you had just

134

Why are you standing under the rain?

135
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,700
Did Mother punish you again?

136
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,899
(It turns out
that we aren't blood siblings.)

137
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,850
(Those dreams I had
weren't forbidden as well.)

138
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,060
Zhen.

139
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,189
Who exactly am I?

140
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,220
Chu,

141
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,220

You always wanted
to leave the residence, right?

147
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,940
I'll take you with me right now.

148
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,060
Let's go.

149
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,890
I wasn't the one
who had committed crimes.

150
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,189
I wasn't the one who had committed
mistakes either. Why should I run away?

151
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,709
Since the world's
all about power and status,

152
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,060
instead of waiting for
the powerful to show mercy,

153
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,220
I would rather

154
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,539
depend on myself

155
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,090
and fight against my unfair destiny.

156
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,610
(No matter if we're blood siblings)

157
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,490
(or not,)

158
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,890
(you and I)

159
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,730
(can never be together.)

160
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,610
Chu has been acting off lately.

161
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,700
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

162
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,610
Report to me once you notice anything.

163
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,560
(Tranquility and Grace)

164
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,700
(No matter how tough
this path will prove to be,)

165
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,220
(I'll make sure all those
who harmed me and my mother)

166
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,580
(pay.)

167
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,820
Mingyue,

168
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,580
has Mr. Lin written anything to me?

169
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,890
Not yet.

170
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,060
It's fine.

171
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,180
I can write to him myself.

172
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,869
Chuchu, you were involved
in a huge scandal.

173
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,499
Even so,
you still dare to doll yourself up

174
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,709
to attract attention, huh?

175
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,949
Your thick skin

176
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,090
is truly astonishing.

177
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,200
A woman adorns herself
to please the one she loves.

178
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,019
I dolled myself up for Mr. Lin's sake.

179
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,019
Unlike you.
You spent so much effort on yourself,

180
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,589
and no one pays you any attention.

181
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,659
Such audacity!

182
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,589
You better stop.

183
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,779
Even a hare will bite

184
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,490
when it gets desperate.

185
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,850
That wretch.

186
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,370
How did she become
this bold all of a sudden?

187
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,619
I never expected

188
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,370
that wretch to be alive.

189
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,010
She even became
General Li's second daughter.

190
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,069
Back then, I found a baby's corpse
to make up the numbers

191
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,820
to prevent my husband
from being suspicious.

192
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,700
If this turns into a commotion,

193
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,370
I'm afraid it won't end well.

194
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,730
Madam, there's no need to worry.

195
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,019
She's just a lass.

196
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,060
What can she do?

197
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,829
We can silence her

198
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,540
with the lift of a finger.

199
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,700
We should practice caution.

200
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,659
Li Zhen is backed by His Majesty.

201
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,490
And, An has fallen
head over heels for her.

202
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,370
We'll be in a reactive position
if people hear about this.

203
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,499
It's best

204
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,109
if we make her vanish

205
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,589
without anyone knowing.

206
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,700
Madam,

207
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,539
it's a letter for Mr. Lin.

208
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,580
I think it's from the General's Mansion.

209
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:15,080
(Mr. Lin, may my words represent me.
Long time no see.)

210
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,840
(The spring scenery
has been pleasing lately.)

211
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,280
(I hope you will show up
at the tea house by the pavilion.)

212
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,349
(See you there, Chuchu)

213
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,300
This vixen is too bold for her own good!

214
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,610
How dare she attempt
to meet An in private?

215
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,019
She...

216
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,610
She's trying to cause a scandal here.

217
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,610
Madam, please be appeased.

218
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,370
Isn't this our opportunity to act?

219
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,010
What about this?

220
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,259
Mingyue,

221
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,349
have you delivered the letter

222
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,069
I told you to?

223
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,420
I have.

224
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,309
Miss,

225
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,379
what exactly are you up to?

226
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,309
Why are you...

227
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,869
This no longer concerns you.

228
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,220
You may leave first.

229
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,250
