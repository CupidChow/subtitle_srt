1
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 24=

4
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,579
Your Highness,

5
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,019
Li Zhen's deputy general, Fenglin,
secretly led Army Qilin

6
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,709
out of Anping County.

7
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,020
Their movements are suspicious.

8
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,580
There's no news from the palace

9
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,510
after so long.

10
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,870
Could the Crown Prince be
planning something big?

11
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,790
Take this.

12
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,019
Lead the troops to station
outside the city.

13
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,460
Just in case.

14
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,660
Yes, Your Highness.

15
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,580
Are you thinking about the Third Prince?

16
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,069
You see right through
everything, Chuchu.

17
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,790
I'm worried.

18
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,580
A war is coming.

19
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,660
If I lose, I might
drag you down with me.

20
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,380
Zhen,

21
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,070
Go ahead and do it. Don't hold back.

22
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,380
I'll always be with you,

23
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,860
in life and death.

24
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,389
Miss Qianqian,

25
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,910
you really scared me.

26
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,350
How's everything going

27
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,310
here?

28
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,059
Miss Chuchu

29
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,750
is back on the mend.

30
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,179
Mr. Zhen has been out often
these past few days.

31
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,100
He probably is handling something big.

32
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,010
(Tranquility and Grace)

33
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,470
Miss Chuchu.

34
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,549
Miss Chuchu,

35
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,149
I beg you.

36
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,829
Please help Miss Qianqian.

37
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,389
She...

38
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,790
She's dying.

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,739
What happened?

40
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,070
Get up and tell me.

41
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,619
Since coming back from the estate,

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,510
Miss Qianqian has been feeling unwell.

43
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,229
I thought she'd secure a good life

44
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,910
with the Third Prince,

45
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,860
but she suddenly fell seriously ill.

46
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,459
Now, she's been abandoned
at an inn,

47
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,100
sinking fast.

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,019
I've never asked anything of you

49
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:35,100
over the past 18 years
I've spent raising you.

50
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,030
Please give Qianqian one more chance.

51
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,700
How about this?

52
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,389
I'll ask Zhen

53
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,910
for his permission to bring her back
to recover.

54
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,190
Miss Chuchu,

55
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,230
please come with me now.

56
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,229
If not, you might miss the chance
to see her

57
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,820
for the last time.

58
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,750
Well.

59
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,190
Wait for me outside.

60
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,820
I'll change and come with you.

61
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,470
Yes, miss.

62
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,060
Qianqian,

63
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,300
what has happened?

64
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,739
Why have you become like this?

65
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,030
Chuchu,

66
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,180
I don't think I have much time left.

67
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,789
When I think back on what I did

68
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,590
that drove us apart,

69
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,179
I feel so ashamed.

70
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,830
Don't say that now.

71
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,910
Your health is what matters more.

72
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,590
I won't ask for your forgiveness,

73
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,420
only that you accept this tea
as my apology.

74
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,590
Chuchu,

75
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,910
kill Li Zhen.

76
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,420
Yes.

77
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,860
Where did you get this drug?

78
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,590
Interesting.

79
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,230
This isn't a drug.

80
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,860
It's Gu poison,

81
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,030
Love Gu.

82
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,740
I got it from a wandering physician

83
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,230
when I was sent back to the estate.

84
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,830
Surprisingly,

85
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,180
now it's coming in handy.

86
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,939
Mr. Zhen,

87
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,470
Miss Chuchu is back.

88
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,610
(Tranquility and Grace)

89
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,350
Chu.

90
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,179
The weather is cold.

91
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,590
You haven't fully recovered.

92
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,180
Don't catch a chill.

93
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,230
Chu,

94
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,030
what are you doing?

95
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,740
I'm going to kill you.

96
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,420
Why?

97
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,860
Master wants me to kill me,

98
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,790
so I will.

99
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,230
One fatal stab.

100
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,910
Well done.

101
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,590
Oh, Li Zhen.

102
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,229
You're too confident.

103
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,590
Do you really think

104
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,660
you're a match for me?

105
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,500
Congratulations, Your Highness.

106
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,030
Now,

107
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
it's time for my turn.

108
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,350
Qianqian,

109
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,780
what are you trying to do?

110
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,500
No need to waste your breath, Chuchu.

111
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,230
You killed Li Zhen.

112
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,710
A murderer like you

113
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,900
can't get away with it.

114
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,550
Li Qianqian,

115
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,739
why do you hate me so much?

116
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,070
I took so many beatings for you
since we were little.

117
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,380
Zhen always treated you well.

118
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,710
Yet you tricked me into killing him.

119
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,190
Don't you feel any guilt toward Madam

120
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,740
for what you've done?

121
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,590
You dare mention her?

122
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,589
She died because of you.

123
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,740
It's you

124
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,100
who turned me into an orphan.

125
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,140
No.

126
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,380
Madam cared about you so much.

127
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,589
She begged me to look after you

128
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,830
even before she breathed her last.

129
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,550
Look after me?

130
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,500
Fine.

131
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,020
If so, will you sacrifice

132
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,710
for my good future once again?

133
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,419
You want to kill me?

134
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,470
That's no fun.

135
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,100
I want you to suffer.

136
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,190
If I scar

137
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,310
your pretty face

138
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,900
with this dagger

139
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,739
and throw you out on the street,

140
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,670
wouldn't that be more fun?

141
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,070
Why?

142
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,780
Why are you doing this to me?

143
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,380
How could I possibly keep

144
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,590
a lowly and wicked woman like you
by my side?

145
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,709
What if you try to poison me?

146
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,230
This isn't a drug.

147
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,830
It's Gu poison.

148
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,100
Someone as obedient and weak

149
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,860
as Miss Chuchu

150
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,860
is more lovable.

151
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,590
Ji Qingyun,

152
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,230
you're a monster!

153
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,470
Beauty,

154
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,380
patience.

155
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,900
It'll be your turn soon.

156
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,740
Rascal,

157
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,710
how dare you fool me?

158
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,139
You never had

159
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,550
any real evidence against me at all!

160
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,500
Dealing with someone
as suspicious and sly as you,

161
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,229
we had to bait you

162
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,190
into revealing yourself.

163
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,230
Miss Qianqian.

164
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,860
Miss Qianqian.

165
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,380
What's Li Qianqian up to?

166
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,430
Please spare me, Mr. Zhen.

167
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,779
I don't know.

168
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,830
Don't test my patience.

169
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,900
Miss Qianqian plans to use
a Gu poison on Miss Chuchu

170
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,670
and turn her into a puppet.

171
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,379
It's too dangerous.

172
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,619
You can't go.

173
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,019
If we don't venture,

174
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,550
we don't gain.

175
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,380
And for the sake of Madam,

176
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,230
I'm willing to give Qianqian
one last chance.

177
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,499
Besides, if the one behind all this

178
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,230
is the Third Prince,

179
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,419
this is the only way
to force his final move.

180
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,550
You've been playing me all along.

181
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,590
I didn't drink that tea.

182
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,379
Also, the dagger

183
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,070
only scratched Zhen's armor.

184
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,230
It was just a minor injury.

185
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,070
That explains why
Li Qianqian couldn't beat you.

186
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,100
What a convincing performance.

187
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,869
But you're celebrating

188
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,230
too soon.

189
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,100
Do you really think
I don't have a backup plan?

190
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,469
Kill them.

191
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,590
Hold on.

192
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,709
You think you can take on the Qilin Army

193
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,070
with a few people of you?

194
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,550
You're just sitting ducks.

195
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,899
If you wish to live,

196
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,470
drop your weapons.

197
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,260
Li Zhen,

198
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,430
you're disrespecting a prince.

199
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,710
I won't let you get away.

200
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,670
Let's see

201
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,590
if you're capable of this.

202
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,419
Guards.

203
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,550
Take him away.

204
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,670
Li Zhen.

205
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,739
(Memorial tablet for
the late father, Lord Li Yunfu)

206
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,900
Father,

207
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,740
I kept my promise.

208
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,470
Your name

209
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,230
has finally been cleared.

210
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,550
Chu,

211
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,500
I'll escort the Third Prince
to the capital

212
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,189
and explain everything

213
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,379
to His Majesty.

214
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,550
All right.

215
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,100
Be careful.

216
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,230
I'll wait for your return.

217
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,309
Miss, you're all dressed up today.

218
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,619
Could it be because
Mr. Zhen is coming back?

219
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,379
Stop it.

220
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,550
Don't talk nonsense.

221
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,440
Miss Chuchu,
His Majesty has issued a decree

222
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
to restore your status as the legitimate
daughter of the Lin family.

223
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,659
From today on,

224
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,310
you're Lin Chuchu.

225
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,869
Thank you,

226
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,100
