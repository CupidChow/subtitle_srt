00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 18=

4
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,280
Qianqian.

5
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,130
Qianqian?

6
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,369
Qianqian.

7
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,419
Today's Madam's birthday.

8
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,619
You visit her quite often usually.

9
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,339
What's taking you so long today?

10
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,000
- You should hurry and...
- Madam.

11
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,720
I just need to be there
before the banquet starts, right?

12
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,050
That makes you distant from her.

13
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,160
Madam,

14
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,640
if you're in a hurry,

15
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,009
you should head there yourself.

16
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,210
What's wrong with you today?

17
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,330
Forget it.

18
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,699
I'll keep an eye on the kitchen.

19
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,339
If not, someone might mess up

20
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,890
and make Madam angry again.

21
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,360
Mother.

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,809
I embroidered

23
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,770
this Pine and Crane
longevity screen for you.

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,649
Mother, I wish you everlasting brightness
like the sun and moon

25
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,009
and a long life.

26
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,000
Qianqian, I appreciate your intention.

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,639
Mother, the Seven Treasure Soup
I've prepared for you should be ready soon.

28
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:06,360
I'll bring it here now.

29
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,449
Once you deal with Li Chuchu,

30
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,889
I'll officially adopt you under my name.

31
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,680
In the future, you'll be
our legitimate daughter.

32
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,890
You can marry whomever you like by then.

33
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,539
Mother, I wish you longevity

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,009
and eternal youth.

35
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,699
The Seven Treasure Soup
is time-consuming.

36
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,680
I appreciate your intention.

37
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,330
Wait!

38
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,050
Madam.

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,569
Chuchu is being filial here.

40
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,329
You shouldn't stop her.

41
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,539
Are you upset with me,
the female head of the family?

42
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,169
No.

43
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,520
I dare not do so.

44
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,120
You better leave, then.

45
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,050
Madam, what's wrong?

46
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,050
Is there something wrong with the soup?

47
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,289
(Wait.)

48
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,009
(If something
is truly wrong with the soup,)

49
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,009
(I'll be the one accused of)

50
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,450
(trying to harm her.)

51
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,210
Mother, today's your birthday.

52
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,920
Madam, don't get ahead of yourself here.

53
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,520
You should let Chuchu go.

54
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,659
General,

55
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,119
this is a letter from Deputy Feng.

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,870
(To General)

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,329
(I've found out)

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,800
(that Third Prince is meeting
foreign spies in secret.)

59
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,450
(I'm collecting evidence as we speak.
I'll make progress soon.)

60
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,400
General Li.

61
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,609
Such audacity!

62
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,480
How dare you intrude upon
our military camp?

63
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,670
(Imperial Edict)

64
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,840
General Li,

65
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,419
someone accused you of
forming your own factions

66
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,689
and taking bribes.

67
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,240
His Majesty is enraged.

68
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,520
He has ordered the Court of Judicial Review
to investigate the case.

69
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,010
According to him,

70
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,250
you should put aside
your military affairs

71
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,369
before the case is solved.

72
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,330
You should head back and rest.

73
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,770
Was that His Majesty's intention?

74
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,330
Or was that Third Prince's intention?

75
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,690
Li Zhen,

76
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,010
there are some people
who you can't afford to offend.

77
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,810
You should know what's good for you.

78
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,810
Mr. Lin, you should worry
about your own affairs.

79
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,130
Don't interfere too much.

80
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,930
It might backfire on you.

81
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,350
(Imperial Edict)

82
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,210
You!

83
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,890
And,

84
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,520
the wedding ceremony between you
and Chu wasn't completed.

85
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,250
Your marriage

86
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,040
doesn't count.

87
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,040
Madam, please pardon me.

88
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,520
I was sick for a long time.

89
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,130
It's been so long
since I had such delicious soup.

90
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,440
My impulsive thoughts
got the better of me.

91
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,720
Since you're sick,

92
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,810
you should head back and rest.

93
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,400
Thank you, Madam.

94
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,960
I...

95
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,720
I'll see Madam off.

96
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,160
Why did you do that?

97
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,130
Are you trying to sacrifice yourself
for Li Chuchu's sake?

98
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,770
I'm not just doing it for Chuchu's sake.

99
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,330
I'm also doing it for your sake.

100
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,520
Qianqian,

101
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,689
don't commit the same mistake.

102
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,520
Both of you

103
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,219
are my daughters.

104
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,520
Shut up!

105
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,330
I'm your only biological daughter.

106
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,330
I'm the only illegitimate daughter whom
a mistress like you has given birth to!

107
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,049
That's why everyone is bullying me.

108
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,930
It's all your fault!

109
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,019
Li Qianqian,

110
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,219
are you inhumane?

111
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,210
How could you say something like that?

112
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,000
No matter how disgraceful I may be,
I'm still better than you.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,040
Li Chuchu,

114
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,370
you shameless jinx!

115
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,169
Not only did you
seduce your own brother,

116
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,010
but you also harmed your own mother.

117
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,419
I hate you.

118
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,890
I hate you all!

119
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,370
Qianqian!

120
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,539
Qianqian!

121
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,690
Madam!

122
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,280
Madam!

123
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,480
Madam!

124
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,640
Madam!

125
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,369
Someone!

126
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,049
Someone!

127
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,810
Hurry and get a physician!

128
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,960
Madam!

129
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,370
It's too late.

130
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,040
My child.

131
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,169
Your sister

132
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,659
is still young.

133
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,099
She's insensible.

134
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,160
Please forgive her.

135
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,289
Madam, please stop talking.

136
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,609
We'll surely find a way.

137
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,930
Wait for me. I'll get a physician.
Wait for me.

138
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,520
I've never begged you to do anything.

139
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,859
On account of my effort

140
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,040
of raising you for the past 18 years,

141
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,930
please give your sister another chance.

142
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,720
Okay.

143
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,810
Okay.

144
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,810
I promise you.

145
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,699
I'll promise you anything

146
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,960
as long as you stay alive.

147
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,450
Madam?

148
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,410
Madam?

149
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,410
Madam!

150
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,930
Madam!

151
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,290
Someone!

152
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,009
Madam!

153
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,692
Don't die on me!

the dead cannot return to life.

Let's instruct our men
to bury Madam Zhang.

169
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,210
Get out.

170
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,760
Chu.

171
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,360
I told you to get out!

172
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,859
Chu.

173
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,050
Chu?

174
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:43,150
(In Mourning)

175
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,409
Miss Qianqian,

176
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,979
don't be too upset.

177
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,979
Please change into your mourning attire.

178
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,810
You should keep vigil
for Madam at the hall.

179
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,240
Keep vigil for her?

180
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,240
I'm no longer her daughter.

181
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,960
Why should I keep vigil for her?

182
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,690
Miss.

183
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,009
You...

184
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,720
Are you out of your mind?

185
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,179
She's just a fool.

186
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,000
She's a total fool!

187
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,769
This is bad!

188
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,650
Miss Qianqian is
possessed by an evil spirit!

189
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,880
Mother.

190
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,240
Please don't die.

191
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,690
Please don't die.

192
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,050
Zhen.

193
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,410
I no longer have a mother.

194
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,050
Chu, don't be afraid.

195
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,840
I'll protect you

196
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,720
on Madam's behalf.

197
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,330
I always thought Madam
only doted on Qianqian.

198
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,810
She didn't pay much attention to me.

199
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,210
Although I didn't say it in public,

200
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,210
I held a grudge against her in secret.

201
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,050
I only understood that she treated me
as her own daughter long ago

202
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,410
only until her death.

203
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,930
Chu,

204
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,210
I understand your feelings completely.

205
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,450
To you,

206
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,360
Madam is not just your benefactor.

207
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,360
She played the role
of a mother in your life.

208
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,120
She was poisoned.

209
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,330
Qianqian poisoned the soup
in order to harm me.

210
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,000
However, she's not that bold.

211
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,930
I'm sure there's
a mastermind behind this.

212
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,960
I have

213
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,330
to investigate the case

214
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,530
and avenge Madam.

215
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,450
All right.

216
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,729
Just tell me

217
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,360
if you need me to do anything.

218
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,000
Zhen, will you uphold justice for me

219
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,330
no matter who the culprit is?

220
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,450
Of course.

221
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,170
But,

222
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,170
what if Mother was the culprit?

223
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,760
Drats.

224
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,129
We were one step away

225
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,489
from getting rid of Li Chuchu.

226
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,339
That foolish mistress,

227
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,699
she just had to intervene!

228
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,769
Madam, please be appeased.

229
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,409
Don't let it affect your health.

230
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,819
At least
the thorn in your flesh is gone.

231
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,880
At least we gained from it.

232
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,889
We've already alerted her
to our presence.

233
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,579
It'll be even more difficult

234
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,009
to strike in the future.

235
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,219
We have to get rid of the antidote

236
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,529
we prepared beforehand.

237
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,720
Yes, Madam.

238
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,210
Mother.

239
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,530
Are you asleep?

240
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,480
Zhen.

241
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,699
What are you doing here at this hour?

242
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,530
Someone died in our mansion.

243
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,360
Mother, I wish to ask you

244
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,050
how we should deal with it.

245
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,179
Madam Zhang was sick for a long time.

246
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,859
It's truly pitiful

247
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,650
that she had to go like that.

248
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,009
I wish to recite the Buddhist chant
for her a few more times

249
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,690
to help her find peace.

250
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,210
She didn't die of illness.

251
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,650
She died of poisoning.

252
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,650
Is that so?

253
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,690
Madam Ping,

254
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,009
you must investigate the case.

255
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,600
You must investigate it thoroughly.

256
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,680
Do not let any villain
take advantage of the opportunity.

257
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,760
Yes, Madam.

258
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,210
Zhen.

259
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,530
What do you mean by this?

260
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,530
Mother,

261
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,179
Chu isn't Father's biological daughter.

262
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,099
I've already decided to marry her.

263
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,240
What?

264
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,330
She isn't his biological daughter?

265
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,529
Even so,

266
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,059
you guys are also siblings in name.

267
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,699
If news of this gets out,

268
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,489
our family's reputation will be ruined.

269
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,210
I'll never agree to this.

270
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,529
I came here

271
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,810
not to seek your permission.

272
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,579
Something cropped up
in the imperial court.

273
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,450
I have been suspended from work.

274
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,299
If anything were to happen right now,

275
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,489
and someone uses the situation

276
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,880
to their advantage,

277
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,530
I'm afraid there's no way
I can turn the tides.

278
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,000
You rebel!

279
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,570
You rebel!

280
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,240
How dare you threaten your mother?

281
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,690
Mother, you said

282
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,650
that the future of our family
lies on my shoulder, right?

283
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,299
If so, you should stop forcing me

284
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,209
to commit such unfilial deeds.

285
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,210
