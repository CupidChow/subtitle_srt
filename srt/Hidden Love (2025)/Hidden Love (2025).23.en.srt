=Hidden Love=

2
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
(Adapted from Brother
by Qingdeng on Xingjijiaoke)

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,780
=Episode 23=

4
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,169
Miss Chuchu lost too much blood

5
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,399
from the stabbing.

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,290
She can't be healed.

7
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,200
I don't believe that.

8
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,930
There must be a way.

9
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,730
There has to be.

10
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,649
General,

11
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,199
Miss Chuchu was already weak

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,529
during pregnancy.

13
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,090
The baby couldn't be saved.

14
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,479
And after the miscarriage,

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,889
she got stabbed

16
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,199
before she could fully recover.

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
Well...

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
General,

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,039
I have a way.

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,080
Years ago, when I was at war
on the southern border,

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,680
I came across a secret remedy.

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,809
Brew the herbs

23
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,090
and have someone drink the tonic.

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,729
When the tonic blends into their blood,

25
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,809
draw the blood

26
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,120
and feed it to the patient.

27
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,330
Does it really work?

28
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,930
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
It's just that...

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,800
It's just that the person
who drinks the tonic

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,120
will endure excruciating pain.

32
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,039
It can be so unbearable

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,409
that most end up begging for death.

34
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,169
I'll drink it.

35
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,280
General.

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,880
Prepare it.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,210
Yes, sir.

38
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,530
Your Highness,

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,639
Mr. Lin failed his mission.

40
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,569
But Li Chuchu seems
to be seriously injured

41
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,840
and may not survive.

42
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,280
So

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,880
Li Zhen and Lin Ansheng

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,250
are at each other's throats now.

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,810
Good.

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,840
That gives me another loyal dog.

47
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,210
Your Highness,

48
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,440
if you wish to deal with Li Zhen,

49
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,930
I have an idea.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,400
Speak.

51
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,090
General.

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,729
Get a rope.

53
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,689
Tie me up.

54
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,199
General,

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,199
this...

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,689
Didn't you say

57
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,840
most beg for death
from the tonic's effect?

58
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,330
So I order you

59
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,880
to tie me up.

60
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,290
(Chu,)

61
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,290
(I'll survive this.)

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,560
(We...)

63
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,120
(We both will.)

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,930
I've underestimated you.

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,880
You're clever.

66
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,250
Being a bedmaid

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,129
is a waste.

68
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,290
Serve me,

69
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,080
and you'll have a bright future.

you're finally awake.

Chu,

95
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,410
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,730
I shouldn't have doubted
that you aborted the child.

97
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,519
I never should've said
those cruel words.

98
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,490
I should be the one apologizing.

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,880
I only thought of revenge,

100
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,370
and never consider your feelings.

101
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,730
Chu,

102
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,560
I won't ask for anything else.

103
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,489
Even if you choose to leave,

104
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,410
I'll let you go.

105
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,810
As long as you live well.

106
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,370
No.

107
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,290
I'm not leaving.

108
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,810
I'll stay with you
for the rest of my life.

109
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,290
Why isn't there any news

110
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,410
after so long?

111
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,880
I've send people
to watch the General's Mansion.

112
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,560
But Li Zhen never leaves
Li Chuchu's side.

113
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,970
There's been no chance.

114
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,329
Don't test my patience.

115
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,880
If you ruin my plan,

116
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,439
I'll tear you apart.

117
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,610
Your Highness,

118
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
it won't be long.

119
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,570
Chu,

120
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,039
you like vinegar fish

121
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,639
from Juxian Restaurant, don't you?

122
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,609
I brought the chef here.

123
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,369
Come.

124
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,570
Let's go try it.

125
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,880
Zhen,

126
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,439
are you trying to fatten me up?

127
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,129
All I do now is eat and sleep.

128
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,969
If this goes on,

129
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,400
I'm getting chubby.

130
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,370
You do look

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,730
a little chubby now.

132
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,400
Really?

133
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,400
I'm kidding.

134
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,559
You were too thin before.

135
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,730
Now you look just right.

136
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,570
No matter what you become,

137
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,039
you're always the prettiest

138
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,880
in my heart.

139
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,570
General.

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,369
- What's the matter?
- A secret missive from the Crown Prince.

141
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,570
General,

142
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,400
what happened?

143
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,210
His Majesty is gravely ill,
and the court is in a mess.

144
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,250
His Highness is doing everything
to keep the news from spreading.

145
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,520
He wants us to act within a month.

146
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,489
Best if we catch him in the act

147
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,800
and take him down in one strike.

148
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,250
But

149
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,249
the Third Prince

150
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,799
is now hiding like a turtle.

151
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,280
He won't even show his face.

152
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,160
How are we supposed to catch him?

153
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,330
Seems like

154
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,920
