1
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,138
The opportunity to turn back time.

2
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,347
It'd be so nice if it were true.

3
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,600
-Do you really want it?
-Show me. Go ahead.

4
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,810
You're serious, right? Don't regret later.

5
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,979
Once it's done, there's no going back.

6
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,148
You crazy...

7
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,443
Look at these dark circles.

8
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,781
Look at my skin. It's all sagging.

9
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,699
I'm old.

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,244
Goodness, I turned the watch again.

11
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,205
I feel sick.

12
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,211
That feels better.

13
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,384
Mom! What?

14
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,261
-"What?"
-What?

15
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,139
I'm an adult that can drink
whenever I want.

16
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,642
I don't care about that.
You want to become a news anchor

17
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,228
but you drink until late at night
and bash your head like that?

18
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,562
My head? Why?

19
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,315
Oh, gosh. What is this?

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,234
My goodness. Did I almost die last night?

21
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,069
Not almost. You'll die today.

22
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,654
Mom, time out!

23
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,573
Let me at least have my last bite of food
before I die.

24
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,117
-You don't deserve it!
-I feel hungover.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,076
Come over here!

26
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,536
-Okay, I won't eat!
-Come here!

27
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,833
That hurts. Seriously,
she hits me so hard.

28
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,418
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

29
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,671
Gosh, you're about to drill a hole
in that taxi.

30
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,091
Why do you always clean this
beat-up car? No one even notices.

31
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,343
You promised to buy me a new taxi
after you succeed.

32
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,886
I'll have to use this until then.

33
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,597
I'm afraid that won't happen.

34
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,849
Just buy a new car first.

35
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,185
You've changed.

36
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,854
Since you've started dating.

37
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,398
"Dating"?

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,941
What do you mean?

39
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,609
Is your head okay?

40
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,444
Right, my head.

41
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,697
Do you even know why you hurt your head?

42
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,701
Of course. I wasn't that drunk.

43
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,412
Didn't I tell you how
stainless steel got its name?

44
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,164
You must've learned this time.

45
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,165
"Stainless steel"?

46
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,333
Don't regret later.

47
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,203
So this is why it's stainless steel.

48
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,957
Stainless steel.

49
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,255
You were such a good driver.
You surprised me.

50
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,298
I even drove?

51
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,217
You did. You drove him.

52
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,470
All right. Make a right.

53
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,847
Make a left.

54
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,600
Keep going straight.

55
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,227
Stop!

56
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,856
I've lost my mind.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,942
You crazy brat!

58
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,027
You must've really lost it last night.

59
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,947
Your hands were full of his hair.

60
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,365
Pull out some more next time.

61
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,325
I'll plant them on my head.

62
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,954
Didn't he say anything?

63
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,374
He didn't do anything wrong,
but he kept apologizing to me.

64
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,541
So?

65
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,252
You don't remember anything at all.

66
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,796
-So?
-So what?

67
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,132
I said I'd kill him if he made
my daughter drink that much again.

68
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,717
-You really said that?
-Why?

69
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,971
Are you worried you might
never see your boyfriend again?

70
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,306
Who says he's my boyfriend?

71
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,557
He's not.

72
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,309
Your reaction tells me he is.

73
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,187
He's not! What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,775
What do you think of him?

75
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,695
He seemed like a nice guy.

76
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,657
Did he really? Gosh.

77
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,744
I'm against you dating him.

78
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,347
You scared me.

79
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,683
My goodness. Get lost!

80
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,686
Get lost! Get lost!

81
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,771
What are you doing?

82
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,982
So did you make wind with your hand?

83
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,067
Didn't you see me blow out that candle?

84
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,402
You're pathetic.

85
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,988
By the way, where is that jerk's house?

86
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,197
Who?

87
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,367
Why do you want to know?

88
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,037
Why do you think guys make girls drink?

89
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,205
I'm going to kill that jerk.
Don't get in my way.

90
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,333
Just stay still if you don't want
to get beaten up by him.

91
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,585
Beaten up? Me?

92
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,004
Weren't you beaten up by Hyeon-ju too?

93
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,132
If that's what you want,
I'll fight you with taekwondo.

94
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,305
How could I hit a girl? I let her hit me.

95
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,265
Whatever. By the way...

96
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,933
Yeong-su.

97
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,771
Can you go get me some soup and rice?

98
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,731
Why?

99
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,316
Did you do something wrong?

100
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,109
-Mom!
-No, wait.

101
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,611
I'll set you up with a girl.

102
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,198
Who? Sang-eun? Hyeon-ju?

103
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,449
I have another friend.

104
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,284
She's really gorgeous.

105
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,536
You can trust me then.

106
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,708
Don't get caught by Mom.

107
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,004
I'm the eldest son of this family.

108
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,465
Mom! I'm hungry.

109
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,591
Give me food!

110
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,599
Kim Yeong-su.

111
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,018
Mom made this for me herself.

112
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,648
Shall I have some chips?

113
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,073
You can't even open that bag
properly because of Mom.

114
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,199
Stop bluffing.

115
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,794
Look who's talking. You're just
sucking on that radish kimchi.

116
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,379
I'm savoring it in my mouth.

117
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,297
Should I give it a good crunch?

118
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,760
What are you eating?

119
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,012
Wait!

120
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,056
You already slapped me here.

121
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,599
The Prohibition Against Double Jeopardy.

122
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,560
No person shall be subject to
the same offense twice.

123
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,978
It's another offense.

124
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,647
-What is it?
-You took money from my wallet.

125
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,443
I meant to tell you, but I forgot

126
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,694
because it was something urgent.

127
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,903
What was so urgent?

128
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,363
I urgently wanted to eat some chips--

129
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,906
You idiot!

130
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,199
That hurts! Mom!

131
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,492
-Stop right there!
-Mom!

132
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,286
-Wait.
-Come here, you brat!

133
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,124
Mom, my friends came over to hang out.

134
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,208
-Hello.
-Hello.

135
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,502
Hello, Hyeon-ju and Sang-eun.

136
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,631
I'll make you some delicious
fish stew, so you should have some.

137
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,216
-Sure.
-Thank you.

138
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,223
Mom, can you bring some drinks
for my friends?

139
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,623
That's so romantic.

140
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,542
She just got hit by an udon bowl.
How could that be romantic?

141
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,213
I don't think I'll be able to see him.

142
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,006
I humiliated myself in front of him.

143
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,383
That's how love begins.

144
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,636
You're lucky if he doesn't think
you're a lunatic.

145
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,889
-A lunatic?
-You deserve to be called that.

146
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,474
Yes, you're right.

147
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,559
I still envy you.

148
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,396
In my ten years as a trainee,
I've never dated.

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,316
All I've done is clean the office,
and I'm old now.

150
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,569
I've totally wasted 25 years of my life.

151
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,240
Hey. Being 25 years old as a woman

152
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,700
is an age when we can't do
anything actually meaningful.

153
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,536
They ask me every time
I go to an interview.

154
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,703
Did you start school early?

155
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,705
That means my face looks old.

156
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,959
At least you guys are doing
what you want to do.

157
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,337
There's nothing I want to do,
and I don't have any skills.

158
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,131
Others are all busy getting a job
and dating.

159
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,593
I'll just grow old
and die making chunjang.

160
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,059
This isn't good. Girls, let's go out.

161
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,519
We need to lift our spirits. Let's go!

162
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,415
What's he doing now?

163
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,459
He'll get caught
if my mom hears the crunching sound.

164
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,345
What a pathetic life. I've made up my mind

165
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,682
to be grateful for everything I have
and work hard.

166
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,393
I feel so much better now.

167
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,104
I must say,
I want to try what he's eating.

168
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,358
Oh, he's looking at us.

169
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,735
Hi, Yeong-su!

170
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,779
Darn it. I'm off.

171
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,158
Hyeon-ju.

172
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,993
Hyeon-ju.

173
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,578
Hey, Lee Hyeon-ju.

174
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,544
What are you doing here?

175
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,088
What?

176
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,593
-Hye-ja...
-Are you here to see me?

177
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,263
-No, Hye-ja...
-I said we're through.

178
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,266
-That's not...
-Right.

179
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,393
It must've been hard to move on.

180
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,520
I'm sure you have many regrets.

181
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,691
I bet you've been trying to find
what you liked in me in other guys.

182
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,530
But you see, I have no interest
in starting over.

183
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,492
Stop using Hye-ja as an excuse

184
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,410
to see me.

185
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,125
The fact that I was
your first ever boyfriend

186
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,753
is a blessing for you in and of itself.

187
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,091
-What the...
-Hey, Hyeon-ju. Put this down.

188
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,967
You were only in middle school.

189
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,260
Gosh, you didn't know any better.

190
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,514
My life was bound to be doomed
even back in middle school.

191
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,016
I know I was only a kid, but how
could I have such low standards...

192
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,060
-He's handsome.
-Have you lost your mind...

193
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,480
Who is she looking at?

194
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,527
Is that the guy?

195
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,821
Your face is telling me that he is.

196
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,697
Who's that woman?

197
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,991
-Seo-yeon.
-Who is Seo-yeon?

198
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,618
My junior who's now a news anchor.

199
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,995
Oh, that elephant in the field?

200
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,539
"She sells seashells."

201
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,045
-Is he a funny guy?
-Is he a funny guy?

202
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:53,963
No, not at all.

203
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,006
-Then she's hitting on him.
-Then she's hitting on him.

204
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,676
-She keeps laughing her head off.
-She keeps laughing her head off.

205
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,678
-Totally flirting with him.
-Totally flirting with him.

206
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,637
Are you okay, Hye-ja?

207
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,390
Why would I not be okay?

208
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,267
It's not like he's my boyfriend.

209
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,644
Girls, let's go.

210
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,273
I'm off!

211
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,625
Gosh, what's wrong with this?

212
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,544
Is it stuck?

213
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,337
Oh, dear. Why is this...

214
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,091
My gosh. What's happening?

215
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,261
-Hello.
-Gosh, my goodness.

216
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,054
It's all right.

217
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,224
What if you get hurt
before your important exam?

218
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,394
No, I won't. I'm going this way anyway.

219
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,022
Thank you.

220
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,691
-It's really okay.
-All right.

221
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,403
I feel bad you walked
way past your place to help me.

222
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,156
It's totally fine. My place
isn't even that far from here.

223
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,492
I'll be off, then.

224
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:08,245
No, wait. Come in for dinner.

225
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,455
You haven't eaten yet, right?

226
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,457
Gosh, it's okay. I'll eat when I get home.

227
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,169
I have to eat alone
because my grandson isn't home yet.

228
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,631
-It's really okay.
-Let's go in.

229
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,549
Okay.

230
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,637
Oh, boy. Hang on.

231
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,305
-Let me carry it for you.
-Okay.

232
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,474
Gosh, there are no side dishes.

233
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,936
-Shall I fry an egg for you?
-No, it's okay. I hate eggs.

234
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,188
-Really? Gosh.
-Yes, let's sit.

235
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,314
All right.

236
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,982
Let's sit.

237
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,402
-No, that's yours.
-Well, I'll...

238
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,071
-You should eat...
-No, eat up.

239
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,406
Okay, thank you.

240
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,658
Grandma.

241
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,202
Hey, Jun-ha.

242
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,170
We eat like country bumpkins.

243
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,089
I don't know if you'll like it.

244
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,216
I do. It's so good.

245
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,472
You're such a lady.

246
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,642
She's adorable even when
she's eating, isn't she?

247
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,314
Yes, sure.

248
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,482
Eat up.

249
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,318
I hope my face isn't red now.

250
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,320
Is it red?

251
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,116
My grandma's green onion kimchi
is so good. Try it.

252
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,368
Thank you.

253
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,226
Grandma, your green onion kimchi
tastes the best with ramyeon.

254
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,770
Oh, ramyeon.

255
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,441
I'll pack some up for you to take home.

256
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,775
Try it at home.

257
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,860
Gosh, it's okay.

258
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,613
It's not that good.
He's just flattering me.

259
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,240
-Thank you.
-No problem.

260
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,663
There was only a little bit
of the kimchi left.

261
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,832
I'm sorry I can only give you
a small container of it.

262
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,125
This is small?

263
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,211
This is a lot.

264
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,504
I'll help her with this.

265
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,299
-It's okay.
-It's dark. Get her home safely.

266
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,010
-Take care.
-All right, bye.

267
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,637
-Thank you for dinner.
-My pleasure.

268
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,679
I won't be long.

269
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,805
-Bye.
-Bye.

270
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,476
Go back inside.

271
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,735
Is your head okay?

272
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,739
Yes. It's rock-hard, so it's fine.

273
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,035
-What about your hair?
-What?

274
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,331
I can see
that you still have a lot of hair.

275
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,294
Thank you.

276
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,672
For what?

277
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,467
For your offer to turn back time for me.

278
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,262
I know you were joking,
but I was still grateful.

279
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,973
I almost wanted to believe it.

280
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,435
How shall I put this?

281
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,772
Shall I say I can tell
you grew up with loving parents?

282
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,194
I envy you for being able to talk
such nonsense so confidently.

283
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,365
Are you subtly dissing me right now?

284
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,454
I guess I don't feel that I'm good enough.

285
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,542
I always make sure
I do everything properly.

286
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,629
I feel like
if I don't do things perfectly,

287
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,924
the flaws will become my weakness.

288
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,302
It sounds like you lack love.

289
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,307
I don't dislike myself.

290
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,103
I can't say I love myself dearly,

291
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,480
but I think I'm all right.

292
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,775
I have my flaws, of course.

293
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,236
But I think I'm quite cute.

294
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,531
I'm crazy.

295
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,702
Well, I'm just trying to tell you
that you should love yourself more.

296
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,038
That will help you become
more generous to yourself.

297
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,251
I like that.

298
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,797
Then...

299
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,176
let's try to be more generous
and talk casually to each other.

300
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,263
Considering what we went through
yesterday,

301
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,515
we should be talking casually.

302
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,771
About yesterday, I sincerely apologize.

303
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,274
I mean, I'm sorry.

304
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,613
And that won't happen again. Never.

305
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,536
Come here.

306
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,268
Come here.

307
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,612
Come here and look.

308
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,827
Isn't the view from here
so beautiful at night?

309
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:45,916
It is.

310
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,090
In this area, you can probably see
the farthest from here.

311
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,469
I think you're right.
I live in this neighborhood,

312
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,638
but I had no idea.

313
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,647
I didn't mean to pry,

314
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,193
but I saw you with Seo-yeon earlier.

315
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,071
Yes, she asked to meet up out of the blue.

316
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,282
Why?

317
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,117
She wanted to go out with me.

318
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,995
And?

319
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,461
I turned her down.

320
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,176
I see.

321
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,432
I love the night view here.

322
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,729
Look at the moon. Even the moon
looks extra beautiful today.

323
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,648
This feels so nice!

324
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,343
Yeong-su.

325
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,053
Please, okay?

326
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,513
Come in.

327
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,098
What?

328
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,436
What's all this?

329
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,437
Sit down.

330
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,772
What are you up to?

331
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,693
How dare you speak
to your older brother like that?

332
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,195
Something is up, right?

333
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,571
No, nothing.

334
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,114
I'm your older brother.

335
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,991
I know you better than anyone else does.

336
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,369
You don't even remember my birthday.

337
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,498
I don't mean such material things.

338
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,083
I mean mentally.

339
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,543
Nothing is going on.

340
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,340
I know something is going on.

341
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,592
What is it? Tell me. Is it about a guy?

342
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,594
-No.
-Is it about your career then?

343
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,349
Your career it is. What's the problem?

344
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,227
-Forget it.
-I can't let you suffer alone.

345
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,776
The thing is,

346
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,612
I've given up on becoming a news anchor.

347
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,407
Really?

348
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,075
Does Mom know?

349
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,201
No.

350
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,124
She'd be so disappointed.

351
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,543
You becoming a news anchor
has been her only dream.

352
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,170
That's what I'm most worried about.

353
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,592
I feel so sorry for you.

354
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,680
I didn't know
I'd be comforted by you one day.

355
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,390
I really feel sorry for you.

356
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,391
Stop it.

357
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,600
I really do.

358
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,728
Stop it. You don't have to.

359
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,356
I do because Mom will beat you up so bad.

360
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,774
-What?
-Mom!

361
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,693
-Hey!
-Hye-ja isn't going to become

362
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,111
-Yeong-su!
-a news anchor!

363
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,071
Hye-ja isn't going to become
a news anchor!

364
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,531
Gosh, seriously.

365
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,575
I should never have trusted you.

366
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,036
What did you say?

367
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,038
Mom, calm down and hear me out.

368
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:15,042
Well, you knew I wasn't good enough
to become a news anchor.

369
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,918
Objectively speaking, I had no chance.

370
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,463
What kind of parents can be
objective about their own child?

371
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,467
I don't need children who don't
understand their parents' concern.

372
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,094
I'll find something else.

373
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,804
I'm not planning on idling around
like him.

374
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,930
Of course.

375
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,099
So what's your plan?

376
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,768
I'm still thinking.

377
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,603
"Thinking"?

378
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,689
How old are you?
How can you still be thinking?

379
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,524
I'm 25.

380
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,443
Because you wanted to
become a news anchor,

381
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,111
I've been easy on you so far.

382
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,404
-Come here.
-What?

383
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,489
-Come right now.
-No, Mom.

384
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,157
-Come.
-Mom!

385
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,242
I'll really find something else.

386
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,410
-I promise.
-Hye-ja!

387
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,245
-Dad!
-Stop right there!

388
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,705
-Close the door!
-Stop!

389
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,207
-Dad!
-Honey.

390
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,500
-Open the door.
-Mom.

391
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,211
Move. I can unlock it within ten seconds.

392
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,337
Gosh.

393
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,588
Why would you hit me?

394
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,215
Get out of my sight!

395
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,425
My goodness.

396
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,803
Hye-ja, it's okay.

397
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,972
He drives me crazy.

398
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,557
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

399
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,231
Dad.

400
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,982
I'm sorry.

401
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,445
I never really thought
you were cut out for a news anchor.

402
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,656
You'd better fit for

403
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,533
Miss Korea.

404
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,869
You should have made me drink more milk.

405
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,496
I tried to, but you wouldn't listen.

406
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,627
I really wanted to become
a news anchor and get you a new car.

407
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,255
But you don't have to be
a news anchor to do that.

408
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,007
Gosh, you're so cold-hearted.

409
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,676
Shouldn't you say, "It's okay, my girl.

410
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,761
I'm happy as long as you're healthy"?

411
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,346
But you're already healthy enough.

412
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,430
You're right.

413
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,977
Will Mom be okay?

414
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,187
She'll whine for a few days.

415
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,648
But after that, she'll get over it
and start curling hair again.

416
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,734
What about you?

417
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,197
I'll just have to suffer through it.

418
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,701
That's not what I mean. How do you feel?

419
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,913
I'm okay as long as you're okay.

420
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,627
I'm so happy you're my dad.

421
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,016
Honey, I'm off to work.

422
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,310
Don't be too harsh on Hye-ja.

423
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,567
Gosh, what a perfect day to curl hair!

424
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,778
We'll have a lot of customers today.

425
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,243
Mom.

426
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,621
Should I start taking
some hairdressing courses?

427
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,747
What?

428
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,625
I mean, Ju-young recently got a job.

429
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,919
She works late every day,
her boss is a psycho,

430
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,254
and she even works on the weekends.

431
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,132
It might be a better idea
to take over your shop...

432
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,968
Does my job look easy to you?

433
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,594
I didn't say it looked easy.

434
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,013
I know how hard it is.

435
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,224
You stand up cutting hair all day

436
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,642
until all your fingers are swollen up.

437
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,644
And those nasty perm solutions...

438
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,021
If you know all that,
why do you want to do it?

439
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:05,939
Move.

440
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,649
There's nothing else I can do.

441
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,609
Find something else.

442
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,527
Like what?

443
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,529
It's your job to find it. Don't ask me.

444
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,781
You're 25, remember?

445
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,617
That's enough. Don't even come here again.

446
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,494
Go now. Hurry!

447
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,870
Let me just fold this.

448
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,038
I can do that.

449
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,670
A thief?

450
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,426
Gosh.

451
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,594
Hello.

452
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,720
Who are you?

453
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,680
I'm Jun-ha's friend.

454
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,765
And?

455
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,100
I'm here to return these food containers.

456
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,065
By the way, who are--

457
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,072
Who is he?

458
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,785
Mom. What's wrong?

459
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,703
Your dad...

460
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,205
Dad? What happened to him?

461
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,539
Mom!

462
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,124
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

463
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,797
-Dad!
-Honey.

464
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,256
-Dad!
-What should we do?

465
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,555
Honey, please.

466
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,140
What should we do?

467
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,025
Honey. Honey!

468
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,236
-Honey!
-Dad!

469
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,824
RESTRICTED AREA

470
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,535
Honey!

471
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,972
He was hit by a truck as he was
making a left at an intersection.

472
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,358
The brakes of the truck
seem to have failed.

473
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,735
SCHOOL ZONE

474
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,403
Well then.

475
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:11,458
RESTRICTED AREA

476
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,685
No! Honey...

477
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,187
No...

478
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,106
This can't be happening...

479
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,445
-No, Honey. Please...
-Mom.

480
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,197
Mom...

481
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,966
Give me back my watch.

482
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,425
I meant to give it back to you.

483
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,718
Give it to me.

484
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,815
This will work. It will.

485
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,318
Please...

486
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,100
Honey, I'm off to work.

487
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,518
Don't be too harsh on Hye-ja.

488
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,270
Dad.

489
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,772
Dad. Dad!

490
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,566
No. Dad!

491
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,448
Dad!

492
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,074
Dad!

493
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,104
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

494
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,694
Dad!

495
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,289
Dad!

496
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,377
Dad!

497
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,095
Dad!

498
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,599
Dad!

499
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,570
I should take this.

500
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,474
JIA BARBERSHOP

501
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,913
JIA BARBERSHOP

502
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,319
Is something wrong?

503
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,116
Do you know how startled I was
when you left like that?

504
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,417
Do you want me to cheer you on
or comfort you right now?

505
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,387
Now you're looking at me.

506
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,600
If I can't do anything for you,
at least let me drink with you.

507
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,274
What would you do?

508
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,153
There's a person you must save.

509
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,489
You must

510
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,367
save him by all means.

511
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,703
But...

512
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,540
But you can't save him.

513
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,088
The same situation repeats
thousands of times,

514
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,634
but there is no way to save him.

515
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,681
You have to keep trying until you succeed.

516
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,517
I can't. No matter how hard I try,
it's impossible.

517
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,478
Still, you must save him.

518
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,023
You're the one who said
he's a person you must save.

519
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,609
A person you must save by all means.

520
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,695
If that person is that important,

521
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,242
you should try a million times
and save him.

522
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,127
Thank you.

523
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,341
I think that's what I wanted to hear.

524
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,375
One, two, three.

525
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,794
One, two, three.

526
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,714
One, two, three.

527
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,092
One, two, three.

528
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,261
One, two.

529
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,183
One, two, three.

530
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,532
Dad, Dad!

531
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,288
Dad.

532
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,707
Dad!

533
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,628
Dad...

534
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,255
Dad, as soon as you left home,

535
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,841
the truck was about to hit you,

536
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,676
so I got on my bike
and tried to divert the truck,

537
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,429
but you kept...
So I got on my bike again...

538
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,848
and followed you,
but I couldn't catch up with you.

539
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,935
I kept trying over and over

540
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,687
and managed to save you.

541
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,485
But what happened to your leg, Dad?

542
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,284
Why? What's wrong?

543
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,638
No...

544
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,948
What on earth happened?

545
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,826
Mom and Dad, you two still look the same.

546
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,786
What happened to me?

547
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,163
Yeong-su looks the same too.

548
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,373
Please calm down. Have some water.

549
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,757
So you're saying...

550
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,511
I'm your father, right?

551
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,096
You're my daughter.

552
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,602
Dad, do you not recognize me?

553
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,147
Mom.

554
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,607
Ma'am.

555
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,941
What is your name?

556
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,610
I'm Kim Hye-ja.

557
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,696
How old are you, ma'am?

558
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,573
You know that I'm 25!

559
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,159
Tell us more.

560
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,204
Like what? What else
do you want me to tell you?

561
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,706
What do you want to know?

562
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:45,169
Right, Mom.
I gave you money to fix the sink.

563
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,172
But that night, I came home drunk
with a scrape here.

564
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,716
-My gosh.
-Also yesterday,

565
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,677
I said I'd give up on becoming
a news anchor, and you scolded me.

566
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,471
And Yeong-su.

567
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,181
You wanted to eat
grilled pork all by yourself,

568
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,309
so you sealed your door
with duct tape and passed out.

569
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,354
We called an ambulance,
and you had to go to the ER.

570
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,564
Do I have to say more?

571
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:10,194
Mom and Dad, you still can't tell

572
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,987
that I'm your daughter?

573
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,997
That watch!

574
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,792
I told myself I'd never use it again.

575
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,752
But to save Dad...

576
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,796
My gosh, what do I do?

577
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,091
What do I do now? My goodness.

578
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,927
-What should I do?
-How is this possible?

579
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,264
No, get off me.

580
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,765
No, this can't happen.

581
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,977
I can turn back time again.

582
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,563
I'll turn back time again.
This will fix everything.

583
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,329
My gosh, what is happening?

584
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,747
What's wrong with this?

585
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,166
Why isn't this working?

586
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,670
No. No, please.

587
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,131
No, you can't stop! No...

588
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,675
I have to go back.

589
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,220
I have to travel back in time.

590
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,828
This can't be fixed.

591
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,873
Watches like this are no longer made.

592
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,336
Oh, this can't be repaired.

593
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,133
This is an ancient model.

594
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,969
It'll be very hard to repair this.

595
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,949
What do I do?

596
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,327
What do I do now?

597
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,539
What am I going to do?

598
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:31,543
What am I supposed to do now?

599
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,838
What do I do? My gosh...

600
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,799
What do I do?

601
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,414
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

602
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,868
MIDNIGHT SNACK BAR

603
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,751
A bowl of udon, please.

604
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,992
Hye-ja.

605
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,328
Open the door.

606
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,378
Hye-ja, open up. Please?

607
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,881
Mom, I can get it open in ten seconds.

608
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,217
What? Gosh, seriously.

609
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,062
There's food on the table. Come out
and eat it whenever you want.

610
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,357
Mom, there was no spicy
stir-fried pork when we were eating.

611
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,025
Gosh, what?

612
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,237
Ma'am, is Hye-ja home?

613
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,155
Well, she's...

614
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,615
Did she get married?

615
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,242
Hey, that's absurd.

616
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,619
Take care.

617
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,828
Thanks.

618
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,163
Goodbye.

619
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,635
Hyeon-ju and Sang-eun came by.

620
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,096
What did you tell them?

621
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,641
Well, nothing much.

622
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,894
Tell them that I'm away on a trip.

623
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,273
They may think I went
to see Auntie in Germany.

624
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,776
All right, I will.

625
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,749
A bowl of udon, please.

626
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,883
Here you go.

627
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,344
-Enjoy.
-Excuse me.

628
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,930
-Yes?
-The girl I came here with.

629
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,181
Has she been back here?

630
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,183
Oh, you mean

631
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,561
-the hairdresser's daughter?
-Yes.

632
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,104
No, she hasn't.

633
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,109
She's probably in Germany.

634
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:28,113
I think I heard she went to visit
some relatives there.

635
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,282
I wish I could go somewhere too.

636
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,169
Why couldn't she tell me before leaving?

637
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:02,898
Grandma.

638
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:26,171
Hey. Greet your father properly.

639
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,590
Jun-ha, you're home.

640
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,220
He's been coming here without me knowing?

641
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,223
I just give him some food...

642
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,768
Hey, I thought you were working tonight.
You're back early.

643
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,395
Leave.

644
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,275
-Get out!
-Calm down.

645
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,612
Gosh, that temper of yours.

646
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,072
More rice, Mom.

647
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,658
My goodness.

648
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,326
You little punk...

649
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,079
Get lost before I sue you

650
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,997
for everything you've stolen from Grandma.

651
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:08,547
This punk definitely needs
to learn a thing or two.

652
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,926
You can't sue someone

653
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,012
for stealing from a family member.

654
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:20,142
How on earth will you become a reporter?
You punk.

655
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,271
Jun-ha, go outside.

656
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,150
Let's go out.

657
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,530
Well, Jun-ha.

658
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,073
He'll leave soon.

659
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,159
So just... Oh, my.

660
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,870
Jun-ha!

661
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,599
Give me some money.

662
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,774
I can see you two aren't starving.

663
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,859
Give me some.

664
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,410
Gosh.

665
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,290
-Excuse me.
-Who is it?

666
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,418
An assault has been reported.

667
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,838
What?

668
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,965
I didn't do anything like that.

669
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,139
Wait...

670
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,729
Oh, my.

671
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,782
That punk is lying!

672
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,784
I'm his dad!

673
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,327
He obviously did it to himself.

674
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:47,163
-Be quiet, will you?
-Gosh.

675
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,624
Did you do it to yourself?

676
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,628
-I didn't.
-That little punk!

677
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:57,132
Mom, talk to them!

678
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,925
You've got some impressive records here.

679
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,886
Gambling, multiple assault charges...

680
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,722
That's not true! Let me go!

681
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,267
He asked for money.

682
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,353
When I said no, he slapped me in the face.

683
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,649
When I tried to stop him,
he started punching me. Then...

684
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,444
he rammed my head against the wall.

685
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,529
This is crazy!

686
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,532
That's all a lie! Mom!

687
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,701
Use a lie detector or something.

688
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,536
Detective Kim, put him in the cell.

689
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,665
-Wait.
-You'll have to come back

690
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,709
-and testify again.
-This is absurd.

691
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,544
Do you think I'll sit back?

692
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,922
I'll pay you back!

693
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,340
Gosh.

694
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,176
This is crazy.

695
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,636
Seriously.

696
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,697
As long as I can keep him away...

697
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,826
It's all right.

698
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,514
I'm never going to get him out.

699
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,808
Neither should you.

700
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,239
Do you think what I did is wrong?

701
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,207
He deserved it.

702
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,753
He was never a good dad.

703
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,632
I never considered him my son.

704
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,986
Grandma, you skipped a meal again?

705
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,003
-Where were you?
-I wanted some fresh air,

706
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,130
so I stepped out for a minute.

707
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,424
-Here.
-What is it?

708
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,551
You can take this on an empty stomach.

709
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,844
So take this before having a meal.

710
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:52,766
Okay.

711
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,614
My goodness. Are you okay?

712
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,865
Yes.

713
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:15,246
I'm sorry.

714
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,377
Gosh, you say that too often.

715
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,590
-I'm okay now.
-I have to go to work.

716
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,342
Turn on the heater in the evening.

717
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,054
-Okay.
-Don't forget your medicine.

718
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,347
Stop feeling bad.

719
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,892
-See you later.
-Okay.

720
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,190
Grandma, I won't be long.

721
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,759
I told you to turn on the heater.
It gets cold at night.

722
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,825
Grandma.

723
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,279
Grandma.

724
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,272
She led such a hard life,
and I can't believe she's gone.

725
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,568
How will you handle her funeral?

726
00:58:58,826 --> 00:58:59,911
I'll take care of it.

727
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,581
Thank you, Hui-won.

728
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,794
No need to thank me. Hang in there.

729
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,681
REST IN PEACE

730
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,648
This is room number two of Gidok Hospital.

731
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:31,776
Can you please deliver a wreath
to this place?

732
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,070
Please send the biggest one you have.

733
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,072
Thank you.

734
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,624
Mom!

735
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:47,875
Mom.

736
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,713
Mom! No...

737
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,593
How could you go like this?

738
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,139
It's your fault, you punk!

739
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,891
Mom died because of you. You jerk.

740
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,979
You killed my mom. It's all your fault.

741
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,440
-Mister.
-Let go.

742
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,442
What are you doing? Goodness.

743
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,568
Mr. Lee.

744
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,612
Did you really make everything up?

745
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,488
Were those wounds really self-inflicted?

746
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,240
Your grandmother dropped by
the police station.

747
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:22,285
I told you so.
That's the kind of punk he is.

748
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,412
What? You want to be a reporter?

749
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,706
I'll sue you for making false charges.

750
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,541
Stop making such a fuss.

751
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,959
Who are all you people?

752
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,340
DAD, MOM

753
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,262
Do you know how long it's been
since you last ate?

754
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,680
What are you thinking?

755
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,223
I want to die.

756
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,641
I can't let my family

757
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,143
live with the old me
for the rest of their lives.

758
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,563
Eating shows are very popular
in China and Southeast Asia.

759
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,440
You see, if this goes well,
I can be filthy rich in an instant.

760
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,484
Hyeon-ju. Shall we start over?

761
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,361
I thought from the moment
you sent me that,

762
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,196
our relationship has legally ended.

763
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:30,491
Like you said, we're strangers now.
There's nothing that I can't do.

764
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:34,078
I don't know about everyone else,
but you should recognize me.

765
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,581
You should've found me first.

766
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,207
Kim Hye-ja.

767
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,960
