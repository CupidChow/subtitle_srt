1
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,657
If it's a midnight flight,
he must be packing by now.

2
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,076
Who?

3
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,411
Mr. Aurora.

4
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,705
I guess so.

5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,792
I wonder if he packed his sunscreen.

6
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,297
He might easily get tanned
since he has such a pale face.

7
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,677
I heard cup noodles are expensive
in places like that.

8
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,221
I hope he takes some cup noodles.

9
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,474
Do you know how picky he is with food?

10
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,602
He should take some gochujang
and doenjang too.

11
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,229
Is that place cold?

12
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,814
It's extremely cold.

13
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,359
Then he should also
take a long down jacket.

14
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:12,113
But the temperature range is severe
in that country,

15
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,991
so he shouldn't just take
thick winter clothes.

16
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,910
Then,

17
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,497
let's add some light clothing
he could layer inside.

18
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,958
But there might not be any space

19
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,212
for anything else because of that
long down jacket.

20
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,589
Shall we take out the gochujang
and doenjang?

21
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,467
No. Let's change them

22
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,428
to those small tubes
that he can squeeze out.

23
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,306
What about instant rice?

24
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,225
He can't forget that.

25
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,727
Shall we take out his underwear

26
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,813
so he could just buy them over there?

27
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,231
He's already on a tight budget.

28
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,149
How could he buy underwear?

29
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,653
Let's change it to a bigger suitcase.

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,446
That's a great idea.

31
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,365
But doesn't he have to pay more

32
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,493
at the airport when he checks in then?

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,663
Why don't you just go
and pack his bag for him?

34
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,206
Right, let's go, Hye-ja.

35
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,541
-Okay
-Hey.

36
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,918
Don't even think about it.
Stop being so clingy.

37
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,170
You've already said goodbye.

38
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,755
You're right.

39
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,385
I did say goodbye.

40
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,264
Why? Do you want to see him again?

41
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,309
No.

42
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,832
Gosh, those punks.

43
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,585
I told them to be nice to him.

44
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,589
Your pretty little face is all ruined.

45
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,718
Hey, Jun-ha.

46
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,596
Were you really going to turn me in?

47
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,891
Stop this, Hui-won.

48
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,018
I'm asking you, you punk.

49
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,604
Were you really going to report me?

50
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,819
I can't believe you.

51
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,529
How could you think of

52
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,073
doing that to me?

53
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,452
I took great care of you.
Don't you remember?

54
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,037
When your grandma passed away,

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,830
I was practically the chief mourner.

56
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,832
When you were locked up
because of your dad,

57
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,627
I tried so hard to get you out.
Don't you remember?

58
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,670
How could you...

59
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,755
treat me like...

60
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,633
This is out of line. Stop, please.

61
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,176
"Out of line"?

62
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,678
What line?

63
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,890
What line did I cross?

64
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,309
Hey.

65
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,686
Do you think we can manage our business

66
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,146
by selling some cheap products?

67
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,357
We are in the red all the time.

68
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,153
I even took a private loan
to manage this business.

69
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,322
How can I pay that back?

70
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,324
Will you do it for me?

71
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,910
I need to have something to rely on.
Don't you think so?

72
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,496
Those old people were even
abandoned by their children.

73
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,122
We play with them, look after them,

74
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,415
and even let them have insurance.

75
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,125
And if they pass away,

76
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,670
I'll get the insurance payout
as a reward for my hard work.

77
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,089
It's not like I'm planning
to kill someone...

78
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,316
Why did Hyeon-ju ask us
to gather so early in the morning?

79
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,611
I have no idea. I'm still half-asleep.

80
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,869
What's this? What's going on?

81
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,373
I rented a car for you girls.

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,584
You girls wanted to go on a trip.
Let's do it.

83
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,462
He's going to see the aurora.
Why can't we go away?

84
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,548
Let's go on a trip too. Get in!

85
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,133
-Amazing!
-Show some respect to elders.

86
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,510
You girls have to respect
my opinion no matter what.

87
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,095
I was going to anyway.

88
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,097
-Where do you want to go?
-The beach.

89
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,515
To see the sunrise.

90
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,934
Okay! We're off to the beach!

91
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,561
By the way, I have a recording today.

92
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,272
We have to pack too.

93
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,780
All right. We'll leave tomorrow, then.

94
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,073
Okay.

95
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,415
Is this all you're taking?

96
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,833
What? What about it?

97
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,877
This is so comfortable when you sleep.

98
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,920
Are you going to sell
your clothes or what?

99
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,846
Are you going to sell your pills or what?

100
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,599
I'm only taking my medication.

101
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,060
We'll need another suitcase
if I'm also taking my supplements.

102
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,978
All those pills must fill you up.

103
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,688
This is your future, okay?

104
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,231
You care about getting dolled up now,

105
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,692
but it's all about survival
when you're older like me.

106
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,820
What shall we do after seeing the sunrise?

107
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,698
Since we're going to the ocean,
we should eat sashimi.

108
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,658
There are many nice cafes there
to take photos.

109
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,495
-We should check out the spa too.
-I want to do that thing.

110
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,496
What?

111
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,998
-Fireworks.
-Me too.

112
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,792
Okay! We'll do all of them.

113
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,262
-Are you going on a trip?
-You heard us?

114
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,764
Are you girls going to be okay?

115
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,600
You absolutely can't tag along.
Don't try to come up with an excuse.

116
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,935
This trip is for our friendship.

117
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,771
What the...
I don't even want to tag along!

118
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,446
Hey, look at me.

119
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,534
Don't avoid eye contact.
Look at me, will you?

120
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,746
I bet you're teary-eyed now
because you're disappointed.

121
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,083
-Are you still going to deny it?
-It's because this is too spicy.

122
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,590
I should go do my broadcast.

123
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,552
Your channel has been suspended.

124
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,681
Hey, why do you keep talking
so casually to me?

125
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,849
I'm older than you.

126
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,933
Am I a joke to you?

127
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,685
Move. Why are you standing here?

128
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,438
I was totally in your way, right?

129
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,731
Right?

130
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,032
Hey, the mat. Did you pack it?

131
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,826
-No.
-Where is it?

132
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,202
It's probably in Yeong-su's room.

133
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,414
Hey! Where's the mat...

134
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,040
Get out! Get out this instant!

135
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,792
You barged in without knocking.
Get out at once!

136
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,335
What's that? Move.

137
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,920
Why?

138
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,010
What are you doing now?

139
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,344
Why are you packing?

140
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,139
-Are you planning to tag along?
-No, I'm not.

141
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,017
I'm going to go away
for a few days as well.

142
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,102
Is that so? Where?

143
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,813
I want to go to a temple.

144
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,273
It'll help me clear my head.

145
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,983
I'll get some fresh air...

146
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,028
and do some thinking as well.

147
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,118
Why are you taking this steak grill
if you're going to a temple?

148
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,997
The wind is quite strong there.
When I'm reading a book,

149
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,749
the pages will flip in the wind,

150
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,959
so I'm taking it to keep the pages down.

151
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,838
All right, fine.
Let's say that I've gone mad.

152
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,592
"Of course, you can definitely
take a steak grill to a temple."

153
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,552
Let's say
I believe that argument of yours.

154
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,517
Then why are you taking
your swim trunks to a temple?

155
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,770
The chief monk asked me to bring it.

156
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,648
Why would a chief monk
need swim trunks like this one?

157
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,277
I'm not sure.
Why did he ask me to bring it?

158
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,029
Are his worldly desires back?

159
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,283
But I should take it
since he asked me to bring it.

160
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,661
I'll try to persuade him
to give up on his worldly desires.

161
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,079
Cut it out.

162
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,664
You can't come! I'm taking all of these.

163
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,124
What's this?

164
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,587
Fine, I'm not going! I won't go!

165
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,591
What's his problem?

166
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,098
Oh, what do you need?

167
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,685
The thing for warm compresses.
The one that's microwavable.

168
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,728
-I feel like I've seen it here.
-Oh, that.

169
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,189
Let's see. Here it is.

170
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,443
-Thanks.
-You're going on a trip?

171
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,530
Yes, when else will I get
to go away with the girls?

172
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,408
What about us?
When can we go on a family trip?

173
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,909
We should totally go somewhere.

174
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,536
Let's go on Dad's day off.

175
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,789
Remember the time
when we went to the beach

176
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,001
and ate watermelon?
That was such a fun trip.

177
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,335
I should get going.

178
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,172
-Dad.
-What are you both doing here?

179
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,677
-See you later.
-Dad, let's go on a family trip.

180
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,684
Like the old days when we were happy.

181
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,785
Why is it taking me forever
to pack for this trip?

182
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,385
-When are you girls leaving?
-At Dawn. Why?

183
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,346
Have a safe trip.

184
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,016
-Here.
-What is that?

185
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,019
Get yourselves some good food
with this. I'm sorry it's so little.

186
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,023
-Are you sick?
-Why?

187
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,317
What's wrong with me giving
my sister some spending money?

188
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,943
No, that's not what I meant.

189
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,237
-Here.
-Thanks, Yeong-su.

190
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,533
Hyeon-ju, take good care of Hye-ja.

191
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,786
What? Okay.

192
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,663
You said you're leaving
early in the morning, right?

193
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,331
This must be heavy.
I'll put it in the trunk.

194
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,166
Drive safely.

195
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,795
Okay.

196
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,675
Have fun, girls.

197
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,432
What's gotten into him?
Did he eat something weird?

198
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,476
Did my mom put rat poison in his food?

199
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,521
Nicely done. That was perfect.

200
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,940
I fooled them perfectly.

201
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,069
Did you girls think
I wouldn't be able to tag along?

202
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,529
Everything is ready now.

203
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,948
I bet you had no idea I'd do this.

204
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,413
You should just sleep over at my place

205
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,373
so that we can leave together
in the morning.

206
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,668
I'll be away for a few days, so I
should at least chop some onions

207
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,586
to feel less guilty.

208
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,926
-Did the recording go well?
-Yes.

209
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,636
Then why do you look so sad?

210
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,347
I'm starving.

211
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,683
I didn't eat all day because I was
stuck in the recording booth.

212
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,309
Want to come with me? I'll cook something.

213
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,896
Hyeon-ju! I'll make sure
your name goes into

214
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,648
the "special thanks to" section
in my album.

215
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,150
My gosh, are you getting home just now?

216
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,236
-Yes.
-Where did you go?

217
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,906
I was at my cousin's 70th birthday party,

218
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,575
and she packed all this food for me.

219
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,368
-I'll carry this for you.
-Oh, yes.

220
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,953
-It's all right.
-No, let me help.

221
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,581
I'll take her home and join you girls.

222
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,291
Let's go, ma'am.

223
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,876
All right.

224
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,466
He said he'd put our suitcase
in the trunk for us. Where is he?

225
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,093
Wait, the car keys!

226
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,225
Gosh, did he run off with the keys
so that we can't leave?

227
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,858
Isn't this the key?

228
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,151
Good.

229
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,569
What? Where?

230
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,531
Gosh, this clumsy idiot.

231
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,742
I feel so bad for the girl
who's going to marry him.

232
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,955
Hold on.

233
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,250
Why is the trunk...

234
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,753
Please... Please...

235
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,131
Is someone inside...

236
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,134
No way.

237
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,845
-Shall we go?
-Yes, what will you cook for me?

238
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,971
What do you want to eat?

239
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,140
-Tangsuyuk?
-Aren't you sick of tangsuyuk?

240
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,809
No, I can never get sick of
the tangsuyuk that you make.

241
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,686
Make sure you include my name
on the thanks-to list.

242
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,898
Mission complete!

243
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,486
Gosh! Am I locked inside this trunk now?

244
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,950
Just one day won't kill me.

245
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,163
Why are the lights on?

246
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,750
The lights have been on
for a few days, even during the day.

247
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,961
-I see.
-Anyway, thank you.

248
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,212
No problem.

249
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,214
Good night.

250
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,267
He hasn't left yet?

251
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,652
Is he not here?

252
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,035
What...

253
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,924
His bag...

254
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,929
Are you keeping an eye on
the old people's insurance papers?

255
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,015
There are now only five or six people left

256
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,933
who haven't yet signed up for insurance.

257
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,101
But the problem is,

258
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,187
there are so many of them
who want to cancel their contracts.

259
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,191
Let's get it over with.

260
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,401
"Get it over with"?

261
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,321
Call up all the people
who have signed up for insurance.

262
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,073
Tell them we reopen tomorrow.

263
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,408
What's your plan?

264
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,453
I can't deal with old people anymore.

265
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,413
Do as I say.

266
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,501
Also, make sure that punk stays here

267
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,170
until everything is done.

268
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,671
Keep an eye on him.

269
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,633
Okay.

270
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,981
Where are you?

271
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,194
Please come back soon. I'm worried.

272
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:02,878
What?

273
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,965
What happened? What time is it?

274
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,765
What is going on?

275
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,021
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

276
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,443
-Have a good time.
-Thanks.

277
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,080
LECTURE HALL

278
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,164
Oh, you're here.

279
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,208
We've been waiting for you.

280
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,752
I thought this place would be closed
for some time.

281
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,546
They're reopening.

282
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,215
As an apology
for having kept the place closed,

283
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,385
they're sending us on a picnic.

284
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,970
"A picnic"?

285
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,931
We'll stay here overnight

286
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,725
and leave tomorrow morning.

287
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,895
Have you seen Mr. Lee?

288
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,856
I haven't. Have you?

289
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,568
-Didn't he say he was going abroad?
-I see.

290
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,279
All right. Thanks.

291
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,828
What are you doing? Please let go.

292
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,208
Do you have something to tell me?

293
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,335
What is it?

294
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,798
Lee...

295
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,801
Jun...

296
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,096
Is it about Mr. Lee?

297
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,391
You've seen him, haven't you?

298
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,727
Where is he right now?

299
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,312
There you are.

300
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,236
I've been looking everywhere for you.

301
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,030
It's time to eat.

302
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,346
This is Jun-ha's.

303
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,904
What should I do?

304
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,388
Ma'am.

305
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,056
-You're here.
-I need some medicine.

306
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,518
Medicine?

307
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,608
Why would you look for medicine here?

308
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,903
What kind of medicine?

309
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,112
What?

310
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,656
You just said you were looking
for some medicine.

311
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,116
What kind?

312
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,244
Medicine for joints.

313
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,080
For joints?

314
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,628
It's over there.

315
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,757
I can't see well.

316
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,311
You're far-sighted.

317
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,409
Thank you.

318
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,293
Ma'am.

319
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,839
Would you like to go on a picnic with us?

320
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,968
No. My family wouldn't like it.

321
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,470
Don't worry. We'll call them for you.

322
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,430
Other families loved the idea
when we called them.

323
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,766
I'm not sure. I'll pass.

324
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,142
Why are you not sure?

325
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,352
Come with us.

326
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,437
Let's have a good time together.

327
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,774
Next time. I'll come next time.

328
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,318
Come with us, ma'am.

329
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,070
-Come.
-Next...

330
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,238
Next time.

331
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,572
Ma'am.

332
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,283
There...

333
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,326
you are.

334
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,204
I told you to wait outside.

335
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,457
I'm going to a movie with him today.

336
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,837
I see.

337
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,922
I guess you really want to see that movie.

338
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,258
Don't tell anyone else.

339
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,845
I said we should meet outside.
It's embarrassing.

340
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,900
Goodness.

341
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,402
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

342
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,530
Will it be all right?

343
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,283
I don't think she figured out anything.

344
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,619
It must have slipped my mind.

345
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,038
We're going to a movie today?

346
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,706
Don't say anything. Just walk.

347
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,000
Is it our first day as a couple today?

348
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,127
-Seriously!
-All right.

349
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,548
Gosh, why aren't they leaving yet?

350
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,470
I need to pee.

351
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,515
Darn it. I forgot to go to the bathroom.

352
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,854
This is pretty serious.

353
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,819
There's too much water.

354
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,571
Fine.

355
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,825
Before you empty something,
you have to fill it up first.

356
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,744
Yeong-su, you can do this.

357
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:51,995
Yeong-su.

358
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,713
This is bad.

359
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,091
I better hurry up.

360
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,635
Yeong-su. You're almost there, Yeong-su.

361
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,303
Keep going.

362
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,014
Well...

363
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,268
The bottle is filling up.
But there's still a lot to come.

364
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,771
Gosh, I'm doomed. What should I do?

365
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,855
Seriously...

366
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,899
My goodness.

367
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,363
Mr. Lee has been kidnapped?

368
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,866
-Why?
-I'm not sure yet.

369
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,868
By the way, what are you doing here?

370
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,245
Are you here for the picnic?

371
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,372
"Picnic"? They're going on a picnic?

372
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,499
You haven't heard about it?

373
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,084
No, I haven't.

374
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,130
It can't be just an ordinary picnic.

375
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,090
INSURANCE CONTRACT

376
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,133
BENEFICIARY: KIM HUI-WON

377
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,596
Did you sign up for insurance
through this place?

378
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,183
No. I don't need any insurance.

379
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,560
I still have all my teeth,

380
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,812
and I work out a lot.

381
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,524
Feel it.

382
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,861
Can you help me?

383
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,487
-Of course.
-If there are more people

384
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,989
who didn't sign up,

385
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,699
can you find them and bring them to me?

386
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,908
Okay.

387
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,336
Did you rig the bus?

388
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,549
Yes. They're working on it now,
and they'll bring it here later.

389
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,135
Hui-won.

390
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,555
This isn't what I think it is, is it?

391
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,891
Who told you to call me by my name?

392
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,225
I'm sorry.

393
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,188
I'm grateful for you taking care
of me and Grandma.

394
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,274
I won't go to Russia, and help you
with whatever you want to do.

395
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,817
So please stop that.

396
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,694
That's not right.

397
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,033
Do whatever you want, you punk.

398
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,620
And listen to me carefully.

399
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,583
All those seniors will die
because of a punk like you.

400
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,618
The exhibit hall is going on
a picnic tomorrow.

401
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,162
None of you here were invited, right?

402
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,250
Why weren't you invited?

403
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,170
That's because you didn't sign the
insurance policy they recommended.

404
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,506
It'll add up to about 1.5 billion won.

405
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,883
Is the bus here?

406
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,885
They only invited those
with the insurance.

407
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,220
And those people are going

408
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,304
-on a picnic.
-Then...

409
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,431
But do we really have to go
all the way to Daegwallyeong?

410
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,475
That place has rugged roads.

411
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,437
If the bus driver gets distracted
even for a moment, they can fall.

412
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:07,148
They'll be the first ones to be suspected.

413
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,733
I doubt they'll do that.

414
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,861
Why would they suspect us?
We'll be on that bus too.

415
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,655
Are you insane? Do you want to die too?

416
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,824
They probably came up with a way.

417
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,993
They'll survive, while all the others...

418
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,996
That's why we already rigged
the bus, you idiot.

419
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,290
Just make sure our seat belts
work properly.

420
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,874
Those scumbags.

421
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,503
Wouldn't it be faster to just
report this to the police?

422
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,505
Reporting it to the police is pointless.

423
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,215
It's totally pointless.

424
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,925
Where are they going?

425
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,260
Going on a picnic.

426
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,263
There needs to be an accident to
raise suspicion in the first place.

427
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,265
Mr. Lee probably knew everything.

428
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,268
He was about to report it,
and he was kidnapped.

429
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,854
You said it's pointless to report it.

430
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,897
Mr. Lee is an insider.

431
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,149
He's different from us.

432
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,777
Then what will happen to Mr. Lee?

433
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,196
INSURANCE CONTRACT

434
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,198
INSURED: LEE JUN-HA
BENEFICIARY: KIM HUI-WON

435
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,284
Put them on the bus.

436
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,537
We're the only ones
who can save Mr. Lee and the seniors

437
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,663
who are going on the picnic.

438
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,540
But something keeps bothering me.

439
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,460
Nothing must go wrong until
we start off for the picnic.

440
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,046
I'm certain they'll be on alert
double, triple times more.

441
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,757
We need a perfect plan
to make sure no one gets hurt.

442
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,471
Can I go to the bathroom?

443
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,901
I told you to do it like this. Here.

444
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,195
Like this! Look at me.

445
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,863
Look.

446
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,702
I'd be better off being hungry.

447
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,789
I really can't stand this thirst.

448
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,546
Yeong-su...

449
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,383
When on earth are they leaving?

450
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,135
I'm going to make them pay for this!

451
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,180
DONGAN CHINESE RESTAURANT

452
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,973
Can we help you with anything?

453
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:08,269
No. You might stand out more
since you're so young and all.

454
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,562
That's true.

455
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,482
What are you going to do
with those people?

456
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,858
I'll have to give it a try.

457
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,611
Sang-eun, let's go on a trip
after taking care of this.

458
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,947
-Does that sound okay?
-Sure.

459
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,157
Then let me begin my briefing.

460
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,535
The time we infiltrate
into the exhibit hall

461
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,663
will be midnight tonight,
when everyone is asleep.

462
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,039
INFILTRATE AT MIDNIGHT

463
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,626
I have to go to sleep at 10 o'clock
no matter what.

464
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,338
Then midnight won't work.
We'll begin at 9 o'clock.

465
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,257
INFILTRATE AT 9 O'CLOCK

466
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,426
I always fall asleep by eight.

467
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,344
I fall asleep right after having dinner.

468
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,430
I usually sleep after the sun sets.

469
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,766
Alright. Then none of you can go
after the sun sets.

470
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,936
Fine. Then before the sun sets tomorrow,

471
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,938
at a time when anyone can see us,

472
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,191
and when it's obvious that
we're on our way to save them,

473
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,694
we'll infiltrate at ten in the morning.

474
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,739
INFILTRATION TIME

475
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,913
When in the world are they leaving?

476
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,124
We rented the car for nothing.

477
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,250
It probably cost a fortune.

478
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,462
Don't worry about it. To be honest

479
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,465
It was free! My uncle works there.

480
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,008
We can just return it. Let's go.

481
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,843
Really? I'm so glad.

482
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,725
-Are they here?
-Did you buckle up?

483
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,976
-Let's go then.
-Okay.

484
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,227
Okay.

485
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,562
Are they finally going?

486
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,439
-Let's go.
-Go!

487
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,690
Let's go!

488
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,609
It feels like we're really going
on a trip.

489
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,111
-We should've just gone.
-We can go next time.

490
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,279
Where should we go?

491
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,491
You're so cute.

492
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,284
Good job. You're adorable.

493
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:51,289
But will we really be able
to save those people when

494
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,124
we're old and can barely walk?

495
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,669
You're right. What could us
old people possibly do?

496
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,338
Physically, it's difficult.

497
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,341
But mentally, it's a different story.

498
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,301
I realized it after becoming old.

499
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,512
Our minds can surpass
our physical weaknesses.

500
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,097
-Yes.
-Yes.

501
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,141
You can act like one person, right?

502
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,351
-Of course.
-Of course.

503
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,978
Listen carefully.

504
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,732
From now on, tell me what
each of you is good at.

505
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,026
That way, we can come up with a strategy

506
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,321
and save the elders and Mr. Lee.

507
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,054
HAPPY LOVE PICNIC
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

508
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,976
Yes.

509
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,563
We'll treat them to a nice dinner

510
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,523
and take them to a picnic.

511
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,734
We'll take them to a sauna for a hot bath

512
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,403
and bring them back home.

513
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,240
I know it was tough for you to look after

514
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,908
your parents all this time.

515
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,787
There's no need to thank us.
We feel grateful to you.

516
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,248
Okay. Have a nice day then.

517
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,171
SEOL JUNG-SEOK

518
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,723
-Ma'am, where are you going?
-The bathroom.

519
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,516
She needs to use the bathroom.

520
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,185
Show her the way, and make sure
she finds her way back.

521
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,478
-Yes, sir. Hey.
-Yes.

522
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,939
Follow them.

523
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,984
This way.

524
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,512
HAPPY LOVE PICNIC
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

525
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,351
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

526
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,990
One minute until the commencement
of our operation.

527
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,120
These are herbal pills.
They'll boost your energy.

528
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,669
You all know your roles, right?

529
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,253
To your positions!

530
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,254
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

531
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,513
-Your role is the most important.
-Yes.

532
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,307
As soon as we arrive
at the entrance of the basement,

533
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,769
you must get all the elders out
at exactly 10:15 a.m.

534
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,270
I'm trusting you.

535
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,856
Hui-seon, after this

536
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,900
-may I ask you out officially?
-No.

537
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:06,859
Yes, ma'am.

538
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,861
-Now!
-Okay!

539
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,962
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

540
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,637
This is a serious situation.

541
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,930
-Yes, sir.
-It's very important.

542
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,349
Make sure no one gets out of control
on all floors.

543
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,393
-I'll check later on.
-Do it properly.

544
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,021
Sir. Where were you?

545
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,274
-I went to the bathroom.
-I didn't see you leave.

546
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,568
I went with many others
so you might not have noticed me.

547
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,194
I suffer from constipation.

548
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,739
Until we arrive
at the entrance of the basement,

549
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,907
you must distract them by all means.

550
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,744
-Go on in.
-Wait!

551
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,246
You two, come over here.

552
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,998
You two, come here.

553
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,542
Hurry up! Come here. You guys too.

554
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,294
Respect your elders. Come on!

555
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,545
-Quick!
-Sir.

556
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,671
Guys.

557
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,423
Where are you guys from?

558
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,050
Do you know who I am?

559
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,094
You don't, do you? Then let me tell you.

560
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,388
You little punks.

561
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,896
I'm the infamous
scary grandpa from Maljuk Street.

562
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,314
Do you all understand?

563
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,191
-Please go in.
-You rude punks!

564
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,861
Shall I call up my boys and turn
this place upside down? You jerks!

565
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,613
-You little punks.
-Gosh, seriously!

566
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,490
-Look at this punk.
-You're...

567
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,741
really testing my patience!

568
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,951
It's all good now. Bear with me, please.

569
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,161
I'll head in.

570
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,455
No, I won't!

571
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,999
You rude brats.

572
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,460
You're testing my patience here.

573
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,484
It's all good.

574
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,902
I'm heading in.

575
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,197
Oh, boy.

576
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,250
Excuse me. Attention, everyone!

577
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,460
All of you, please gather around here.

578
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,295
This way. Come here.

579
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,714
Please gather. Gather around.

580
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,843
This is important.

581
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,553
Listen carefully, okay?

582
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,097
All of you were told that you're
going on a picnic today, right?

583
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,765
-You were, right?
-Yes.

584
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,601
Let me tell you the truth.
Those jerks at this exhibit hall

585
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,645
are after your insurance payouts.

586
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,730
You're going on this picnic.

587
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,774
Do you know why they didn't
invite me and a few others?

588
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,776
Because we didn't sign up
for the insurance policy.

589
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,903
They didn't invite us
because they don't need us.

590
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,280
Then why did they invite us?

591
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,074
Hey.

592
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,034
Did you buy any of the supplements
they sell?

593
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,495
I was going to buy some later on.

594
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,164
-So you've bought none, right?
-Yes.

595
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,456
What about you?

596
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,126
None, right? How about you two?

597
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,672
You folks haven't even spent a penny here.

598
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,175
And yet they got you the insurance
and even this picnic now?

599
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,719
What has life taught us?

600
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,512
Nothing's free in life.

601
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,097
No one gives you anything for free.

602
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,808
Those guys will never do
anything bad to us.

603
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,476
-That's right.
-Of course not.

604
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,020
-Yes.
-What's he saying?

605
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,813
-He's talking nonsense.
-I know, right?

606
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,815
-They'll never hurt us.
-This is driving me crazy.

607
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,359
Sure, fine.

608
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,904
I won't stop you folks if you want to go,

609
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,405
but you should just die

610
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,657
instead of ending up with injuries.
Do you understand?

611
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,910
Don't be a burden to your children.

612
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,766
At 10:15 a.m. sharp,

613
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,268
escape the building with everyone.
Then the thugs will follow you out,

614
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,187
and the door to the basement will open,

615
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,480
and we'll go in.

616
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,274
If we don't come back out in 30 minutes,

617
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,859
you should call the police.

618
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,787
Let's go!

619
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,122
-Go!
-Let's go!

620
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,791
-What's going on?
-What's the matter, sir?

621
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,461
-Stop them.
-Sir, what's the matter?

622
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,380
-Ma'am, stop!
-Sir!

623
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,131
-Stop!
-Sir!

624
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,758
-What's going on?
-Get them!

625
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,510
-Stop them!
-Sir!

626
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,178
-That way.
-They're going that way.

627
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,722
-Get them!
-We have a situation!

628
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,058
Wait. Hey, go get them!

629
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,185
-We have a situation.
-Guys, they're calling us.

630
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,937
-What's going on?
-Hurry!

631
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,147
Run, you punks.

632
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,277
-Go!
-Stop them!

633
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,821
We have a situation.
We have a situation up here!

634
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,240
Guys, quick!

635
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,450
Run, hurry!

636
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,496
-You're ready, right?
-I'm always ready.

637
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,833
I'm like a bag lady that carries
everything around, you know.

638
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,382
It's my turn now.

639
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,384
Give me a chopstick
and a pair of insulated gloves.

640
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,261
Here you go.

641
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,978
What just happened?

642
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,396
-Goodness.
-What happened?

643
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,315
-I can't see a thing.
-Darn it.

644
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,984
Why does electricity keep tripping off?

645
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,778
Hey, come here. This way.

646
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,946
-Darn it.
-Goodness.

647
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,127
By the way, why did you cut off power?

648
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,213
This will work to our advantage.

649
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,297
Mr. Kim.

650
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,929
Tell me what each of you is good at.

651
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,681
The energy waves from each time
my walking stick hits the ground

652
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,267
helps me see even better

653
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,560
than having perfect vision.

654
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,146
Now, go.

655
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,578
There's a room on the far left.

656
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,871
Two rooms on the right.

657
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,415
And there's a corridor in between.

658
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,667
It's a narrow corridor that turns right.

659
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,753
At the end of the corridor,
a wider hallway begins.

660
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,091
You should go to the narrow corridor
and wait for us there.

661
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,217
Okay.

662
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,187
-Hui-won!
-Hey, what's up?

663
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,856
-What's going on?
-Everyone left.

664
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,524
Who left? What are you talking about?

665
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,568
All those old folks went home.

666
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,694
What did you say?

667
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,279
By the way, why is it so dark?

668
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,405
Power suddenly went out.

669
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,532
Then bring it back up, you idiot!
We need power.

670
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,658
-Fix it, you fools.
-Yes, sir.

671
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,035
Hey, what about Jun-ha? Where is he?

672
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,245
We'll be doomed if he gets out.

673
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,955
Hurry up, you idiot! Go on.

674
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,376
Darn it!

675
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,546
Mr. Kim, where is Mr. Lee?

676
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,555
I think he's in
the first room on the right.

677
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,973
Follow me.

678
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,781
Jun-ha.

679
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,881
-What?
-That's not Mr. Lee.

680
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,883
Just a moment.

681
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,518
It's the room on the far left.

682
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,019
I couldn't see him.

683
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,395
Let's hurry there and save him.

684
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,314
Then what about him?

685
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,108
We don't have time to worry
about him. We must save Mr. Lee.

686
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,777
-No, let's take him.
-What?

687
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,654
He'll just be a burden.

688
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,489
Which one of us isn't a burden?

689
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,991
Let's take him. Lead the way.

690
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,625
Jun-ha!

691
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,794
Jun-ha.

692
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,711
Jun-ha.

693
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,422
Wake up. Why on earth are you here?

694
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,967
-Hye-ja.
-Yes. It's me, Hye-ja.

695
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,261
-Do something.
-Okay.

696
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,682
-There.
-Let's go.

697
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,395
-I see lights over there.
-What's that?

698
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,980
My gosh, we should hurry!

699
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,817
-Guys, hurry!
-What's going on?

700
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,569
Mr. Kim, lead the way.

701
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,571
Hold my hand and follow me.

702
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,239
Go, quick!

703
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,907
Darn it, we need lights!

704
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,034
-Turn on the lights!
-Darn it.

705
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,120
-Turn on the lights.
-Hurry.

706
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,414
-For goodness' sake.
-Gosh.

707
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,501
They're here!

708
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,184
Where did they go?

709
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,187
Guys, that way.

710
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,690
-Let's go.
-Okay.

711
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,443
You two can move like one person, right?

712
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,361
Let's go.

713
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,822
Hold on.

714
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,909
-Was that mirror always there?
-I don't remember.

715
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,537
Gosh. Let's go check!

716
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:48,959
You idiot.

717
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,674
Over here!

718
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,682
Hurry!

719
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,314
Don't worry and go on.

720
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,899
I can take care of the rest.

721
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,652
-Thank you.
-No problem. Hurry.

722
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,944
Go on.

723
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,415
Do you know what I'm good at?

724
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,043
I can slow down

725
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,170
anyone in the world.

726
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,439
Mr. Kim, where is the exit?

727
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,030
I could see it a moment ago.

728
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,573
But the waves won't come back to me.

729
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,627
You all! Stay right there.

730
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,047
You know what?

731
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,842
Since the moment I first met you,

732
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,261
I've never liked you, old lady.

733
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,346
Do you think I like you?

734
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,765
You totally look like an evil person.

735
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,892
Right? I look evil, don't I?

736
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,354
And I'm about to show you
how evil I can be.

737
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,565
Go get them!

738
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,281
Sir, you said you can control
any dog in the world, right?

739
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,074
-I did.
-Now!

740
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,708
Who wants to go for a walk?

741
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,797
The exit is over there.

742
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,110
Come on, you jerks!

743
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,154
Come on!

744
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,410
The door is open.

745
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,135
-Open the door!
-Open it!

746
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,096
Open!

747
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,264
What are you fools doing?

748
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,391
-Open the door right now!
-Open!

749
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,149
Get in.

750
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,907
Well, let's go.

751
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,326
Hyun and a lady are missing.

752
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,620
Leave now, or we'll be caught.

753
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,539
My goodness.

754
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,207
What should we do?

755
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,293
Ma'am!

756
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,546
Ma'am!

757
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,929
Get them!

758
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,430
-Get them!
-Take her!

759
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,308
-You little...
-Go!

760
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,601
Stop right there.

761
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,228
What the...

762
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,064
-What is this?
-What is this?

763
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,816
This is crazy.

764
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,484
Ma'am.

765
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,529
Thank you for all the good times.

766
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:51,577
I couldn't be happier
that I can be of any help to you.

767
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,540
Ma'am. I mean, Hui-seon.

768
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,127
Buddhists believe in rebirth.

769
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,799
In our next lives,
I hope we'll be a couple.

770
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,846
I'm a Christian.

771
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,532
What is he doing? Let's beat him up.

772
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,825
What is this?

773
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,203
Impressive.

774
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,998
I'm getting old.

775
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,876
-Goodness.
-What's happening?

776
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,201
What is it?

777
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,191
What's that sound?

778
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,568
Are we on a ferry?

779
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,196
That means

780
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,615
we're going to Jeju Island.

781
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,618
I love Jeju Island.

782
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,649
Jun-ha.

783
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,567
Jun-ha.

784
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,010
Look at the sea!

785
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,636
The sea.

786
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,680
The sea.

787
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:07,647
How does the sea look?

788
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,193
The sun is setting

789
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,196
over the sea.

790
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,784
Both the sky and the sea

791
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,660
are glowing golden.

792
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,792
It looks as if the sea is smiling at us.

793
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,796
Is that right?

794
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:33,400
CHINESE RESTAURANT

795
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,451
I wonder if Hye-ja is on her way.

796
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,911
Where is Hye-ja going?

797
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,705
She said she wanted to go to the beach

798
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,540
and said she'd take Jun-ha
if she found him.

799
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,836
By the way, where is our suitcase?

800
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,254
What? Suitcase?

801
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,299
Oh, right! In the trunk!

802
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,593
We didn't take out the suitcase
from the car trunk. Hold on.

803
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,601
-Hello?
-Uncle.

804
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,060
That car we returned yesterday.

805
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,479
I left my suitcase in the trunk
and forgot about it.

806
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,689
You didn't sell it yet, right?

807
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,774
What? I already sold it.

808
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,819
Then can you make a call and
tell them to return my suitcase?

809
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,906
I don't think that's possible.

810
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,366
Why? Don't you have the number
of the person who bought it?

811
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,036
Well, that car was sold
to an overseas buyer.

812
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,622
Korean used cars are really popular
in Africa these days.

813
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,916
You sold it to someone in Africa?

814
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,836
Yes. That car is probably somewhere
around the equator already.

815
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,172
Oh. Well, too bad then.

816
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,132
Okay, thanks, Uncle.

817
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,928
The car was sold to someone in Africa?

818
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,639
Yes. What should we do?

819
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,184
It's okay. I was thinking of
throwing those clothes out anyway.

820
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,311
Let's just forget about it.
It could've been much worse.

821
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,437
Cheers.

822
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,032
But what is this strange feeling?

823
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:23,004
Since it's Hye-ja and Jun-ha,
it's "H.J. Loves J.H."!

824
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,487
Mom!

825
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,499
-Mom!
-Mother!

826
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,512
Mom!

827
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,170
EMERGENCY WARD

828
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,421
Mom.

829
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,595
Dad.

830
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,599
Mom.

831
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,019
Mom?

832
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,021
Mother.

833
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,106
Can you recognize me?

834
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,243
You don't have to be worried.

835
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,913
She'll get better if she gets some rest.

836
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,339
I was her doctor
from the senior care center.

837
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,757
My name is Kim Sang-hyeon.

838
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,596
It feels as if I woke up
from a long dream.

839
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,141
But I'm not sure

840
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:31,437
if it was the younger me
dreaming of when I was old

841
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:36,859
or if it was the older me
dreaming of when I was young.

842
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,737
Please keep checking her blood pressure.

843
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,364
And please send me her blood work results.

844
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,033
Also, assess her mental orientation
when she regains her consciousness.

845
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,369
We'll also have to do a CT scan
as well as an EEG.

846
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,915
She might be confused, so please
try not to talk to her too much.

847
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:10,226
I'm suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

848
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,061
I've always thought

849
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,023
that my life was blighted by misfortunes.

850
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,443
I thought it was unfair.

851
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,404
But looking back now,

852
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,200
I'm realizing that all my memories,
from the ones

853
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:10,203
of our happy moments together
to the unhappy ones.

854
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,956
All the memories of my past
have enabled me

855
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,043
to hold out until now.

856
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,754
Thinking

857
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,591
that I might lose those memories

858
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:27,845
terrifies me even more.

859
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,265
