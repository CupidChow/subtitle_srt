A MISSION TO RECEIVE CANDIES!

2
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:36,077
THE ASMR OF DEATH!
SECRET EATING SHOW, 8 VIEWERS

3
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,210
Food Don't Know gave me
a mission for ten candies.

4
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,504
The ASMR of Death.

5
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,089
Do you see that old lady over there?

6
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,175
She's a really terrifying lady.

7
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,051
She might kill me if she wakes up.

8
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,055
I'm risking my life on this
for you viewers!

9
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,222
STOP STALLING AND START EATING

10
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,307
With that being said,

11
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,559
ten candies seem like too little.

12
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,894
Give me five more.

13
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,064
All right, you promised!

14
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,024
I will risk my life and succeed.

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,650
Let me begin the first mission!

16
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,028
HOW CAN HE FINISH A RADISH SILENTLY?

17
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,821
I'LL GIVE HIM 30 CANDIES IF HE SUCCEEDS

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,948
IT SURE IS A MISSION OF DEATH
HE SUCCEEDED! 10 CANDIES!

19
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,283
WHY DON'T YOU SEND 30 MORE?

20
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,995
IS IT A CABBAGE THIS TIME?

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,913
I FEEL NERVOUS

22
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,586
LOL

23
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,630
YOU HAVE RECEIVED 20 CANDIES!

24
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,048
It's time for the last stage.

25
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,134
I will try eating cheongyang pepper.

26
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:40,600
WHY IS HE DOING THIS?

27

THE OLD LADY IS MOVING

30
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,615
Still, I've endured this long enough.

31
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,283
You guys better not go out.

32
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,952
HE'S DEAD MEAT NOW

33
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,578
THE ASMR OF DEATH!

34
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,080
IS SHE A ZOMBIE?

35
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,874
THIS IS A TRUE HORROR FILM

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,210
MY GOSH

37
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,049
It smells.

38
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,596
Hye-ja, get me some water.
I feel like I'm about to die.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,515
Just die.

40
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,853
Hye-ja, please go get me some water.

41
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,271
I'm going to sleep.

42
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,439
I asked you to get me some water.

43
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,483
I said, I don't want to.

44
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,486
-Go get me some water!
-Stop bothering me!

45
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,287
What did the doctor say?

46
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,080
Nothing much.

47
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,040
There's nothing seriously wrong,

48
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,167
but they wanted me to check
a few things just to be sure.

49
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,627
PATIENT RECEIPT

50
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,093
That's common for a hospital visit.
It's nothing serious.

51
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,095
I go to the hospital often as well.

52
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,098
I didn't tell you
because you never asked me.

53
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,311
The hospital bills will end up
being quite costly.

54
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,313
Gosh, it won't be that bad.

55
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,315
Her medications are the problem.

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,318
Once she starts taking medications,
it'll be hard to get off them.

57
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,652
She should either never start

58
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,654
or keep on taking them.

59
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,490
I'll take lunch to work starting tomorrow.

60
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,493
Cutting our food expenses won't
really help, so just order lunch.

61
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,245
Find the lunch container.
I'll pack my lunch.

62
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,080
Gosh, I already have
more than enough on my plate.

63
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,957
Can you please not add to that?

64
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,781
-See you later, Grandma.
-Wait.

65
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,325
Drink this before you go.

66
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,288
Yes, good.

67
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,540
I finished it. See you later.

68
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,833
All right.

69
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,056
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

70
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,317
You must be sick of ordering
the same thing for lunch every day.

71
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,902
If it's 5,000 won, how much
are you spending a month?

72
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,657
Dad, this is rice.
And I packed some side dishes here.

73
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,618
You have a jobless daughter.

74
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,746
Put me to work with things like this.

75
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,540
You're touched again, aren't you?

76
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,418
But you know what? You'll be
even more touched when you eat it.

77
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,431
It's cold. Go back inside.

78
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,391
I want to see you leave.

79
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,109
Eat the stir-fried anchovies.
Anchovies improve bone health.

80
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,673
You should get more sleep.
Why are you already up?

81
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:23,966
Where's your dad?

82
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,261
I packed lunch for him
and saw him off, so don't worry.

83
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,013
I'll fix breakfast for you.
You should eat.

84
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,099
I'll eat later. I have no appetite now.

85
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,017
You have to take your medications.

86
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,227
You should eat something.

87
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,030
-Take these after you eat.
-Okay.

88
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:50,284
I may be busy with customers
at lunch, so remember to take them.

89
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,167
Growing old means

90
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:01,295
the number of pills you must take
goes up each year.

91
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,340
Now, I understand why elders usually say

92
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,717
that they have no appetite,
sitting at the table.

93
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,595
Thinking about all the pills

94
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,764
you have to take after the meal

95
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,683
fills you up.

96
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,269
Did I see this on TV?

97
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,980
Salmon at salmon farms

98
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,566
live in small tanks, and they're given

99
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,069
the same amount of antibiotics
as their feed every single day.

100
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:29,323
It's not an exaggeration to say
that they're not living.

101
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,201
They're literally depending
on medications to stay alive.

102
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,496
They never get to experience strong
currents that get in their way

103
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,250
or sharp bear claws.

104
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,545
I'm suddenly craving salmon sushi.

105
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,006
Mom.

106
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,800
Can we have salmon sushi for dinner?

107
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,595
Gosh.

108
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,143
There's an order for delivery.
ten bowls of jjajangmyeon.

109
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,811
Ten bowls? What's the address?

110
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,813
He said to deliver them to Hye-ja's place.

111
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,482
Hye-ja's place?

112
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,276
Is a customer at the salon
buying lunch for everyone?

113
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,363
Hold on. Is Yeong-su...

114
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,782
Dad! I'll take care of the delivery.

115
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,288
You brought ten bowls, right? Come on in.

116
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,334
Hey, come in. Hurry up. Come on.

117
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,510
-You're doing your broadcast again?
-Today, it's for another channel.

118
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,138
Do you know how much PewDiePie makes
per year through the broadcast?

119
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,598
I don't know.

120
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,059
You have to give me 60,000 won
for the 10 bowls of jjajangmyeon.

121
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,853
Eating shows are very popular among
viewers in China and Southeast Asia.

122
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,315
You see, if this goes well,
I can be filthy rich

123
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,566
in no time.

124
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,819
The official record for finishing
10 bowls is 15 minutes.

125
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,363
However,

126
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,616
I will break that record today.

127
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,451
I never asked, and I'm not even curious.

128
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,161
Give me the money. I have to get going.

129
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,247
I need a witness for this record
to be official.

130
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,165
I want you to stay and be my witness.

131
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,212
Don't get any wrong ideas though.

132
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,756
I heard girls get the wrong idea
like this often.

133
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,882
"Why did he ask me to come?

134
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,175
Am I special to him?

135
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,593
Does he have feelings for me?"

136
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,680
No, no, no. You're just my witness.

137
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,307
Nothing more or less. Are we clear?

138
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,519
Hello! Hello, everyone.

139
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,895
Hello, you're watching Yeong-su TV.

140
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,731
Today's mission is eating
ten bowls of jjajangmyeon quickly.

141
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,694
Wait! Before I begin, please
subscribe and like my channel.

142
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,446
Today, I'll try to eat ten bowls
of jjajangmyeon as fast as I can,

143
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,156
hoping to set a new world record.

144
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,075
I'll get started now.

145
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:42,790
GO, YEONG-SU! INHALE JJAJANGMYEON!
8 VIEWERS

146
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,140
Gosh, did I order a bigger size?

147
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,100
I'm full.

148
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,439
I'll try again next time.
That's it for today!

149
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,443
I haven't removed the wrap
on these nine bowls.

150
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,112
-Can I return them?
-Are you kidding me?

151
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,698
Just give me the money.
You owe me 60,000 won.

152
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,119
Do you remember?

153
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,040
Was it the first snow day that year?

154
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,544
You told me under the bridge
that you had a crush on me.

155
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,299
And after that, we started dating.

156
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,679
Hyeon-ju.

157
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,806
Shall we start over?

158
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,310
I worked so hard to make them.

159
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,397
You'd better give me the 60,000 won. Now!

160
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,781
-You're back, Dad.
-Yes.

161
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,241
Dad, how was it?

162
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,495
-What?
-The lunch box. Was it good?

163
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,913
Yes.

164
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,289
What did your co-workers say?

165
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,667
They must've envied you
for having such a sweet daughter.

166
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,213
Gosh.

167
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,340
You ate everything but the anchovies.

168
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,509
Are you a kid or what?

169
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,178
I told you to eat the anchovies.

170
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,805
They're good for the bones.

171
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,640
They'll help your leg heal quicker.

172
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,016
I'm going to wash up.

173
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,812
I worked hard to make it.
I wish you ate at least some of it.

174
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,107
He doesn't like anchovies as he ate
too much of them when he was little.

175
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,321
It's so good.

176
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,242
Shall I use smaller anchovies?

177
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,048
MIDNIGHT SNACK BAR

178
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,760
I wonder if he stopped by.

179
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,266
All right. Oh, hello.

180
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,436
Are you looking for someone?

181
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,729
Me? Who would I be looking for?

182
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,232
I'm not looking for anyone. Bye.

183
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,277
That's right. I'm not looking for anyone.

184
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,196
Why would I look for him
when he's not looking for me?

185
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,364
Darn it.

186
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,134
You must have been lonely all day.

187
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,179
Give me a second.
Let me get you some food.

188
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,689
It's a dog.

189
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,697
Did they always have a dog?

190
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:07,119
By the way, that dog looks
just like Bappul.

191
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,914
Where have you been?

192
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,291
Don't worry. I didn't do anything strange.

193
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,126
I'm worried no matter what you do.

194
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,128
She's home now. Go in.

195
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,132
Dad, I saw a dog
that looks exactly like Bappul .

196
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,342
What?

197
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,553
I said, I saw a dog
that looks exactly like Bappul .

198
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,639
Bappul?

199
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,266
With so many things happening,

200
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,644
I completely forgot about Bappul.

201
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,687
We were totally inseparable before.

202
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,233
She must be so angry at me by now.

203
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,495
Where is Bappul?

204
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,665
-Well...
-Dad.

205
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,710
I unleashed her for a moment,
and she disappeared.

206
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,463
When?

207
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,259
A few weeks ago.

208
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,345
And you didn't even look for her?

209
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,389
Gosh.

210
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,312
It's all my fault.

211
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,232
Bappul, I'm sorry.

212
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,360
Because of the things
that happened to me...

213
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,779
I'm so sorry.

214
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:34,248
No way. It must be just a dog
that looks like her.

215
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,547
Bappul.

216
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,387
Happy.

217
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,932
Toto?

218
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,565
Bappul.

219
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,028
It's you, Bappul.

220
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,696
It's me.

221
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,327
Bappul.

222
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,120
It's me.

223
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,288
Come here.

224
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,295
My goodness.

225
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,214
Bappul must be really angry at me.

226
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,218
I understand her.
She has good reasons to be angry.

227
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,597
What are you doing?

228
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,015
I'm examining her.

229
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,850
I need to make sure
she isn't infected with rabies.

230
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,185
Open your eyes.

231
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,606
Your eyes are a bit red.

232
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,983
What?

233
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,319
Why did Bappul bite me?

234
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,654
Because she's not Bappul.

235
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,322
She is Bappul.

236
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,032
She ran away over a month ago.

237
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,325
Why would she be there?

238
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,743
I'm perfectly sure.

239
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,204
When I called her name,

240
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,581
She wagged her tail.

241
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,542
After all these years, you think
I don't recognize her?

242
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,670
Hey, how do you know which dog is which?

243
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,380
All dogs of the same breed look alike.

244
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,547
What do you know about dogs?

245
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,174
-What if you're wrong?
-What if I'm right?

246
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,759
I bet Mom that you're wrong.

247
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,728
It's no wonder
Bappul doesn't recognize me.

248
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,525
Even people don't recognize me
after I aged overnight.

249
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,319
Why should it be different for a dog?

250
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,197
Wait.

251
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,659
But dogs recognize people by their smell.

252
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,203
Do I smell different too now?

253
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,669
I should take a shower.

254
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,507
My back.

255
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,975
Come out.

256
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,360
Hop on.

257
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,280
-Why?
-I have something to tell you.

258
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,741
Where are we going?

259
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,532
Where are we?

260
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,161
Have we been here on a date?

261
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,539
I did like to go to places
where there were no people.

262
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,920
Sorry.

263
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,506
I've dated so many girls.

264
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,341
I get mixed up sometimes.

265
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,554
I have a question. Please answer honestly.

266
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,059
All right. Unless it's something
difficult to answer.

267
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,770
Can you give me 60,000 won
for the jjajangmyeon?

268
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,483
That's a difficult question
to answer. No, I can't.

269
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,984
I knew it.

270
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,320
We're leaving already?

271
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,408
Wait!

272
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,952
What about me?

273
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,808
Your lovely daughter packed your lunch.

274
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,227
So finish all the anchovies.

275
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,854
Have a nice day!

276
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,285
I had this watch
that could turn back time.

277
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,579
That's what made me look like this.

278
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,290
I might look different on the outside now,

279
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,126
but I'm still the same on the inside.

280
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,420
Look at me carefully.

281
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,672
Then you'll see.

282
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,300
Look. Look at me now.

283
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,594
You recognize me, don't you?

284
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,803
Who are you?

285
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,063
Are you lost again?

286
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,065
No, I'm not.

287
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,151
I wasn't lost last time either.

288
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,402
I ran away...

289
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,281
Anyway, don't get the wrong idea.

290
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,826
I know it may look like that,
but I'm not that kind of person.

291
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,161
What kind of person?

292
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,871
The kind of person who breaks

293
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,165
into someone else's house
and plays with his dog.

294
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,459
You just intruded into my house

295
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,127
and played with my dog.

296
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,630
You have a point, but...

297
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,258
Are you suspecting me?
Do you think I'm a dog stealer?

298
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,927
So what were you doing here?

299
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,595
I'm here to get my dog back.

300
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,513
Why would you look for your dog here?

301
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,182
That dog is mine.

302
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,934
-Antler?
-Bappul.

303
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,812
She's obviously not your dog.
You didn't have any dog.

304
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,440
How do you know that?

305
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,025
That's what people say.

306
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,152
People say I didn't have any dog?

307
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,195
Exactly.

308
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,240
It's a small neighborhood.
People say all kinds of things.

309
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,116
She's not your dog, is she?

310
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,619
She came into my house
out of nowhere a few days ago.

311
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,829
Without my permission,
just like a certain someone.

312
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,249
See? She is just like me.

313
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,001
Dogs take on their owners' personalities.

314
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,544
She's definitely my dog, Bappul.

315
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,463
Do you have proof that it's your dog?

316
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,257
Do you have proof that it isn't?

317
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,802
I think that proves she's not your dog.

318
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,928
What do you mean?

319
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,513
Oh, my.

320
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,058
She's angry that I found her so late.

321
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,143
-I understand, so please...
-Antler, stop!

322
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,772
I'll give you the dog if you bring
something to prove

323
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,898
that it's yours.

324
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,025
-"Something to prove that it's mine"?
-Yes.

325
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,529
You must have some pictures
or videos of you and her.

326
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,490
She is too shy.
I don't have any pictures of her.

327
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,410
But I know for a fact that she is Bappul.

328
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,619
You know what that means, right?

329
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,372
Your occupation deals with facts.

330
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,417
She listens to me. Do you want to test it?

331
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,255
Bappul, sit.

332
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,634
You want to stand? You can stand...

333
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,386
Or sit...

334
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,430
Or walk around.

335
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,265
Yes, walk around.

336
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,226
You want to come to me?

337
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,521
Mark my words, I'll be back.

338
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,316
And she is Bappul, not Antler.

339
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,986
Bappul, you'll regret it.

340
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,654
Even if you recognize me again,

341
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,115
wagging your tail and licking me,

342
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,160
I will ignore you cold-heartedly.

343
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,707
I understand since Bappul is just
a dumb little dog.

344
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,044
But you're smart

345
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,212
and quick-witted.

346
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,176
You knew right away I didn't have
what it takes to be a news anchor.

347
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,095
But why can't you recognize me?

348
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,016
Can't you recognize my features
because of this old face?

349
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,186
We spent so much time together.

350
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,772
We ate udon and had a drink.

351
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,523
You even carried me on your back.

352
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,779
If this was the old days,
we'd already be married by now.

353
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,578
This is

354
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,955
the scent of when I was 25!

355
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,582
Turn right.

356
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,835
Turn left. Go, go!

357
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,213
Go straight. Jump!

358
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,423
These are the clothes I wore back then.

359
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,218
Will he remember?

360
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,287
What do you think?
Does this spark a memory?

361
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,544
You stepped on poop.

362
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,634
Oh, gosh. Darn it!

363
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,018
-I'm going to take her.
-Suit yourself.

364
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,314
Bappul. It's me.

365
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,192
Do you remember these clothes?

366
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,945
These are my favorite clothes
that I wore often.

367
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,282
If you look a little bit closer,
you'll be able to remember.

368
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,535
Look closely, and smell it.

369
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,579
Gosh, let go.

370
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:19,082
She likes this because
it holds so many memories.

371
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,460
That's enough of cherishing
memories. You should let go now.

372
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,213
Let go. Oh, my gosh.

373
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,301
I have to go to work.
Are you going to stay here?

374
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,262
Fine. I was just about to leave.

375
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,557
You go to work very late.

376
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,916
Dad, did you look at the anchovies
and sigh again?

377
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,002
You always leave the anchovies
untouched in your lunch box,

378
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,338
so I came up with a special measure.

379
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,841
I won't make anything else until
you finish all your fried anchovies!

380
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,719
It's good for your bones,
so please have some.

381
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,346
From your daughter, with love.

382
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,442
I'm so exhausted.

383
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,952
Hey, you must be coming from
somewhere far away.

384
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,536
Yes.

385
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,249
-Do you want a ride?
-No need. I'm exercising.

386
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,043
One, two, go! My goodness.

387
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,422
This is embarrassing.

388
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,635
What?

389
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,845
Where did those nerves come from?

390
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,140
Why did you order ten bowls
of jjajangmyeon with no money?

391
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,558
Oh, that?

392
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,853
I was going to pay you back
after I become famous.

393
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,105
When will that be?

394
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,652
Since you paid back 800 won,
you have 59,200 won left.

395
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,945
Thanks.

396
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,783
No!

397
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,496
How could he treat me like this?

398
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,124
How could he not recognize me?

399
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,168
Are you talking about Bappul or him?

400
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,089
This is so romantic.

401
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,508
What's romantic about getting bitten
by a dog like a crazy woman?

402
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,427
How romantic is this?

403
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,637
A man and woman fighting over a dog...

404
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,057
I mean, a man and an old lady.

405
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,478
-Just forget about it.
-Forget what?

406
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,023
Bappul or him?

407
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,277
I'll get you a cute little puppy.

408
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,322
Just forget about her.
She has already forgotten about you.

409
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,240
Do you think that's easy as it sounds?

410
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,284
We share so many memories together.

411
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,912
No matter how much you loved someone,

412
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,290
once you make up your mind,
you can even forget his name.

413
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,293
-Even his name?
-Yes, everything becomes blank.

414
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,385
Hey, I better get going. See you later.

415
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,470
Why?

416
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,142
Hey, Hye-ja. There's a lot
to eat there. Can I have some?

417
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,852
That's for Bappul.

418
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,062
Just leave it.

419
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,730
Do you even eat dog food?

420
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,024
You should've stopped Hyeon-ju
from going out the window.

421
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,108
It's dangerous.

422
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,527
Hey! You should close the window
when you leave.

423
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,196
Do you know how much we pay for heating?

424
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,283
Hyeon-ju is better off than Bappul.

425
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:44,329
But I feel like we missed
something important.

426
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,874
Why couldn't Bappul recognize you?

427
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,420
When I came home late at night,
I always gave Bappul a hug.

428
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,383
And I even slept outside with Bappul
from time to time.

429
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,302
-That's it!
-What?

430
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,054
The way I see it,

431
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,973
you were always wasted in front of Bappul.

432
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,560
-Right.
-Bappul!

433
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,979
Did you miss me?

434
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,398
You're right!

435
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,237
Bappul remembers the
intoxicated version of me.

436
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,157
Twenty.

437
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,451
-Twenty one...
-She'll recognize me now.

438
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,329
Hey, where are you going?
Mom and Dad will be worried!

439
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,581
-I'll be back soon.
-That brat.

440
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,756
Beef?

441
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,842
Beef?

442
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,059
It smells quite tasty.

443
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,167
Now you're even stuffing yourself
with dog food?

444
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,678
What are you crying for this time?
Did that hurt?

445
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,389
Then what is it?

446
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,476
-It hurts my pride.
-What does?

447
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,481
Dog food tastes so delicious.

448
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,065
What...

449
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,193
It tastes amazing.

450
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:44,240
Bappul. Do you remember me
reeking of alcohol?

451
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,494
Bappul! Here!

452
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,663
How long will you keep coming here?

453
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,296
Until I take Bappul back.

454
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,342
Let's try this then.

455
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,513
Let's cut her loose, call her name,
and see who she comes to.

456
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,264
If she comes to you, you can take her.

457
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,226
But if she comes to me,

458
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,353
never come back here again.

459
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,562
Okay, deal.

460
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,903
-Let's begin then.
-Wait.

461
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,656
I'd like to make the last statement.

462
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,951
Go ahead.

463
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,330
Bappul, it's me.

464
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,667
A long time ago,

465
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,420
I received money
for making it into college.

466
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,423
I was on my way to buy
clothes with that money,

467
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,801
and met you on the way there.

468
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,930
The owner of the pet shop said
you were a Maltese,

469
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,808
but it turned out you weren't
when you grew up.

470
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,270
I thought I was fooled, but it was okay.

471
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,815
You are Bappul, whom I love the most

472
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,483
in this world.

473
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,987
That's what stays unchanged.

474
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,240
Whether you're a Maltese or a mutt,

475
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,410
I will always love you the most.

476
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,330
Bappul, look at me closely.

477
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:19,210
I might look different from
the person you remember.

478
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,423
It's okay if you don't come to me.

479
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,843
But you must remember that I am the woman

480
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,803
you know from before.

481
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,766
I miss those days when you remembered me.

482
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:38,438
Promise me that we'll meet again
very soon.

483
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,859
Are you finished?

484
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,778
Yes.

485
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,323
Wait.

486
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:55,121
All right. We'll call her name
on the count of three.

487
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,082
-One...
-Bappul!

488
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,510
I can't believe this.

489
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,262
How could you do this to me?

490
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,974
I don't know about everyone else,
but you should recognize me.

491
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,229
I get that I've aged and changed,

492
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,441
but you really should recognize me.

493
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,069
If I hadn't been able to find you,

494
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,155
you should've found me first.

495
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,789
I didn't know we were neighbors.

496
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,415
See you around.

497
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,086
You have to pay first.

498
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,338
You startled me.

499
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,589
Had a nice day.

500
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,259
What if you could?

501
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:55,473
If you could actually
turn back time, what would you do?

502
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,601
I'm just trying to tell you
that you should love yourself more.

503
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,853
That will help you become
more generous to yourself.

504
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,606
Look at the moon. Even the moon
looks extra beautiful today.

505
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,609
This feels so nice!

506
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,144
Did you not take your medications?

507
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,315
What did the doctor tell you?

508
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,444
He said you shouldn't forget
to take your medications.

509
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,988
I'm fine, so just go to bed.

510
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,246
Is she okay?

511
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,874
I'm worried that she might fall ill.

512
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,885
Gosh, you're so inconsiderate.

513
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,180
Couldn't you just force yourself
to eat this for your daughter?

514
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,307
If not, you should've just thrown it out.

515
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,392
How could you bring it back untouched?

516
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,816
I'm stepping out.

517
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,705
That lady must've been very fond of you.

518
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,133
What a strange neighborhood.

519
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,181
What felt like a sudden spring breeze

520
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,433
vanished without a trace.

521
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,690
It feels like a dream. All of it.

522
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,517
Did he let you take her?

523
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,895
He said he was on his way
to bring her to us.

524
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,522
That's it?

525
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,066
Did he say anything else?

526
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,401
No.

527
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,069
Really?

528
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,156
That punk,
he should've just let me take her.

529
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:02,243
Bappul, we're going to be
happy together now.

530
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,328
Gosh, I'm startled.

531
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,291
Mom!

532
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,750
Gosh, what's with all the fuss?

533
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,502
Mom, Bappul... Bappul has...

534
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,920
What about her?

535
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,964
-Bappul has the thing down there.
-What?

536
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,340
I thought Bappul was a girl.

537
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,050
But I saw the thing down there.

538
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,303
Gosh, then we should've seen it
a long time ago.

539
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,264
No, no. It's not that obvious
because Bappul has been neutered,

540
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,099
but I clearly saw it. It's really there.

541
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,227
You can't tell Hye-ja about this.

542
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,562
We shouldn't tell her, right?

543
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,439
She'll be so shocked.

544
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,361
Then I should get something

545
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,280
in return for keeping my lips sealed.

546
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,990
Don't you think so?

547
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,752
I'll spare your life.

548
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,716
That should be enough as a reward.
Thank you.

549
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,395
They seemed to get along very well.

550
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,023
Should I have just let him keep her?

551
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,148
DONGAN CHINESE RESTAURANT

552
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,278
I'll give you the 59,200 won
I owe you, so follow me.

553
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,623
What's this? You said
you were giving me the money.

554
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,958
Just wait.

555
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,876
I'll collect some candies to pay you back.

556
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,879
Each candy is worth 100 won, so I'll
earn 60,000 won if I get 600 candies.

557
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,881
Gosh, whatever.

558
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,926
Hey, can you hold this for a second?

559
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,598
I'll pay off everything I owe you today.

560
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,434
Six hundred candies.

561
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,395
Give it back.

562
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,106
Hi, everyone. Are you guys there?

563
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,568
My goal for today is 600 candies.
Let's go!

564
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,287
THE ULTIMATE SEXY DANCE!
A CHALLENGE FOR 600 CANDIES!

565
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,039
7 VIEWERS

566
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,420
HE'S TRYING SO HARD.

567
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,796
1 CANDY

568
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,969
Let's go! Let's do this.

569
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,263
Join me! We have to do this together.

570
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,322
2 CANDIES FROM HEATSTROKE

571
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,741
2 CANDIES FROM TOY CRANE,
4 CANDIES FROM HEATSTROKE

572
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,951
8 CANDIES FROM TOY CRANE

573
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,603
Is no one home?

574
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,149
Ma'am!

575
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,111
Is she not home at the moment?

576
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,279
Ma'am.

577
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,032
I didn't see her the other day either.

578
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,868
Is she not feeling well?

579
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,748
Ma'am.

580
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,020
My gosh.

581
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,023
Do they never cook at home?

582
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,537
She passed away? My gosh.

583
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,382
Gosh...

584
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,803
It looks like she passed away.
My goodness, I had no idea.

585
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,245
Where did you put it?

586
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,997
You'd better give it to me
while I'm being nice.

587
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,710
-Give what?
-What else? The insurance payout.

588
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,088
Give it to me.

589
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,923
What does that have to do with you?

590
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,345
I can't believe this rude brat.

591
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,764
Is that the way you talk to your father?

592
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,810
I thought from the moment
you sent me that,

593
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,396
our relationship has legally ended.

594
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,400
What's going on?

595
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,194
Oh, my. It arrived
earlier than I expected.

596
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,534
Yes, we're strangers now.

597
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:02,246
So let's just divide up the money
and part ways.

598
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,206
Do you even know what today is?

599
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,626
It's Grandma's 49th-day ritual day

600
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,547
She's dead anyway. I don't care
if it's the 49th or 50th.

601
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,720
Let's not make a scene
in front of the deceased.

602
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,888
Let's work it out, okay?

603
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,266
I'm already at the bottom anyway,

604
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,977
but you have your whole life ahead of you.

605
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,691
Like you said, we're strangers now.

606
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,777
There's nothing that I can't do.

607
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,742
My goodness.

608
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,286
Mom.

609
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,039
Your son is leaving.

610
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,624
Goodbye.

611
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,666
Bye.

612
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,251
I'll come again.

613
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,844
Well...

614
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,306
I was feeling grateful and sorry,

615
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,351
-so I brought some food.
-Go back now.

616
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,233
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

617
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,652
-I didn't mean to hide and...
-It's okay. Just leave.

618
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,084
One udon, please.

619
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,380
My heart is still pounding.
What's going on?

620
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,967
That man is his father?

621
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,055
If his grandmother passed away,

622
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,766
is Jun-ha all by himself now?

623
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,435
My goodness.

624
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,478
I feel so sorry for him.

625
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,005
Grandma.

626
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,885
People say you should eat a lot
on the 49th day...

627
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,431
because you have a long journey ahead.

628
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,937
I'm sorry.

629
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,568
It was my grandma's 49th-day ritual today.

630
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,860
That one's for your grandma.

631
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,339
I'm not going to answer,
so don't ask any questions.

632
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,216
I wasn't going to.

633
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,681
Bappul is doing well.

634
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,350
She doesn't bite me anymore. Look.

635
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,769
You don't see any wounds, do you?

636
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,731
That's good.

637
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,276
You were worried?

638
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,697
You're kinder than you look.

639
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,533
You haven't even seen me that many times.

640
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,910
I've seen you quite a few times.

641
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,997
At the police station,
in the neighborhood...

642
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,751
Even before that,
we saw each other a few times.

643
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,546
You don't seem to remember.

644
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,090
We did?

645
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,468
Try to remember.

646
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,679
-You saw me here too.
-I saw you here?

647
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,604
Do you realize you're seeing me
from a very narrow perspective?

648
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,733
When you say

649
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,777
you "see" someone,

650
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,363
you know the verb,
"See, saw, seen," right?

651
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,074
It doesn't just mean you see
the appearance of that person.

652
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:15,035
It has a much deeper meaning than that.

653
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,330
Do you remember what those blue creatures
in Avatar say?

654
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,462
Why would they have said that?

655
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,423
It's because

656
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,301
when you "see" someone,

657
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:35,931
you're supposed to feel
what's inside of that person.

658
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,059
I can feel it.

659
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,645
Really? You can?

660
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,313
You remember me now?

661
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,233
You smacked me on the head here
the other day.

662
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,194
Why did you do that?

663
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,613
You said, "Who do you think you are?
What's bothering you so much?"

664
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,615
That's not the point.

665
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,660
Have you ever heard of

666
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,579
Happy Beauty Salon up there on the hill?

667
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,542
-I have.
-The hairdresser's daughter.

668
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,796
With big, shiny eyes

669
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,631
and a sharp nose...

670
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,300
She has harmonious facial features.
She's rather tiny.

671
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,845
I mean that charming, pretty girl.

672
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,763
I know who you mean,
but I'm not sure she's pretty.

673
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,473
-What did you say, punk?
-Pardon?

674
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,225
Never mind.

675
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,354
She is pretty, but I guess
she wasn't really your type.

676
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,357
That's not it.
I just never thought she was pretty.

677
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,651
I see.

678
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,572
I can see why things never go his way.

679
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,658
So what about Hye-ja?

680
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,661
Hye-ja. Kim Hye-ja.

681
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,621
You remember her name.

682
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,834
Don't be surprised. I'm...

683
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,503
Hye-ja...

684
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,050
I'm her great-aunt.

685
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,304
Okay.

686
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,182
Is that it?

687
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,475
Do I have to be surprised?

688
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,770
Not actually, but...

689
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,648
Is he a sociopath or what?

690
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,322
Although it's late, congratulations
on finding a job.

691
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,699
I heard it from Hye-ja.

692
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,495
Which department is it?
Economics? Social affairs?

693
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,415
I'll pay for the drinks
since you gave me food earlier.

694
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,251
Which department is it?
Where? Is it a secret?

695
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,295
You're very talkative, just like Hye-ja.

696
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:34,257
I'll let you know how Hye-ja
is doing, if you're curious.

697
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,842
Fine.

698
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,262
You're just dying to know, aren't you?

699
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,443
At this age, I got drunk again
and slept in.

700
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,029
Where is Dad?

701
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,617
ON PATROL

702
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,004
So this is the place Dad works at.

703
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,265
What brings you here?

704
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,558
I brought you a lunch box.

705
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,269
Don't worry. I made you
some other side dishes.

706
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,020
You didn't have to come.

707
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,192
Yes, this is the security guard.

708
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,237
Yes, Building 105, unit 805? Okay.

709
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,281
I understand.

710
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,743
Hello?

711
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,538
I'll connect you to
the maintenance office.

712
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,042
SOO YEONG SHIPPING

713
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,516
Dad.

714
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,937
Wasn't it better when you drove a taxi?

715
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,356
You could just rest in your car
whenever you were tired.

716
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,359
No.

717
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,237
I walk around all the time,
and it's good exercise.

718
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:22,991
Go home now.

719
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,201
I came to watch you eat.

720
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:26,995
I'll eat it later.

721
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,705
Leaving out the anchovies again,
aren't you?

722
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,291
I'm not moving an inch until
you eat that, so suit yourself.

723
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,335
It's time for my patrol, so I have to go.

724
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,544
Wait for me at home.

725
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,049
It's past your lunchtime!

726
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,928
I have to finish my regular patrol.

727
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,263
Go home safely.

728
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,406
I told you it was a mistake.

729
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,325
I made a mistake while I was recycling.

730
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,826
How dare you try to teach me?

731
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,496
It's not that.

732
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,456
I just asked you to be more careful
next time.

733
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,875
Goodness. You just don't know
your place, do you?

734
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,086
If stuff is jumbled up in there,
you should do the recycling

735
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,338
since people can make mistakes
once in a while.

736
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,799
Don't you have some of the money
from this anyway?

737
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,467
We're doing recycling for free.

738
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,428
Then you should do this at least.
Why are you slacking off?

739
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,305
There must be a misunderstanding.

740
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,016
We don't keep the money that comes
from recycling.

741
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,811
I heard you do. Don't try to fool me.

742
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,396
Oh, okay.

743
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,856
Then let's see where all that money goes.

744
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,650
Go and bring the ledger
for the maintenance fees.

745
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,320
I'm sorry. I'll take care of this.
You can go.

746
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,155
See, I knew it!

747
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,490
Ma'am you're a witness to this.

748
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,159
Look at him backing off
at the mention of money.

749
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,494
Do you feel guilty?

750
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,163
-Tell me. Come on.
-Hey!

751
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,708
How could you say something like that?

752
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,584
What? Hey, old lady.

753
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,670
It's not your business, so stay out of it.

754
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,838
Why isn't it my business?

755
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,506
Who are you to butt in?

756
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,093
I'm his mom. I'm this guard's mother.

757
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,347
If he sold these and brought
a single penny home,

758
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,473
I'll take the blame instead.

759
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,475
-Seriously.
-Seriously what?

760
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:16,271
If you're humiliated like this
in front of your mom by a stranger,

761
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,398
how would you feel? Tell me.

762
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,091
I'm sorry, Dad.

763
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,595
That guy acted up
and I just lost my temper.

764
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:53,266
Still, I shouldn't have told him
that I was your mom, right?

765
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,328
It felt reassuring...

766
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,792
since you stood on my side.

767
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,298
Do you want to go for some udon?

768
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,652
I'd like some soju tonight.

769
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,737
Let me do that.

770
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,291
You just saw a very rare sight.

771
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,502
I don't do this in front of anyone.

772
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,048
All right.

773
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,347
What shall we order for food?

774
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,101
I already have something.

775
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,611
I heard anchovies...

776
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,324
are good for bones.

777
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,242
I thought you might miss Bappul.

778
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,916
Hello, Bappul.

779
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:10,171
He said hi to a dog, and just ignored me.

780
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,052
You're going to work late.

781
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,929
Does your company have free working hours?

782
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,430
Did you have breakfast?

783
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,641
-You have to eat heartily to work.
-Okay.

784
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,143
How is work? Are there a lot of women?

785
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,521
Men must always be careful of women.

786
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,068
What is it? Is it for me?

787
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,905
Fetch!

788
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,533
That jerk.

789
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,788
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

790
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,709
Aunt.

791
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,794
Why are you so out of breath?

792
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:53,256
Come on in. Come and sit here.

793
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,717
Are you okay?

794
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,302
I ran a bit.

795
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,220
That's why I'm out of breath.

796
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,139
Gosh, why did you run?

797
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,059
Sit here and try to catch your breath.

798
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,022
-Is she all right?
-Yes, I think she's okay.

799
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,857
Are you feeling better now?

800
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:16,654
I'll sit here for a few more minutes.

801
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,658
All right. Take your time.

802
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,453
By the way, where are the three ladies

803
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,663
that were always here?

804
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,915
They probably went to the exhibit hall.

805
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,586
The exhibit hall? Isn't it full of
scammers who try

806
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,004
to sell things and rip you off?

807
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,964
They've smartened up,
so they don't do those things.

808
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,300
So what do they do
if they don't sell things there?

809
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:41,095
I heard it's now like
a daycare center for the elderly.

810
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,264
-What?
-Just like children's daycare,

811
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,974
they give snacks and run various programs.

812
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,061
All elderly ladies in this
neighborhood go there these days.

813
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,230
My mother-in-law's friend
goes there too, and she loves it.

814
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,567
They bring home a pack of
toilet papers every day. It's great.

815
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,362
Ma'am, you should
check it out too. I heard it's fun.

816
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,739
I'm not interested.

817
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:05,036
Thank goodness, my mother-in-law
has somewhere to go.

818
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,080
That's why I can come
and get my hair done like this.

819
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,956
She really suffocates me.

820
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,058
Here it comes.

821
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,607
-Hello.
-Hello.

822
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,317
-Please get in.
-Thank you.

823
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,404
Sir, you get in first. Please be careful.

824
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,571
-Thank you.
-No problem.

825
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,782
-I always enjoy it.
-Yes, it's great.

826
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,702
And today, we have special things
prepared for you.

827
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,662
-We'd like many...
-Oh, boy.

828
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,789
Ma'am, aren't you coming?

829
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,543
Would you like to get in or not?

830
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,171
You've been waiting to join us, right?

831
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,092
Then please get in.

832
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,391
It's okay. Everyone's like that at first.
Please get in.

833
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,644
You're very shy.

834
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,482
Then if you'd like to come with us,

835
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,526
please do this with one finger.

836
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,780
If you're not coming, give me two fingers.

837
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,992
All right. One, two, three.

838
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,165
Gosh, I knew you want to join us.

839
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,335
You're welcome to join us. Please get in.

840
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:40,131
Ma'am, I'll give you extra eggs
as a welcome gift.

841
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,551
Don't tell anyone else, okay?

842
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:44,886
Please get in.

843
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:45,845
All right.

844
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,764
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

845
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,432
BEAUTIFUL COMPANION, LIFE, SHELTER!

846
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,157
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL IS HERE
FOR YOUR HAPPINESS

847
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,461
Where are you going? It's about to begin.

848
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,254
It's fine. I want to leave.

849
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,341
Gosh, you should stay.
The real fun part is about to begin.

850
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,884
-I want to leave.
-Why?

851
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,511
-Look.
-Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

852
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,262
Hyoja Exhibit Hall's mascot

853
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:31,015
and your forever little brother

854
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,476
-is here to entertain you.
-Give him a big hand!

855
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:38,272
Let's go!

856
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:43,903
Hey, hey, hey

857
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,614
What's wrong with my age?

858
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:52,537
Age doesn't matter when it comes to love

859
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,363
What is he doing here?

860
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,949
Why is that aspiring reporter
with a bright future working here?

861
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,576
What on earth happened to him?

862
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,411
I bet I was your first
and last girlfriend.

863
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,745
What will you do if I date someone?

864
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,914
If you manage to date someone,
I'll do everything you ask me to do.

865
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,834
You're the only girl I know,
so I'm making you fall for me again.

866
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,044
When it comes to gifts,
what it is doesn't matter.

867
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,713
What's important is who gave it to you.

868
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,673
You'll earn money yourself?

869
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,383
Ma'am, you got the job.

870
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,302
We are holding a fundraiser.

871
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,845
There's been an accident...

872
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,722
Isn't this a phone scam?

873
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,682
Your voice is just perfect for eggs.

874
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:55,850
Is there such a voice?

875
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:58,603
Check out these large, fresh eggs.

876
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,688
Tell Hye-ja in Germany.

877
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,481
I don't want to see you ever again.

878
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:06,068
If I can go back and make everything
go back to the way it was...

879
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,529
Please, just once.

880
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,365
