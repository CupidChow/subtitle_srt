1
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:01,978
That's right.

2
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,481
This is the only way.

3
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,859
Dad, Mom...

4
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,903
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,697
Yeong-su.

6
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,533
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,333
Thank you for all these times.

8
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,426
It's time to go.

9
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,852
Darn it!

10
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,409
Ma'am.

11
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,414
You won't die from that.

12
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,378
Even if you fall from there,

13
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,172
you won't die.

14
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,426
You'll just break your pelvis

15
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,847
or your spine, and become
hospitalized forever.

16
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,516
And your family will suffer even more

17
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,602
taking care of you for their whole lives.

18
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,940
So you should live.

19
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,652
Just keep living.

20
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,367
Stay alive until you can.

21
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,874
That's how you'll make your family
suffer less.

22
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,732
What? My letter.

23
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,610
What if Mom saw it?

24
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,884
Mom's a kind of person
who would go crazy looking for me

25
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,844
had she saw the letter.

26
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,554
Then was it...

27
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,691
Where did the letter go?

28
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,319
Have I become old
that I forget things now?

29
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,614
Gosh, I aged this much overnight,

30
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,491
but all the age-related changes
are still happening.

31
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,679
Look at my hair.

32
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,561
I used to look fabulous.

33
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,903
Are you up?

34
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,244
Gosh, is it going to rain today or what?

35
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,497
My wrists hurt so much.

36
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,043
I really want to close the salon
for the day

37
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,420
and plunge into the hot pool
at the bathhouse.

38
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,841
I know you like going to the bathhouse.

39
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,220
Are you listening?

40
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,516
Oh, dear.

41
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,229
I wonder if autumn will be gone
in the near future.

42
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,857
I feel like it was summer just yesterday,

43
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,319
but it's already getting cold.

44
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,783
I'm leaving your breakfast
in front of the door.

45
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,720
Jun-ha, Jun-ha!

46
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,223
Hey, you're inside, right?

47
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,559
Open up.

48
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,771
I'll give you this porridge
I picked up for you and leave.

49
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,732
He's not home, right?

50
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,359
Well...

51
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,656
I'm not sure, but he's not answering.

52
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,867
The thing is, his grandmother
passed away suddenly.

53
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,537
Yes, I'm aware.

54
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,996
He knows.

55
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,250
The young man who lives here
has no family.

56
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,837
He might have nothing to eat,
so I brought some food for him.

57
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,215
I went hiking in the spring
and picked some mugwort.

58
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,467
I steamed it with some flour.

59
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,053
And I made this with plums I bought

60
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,639
when I went to Gwangyang.
I pickled them first

61
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,599
and seasoned them with gochujang.

62
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,726
It perks up your appetite
like nothing else can.

63
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,646
You can easily eat a whole bowl
of rice with this and water alone.

64
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,814
I see.

65
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,317
The thing is, his grandmother
passed away suddenly.

66
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,821
-I told you earlier that I know.
-He knows.

67
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,991
Jun-ha.

68
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,758
She didn't eat again?

69
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,847
The rice is so hot.

70
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,808
I prefer cold rice.

71
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,188
Mom, I don't want hot rice.
I like digging right into cold rice.

72
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,231
Don't be so fussy. Let's just eat, okay?

73
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,692
I'm about to lose it.

74
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,653
Okay.

75
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,282
Let's break the door open.

76
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,245
Let's get it open and take her
to the hospital or something.

77
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,580
We can't just leave her like that.

78
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,249
Do you think it's that simple?

79
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,253
You think she's not coming out
because she can't get the door open?

80
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,719
You've never even tried
to understand how others might feel.

81
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,365
Good, right there. Okay. Confirm.

82
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,579
Gosh, you idiot. Why did you
have to go there and die?

83
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,419
Playing this game alone is no fun.
I need someone to watch me play it.

84
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,632
That's it. Stop right there. Stop, stop!

85
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,968
Okay. Isn't this it?

86
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,310
I picked up some kimchi dumplings.

87
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,062
I know you like these dumplings.

88
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,566
You should eat them before they get cold.

89
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,610
And tell me if there's anything else
you want to eat.

90
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,333
You don't have to come out,
but you should eat something.

91
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,295
You need to eat to live.

92
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,565
Can she see me?

93
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,641
Hey! Focus, will you?

94
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,518
This is why I told you to take a break.

95
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,437
You should just go home.

96
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,331
Jun-ha! Come here and have some food.

97
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,418
Where did it go? Here it is.

98
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,604
It's 3 a.m.?

99
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,734
I've gone to bed at 3 a.m.,
but I've never woken up at 3 a.m.

100
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,738
I heard old people get up very early
in the morning.

101
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,646
I'm sorry. Are you closing soon?

102
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,314
No, not at all.

103
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,816
What would you like?

104
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,319
-A bowl of udon, please.
-Sure. Have a seat.

105
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,543
A bottle of soju, please.

106
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,256
You're drinking soju again?

107
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,216
Have you eaten?

108
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,599
Here.

109
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,517
It's on the house.

110
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,644
Eat some while you drink, okay?

111
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,274
Gosh, your face has become so thin.

112
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,193
I can't stand seeing you like that.

113
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,321
Well, here is your udon.

114
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,282
Enjoy.

115
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,408
Thank you.

116
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,830
You don't live around here, do you?

117
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,208
No.

118
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,544
Oh, your son must live around here.

119
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,467
I understand.

120
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,428
Everyone has a story, I guess.

121
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,182
The water is boiling.

122
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,454
What's bothering you?

123
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,873
Why are you drinking so much?

124
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,834
Whatever it is, I doubt
you're in deeper trouble than I am.

125
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,796
I got old overnight, for goodness' sake.

126
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,683
After telling me not to kill myself,

127
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,269
why do you look so depressed yourself?

128
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,230
Who are you to tell me to live?

129
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,274
Who gives you the right?

130
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,408
Who do you think you are?

131
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,244
What's bothering you so much?

132
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,121
What is it?

133
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,779
Gosh.

134
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,470
Why didn't you eat the dumplings? Why?

135
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,056
You used to die for those dumplings!

136
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,767
You even said Choi Min-sik in Oldboy

137
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,769
wouldn't have become so furious
if he had been given

138
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,688
kimchi dumplings
instead of the grilled ones.

139
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,192
You said you wouldn't mind being
locked up eating them forever.

140
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,403
Why aren't you eating them now?

141
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,364
I don't want them.

142
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,742
You eat only when you want food?

143
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,453
You can't fool your stomach.

144
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,541
Do you know how long it's been
since you last ate?

145
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,543
What are you thinking?

146
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,380
I want to die.

147
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,597
In this state, it wouldn't be surprising
even if I die tomorrow.

148
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,269
Come out.

149
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,314
I said, come out!

150
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,651
Come out!

151
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,992
CURLY PERM

152
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,628
You're lucky.

153
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,506
You can dye your hair for free
for the rest of your life.

154
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,928
If you're jealous, get old.

155
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,432
I'll dye your hair.

156
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,851
I'm already old.

157
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,270
Because I work so hard,

158
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,522
you think I'm still young.

159
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,358
I...

160
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,488
always wondered

161
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,283
when I saw the old ladies that come here.

162
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,411
"How did

163
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,666
those ladies look when they were young?

164
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,878
And...

165
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,883
how will I look when I get old?"

166
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,888
So this is how I look.

167
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,434
Gosh, you have so much hair.

168
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,811
I need more dye.

169
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,480
Give me a second. I'll get some more.

170
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,502
A daughter who got old before her mother.

171
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,466
A mother who has to dye
her old daughter's hair.

172
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,219
What a nightmare.

173
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,309
I can't let my family

174
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,354
live with the old me
for the rest of their lives.

175
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,400
The 25-year-old Kim Hye-ja

176
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,527
is gone now.

177
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,703
Is there a bigger suitcase?

178
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,373
A T-shirt.

179
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,795
This might come in handy too.

180
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,381
A woven straw bag for summer.

181
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,385
Am I going on a trip?

182
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,678
My goodness.

183
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,598
Even after getting old,
I'm still so childish.

184
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,394
What are you going to do now, Hye-ja?

185
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,250
SEOUL EXPRESS BUS TERMINAL

186
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,093
TIMETABLE

187
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,640
WHERE FUN TRIPS START

188
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,561
To where?

189
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,687
Pardon?

190
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,648
To the sea.

191
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,316
Which sea?

192
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,277
YEOSU

193
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,529
Do you want to get on
the next bus that's in an hour?

194
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,697
Yes, please.

195
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,741
It's 14,800 won.

196
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,088
-Do you want it or not?
-I do.

197
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,840
Here you go.

198
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,961
Excuse me, ma'am.

199
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,381
How do we get to Sinchon?

200
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,967
Sinchon? It's Line Number Two.

201
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,510
Get on the subway

202
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,679
and transfer once.

203
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,556
Okay. Thank you.

204
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,017
By the way,

205
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,103
you don't look so well. Are you all right?

206
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,771
It shows?

207
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,983
Yes, a lot. My goodness.

208
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,403
Has something unfair
happened to you lately?

209
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,947
Yes.

210
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,699
We study these things.

211
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,952
We could see the bad energy
around you even from a distance.

212
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,662
We wanted to help you.

213
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,414
How can you help me?

214
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,710
We can help people like you,
who have been through a lot...

215
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,508
We know some people

216
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,678
who can help those who have been
through a lot.

217
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,140
If you come with us...

218
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,477
I guess you haven't eaten.

219
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,644
No.

220
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,737
For someone who has been through a lot,

221
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,447
you have a good appetite.

222
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,366
Well, I'm glad for you.

223
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,914
Nothing has gone wrong with my life
until now.

224
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,793
-Can we get more side dishes?
-Okay.

225
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,797
But if I think about my family,
I have second thoughts.

226
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,299
My grandfather passed away
a few months ago.

227
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,094
I got swindled, and fired from
work as well.

228
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,012
I even got sick from
an unidentified disease.

229
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,431
-Do you remember?
-Of course I do.

230
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,767
But after you performed ancestral rites,

231
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,521
you were cured immediately
and things started going well.

232
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,606
What? Ancestral rites?

233
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,442
Yes. There's an old saying that
our ancestors always help us.

234
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,819
We must respect our ancestors

235
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,738
to bring fortune to ourselves
and our families.

236
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,742
Do you mean if I do that,
everything will be taken care of?

237
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,663
Then will I be able to go back to
when I was 25?

238
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,458
-Sorry?
-Go back?

239
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,505
To tell you the truth, I'm 25 years old.

240
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,384
I see. 25?

241
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,762
-Really?
-I have

242
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,431
a watch that can turn back time.

243
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,101
It's a long story, so let's skip it.

244
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,436
Anyway, I'm 25 years old.

245
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,314
But suddenly I got so old.

246
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,652
Will ancestral rites take care of
my problem too?

247
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,737
When were you 25 years old?

248
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,698
Let's see...

249
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,868
About two months ago?

250
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,662
I suddenly turned into an old lady.

251
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,207
Until now, I've experienced
growing old bit by bit,

252
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,377
but seriously, when I suddenly
turned this old,

253
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,671
do you know how shocked I was?

254
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,800
We are shocked as well.

255
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,846
Is the place for ancestral rites far away?

256
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,264
Why? Do you want to go?

257
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,849
-Well...
-Gosh, it's too far.

258
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,518
-It takes three days to get there.
-Right.

259
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,020
I have a lot of time to spare.

260
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,024
-Ma'am. Can we have the bill?
-Have some coffee. It's free.

261
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,573
Where did they go?

262
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,452
They said performing ancestral rites
would take care of everything.

263
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,793
My bag!

264
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,930
Oh, gosh.

265
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,643
It's a small bag that's about this big.

266
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,728
It's made of cloth. And the color is...

267
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,855
Oh, it's the same color as your shirt.

268
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,067
And it's covered with
white polka dots like this.

269
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,443
I see.

270
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,612
So it's this color, and covered with
white polka dots.

271
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,738
-Yes.
-Okay.

272
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,615
-If we find it,
-Yes.

273
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,991
we'll call you at home right away.

274
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,409
You can go home and wait.

275
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,827
Where do you live?

276
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,540
-Where do I live?
-Yes. Tell me your address.

277
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,461
-I don't have one.
-What?

278
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,255
I don't have a home.

279
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,091
Ma'am, is it because you don't
remember your address?

280
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,134
No. There is no house to remember.

281
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,844
How could I remember
when I don't have a house?

282
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,555
I'm telling you, I don't have
a house. I really mean it.

283
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,935
Then where did you live until now?

284
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,730
On the streets. I slept on the streets.

285
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,941
You know, like a homeless person
sleeping on the streets.

286
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,403
Well then... Ma'am.

287
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,571
May I scan your fingerprint?

288
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,199
If we scan your fingerprint, we can
find out your address right away.

289
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,368
-Hey.
-Gosh, my stomach!

290
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,663
-What's wrong?
-Where is the bathroom?

291
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,796
I told you I was fine. Why are you
still standing there?

292
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,132
What is that?

293
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,808
Before my parents find me,

294
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,228
I have to go as far away as possible.

295
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,316
I don't have my bag,
and I'm totally broke.

296
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,256
I smiled at him so nicely.
Why can't he just let me in?

297
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,763
I have to go to the sea,
but I don't have money.

298
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,813
I'm sorry, but I don't have money...

299
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,568
Right. Not a drop of oil is
produced in this country.

300
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,570
No taxi would give me a free ride,
I guess.

301
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,827
Ma'am. Where are you headed?

302
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,454
I don't have money.

303
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,956
Gosh. I don't have money either.

304
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,708
Where are you headed?

305
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,462
To the sea.

306
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,839
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

307
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,723
TAXI DRIVER CERTIFICATION, KIM BYUNG-SUB

308
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,354
I turned on the car seat warmer.
Do you feel warm?

309
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,772
Yes.

310
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,276
If my mother was still alive,

311
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,612
she'd be about your age.

312
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,616
What? How old was your mother?

313
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:25,120
When people asked her how old
she was at the hospital,

314
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,456
she answered Class 7-5 at that age.

315
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,668
Class 7-5? Does he mean 75?

316
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,713
You said she passed away. When was it?

317
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,925
Five years ago.

318
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,593
Five years ago?

319
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,847
Then 75 plus 5 is...

320
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,809
Does that mean that I look like I'm 80?

321
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,062
Oh, gosh.

322
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,023
You're even humorous, just like my mother.

323
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,486
Does this sound like humor to you?

324
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,909
I just said that because
you remind me of my mother.

325
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,955
She suffered all her life
before passing away.

326
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,333
Goodness, she was so unfortunate.

327
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,588
She was on her way from the
countryside to see my new house

328
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,465
and she went missing that day.

329
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,384
I found her at a shelter six months later.

330
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,553
I don't know what happened,

331
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,430
but she was practically half-dead.

332
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,641
She passed away at the hospital
after that.

333
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,730
I didn't even go to pick her up
to make money

334
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,107
and that's what I regret
the most in my life.

335
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,998
Ma'am?

336
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,501
Ma'am?

337
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,837
You shouldn't take on other passengers.

338
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,090
Ma'am, you were deep asleep.

339
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,635
I feel drowsy after eating...

340
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,055
Why am I at the police station again?

341
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,725
The driver said you seemed to be
lost, and brought you here.

342
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,649
-I'm telling you, I'm not lost.
-I see.

343
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:21,402
Mister! Mister 7-5!

344
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,862
I'm telling you.

345
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,114
Ma'am please give me your hand.

346
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,200
It will only take a second.

347
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,745
Gosh, you are really stubborn as a mule.

348
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,082
I've made all kinds of people talk
in my 30 years as a cop,

349
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,668
but I've never met anyone like you.

350
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,549
Thank you.

351
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,008
Goodness.

352
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,636
How could cops fool
an innocent civilian like this?

353
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,846
Thank you for your cooperation.

354
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,265
Ma'am, it's a new world these days,

355
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,141
we can search your address
using your fingerprint.

356
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,184
Please wait just a moment.

357
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,311
I'm telling you, I don't want you
to search it!

358
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,321
What is he doing here?

359
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,823
Did he come to interview someone?

360
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,450
I heard everything from the police station
in Jagok-dong.

361
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,328
I know you're going through a lot
with your recent loss.

362
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,873
I'd like to submit this.

363
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,128
REQUEST FOR COMPLAINT

364
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,170
I see.

365
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,299
It's difficult to punish someone
for making false accusations.

366
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,509
I heard it's your father.

367
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,638
It seems to me that instead of
punishing him,

368
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,557
you just want to give him trouble.

369
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,935
Is this perhaps a matter of money?

370
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,478
Forget it!

371
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,107
Ma'am, I think your fingerprint wasn't
scanned properly. Let's try it again.

372
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,318
I told you I really don't have a home!

373
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,737
Ma'am, lately there are a lot of
elders like you

374
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,157
who run away from home not to be
a nuisance to their families. Here.

375
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,076
She lives in my neighborhood.

376
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,706
-She does?
-Yes. Jagok-2 dong.

377
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,292
Can you please come this way?

378
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,716
Ma'am.

379
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,718
Do you know him?

380
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,054
Not at all.

381
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,430
She is from Jagok-2 dong.

382
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,350
I'm telling you.
I don't live in Jagok-2 dong.

383
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,227
You hit my head last time
at the snack bar.

384
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,271
You asked me what's bothering me so much.

385
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,326
You can't open the rear door
of a police car.

386
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,036
They have to open it for you from outside.

387
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,373
Ma'am, no!

388
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,087
Are you getting revenge on me

389
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,713
for smacking you on the head?

390
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,215
You are, right?

391
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,593
How petty.

392
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,270
You live in this neighborhood, right?

393
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,232
What is this place?

394
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,318
This is my first time
in this neighborhood.

395
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:14,242
Officer, please help me find my grandma.

396
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,286
My grandma's gone missing.

397
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,248
She's short,

398
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,544
and her eyes are...
Oh, they look like this lady's eyes.

399
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,422
Her hair is all white.

400
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,341
Did she dye her hair?

401
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,720
Goodbye.

402
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,806
Thanks.

403
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,434
Gosh.

404
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,603
All handsome guys are so obnoxious.

405
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,690
Hey, you took my underwear--

406
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,734
Right, ma'am?

407
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,819
It's breezy and comfortable in summer.

408
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,571
That brief brings me good luck.

409
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,615
As if! It's been proven to be useless.

410
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,869
I lost my bag, so you'll never find it.

411
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,664
What? I'll buy you a new one later on.

412
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,542
How could you try to take money
from your sister as soon as she's back?

413
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,669
I'm so exhausted

414
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,796
from running around all day.

415
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,970
-Get on my back.
-Are you crazy?

416
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,473
You said you're exhausted
from running around all day.

417
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,640
I'll carry you home.

418
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,976
KIM YEONG-SU

419
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,899
This is why you didn't grow taller.

420
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,525
Are you sure Mom and Dad don't know?

421
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,735
Gosh, you.

422
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,653
Why run away if you were going to worry
about them?

423
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,323
Did you think they'd be able to
sleep soundly without any worries,

424
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,866
if you ran away from home?

425
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,789
Your brain didn't develop
properly just like your height.

426
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,208
That's why you wrote this childish letter.
This stupid letter.

427
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,626
You were the one who took it?

428
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,586
I knew it. I couldn't find it anywhere.

429
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,837
-Give it back.
-No way.

430
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,465
If you don't do as I say,

431
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,801
I'm going to give this letter
to Mom and Dad. Understood?

432
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,637
What? Give it back!

433
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,722
Gosh, I'm hungry because I've been
running around all day.

434
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,682
Hey, go and make a bowl of ramyeon for me.

435
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,685
Whatever. I'm tired
because I've been out all day.

436
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,312
I'm going to get some sleep.

437
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,744
Gosh, poor me.

438
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,373
Hey, I won't eat it
if you burst the egg yolk.

439
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,126
Just eat whatever I give you
unless you want to see me

440
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,502
bursting something else.

441
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,838
-Mom...
-Gosh, okay. I heard you.

442
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,673
I'm making sure the egg yolk stays intact.

443
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,591
You see the yolk, right?

444
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,759
It better be delicious.

445
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,637
It's ready. Dig in.

446
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,849
PRINCE YEONG-SU TV, JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE

447
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,142
"HEATSTROKE" HAS ENTERED

448
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,143

449

"5-MINUTE PHLEGM"
"TOY CRANE" HAVE ENTERED

450
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,729
Ta-da.

451
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,274
Heatstroke promised me 1,000 candies
for this mission.

452
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,734
Finishing this ramyeon in a minute,
see it's piping hot, right?

453
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,902
It's really hot.

454
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,821
TIMER

455
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,198
I still have 13 seconds.

456
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,783
I'm really good at eating piping hot food.

457
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,285
You have to give me 1,000 candies.

458
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,749
That's how I'm going to eat this.

459
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,253
Start!

460
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,671
Gosh, it's so hot.

461
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,215
THIS IS GOING TO BE SUPER ENTERTAINING

462
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,967
I BET ALL MY MONEY,
HE'LL SPIT IT OUT RIGHT AWAY

463
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,135
WHY IS HE EVEN DOING THAT?

464
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,262
"HANSEL SAID SO" HAS ENTERED

465
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,890

467
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,309

What? He left the room?

469
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,858
Heatstroke left the room?

470
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,401
Hey! That piece of...

471
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,405
BEAUTY SALON

472
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,537
My gosh.

473
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,295
Mom, come sit over here.

474
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,616
Gosh. Oh, boy.

475
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,622
I'll just sit comfortably
since my knees are bad now.

476
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:37,171
I'm sorry about everything, Mom and Dad.

477
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:43,344
I've never done anything nice
for the two of you,

478
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,721
and I've aged overnight like this
on top of that

479
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,932
and ended up breaking your hearts.

480
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,644
I wanted to become a news anchor

481
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,980
so that I can clear our debt,

482
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,732
get a brand-new car for Dad,

483
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,236
and build a two-story building

484
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,446
so that Mom can move her salon there.

485
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,454
But as you can see,
I've ended up like this,

486
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,624
so I can no longer keep my promise.

487
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,918
Instead,

488
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,838
I can do laundry, cook, and clean.

489
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,798
I can help with housework.

490
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,509
I mean, I'm still mobile at least.

491
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,013
Also, Mom.

492
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,391
Can you come with me
to the hospital today?

493
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,768
Why? Are you feeling sick?

494
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,978
No.

495
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,732
I need to know how old I am at least.

496
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:43,195
MEDICAL EXAMINATION INFORMATION DESK

497
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,782
We won't get caught, right?

498
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,952
My aunt lives in the countryside,
so she can't even come here.

499
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,830
She's almost 80 though.
Do I look that old?

500
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,584
Yes, you do.

501
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,002
Are you really my mom?

502
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,670
Ms. Jeon Hye-rim.

503
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,922
Is there no Ms. Jeon Hye-rim?

504
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,467
Aren't you Ms. Jeon Hye-rim?

505
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,385
-No.
-Oh, right. That is her name.

506
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,970
Right, I'm Jeon Hye-rim.

507
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,055
Please come in.

508
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,057
Your aunt's name is Jeon Hye-rim?

509
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,391
Everyone has a pretty name but me.

510
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,810
I have the worst name ever.
Who names their daughter "Hye-ja"?

511
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,608
My gosh, ma'am.

512
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,527
Your biological age is a lot younger
than your actual age.

513
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,404
How old am I?

514
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,407
It says here that you're 78.
This information is correct, right?

515
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,742
Am I that old...

516
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,204
-Yes, it's correct.
-But your biological age

517
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,706
is only 65 according to the results.

518
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,708
Congratulations.

519
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,294
-How...
-Calm down.

520
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,420
I'm sorry.

521
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,550
I guess you were expecting it
to be lower than that, right?

522
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,761
Anything else?

523
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,430
Oh, anything else? Well, let's see.

524
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,101
Her liver is exceptionally healthy.

525
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,311
It's like a young man's liver.

526
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,479
How old?

527
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,315
I'd say 55.

528
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,693
Are you an infant
if a 55-year-old is a young man?

529
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,070
Are you a cell molecule or what?

530
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,738
Enough, calm down.

531
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,739
Let go.

532
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,242
He's saying you're young.
What's the problem? What's with you?

533
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,035
I said, let go.

534
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,870
Then you'll go back in
and grab him by the collar.

535
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,748
No, I have a question for him.
I'm serious.

536
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,375
-Really?
-Yes.

537
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,626
You won't grab him by the collar?

538
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,627
I won't.

539
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,213
Doctor, what about menopause?

540
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,091
Let's go.

541
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,387
Record everything accurately.

542
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,347
Why do you suddenly want to exercise?

543
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,684
I need to know what I can or can't do.

544
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,270
-All right.
-Two, three.

545
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,197
Write down. I'm already short of breath.

546
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,657
SHORTNESS OF BREATH AFTER 5 STEPS

547
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,542
My knees keep making a clunking noise.

548
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,877
CLUNKING KNEES AFTER 10 STEPS

549
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,713
I'll run from here to there.
Measure how many seconds I take.

550
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,381
Ready.

551
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,258
Go!

552
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,471
I can't run.

553
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:17,057
RUNNING: CAN'T DO

554
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,358
Everything looks great on you.

555
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,986
-We'll take this one.
-Sure.

556
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,989
Pick one. Don't worry.

557
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,409
You got a new job. Pick one.

558
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,702
You already bought me a suit.

559
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,830
When you wear a suit,
you need a watch too. Look here.

560
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,540
What about this one?

561
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,669
Hey, I think the first one is the best.

562
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,675
This isn't an easy decision for me,

563
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,844
but I'll grant you an opportunity
to change things.

564
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,721
The opportunity to turn back time.

565
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,056
Thank you.

566
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,850
I think that's what I wanted to hear.

567
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,944
Cheers.

568
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,581
When we were climbing up here,

569
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,750
I just thought the area was filthy.

570
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,045
But the view here is just fantastic.

571
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,133
All my life,

572
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,845
I've moved around a lot.

573
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,434
So I didn't know what it was like
to be attached to an area.

574
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,605
To be attached to an area,

575
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,108
not even a person?

576
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,654
But...

577
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,867
I've become attached to this area.

578
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,998
Someone who understands me...

579
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,586
lives nearby.

580
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,007
And that's enough to comfort me.

581
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,638
I never felt that way before I moved here.

582
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,938
Cheer up, you brat.
Look at this amazing view.

583
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,108
A bright future awaits you. Let's drink.

584
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,789
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

585
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,127
You're up.

586
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,338
I wake up early these days.

587
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,548
I couldn't seem to go back to sleep.

588
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,093
Okay. Thank you.

589
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,144
Gosh, my back.

590
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,147
My back is killing me.

591
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,907
Dad, I couldn't seem
to get the shampoo foam

592
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,909
no matter how many times I pumped.

593
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,827
Turns out, it was conditioner.

594
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,705
My goodness. I can't believe it.

595
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,085
But there's one good thing.

596
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,837
It doesn't take long to dry my hair.

597
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,964
I must have less hair now that I'm old.

598
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,556
Let's step out for a moment.

599
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,518
Where are we going?

600
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,603
ONLY 4 DISTRICTS ATTRACT PEOPLE IN 30S

601
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,773
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THEIR 30S
DECREASED BY MORE THAN 10 PERCENT

602
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,900
This is how you're supposed to see?

603
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,236
-Don't they make you dizzy?
-Not at all.

604
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,365
I can even read these small texts.
Unbelievable.

605
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,327
Can I get another frame, though?

606
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,621
It'd make me look old.

607
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,833
-Well...
-Ask him.

608
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,711
-Can I get another frame?
-Yes, you can.

609
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,174
-This...
-That one.

610
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,384
Yes, that one.

611
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,222
They're ready now.
Let me just wipe them first.

612
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,154
Dad, are you sad?

613
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:42,865
What?

614
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,534
I don't mind wearing glasses.

615
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,620
Isn't it supposed to make you
look intelligent?

616
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,249
You're right.

617
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,338
Am I a stranger to you?

618
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:05,220
You don't talk to me
or laugh with me anymore.

619
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,475
I'm a stranger to myself too.

620
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:13,395
I'm surprised every morning
when I look in the mirror.

621
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,442
I should have been nicer to you.

622
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,992
But I've decided to accept this.

623
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,502
I had to go through this to get back

624
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,171
something precious to me.

625
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,594
I think it was worth it.

626
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,890
"Something precious"?

627
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,309
What is it?

628
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,688
It's a secret.

629
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,858
Your glasses are ready.

630
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,444
Okay.

631
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,547
You're not driving a taxi anymore,
are you?

632
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,719
I work as a janitor now.

633
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,974
Why couldn't you wait
until your legs fully recover?

634
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,770
I'm fine.

635
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,440
That's why I'm working.

636
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,610
Are you sure you're fine?

637
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,282
Continue to see your doctor.

638
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,536
Okay.

639
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,585
I'm so happy you got a new job.

640
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,796
-Stop by sometimes.
-Thank you for everything.

641
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,674
Finish your drink before you leave.

642
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,925
Okay.

643
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,386
Hi.

644
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,849
It's me.

645
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,520
Oh, my. Did you get plastic surgery?

646
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,440
If I did, why would I be wearing this?

647
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,860
-I'm stopping by at Hye-ja's place.
-Why?

648
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,029
She's on a trip
so you won't be able to see...

649
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,699
You want to see Yeong-su?

650
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,826
Gosh. Hey.

651
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,370
Do you seriously believe
she just went on a trip like that?

652
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,456
Without saying anything to us?

653
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,459
Something doesn't feel right.

654
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,628
I'm sure something happened.

655
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,762
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

656
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,307
Gosh.

657
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,185
You don't have to do that.
You must be tired.

658
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,937
Don't worry. I'm okay.

659
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,021
Try it.

660
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,443
It tastes good, right?

661
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,070
Yes, it tastes good.

662
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,614
It seems like I've become a better cook
with age.

663
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,783
I've never made it before,
but it still tastes so good.

664
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,745
Yes, this is it.

665
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,415
Hey, Yeong-su!

666
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,667
Come and eat!

667
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,377
I'm your older brother.

668
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,337
"Hey, Yeong-su"?

669
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,510
My respect for elders saved you.

670
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,012
-I'm very grateful.
-Stop it, you brats.

671
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:18,974
Let me see.

672
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,809
Dad, is that you?

673
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,102
Dad?

674
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,665
It doesn't taste good? Mom liked it.

675
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,835
-It tastes good.
-Right?

676
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,004
-I should have become a cook.
-Come on.

677
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,714
You should put pork in kimchi stew,

678
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:51,882
not fish cakes.

679
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,050
It tastes perfectly fine.
Don't eat it if you don't like it.

680
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,427
I'm still going to eat it.

681
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,513
Can you get me some water?

682
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,475
I'll get it.

683
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,775
Eat slowly.

684
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,781
Dad, you should eat a lot
for your legs to recover fast.

685
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,825
Also, don't forget to take
your medicine after your meal.

686
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,955
I have a night shift today.

687
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,625
I forgot.

688
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,460
Goodness.

689
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,754
Go on ahead. I'm feeling a bit tired,

690
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,631
so I'll go to bed first.

691
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,909
Dad, wait.

692
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,043
You might get hungry at night.

693
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:19,970
Go to sleep.

694
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,976
Let's go, Dad!

695
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,663
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

696
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,041
I'll go get some hair treatment for you.

697
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,167
Okay.

698
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,547
What are you doing here?

699
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,516
Is she your daughter?

700
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,561
What?

701
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,397
I mean, is Ms. Lee your daughter?

702
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,690
No, I'm not.

703
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,861
I'm her aunt.

704
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,948
I knew it. You two look alike.

705
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,284
There's a familiar feeling
coming from you two.

706
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,660
Are you visiting?

707
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,203
I just dropped by.

708
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,455
Where do you live?

709
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,582
Why are you asking that for?

710
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,334
I live in Brazil.

711
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,543
Brazil?

712
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,879
You came from far away.

713
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,759
Do I have to wait long?

714
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:41,885
No, come sit down.

715
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,262
-Can I get a perm?
-Sure.

716
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,222
-How much is it?
-It's 20,000 won.

717
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,475
The neighborhood near here
charges 15,000 won.

718
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,893
How about for 15,000 won?

719
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,770
Gosh, Ma'am.

720
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,730
-I can barely buy materials.
-Come on.

721
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,149
You shouldn't do business like that
in such a small neighborhood.

722
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:59,653
Then go to that neighborhood
and get it done for 15,000 won.

723
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,697
If you can't even buy materials,

724
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,700
do the other cheap beauty salons
run on a deficit or something?

725
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,535
That doesn't make sense.

726
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,663
Do you think perms are done
with only hair chemicals?

727
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,791
With big hair rods, you can curl
your hair in no time.

728
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,668
But do you know how much your wrists hurt

729
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,711
when you use small hair rods?

730
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,839
And everyone asks for a perm
that won't loosen up.

731
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,342
How could a perm not loosen up?

732
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,679
If that was possible, every
hair salon will go out of business.

733
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,641
Even chicken that goes into
your mouth costs 20,000 won lately.

734
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,892
During the whole perm process,

735
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,103
a person has to stand and
do this with her hands.

736
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,981
You can't say 20,000 won is expensive.

737
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,692
Still, this is a small neighborhood...

738
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,276
This is how we do business here.

739
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,696
If you don't like it, go there
and do it for 15,000 won.

740
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,864
How about a squid ink jet black color?

741
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:45,991
Okay.

742
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,673
Gosh, you have such a loud
and clear voice.

743
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,425
That was truly something.

744
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,592
I know.

745
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,345
You must've made a nice living
with that voice of yours.

746
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,015
Of course. I used to be a news anchor.

747
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:15,395
I knew it. That voice of yours
is no ordinary voice at all.

748
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,106
You're such an eloquent speaker.

749
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,449
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

750
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,539
I need to get some sun.

751
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:40,879
Are you leaving?

752
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,340
When you come tomorrow,
bring some fried dumplings.

753
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,760
I can eat cold or left-over dumplings too.

754
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,887
Why are you so surprised?

755
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,640
Are you wearing that helmet
hoping I won't recognize you?

756
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,601
Come on.

757
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,020
How could I not recognize you?

758
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:58,605
Don't forget the fried dumplings.

759
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,864
Darn it.

760
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,576
How did that loser know it was me?

761
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,922
Shoot.

762
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,594
I have a cramp.

763
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,347
Hye-ja, pull my foot.

764
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,390
It hurts so bad.

765
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,434
What do you think your hands are for?

766
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,645
What an idiot.

767
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,649
Hyeon-ju dropped by earlier.

768
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,776
I think she came to see
what you were doing.

769
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,071
She won't believe you suddenly went
on a trip. It's ridiculous.

770
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,740
Then go explain to her so
it won't sound ridiculous then.

771
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,242
I'll tell her.

772
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,288
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

773
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,875
Are you saying Hye-ja
might not have gone on a trip?

774
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,795
I'm saying, let's go check
if it's true or not.

775
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,631
So you mean you want me to ask
where she went?

776
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,259
It's not that, you moron!

777
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,885
I'll do the asking.

778
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,513
You can pretend to go to the bathroom

779
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,722
and go to Hye-ja's room.

780
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,433
She might be confined in there
or something.

781
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,601
Why would she be confined?

782
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,895
I'm just saying, anything is possible.

783
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,397
Hey.

784
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,946
You know the structure
of that house well, right?

785
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,823
While I distract her family...

786
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,298
That's how

787
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,842
I became like this.

788
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,804
Isn't it awkward?

789
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,852
Hye-ja...

790
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,689
Hye-ja, what happened to you?

791
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,864
I thought you did something terrible

792
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,949
and got trapped in here
with your head shaved clean.

793
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,744
Ma'am.

794
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,456
Can't you guys sit comfortably?

795
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,753
Can we?

796
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,798
What's wrong?
I already explained everything.

797
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,509
Are you going to make me
uncomfortable too?

798
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,470
I know, but I have no idea
how to react to this.

799
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,388
Well, I can't even accept this either.

800
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,015
I can't imagine how you must feel.

801
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,393
Do you want to sit?

802
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,563
It would've been better
if I got my head shaved instead.

803
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,732
I can just grow my hair back.

804
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,276
Does your hair stop growing if you're old?

805
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,653
That's absurd!

806
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:06,000
That's the most polite gesture
I've ever seen you make.

807
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,546
It's strange. I can't help
acting like this. Sorry.

808
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,048
Hey. I heard true friends
shouldn't feel sorry

809
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,800
to each other about anything.

810
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,510
We're friends.

811
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,011
Yes, friends.

812
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,388
Friends!

813
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:26,271
Well, I've never been treated
like this in my life.

814
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,772
It's not that bad.

815
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,069
You should come over
during the day next time.

816
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,780
I can barely stay awake
after the sun sets.

817
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,032
I guess I really am old.

818
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,911
What are you crying for?

819
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,288
Why are you crying?

820
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,373
I'm always like this 24 hours a day.

821
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:46,958
I even wake up early in the morning.

822
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,293
Stop overreacting.

823
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,296
I never imagined it was you
the elderly women were talking about.

824
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,380
Already talked about me?

825
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,216
some old lady was at the beauty salon
and she was really feisty.

826
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,217
What did you do?

827
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,261
They kept asking about me

828
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,554
so I lied a little bit.

829
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,222
Actually, it's not even a lie.

830
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,809
I might've become a news anchor
during the times that I missed.

831
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,311
You lied you used to be a news anchor?

832
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,855
They kept complimenting
that I had a nice voice.

833
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,524
They also asked about my children.

834
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,985
What do I know about raising children?

835
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:16,904
So I just said I have a son
and grand kids,

836
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,741
but I lied and said they live in Brazil.

837
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:20,825
And they believed you?

838
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,785
That's how this neighborhood is.

839
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,829
People believe whatever you tell them.

840
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,041
But I must say,

841
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,754
what happened to me is the most
unbelievable story of them all.

842
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,928
Why do you keep crying?
You're really annoying me today.

843
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:52,523
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

844
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,909
My mom... I mean, my boss is still in bed.

845
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,535
I'm not here to see her.

846
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,041
I went to the jeweler's shop
hoping to sell this,

847
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:13,836
but the owner gave me a 10,000 won
bill and told me to leave.

848
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,463
Was it 10,000 won?

849
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,298
This looks quite expensive.

850
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,717
Maybe he didn't take me seriously
because I'm shabbily dressed.

851
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,013
So I was just wondering
if you could come with me.

852
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,473
Me?

853
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,433
I know it's a lot to ask.

854
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,770
But from what I saw yesterday,
I know that you're very eloquent.

855
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,482
Just a moment, then. I'll get ready
and meet you out here.

856
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,614
I guess you got a job.

857
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,491
You look dashing. You found a job, right?

858
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,452
I live with the lady
who owns the hair salon over there.

859
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,704
Happy Beauty Salon.

860
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,917
Yes, you remember me, right?
I'm sure you do.

861
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,753
You must want to ask about Kim Hye-ja.
You do, right?

862
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:00,925
Oh, no.

863
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,847
That punk.

864
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,017
Hey.

865
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,397
How could he not recognize me
just because I've aged a little?

866
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:19,277
He and I share so many memories together.

867
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:23,573
Does he want to erase
all the memories of this place

868
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:24,782
now that he's moved on?

869
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,410
You see,

870
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,705
I mentioned my mom's salon to him,

871
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,584
but he didn't ask about me at all.

872
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,549
Why does it make me so sad?

873
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:46,471
We weren't close to the point
that I should be drinking and crying now.

874
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,725
Does this mean

875
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,060
I liked him a lot?

876
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,563
Is that it?

877
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,025

SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK SU-YOUNG
AND SIM HEE-SEOB

881
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,664
I saw a dog
that looks exactly like Bappul.

882
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:39,417
She ran away over a month ago.
Why would she be there?

883
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,835
Do you have proof that it's your dog?

884
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,169
Do you have proof that it isn't?

885
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,964
I'll give you the dog if you bring
something to prove that it's yours.

886
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,091
-"Something to prove that it's mine"?
-Yes.

887
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,760
You have to give me 60,000 won
for the 10 bowls of jjajangmyeon.

888
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,804
I haven't removed the wrap on these.
Can I return them?

889
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,639
I worked so hard to make them.

890
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:57,018
Wait! What about me?

891
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,688
You'd better give me the insurance
payout while I'm being nice.

892
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,607
Try to remember.

893
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,609
-You saw me here too.
-I saw you here?

894
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:05,735
Don't be surprised.

895
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:08,195
I'm Hye-ja.

896
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,282
