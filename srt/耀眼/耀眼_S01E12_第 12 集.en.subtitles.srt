1
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,623
Ma'am! Are you all right?

2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,796
HYOJA NURSING HOSPITAL
WE PROVIDE FULL DAY CARE

3
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,799
I always watch that. Isn't it fun?

4
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,221
There was a commotion last night.

5
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,390
A watch?

6
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,352
There was a problem a few months ago
because of that watch too.

7
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,815
Patients tend to show violent
behavior sometimes,

8
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,568
but she never acted that way before.

9
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,906
By any chance, does she have any
traumatic experience

10
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,742
or specific memory that may be
related to that watch?

11
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,787
I've never bought anything from
a home shopping channel.

12
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,789
Me neither.

13
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,416
-Hello.
-You're here.

14
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,126
What about work?

15
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,254
I have a night shift tonight.

16
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,882
I see.

17
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,551
It must be tiring.

18
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:40,391
My mother is suffering from
Alzheimer's disease.

19
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,771
Oh, my. Are you okay?

20
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,898
Leave him. Let him get up on his own.

21
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,403
Get up.

22
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,697
You can get up alone.

23
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,908
Mom.

24
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,785
If you can't even get up on your own,

25
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,286
how will you live your life?

26
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,788
Get up.

27
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,256
Mom.

28
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,434
Mom!

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,732
There's a new caregiver
who has just started working.

30
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,445
She is working very hard.

31
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,740
Who?

32
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,576
You didn't see her?

33
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,289
She has a round face,
and seems like a warm person.

34
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,375
She said she's a hairstylist.

35
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,086
She brushed my hair yesterday.

36
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,754
She's quite good at it.

37
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,716
Who are you talking...

38
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,641
I'm afraid she doesn't remember my wife.

39
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,478
Her symptom will only get worse
as time passes.

40
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,689
Still, I recommend you to play along.

41
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,775
That's better than
making her emotionally stirred.

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,446
You're home.

43
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,740
Is Mother asleep?

44
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,327
What is all that?

45
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,745
That's for Father's memorial ceremony.

46
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,247
The day has come near, you know.

47
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,958
I need to buy these stuffs when I can

48
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,377
so I have time to visit Mother.

49
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,212
You're going to do it this year?

50
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,506
With Mother in that state?

51
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,551
What does that have to do with
the memorial ceremony for Father?

52
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,678
I can manage alone because
I've done this before.

53
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,514
I'll take care of it.

54
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,402
Sang-yong.

55
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,404
Dad!

56
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,864
Did you have fun?

57
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,283
Yes.

58
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,550
Dae-sang.

59
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,735
Hey, cripple!

60
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,279
-Limper!
-Hey, I heard you have a robot leg.

61
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,489
Can you fight as well as
Robot Taekwon V does?

62
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,409
Hey, let's fight!

63
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,578
-Come at us.
-Hey.

64
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,748
BEAUTY SALON

65
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,542
-To drop it off?
-Yes.

66
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,505
-Mom.
-What are we doing today?

67
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,590
-I need a haircut.
-Oh, okay.

68
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,341
Ma'am, please wait just a moment
over there.

69
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,801
Have a seat here.

70
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,356
Wake up. It's 8 a.m.

71
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,816
Eat breakfast and go to school.

72
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,651
I'm sick.

73
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,403
I can't go to school today.

74
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,822
Come on. You have to go to school
even if you're feeling sick.

75
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,455
Get up.

76
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,583
If you're late one more time,
you'll have to clean the washrooms.

77
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,879
It's the field day.

78
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,256
So what?

79
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,675
You can't go because you're embarrassed?

80
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,594
Then live alone in hiding all your life.

81
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,806
Don't go to school. Don't even
go out for the rest of your life.

82
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,685
-Hye-ja!
-Yes, I'm coming!

83
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,983
-Thank you so much.
-Gosh, don't mention it.

84
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,319
I'm just giving you clothes
that no longer fit my boys.

85
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,197
Isn't it still better
than buying used clothes?

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,783
They make you wary because you have
no idea who used to wear them.

87
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,284
Yes, exactly.

88
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,703
-You want your hair styled again?
-Yes.

89
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,955
All right, please take a seat.

90
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,834
Give me a moment, okay?

91
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,675
This part already looks good,
so I'll fix the bottom for you.

92
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,678
I'm going to school.

93
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,723
-You can style your hair very well.
-Gosh, thank you.

94
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,143
Going to school must be stressful for you.

95
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,936
Walk properly, will you?

96
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,439
Hey, look at me.

97
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,316
What? You can't even look?
Get it together.

98
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,818
Seriously.

99
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,903
You stupid cripple.

100
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,211
After that, other kids at school
stopped making fun of me,

101
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,714
and they didn't even come
anywhere near me.

102
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,300
Whether I was home or elsewhere,

103
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,887
I was always completely alone.

104
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,640
Fish cakes, again?

105
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,601
Don't eat it if you don't want to.

106
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,519
Can't you put in some pork?

107
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,356
-All other families put--
-Live with them. I won't stop you.

108
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,320
You hate me, don't you?

109
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,115
I'm a nuisance to you, right?

110
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,658
I'll put it away if you're not eating.

111
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,453
Mom.

112
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,748
You want me to just die, don't you?

113
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,045
-Don't you pity me?
-Does pity give you food to eat?

114
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,796
Does it give you money?

115
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,798
Then I'll say I pity you.

116
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,138
Wash the dishes after you're done.

117
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,236
I'm not sure if it was
because of my injured leg

118
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,447
or because of my resentment toward my mom.

119
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,285
But even after that, my teen years
felt excruciatingly long

120
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,079
and tough.

121
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:02,416
Dad, I'm sorry. Dad.

122
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,878
Dad, I'm so sorry.

123
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,423
Dad... I'm sorry.

124
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,259
Dad...

125
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,896
ALARM

126
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,555
Oh, right. You said you have
a night shift today, right?

127
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,307
Sleep at home. It's cold here.

128
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,311
I'll visit Mother tomorrow
so that you can get some rest.

129
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,396
It's okay.

130
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,691
It's not okay. It's not easy
to put up with the cold weather.

131
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,818
Mom...

132
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,323
doesn't recognize you.

133
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,285
I know.

134
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,454
You knew?

135
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,832
It's fine. It's all good
because I recognize her.

136
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,461
See you later.

137
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,608
-What brings you here?
-I brought you a lunch box.

138
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,068
I'll eat it later.

139
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,694
Leaving out the anchovies again,
aren't you?

140
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,072
I'm not moving an inch until
you eat that, so suit yourself.

141
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,532
-How could you say something like that?
-Who are you to butt in?

142
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,702
I'm his mom. I'm this guard's mother.

143
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,789
If you're humiliated like this
in front of your mom by a stranger,

144
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,291
how would you feel? Tell me.

145
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,717
HYOJA NURSING HOSPITAL

146
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,605
What is it?

147
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,442
Are you wondering what
a fairy is doing here all alone?

148
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,570
How old are you?

149
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,496
Me?

150
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,707
How old do I look?

151
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,672
Your job must be tough.

152
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,967
I bet you have to put up
with so many fussy old people.

153
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,389
No, it's fine.

154
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,725
I think of them as my parents.

155
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,894
Where are your parents?

156
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,605
Both of them passed away a long time ago.

157
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:16,318
As for one of them,
all he cared about was drinking.

158
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,487
One day, he drank as usual

159
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,407
and drowned in a river on his way home.

160
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,077
And the other one suffered
from diabetes all her life--

161
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,579
I don't even need to hear anymore.

162
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,960
-But luckily, my in-laws are nice.
-Cut it out.

163
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,255
They're lucky to have
a daughter-in-law like you.

164
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,466
I can tell from your hands.

165
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,224
Do you really not recognize me?

166
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,943
Did you get your hair done
at my salon in the past?

167
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,620
That's my son.
You've never met him, right?

168
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,457
This is the caregiver I told you about.

169
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,172
KIM HYE-JA

170
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,757
There's only one piece left now.

171
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,592
What should you do with it?

172
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,476
Here, you can hold it.

173
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,106
It's missing a triangle.
This is a triangle, right?

174
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,067
Where should it go?

175
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,241
You see what's missing here. A triangle.

176
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,825
This is a triangle, right?

177
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,619
So where should you put this?

178
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,542
You can put it right here.

179
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,878
Just put it here. Why are you...

180
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,449
The caregiver.

181
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,161
It sounded like she's had a tough life,

182
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,873
and she said she was a hairstylist.

183
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,710
Is she

184
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,380
my daughter-in-law?

185
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:52,182
Will retrieving memories of the watch

186
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,310
be helpful?

187
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,566
I can't tell you for certain
how her memories of the watch

188
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,942
will affect her,

189
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,570
but I think it's worth trying.

ACCOUNT BOOK

191

HANMIN NEWSPAPER IS HONEST AND HARDWORKING

193
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,923
You guys are so lovey-dovey.

194
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,676
You make this single man feel lonely.

195
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,219
They just got married.

196
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,179
It won't last two years.
Just put up with it.

197
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,848
Ms. Kim, stop coming here. I feel jealous.

198
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,685
If I feel too jealous,
I might not let Jun-ha go home.

199
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,478
I'll take it down a notch.

200
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,688
Yes, please.

201
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,147
-Okay.
-See you.

202
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,899
See you tomorrow.

203
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,359
-Bye.
-Thank you for today.

204
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,443
Bye.

205
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,625
Honey, thank you for this month.

206
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,293
You said you'd take it down a notch.

207
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,587
What? It's not like I touched a stranger.

208
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,256
You're my husband.

209
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,716
Come on.

210
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,300
What should we eat?

211
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,469
Should we take your parents
somewhere nice?

212
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,723
I have an idea.

213
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,182
Follow me.

214
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,934
How expensive is it?

215
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,937
I'll get the most expensive dish.

216
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,188
Really?

217
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,982

219
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,320
Why didn't you get something nicer?

220
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,323
Nothing tastes better than this.

221
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,660
I'm having many bowls today
because you were paid.

222
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,871
On other days, I wouldn't dream of it.

223
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,499
Your taste really is...

224
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,584
Great, isn't it?

225
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,670
That's why I chose you.

226
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,297
I agree.

227
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,383
Bye.

228
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,430
Are you almost finished?

229
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,514
Yes.

230
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,684
It's curfew soon.

231
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,478
Really?

Don't forget your coat.

234
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,112
-Thank you.
-Bye.

235
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,572
-Goodnight.
-Bye.

00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,660
Let's hurry.

238
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,460
You're pretty high-maintenance,
aren't you?

239
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,629
Thank you for not leaving me here.

240
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,047
NAMDO LINEN SHOP

241
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,346
Let's go.

242
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,490
What's that face?

243
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,867
-What?
-What?

244
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,287
Come on.

245
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,458
Is that how you congratulate me?

246
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,087
Congratulations.

247
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,840
"Congratulations"?

248
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,592
It's our child.

249
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,804
Should I say thank you?

250
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,849
What?

251
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,351
Ta-da.

252
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,354
Hye-ja, eat up.
The stir-fried seafood is coming up.

253
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,522
Hey.

254
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,941
When I found out I'm pregnant,

255
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,819
I jumped for joy even though I was alone.

256
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,779
Why did he say "Thank you"?

257
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,449
And what's with "Congratulations"?

258
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,411
All men are like that.

259
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,829
Don't expect anything from them.

260
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,165
He must have been shy.

261
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,708
Men are like that.

262
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,753
Also, it probably didn't feel real.
Don't you think so?

263
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,338
I guess.

264
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,717
Then again, I can't believe it either.

265
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,928
It's still as small as a fingernail.

266
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,807
Having it in your tummy is way better.

267
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,226
Now my baby has to eat and poop.

268
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,853
It's driving me crazy.

269
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,315
So sit down. Stop moving around.

270
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,775
Should I? It's been a long time, Hye-ja.

271
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,445
Where is Yeong-su?

272
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,614
He's in the kitchen.

273
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,159
Dad wants to train him.

274
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,410
Did he get promoted?

275
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,871
It's nothing to be happy about.

276
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,714
Hey, Kim.

277
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,883
Try to do better.

278
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,718
They aren't equally thick.

279
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,512
"Hey, Kim"?

280
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,848
You little brat.

281
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,350
Do you know who I am?

282
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,478
I'll inherit this place
from my father-in-law soon.

283
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,771
You don't understand.

284
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,358
Didn't he tell you to treat me
with respect?

285
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,360
You want me to tell on you?

286
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,320
Please don't.

287
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,197
You're so immature.

288
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,785
Once I inherit this place,
I'll fire him first.

289
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,789
Hey. What's your name?

290
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,583
It's Lee Yeon-bok.

291
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,876
Lee Yeon-bok?

292
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,587
Lee Yeon-bok...

293
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,964
I'll remember it.

294
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,842
I have a feeling he'll become successful.

295
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,268
This onion is red.

296
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,686
Doesn't it hurt?

297
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,812
What?

298
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,486
Gosh.

299
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,656
KIM SEON-YOUNG MIDWIFERY CLINIC

300
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,658
All right. I'm sorry.

301
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,451
You're hungry?

302
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,578
I'm sorry. I'll hurry up.

303
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,998
It's okay. Mom is here.

304
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,749
Mom is here.

305
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,882
It's okay. Stop crying.

306
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,677
Keep an eye on Dae-sang.
I have to boil his diapers.

307
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,929
Take a break. Can't you do it tomorrow?

308
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,849
If I do it tomorrow,
what will he use in the meantime?

309
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,476
Keep an eye on him.

310
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,644
Okay.

311
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,650
You little brat, give your mom a break.

312
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,445
Fine. Stop crying. I'm sorry.

313
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,696
What do you want me to do?

314
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,412
What happened?

315
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,706
-What should I do?
-What's wrong?

316
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,624
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on him?

317
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,876
What is this?

318
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,422
Were you just looking at him?

319
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,549
You should have played with him

320
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,844
and made sure he didn't get hurt.
You're his dad.

321
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,429
And this is not the first time.

322
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,889
I'm sorry.

323
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,894
What is it?

324
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,772
You don't love him?

325
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,232
You have no affection for him?

326
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,692
To be honest,

327
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,655
I feel awkward around him.

328
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,368
I didn't get anything from my dad.

329
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,788
So I don't know how to love a child.

330
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,958
I'm also afraid I'll make a mistake.

331
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,587
I've never done this before either.

332
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,256
This is my first time too.

333
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,760
I've never been a mom before.

334
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,597
Let's do this.

335
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,934
Let's do our best

336
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,645
to be good parents.

337
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,739
Is this how you do it? Am I doing good?

338
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,533
Yes.

339
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,410
If you feel nervous, so will the baby.

340
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,664
Try washing his face now.

341
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,374
What if the water gets in his nose?

342
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,668
That's tough even for a grown-up.

343
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,171
Are you not going to wash
his face and hair ever?

344
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,589
He's not some dog in the neighborhood.

345
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,718
Just do it gently.
Splash a little water on his face.

346
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,845
Start from his cheeks.

347
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,932
No. Stop.

348
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,475
Stay still.

349
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,523
Isn't he adorable?

350
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,693
We're a family now.

351
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,929
-Did he fall asleep?
-Yes.

352
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,856
Thank you.

353
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,194
It feels like...

354
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,407
I'm just starting to solve
the problem that's been haunting me.

355
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,870
What did I do?

356
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,623
I didn't do anything.

357
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,920
I'm so proud of you.

358
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,591
Gosh.

359
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,844
I just came to see my grandson.

360
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,222
Go home. You seem drunk.

361
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,682
Goodness, this is upsetting.

362
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,101
Isn't it because you
didn't get the money you wanted?

363
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,190
How does it feel?

364
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,192
Now that you have your own child,

365
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,403
can you sympathize with
how I used to feel?

366
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,407
Yes. I wondered how a father with
a child could live like that.

367
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,993
My goodness. You're just like your mom.

368
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,288
I just can't get attached to you.

369
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,836
Now that you have a child and all,

370
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,506
I don't want to make matters worse for us.

371
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,759
I just came to patch things up peacefully.

372
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,763
No, like you said,
I am a father of a child

373
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,641
and the husband of a woman.

374
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,270
I will do anything I can
in order to protect my family.

375
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,897
And...

376
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,777
I might even do something bad.

377
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,573
Go home.

378
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,539
You little punk. My goodness.

379
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,460
That little punk. I can't believe it.

380
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,422
Darn it.

381
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,736
It's cold. Let's go inside.

382
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,880
Hello. I have a parcel for you.

383
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,611
Your hair seems too long.

384
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,822
Really? Well...

385
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,533
Not many people notice my back hair

386
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,702
and I have no one to show anyway.

387
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,496
You don't have a husband?

388
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,876
I do. But...

389
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,295
All husbands are like that.

390
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,507
You know what they say. Husbands are
always on someone else's side,

391
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,342
instead of my side.

392
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,763
I used to be a hairstylist
when I was young too.

393
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,766
Shall I trim your hair for you?

394
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,312
Sure.

395
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,709
HYOJA NURSING HOSPITAL

396
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,379
How do I look?

397
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,633
Mother trimmed my hair for me.
Doesn't it look nice?

398
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,802
It does.

399
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,692
-Why are you here again?
-I'm here to meet my friend. Why?

400
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,195
How is she?

401
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,656
She seems better today.

402
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,246
Hey. When we were young,

403
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,623
I was the prettiest among the three of us.

404
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,168
Is that why you married my brother?

405
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,795
Brothers always pick the prettiest girl

406
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,757
among their sister's friends
and hit on them.

407
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,760
I never imagined it.

408
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,473
You totally threw a fit whenever
Sang-eun mentioned my brother.

409
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,393
Hey. That fortune teller told me

410
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,439
that there would be three moments
when I was left with deep regret.

411
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,191
I thought about it.

412
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,361
The first was when I had a crush
on Yeong-su in middle school.

413
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,824
The second was when I dated him when
I was old enough to get married.

414
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,203
The third was when I got married to him.

415
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,247
Hey. Don't you think that
fortune teller was a genius?

416
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:56,461
Bappul used to bark all the time
whenever she saw you.

417
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,547
She liked Yeong-su so much
because she was a girl.

418
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,883
She knew it by instinct.

419
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,221
I didn't know that and always scolded her.

420
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,557
I remember Bappul.

421
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,268
-She was so adorable.
-Yes.

422
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,485
It feels like it all happened yesterday.

423
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,279
I know.

424
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,283
It feels like it happened
just a few days ago.

425
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,626
How is her appetite lately?

426
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,796
She always used to be skinny,
but she lost even more weight.

427
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,965
She's not eating as much as before.

428
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,676
My wife still takes good care of her.

429
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,554
I heard she doesn't recognize your wife.

430
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,806
No.

431
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,101
But I'm glad she still recognizes you.

432
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,481
By the way...

433
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,570
do you know any watch
that's related with my mom?

434
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,864
A watch? What watch?

435
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,157
It's just an ordinary watch.

436
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,246
Strangely, Mom keeps reacting sensitively
to an old man's watch.

437
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,750
Where's that man?

438
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,671
-Sorry?
-Wait. Is he still alive?

439
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,385
What day is it today?

440
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,597
Today? It's the 22nd.

441
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,436
Dae-sang, I'm off to work.

442
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,150
What? Did I forget anything?

443
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,319
You forgot the most important thing.

444
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,904
What is it? Let me see.

445
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,865
Before we got married, you always

446
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,201
were so keen about
my expression and words.

447
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,456
How could you become so slow-witted
after becoming a reporter?

448
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,587
I'm sorry. Today's your birthday.

449
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,923
-I'm sorry.
-It's our wedding anniversary.

450
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,551
I even caught you not remembering
my birthday.

451
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,802
Well...

452
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:14,849
It's just so hectic lately, because
of the story I'm covering.

453
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,351
I'm really sorry.

454
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,605
You might forget our address and get lost.

455
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,148
Shall we go out and eat tonight?

456
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,442
Make sure you come back home before
the restaurants close.

457
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,903
Okay. I'll make sure
I come home early today.

458
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,657
I always let you off with a warning,
but if you're late today,

459
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,159
I'll nail the door shut.

460
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,328
Okay, I hear you.

461
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,081
See you later.

462
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,208
Dae-sang, Daddy's going to work!

463
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,378
-Have a good day.
-I'll be home early.

464
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,726
I knew it.

465
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,788
It's cold.

466
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,593
Is he working late again?

467
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,516
Fine. Go ahead and write up
all the articles in this world.

468
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,829
What? He didn't come home again?

469
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,543
HANMIN NEWSPAPER IS HONEST AND HARDWORKING

470
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,468
Hye-ja, good morning.

471
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,846
Stop making him work so hard.

472
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,848
Where is Jun-ha?

473
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,392
Is he sleeping in the
night duty room again?

474
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,853
Jun-ha isn't back yet?

475
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,939
"Yet"?

476
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,401
Did he go somewhere?

477
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,654
To tell you the truth, yesterday,

478
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,823
officers from the government barged in

479
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,367
and arrested everyone from
our newspaper company.

480
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,787
Jun-ha and I were taken away too.

481
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,747
They took him?

482
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,250
I was released at dawn,
so I assumed he'd be back by now.

483
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,920
Say, "Daddy, hurry on home."

484
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,839
-"Daddy, hurry on home."
-Good.

485
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,634
There you go.

486
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,388
We reported a missing person to the
police, so they'll call us.

487
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,100
He might've been exhausted after
being investigated all night

488
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,644
and fell asleep at an inn or something.

489
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,896
Bang.

490
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,783
Do you need a hand with anything?

491
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,159
No, I'm almost done.

492
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,411
You should hurry.
Mother must be waiting for you.

493
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,622
Yes, I should get going.

494
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,209
She hasn't been eating much lately.

495
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,294
With the weather getting colder,
I'm really worried.

496
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,589
Take it easy.

497
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,886
For Mother, this may be
the last memorial ceremony.

498
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,765
I should do my best with the preparations.

499
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,811
I heard you haven't had
much of an appetite,

500
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,354
so I'm giving you this IV instead.

501
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,731
Yes, I know.

502
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,818
The fluid does contain many nutrients,

503
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,028
but it's obviously not as good
as eating a nutritious meal,

504
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,780
so please get your strength back soon

505
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,324
so that we can eat
something together, okay?

506
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,826
Okay.

507
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,126
Let's see how it goes.

508
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,628
She may recover, you know.

509
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,131
Okay.

510
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,984
Mom, watch Dae-sang for me.

511
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,320
Your dad went to the police station
to find out what's going on.

512
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,363
I have to go and find out myself.

513
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:43,201
REVITALIZATION REFORM
WILL MAKE NEW HISTORY

514
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,078
I just want to check and see
if my husband is here.

515
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,663
-Why can't I do that?
-It's not allowed.

516
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,499
Just let me in to make sure
that he's not here.

517
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,960
He's a newspaper journalist
named Lee Jun-ha.

518
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,671
He has a proper job and everything.
Why are you detaining him?

519
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,465
Lee Jun-ha?

520
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,467
From Hanmin Newspaper?

521
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,596
Yes, he's my husband.

522
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,181
Do you know if he's here?

523
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,683
Yes, we're investigating something.

524
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,018
Investigate what?

525
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,188
What did my husband do?

526
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,274
We'll investigate and find out
if he's done anything wrong.

527
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,567
Please leave.

528
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,571
You're detaining an innocent man
for no legitimate reason.

529
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,328
I heard you have a son.

530
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,665
If you don't want your son's future
to be ruined,

531
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,709
please just leave. Okay?

532
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,964
REPORT YOUR ILLEGAL FIREARMS

533
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,634
Yesterday, I heard another
newspaper's reporter got released,

534
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,970
so I met him and asked about Jun-ha.

535
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,763
What did he say?

536
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,348
Is Jun-ha okay?

537
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,226
The situation doesn't look good.

538
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,228
Why do you say that?

539
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,815
What on earth did Jun-ha do?

540
00:37:56,148 --> 00:38:00,194
Anyway, our chief editor said
that he'd put in a request,

541
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,321
so let's wait just a bit longer.

542
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,698
LEE JUN-HA

543
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,712
The chief editor implored them

544
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,382
to at least let his family see him.

545
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,386
You should mentally prepare yourself
before you go see him.

546
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,226
ERADICATE COMMUNISTS AND SPIES

547
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,280
Honey.

548
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,118
REFLECT ON YOUR CONDUCT
FOR SELF-REALIZATION AND INTEGRITY

549
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,332
What are you doing here? Go home.

550
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:56,917
Why...

551
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,920
Why do you have to be here?

552
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,924
What happened to your face?

553
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,762
Did they hit you?

554
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,765
There must've been a misunderstanding.

555
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,267
I'll be released soon,
so just go home and wait.

556
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,149
What did my husband do?
Why did you hit him?

557
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,401
Did he steal something?

558
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,903
Or did he kill someone?

559
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,614
Why on earth did you hit him?

560
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,532
See your husband

561
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,910
and leave quietly
if that's what you came here for.

562
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,871
Hye-ja, I'm okay.

563
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,500
Why must you be here
when you did nothing wrong?

564
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,378
Don't cry.
I'll be released. I'll get out soon.

565
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,338
No, get out of there now.

566
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,299
Come on. Get out of there right now!

567
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,802
Hye-ja, I'll get out soon.

568
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,391
Take good care of Dae-sang
until I get out.

569
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,560
No, let's go home together.
Let's go see Dae-sang together.

570
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,437
I'm not leaving.

571
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,273
We have to go home together
no matter what.

572
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,285
LEE JUN-HA

573
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,182
Mom!

574
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,309
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

575
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,815
NOTICE OF DEATH

576
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,249
He exhibited symptoms of pneumonia
during the investigation.

577
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,918
We transferred him to the hospital
right away and got him treated.

578
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,671
I'm sorry for your loss.
Please accept my condolences.

579
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,592
How could this...

580
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,262
How could something like this happen?

581
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,681
We are also sad about what happened.

582
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,642
Here, these are his belongings.

583
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,205
His watch isn't here.

584
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,457
Jun-ha's watch...

585
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,917
His watch is gone.

586
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,502
-Dad.
-His watch?

587
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,796
Dad, Jun-ha's watch isn't here.

588
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,340
There's no watch on this list.

589
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,591
That's impossible.

590
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,761
He wore it all the time.

591
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,472
-Good grief.
-His watch is gone!

592
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,932
Maybe he got it stolen...

593
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,392
before he was brought to our station.

594
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,978
Don't cause a scene here, please.
Go file a report.

595
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,522
How dare you raise a ruckus here.

596
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,732
You explain this.

597
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,150
What did you do to Jun-ha?

598
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,985
-What's with this woman?
-What did you do to him?

599
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,695
-Let go!
-Please calm down.

600
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,864
The watch.

601
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,741
This watch.

602
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,576
-This...
-Let go!

603
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,787
It is his. It's my husband's watch!

604
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,748
Why would I wear
a dead man's watch? Nonsense.

605
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,291
-Officer Park.
-You killed him.

606
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,876
You beat him up to death!

607
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,044
Gosh. Get her out of here!

608
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,712
-No. Give it back.
-Gosh, Hye-ja.

609
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,630
-Let go!
-Calm down.

610
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,257
-Hye-ja, calm down.
-I must get it back.

611
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,633
-Drag her out!
-Dad, I must...

612
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,426
-Hye-ja.
-Dad.

613
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,678
-No!
-Drag her out.

614
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,346
No, that watch...

615
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,807
-It's Jun-ha's watch!
-Let's go.

616
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,600
-Darn it.
-Dad...

617
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,727
-Please help me get it back!
-Why are you being like this?

618
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,021
-Come on! Let's go.
-Dad...

619
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,690
-You have to leave.
-Come on!

620
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:57,449
HYOJA NURSING HOSPITAL

621
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,257
Excuse me. Well...

622
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,009
Can I help you?

623
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,178
I kept telling him
that this isn't allowed,

624
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,430
but he stubbornly insisted.

625
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,724
Does your mother know him?

626
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,103
I'm not sure.

627
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,317
We should let him see her
since he's already here.

628
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,484
Sure.

629
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,389
I'm sorry.

630
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,586
I've always thought

631
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,215
that my life was blighted by misfortunes.

632
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,761
I thought it was unfair.

633
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,268
But looking back now,

634
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,439
I'm realizing that all my memories,
from the ones

635
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,900
of our happy moments together
to the unhappy ones...

636
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:42,406
All the memories of my past
have enabled me

637
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,784
to hold out until now.

638
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,165
-Grandma.
-Yes?

639
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:55,169
Every time I see pictures of him,
I think my grandpa is so handsome.

640
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,546
Why didn't I take after him?

641
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,633
You're handsome too.

642
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,677
Thinking

643
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,764
that I might lose those memories

644
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,351
terrifies me even more.

645
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,398
What's more terrifying
than the day you died

646
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,692
is the thought that I might

647
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:24,364
forget you.

648
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,578
It's hard to bear.

649
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,247
Maybe we should have used another picture.

650
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,540
Why?

651
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:38,170
Father will always remain
young and beautiful.

652
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,881
Thank you for all the work.

653
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,550
Give a bow.

654
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,177
Mother must be tired.

655
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,513
-Min-su.
-Yes.

656
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,162
Grandma, do you want to
say something to Grandpa?

657
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,588
You don't have to give a bow.

658
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,674
Okay.

659
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,562
Time passes by,

660
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,649
but you never

661
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,859
age.

662
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,531
You look beautiful.

663
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,326
How are you doing there?

664
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,873
You never visit me in my dreams.

665
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,253
I'm sure you're doing very well.

666
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,634
Do you remember the watch
you loved so much?

667
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:12,639
I wanted to get it back, but I gave up.

668
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,392
Are you disappointed?

669
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,187
I'm sorry

670
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,733
for not getting the watch back.

671
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,570
And...

672
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:33,619
I'm sorry I let you go alone...

673
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,499
after being lonely...

674
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,169
all your life.

675
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,008
I'm sorry I let you go alone...

676
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,262
after being lonely all your life.

677
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:37,849
I think it'll pour soon.

678
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,520
My knees ache.

679
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,167
It's going to snow all night.

680
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,712
Let's sweep the snow before it piles up.

681
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,213
Okay.

682
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,882
By the way, how is your mother doing?

683
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,223
Anyway, make sure
the snow doesn't pile up. Otherwise,

684
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,684
-the residents will complain.
-Okay.

685
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,519
Well... It's slippery today.

686
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,354
-Be careful.
-Okay.

687
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,590
Hello.

688
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,676
What?

689
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,685
She is not in her room.
We can't find her anywhere.

690
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,313
I took her temperature a moment ago.

691
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,190
What about outside?
Could she have gone out?

692
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,526
Some nurses are looking for her outside.

693
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,194
-Okay.
-All right.

694
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,085
What are you doing right now?

695
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,628
Gosh, you startled me.

696
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,340
I'm sweeping the snow.

697
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,139
It's snowing.

698
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,642
My son can't walk well.

699
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,938
He has to go to school,
and it'll be too slippery.

700
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,070
If you can't even get up on your own,
how will you live your life?

701
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,656
-It's the field day.
-You can't go because you're embarrassed?

702
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,366
Then live alone in hiding all your life.

703
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,507
Your son...

704
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,724
won't know.

705
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,603
It doesn't matter.

706
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,149
As long as he doesn't slip.

707
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,086
You must be cold.

708
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,489
You can stop sweeping now.

709
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,784
No.

710
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,370
It's still snowing.

711
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,335
Your son...

712
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,094
never fell down.

713
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,393
Even on snowy days,

714
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,480
he never...

715
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,527
fell down, not even once.

716
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,449
Really?

717
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,201
I'm so glad.

718
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,666
Why are you crying?

719
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,252
Oh, no. Don't cry.

720
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,173
It's cold. What are you doing outside?

721
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,758
-Goodness.
-Here.

722
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,635
-Go inside.
-Don't cry.

723
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,722
-Why do you keep crying?
-Sit down.

724
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,016
It's cold.

725
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,102
Let's go.

726
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,369
Honey.

727
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,635
It was Mom.

728
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,268
The person who swept the snow
all this time.

729
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,818
It was Mom.

730
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,285
Go on and cry.

731
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,455
It's okay to cry.

732
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,625
Don't hold it in and just cry.

733
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,663
KIM HYE-JA

734
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,724
It's your first time

735
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,685
looking at Mother

736
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,520
with such a warm face.

737
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,529
For my whole life,

738
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,784
my leg that constrained her life
like a shackle

739
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,871
and my life are

740
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,418
all gone from Mom's memory now.

741
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,383
I can't get angry at her anymore.

742
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,689
Hurry up and call her family.

743
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,941
Yes, sir.

744
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,539
Mom.

745
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:05,959
Mom.

746
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:13,716
Mom.

747
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,261
Mom.

748
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,567
Dad.

749
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,361
It's okay.

750
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,488
You went through so much all this time

751
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:36,864
since your mother was sick.

752
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,534
You can rest now.

753
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,620
I'm glad she left.

754
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,290
She should've gone faster.

755
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,208
I'm glad she has left now.

756
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,754
Now, I can

757
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,215
live more comfortably.

758
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,219
Do you know how hard it has been
to take care of that old lady?

759
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,763
Gosh, I'm sick and tired of it.

760
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,683
Now that she's gone,

761
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,144
I can do things that I want to do

762
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,271
and live more comfortably.

763
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,566
What about Ji-yun?

764
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,110
Did you send her to school
before coming here?

765
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,111
Yes.

766
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,532
Oh, here you are.

767
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,160
-Are you her daughter?
-Yes.

768
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,870
-Can we talk in the office?
-Okay.

769
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,605
YOON HYEON-SOOK

770
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,375
I experience it all the time,

771
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,378
but I never get used to it.

772
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,633
How could you get used to death?

773
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:50,349
Every time one passes away,
the others get so depressed.

774
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,352
I don't know what we should do for them.

775
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,359
What should we do?

776
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,864
Don't cry.

777
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,741
You're a man.

778
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,035
You look so terrifying

779
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,370
but you sure do cry a lot.

780
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,998
Gosh...

781
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,715
It's so pretty.

782
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,179
-I'll help you.
-Thank you.

783
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,765
In One, two, three.

784
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,309
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

785
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,938
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

786
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,406
I came as fast as I could,
but it went cold.

787
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,660
It's still crispy and tasty
even when it's cold.

788
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,249
I'm

789
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,835
thinking of quitting my job as a guard.

790
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,380
Good.

791
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,174
I'm scared to sleep in

792
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,177
this small house alone every two days.

793
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,179
You made the right decision.

794
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,391
It's not about that.

795
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,602
I want to move to the countryside
with Mom.

796
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,441
After seeing one of the seniors
passing away yesterday,

797
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:27,822
I keep wondering if it's right for Mom

798
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,283
to stay bedridden there
until her final moments.

799
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,036
All right.

800
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,540
Then I'll tell the realtor
that we're selling this store space.

801
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,168
You want to come with us?

802
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,045
Of course.

803
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,215
Why don't you want me to come?

804
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,093
Where will I live, then?

805
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,554
Will you be okay though?

806
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,307
-You don't have to...
-Gosh, seriously.

807
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,601
Are you going to keep trying
to separate me from you two?

808
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,270
I told you that I'm scared to sleep alone.

809
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,578
You can have it.
I don't like chicken wings.

810
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,250
Is it Min-su that likes chicken wings?

811
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,129
What's gotten into you?
I'm surprised you remember that.

812
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:27,506
I remember, of course.

813
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,344
Next time when Min-su comes over,

814
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:34,180
you two should go for some beer
and fried chicken.

815
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,225
Yes, we should.

Hello.

Hello.

822
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,161
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

823
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:41,831
It is indeed.

824
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,252
It's a dazzlingly beautiful day.

825
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,301
When did you move here?

826
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:00,182
Me?

827
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:04,061
How long ago was it?

828
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,774
What about you? When did you move here?

829
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,236
Me? I...

830
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,663
Actually, when did I move here?

831
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,794
You don't have to force yourself
to recall what you don't remember.

832
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,964
Just...

833
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,176
remember the moments...

834
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:37,928
when you were happy.

835
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,724
Happy moments.

836
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,023
Ma'am, when was...

837
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,193
the happiest moment in your life so far?

838
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:03,204
I wouldn't say it was any special day.

839
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,290
You see,

840
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,879
those ordinary days made me happy.

841
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,299
Around the time when the whole village

842
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:18,052
was filled with the aroma of rice
being cooked,

843
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,848
I'd start cooking rice
on the stove as well.

844
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:28,729
My son had just started walking

845
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,232
back then.

846
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:35,027
I'd hold his hand...

847
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,072
and go out to the front yard with him.

848
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:43,786
Then we'd see the sun setting...

849
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:47,998
from afar.

850
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,502
Where's your daddy?

851
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,212
Let's go see whereabouts he is.

852
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,804
Dae-sang, who's that?

853
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,931
Who's that? Who is he?

854
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,812
Come here, my pumpkin.

855
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:19,947
What a beautiful sunset.

856
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,783
I know, right?

857
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,785
I can never get sick of this view.

858
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:28,164
I think sunsets are more beautiful
than flowers.

859
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,040
I agree.

860
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:48,934
Those were the happiest moments.

861
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:52,980
Those days.

862
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,987
My mother is suffering from
Alzheimer's disease.

863
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,282
But perhaps,

864
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,953
she's simply reliving

865
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,415
the happiest moments of her life.

866
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,839
Now, stay with me here.

867
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,176
Don't go anywhere.

868
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:32,431
My life was blighted
by misfortune at times,

869
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:35,851
but there were also happy moments.

870
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:41,106
They say that life is nothing
but a mere dream,

871
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:44,818
but I was still grateful for my life.

872
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:50,324
The cold, brisk air at dawn,

873
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:54,203
the sweet breeze
right before flowers start to bloom,

874
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:58,791
and the scent of sunset
that fills the air at sundown.

875
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,754
Every single day was dazzlingly beautiful.

876
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:08,008
Even if you're struggling right now,

877
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:11,887
everyone alive

878
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:16,934
has the right to enjoy all this every day.

879
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:21,063
Even if one ordinary day is followed

880
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,191
by another ordinary day,

881
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:28,904
life is still worth living.

882
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:33,200
Don't waste the present

883
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,953
regretting the past

884
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:39,123
and worrying about the future.

885
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,084
Live this day

886
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,336
beautifully.

887
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,882
You deserve it.

888
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,386
To all of you who were a mom,

889
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,388
a sister,

890
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:58,142
a daughter,

891
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:00,936
and

892
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,230
yourself.

893
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:10,571
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
THE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES

894
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:14,533
SPECIAL THANKS TO SON SOOK

895
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:04,958
