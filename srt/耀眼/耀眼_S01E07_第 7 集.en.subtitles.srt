1
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,158
I'm certain it was broken.

2
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,201
How is it still ticking?

3
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,748
Sir, was this watch always ticking

4
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,915
-like this?
-Sir.

5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,543
You said you have to go
to the hospital by 2:30 p.m. for medicine.

6
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,836
It's time now.

7
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,880
Excuse me. We need to pass by.

8
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,217
Hold on, that...

9
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,638
That...

10
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,683
I told you so.

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,268
Let's go see the flowers.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,856
Come on.

13
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,151
Is it not my watch?

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,910
Look. Isn't it pretty?

15
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,746
Maybe it's just a similar watch.

16
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,998
-Right.
-By doing this,

17
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,250
all the attention will be focused
on your fingernails.

18
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,086
People won't notice the wrinkles
or age spots on your hands--

19
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:33,009
I was about to do your fingernails too.
Have patience.

20
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,219
Choose a color from here.

21
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,638
Forget it. I peel onions
and do the dishes every day.

22
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,931
What good is getting a manicure?

23
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,599
Then, your toenails!

24
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,100
How about a pedicure?

25
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,727
Take off your socks.

26
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,020
Hey!

27
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,356
Why are you taking off my socks?

28
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,774
Hyeon-ju.

29
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,985
The soles of your feet are
as rough as sandpaper.

30
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,904
You'll ruin your stockings.

31
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,447
Have you ever seen me wearing stockings?

32
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,657
Give me back my socks.

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,200
Come on, give me your foot.

34
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,910
I'll make it soft as a baby's foot.

35
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,078
-Gosh!
-No.

36
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,746
He lives in this neighborhood.

37
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,581
So he might have picked up my watch
and fixed it.

38
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,999
-Right?
-Leave it up to me.

39
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,793
You guys aren't leaving now, right?

40
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,461
I'll be right back.

41
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,927
I think it was around here somewhere.

42
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,472
I can't even see properly.

43
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,559
This way?

44
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,937
I was on the rooftop!

45
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,694
Doesn't this scene

46
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,571
feel kind of familiar?

47
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,740
What's going on?

48
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,160
Are you on mute or what?

49
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,123
I'm here to look for something.

50
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:49,294
But is it because it's dark,
or is it because I'm old? I can't find it.

51
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:53,172
I wonder if any young men
would be willing to help me.

52
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,762
I hope a fly falls into your beer.

53
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,476
Darn it.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,714
Are you impressed that this old lady knows

55
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,090
how to enjoy beer?

56
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,720
I just think it's odd that
you always act like we're close.

57
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,805
We are close.

58
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,811
Are you mad at me

59
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,481
for lecturing you
about how you should live your life?

60
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,734
Or are you mad at Hye-ja

61
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,445
for leaving
without even saying a word to you?

62
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,364
I've expressed
my discomfort multiple times,

63
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,824
but you keep bringing her up.
I don't know why you're doing this.

64
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,123
Do you want me to keep
missing your great-niece?

65
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,668
Me?

66
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,879
Could you please stop this
if that's not the case?

67
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,976
It's not nice to hear someone
criticizing my current situation,

68
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,063
and my situation has nothing to do
with your great-niece abroad.

69
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,941
To put it more accurately,

70
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,528
your great-niece and I
knew each other for a little while,

71
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,574
but we're practically strangers now.

72
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,578
You're so firm.

73
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,998
You, stern young man.

74
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,127
Can't you be concerned for each
other even if you're strangers now?

75
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,634
What if she comes back?

76
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,472
What if Hye-ja comes back?

77
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,979
Nothing will change.

78
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,359
Hye-ja will be sad.

79
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,739
Thanks for the beer.

80
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,163
Next time, I'll buy you a drink.

81
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,010
Gosh, why am I buzzed
just after a can of beer?

82
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,682
What a jerk! How could he say that?

83
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,060
This is why I don't like smart people.

84
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,104
He purposely picked words

85
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,691
that would hurt my feelings
and scar me forever.

86
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,610
We "knew each other",
but we're "strangers" now?

87
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,782
Fine, it's all my fault.

88
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,868
It's my fault

89
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,496
It's all my fault

90
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,129
Gosh, that's enough.
I rarely take my shoes off.

91
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,925
Missy, how can you say that
after seeing all the filings here?

92
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,259
Hey, Kim Hye-ja!

93
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,499
You girls ate mochi without me? How mean.

94
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,502
Especially you!
I'm so disappointed in you.

95
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,797
Hye-ja stepped out, saying
she has to take care of something.

96
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,757
It's getting late, so she'll be home soon.

97
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,843
Why do you need her for your broadcast?

98
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,553
She said she'd join me
in my broadcast today.

99
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,972
Hey, did you bring your guitar?

100
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,726
Okay! That's great. Follow me.

101
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,604
-I need you to fill in for her.
-Whatever. We're going home.

102
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,606
Be honored.

103
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,984
Thirty-two people have added my channel
to their favorites.

104
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,486
Not everyone gets to be on it. Follow me.

105
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,572
-Hey.
-Let's go!

106
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,535
Hello, I'm your broadcasting jockey,
Prince. Hello, everyone.

107
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,329
Welcome, Dr. Ssamjang.

108
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,415
Hansel Said So is here too.

109
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,875
Prince, my foot.

110
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,751
Loan Ms. Kim is here too.

111
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,420
All right, get settled in.

112
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,797
Today, I went through hoops
to invite this singer

113
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,299
for you guys.

114
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,592
OH, MY
FOR REAL?

115
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,761
IS IT A GIRL GROUP?
I LOVE GFRIEND

116
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,431
I already got 100 candies.

117
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,933
You can send me candies
after finding out who the singer is.

118
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,935
The singer is--

119
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,397
Hello, I'm rookie singer Yoon Sang-eun.

120
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,648
It's nice to meet you all.

121
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,442
I hope you enjoy my song.

122
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,613
PRINCE YEONG-SU TV,
NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS: 27

123
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,448
All of you must be quite flustered.

124
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,534
I'm very flustered myself at the moment.

125
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,036
Hello?

126
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,498
Did everyone leave? Hello?

127
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,501
Then how about I sing a song

128
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,835
to lift everyone's spirits?

129
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,546
Hey, no. Don't. That's not going to help.

130
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,216
If they want an encore,
I'll do it another time.

131
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,802
One, two, three, four.

132
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,931
WHAT'S WITH THE SONG CHOICE?
I'M OUT

133
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,351
-She's busy, so we'll stop here.
-I have so much time.

134
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,435
WHO'S THAT NO-NAME SINGER?

135
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,604
Well, didn't you say you're busy today?

136
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,773
You should rush home and do--

137
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,734
"Who's that no-name singer?

138
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,486
Get lost"?

139
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,114
Sang-eun, let's go. Come on!

140
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,159
"Take my sincere word of advice.

141
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,872
You have no talent to be a singer."

142
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,002
This is how my live broadcast
usually goes.

143
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,212
Right? Aren't I right, everyone?

144
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,922
We're always like this, right?

145
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,351
Sang-eun, let's go.
Come on. Let's get going.

146
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,979
Thank you.

147
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,023
Thank you so much.

148
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,027
I'm so used to

149
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,030
everyone treating me as if I'm invisible.

150
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,533
I feel like these mean comments

151
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,327
show your interest at least,
and I thank you for that.

152
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:46,002
CHEER UP

153
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,838
Thank you. I will cheer up.

154
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,508
Thank you.

155
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,093
That's right. Oh, more candies!

156
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,140
-Gosh!
-Thank you.

157
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:46,103
"I KNOW", THANK YOU FOR 109 CANDIES!

158
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,773
Let me get some sleep, will you?

159
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,857
Nice.

160
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,444
The lady you've all been waiting for
is finally here.

161
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:57,239
Let's welcome the 25-year-old granny
from the underworld, Kim Hye-ja.

162
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,534
-Stop spewing total nonsense.
-You little... This is work.

163
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,870
You promised to cooperate.

164
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,668
Grandma Monster,
thank you for the candies.

165
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,548
THE 25-YEAR-OLD KIM HYE-JA IS HERE

166
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,008
"Are you really 25?"

167
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,051
ARE YOU REALLY 25?

168
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,761
How many times do I have to tell you?

169
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,346
You want to see my ID card?

170
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,099
If any of you turn out to be older
than me,

171
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,559
will you send us candies?

172
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,561
-Deal?
-Deal!

173
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,438
I'M 27

174
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,107
I'M 44, I WAS BORN IN 1973

175
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,274
So what?

176
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,568
CALL ME SIR

177
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,156
IF YOU CALL ME SIR,
I'LL SEND YOU 58 CANDIES

178
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,282
Sir.

179
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,576
58 CANDIES FROM TOY CRANE

180
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,453
58 candies from Toy Crane.

181
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,914
Fifty eight candies.

182
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,082
Thank you!

183
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:53,129
SHE IS A MONSTER CREATED BY CAPITALISM

184
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,465
You guys asked me to do it.
Keep trolling, and I'll leave.

185
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,217
Calm down.

186
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,679
All right, guys. It's been a while.

187
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,472
Let's have a Q and A session.

188
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,516
Any questions regarding
personal information, body size,

189
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,893
military service, soccer, and poop

190
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,937
are forbidden. You know that, right?

191
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,814
Let's start.

192
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,068
YOU SAID YOU AGED OVERNIGHT.
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE OLD?

193
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,903
A question from Ppippuppappujjuppu.

194
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,240
"You said you aged overnight.
What is it like to be old?"

195
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,950
So what is it like?

196
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,286
It sucks.

197
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,458
425 CANDIES FROM DARKUMENTARY

198
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,876
Did you all hear that?

199
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,086
She says it's fun.

200
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,754
Manager, are you watching?

201
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,674
I adhere to the broadcasting regulations.

202
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,677
Pull yourself together.

203
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,059
"Is there really no benefit to being old?"

204
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,521
Yes, there are certain benefits.

205
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,689
There are a lot, actually.

206
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,066
Like what?

207
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,405
You guys are concerned about
finding jobs, right?

208
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,241
Why don't you just get old like me?

209
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,535
When you're old,
you don't have to do anything.

210
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,455
Even if you just sit around,
no one tells you to find a job.

211
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,165
No one wants to employ you anyway.

212
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,958
THE 25-YEAR-OLD KIM HYE-JA IS HERE

213
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,084
Well...

214
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,004
Are there any other benefits?

215
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,840
"I recently got a job,

216
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,551
but I work late a lot,
and my boss is a bully."

217
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,095
Just get old. Then you won't have to work.

218
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,474
"It bothers me
that I don't have a girlfriend."

219
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,643
Like I said, get old.

220
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,479
Then it won't bother you anymore.

221
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,524
The only problem is
your body feels a bit weak.

222
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,733
What else?

223
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,777
You absolutely don't have to do anything.

224
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,487
You just sit around,

225
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,656
waiting for the day you die.

226
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,324
How easy is that?

227
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,245
I CAN'T REALLY LAUGH

228
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,457
IT'S SUDDENLY SO AWKWARD

229
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,126
Should we listen to some music?

230
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,796
I answered their questions.
Why aren't they saying anything?

231
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,882
BUT THERE IS NO WAY
WE CAN GET OLD IMMEDIATELY

232
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,759
"There is no way
we can get old immediately"?

233
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,389
If there was a way, would you get old?

234
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,391
Are you ready for that?

235
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:18,274
I'm sure you guys all slept
through your classes,

236
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,110
so I doubt you caught
any of what the teachers said.

237
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,447
But there is this thing called
the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

238
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,577
It's what the world is based on.

239
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,830
So what does it mean?

240
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,499
To buy a thing,

241
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,294
you pay what it's worth, right?

242
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,546
Likewise, when you want something,

243
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,090
you have to give up something

244
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,467
that is just as valuable as that.

245
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,846
Considering your mental capacity,

246
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,682
I tried to put it as simply as I could.

247
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,436
If you can't follow,
I'll have to give up on you.

248
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,022
IS THIS SOME KIND OF EDUCATION CHANNEL?

249
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,189
ENOUGH OF YOUR RAMBLING

250
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,524
YOU DON'T WANT TO LISTEN JUST LEAVE

251
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,612
Who wants to switch with me
starting tomorrow?

252
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,490
I will live your unemployed,

253
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,784
broke, single,

254
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,163
helpless, and confusing life.

255
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,749
You eat food someone else cooks for you,

256
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,959
have a seat given up for you
on the subway,

257
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:22,129
and sleep all day with no one
making a fuss about it.

258
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,256
Live my life.

259
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,507
What do you say?

260
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,719
It sounds quite horrifying, doesn't it?

261
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,265
You instinctively know
it's not a good deal, don't you?

262
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,017
I IMAGINED IT FOR REAL

263
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,018
NOT SCARY NOT AT ALL.

264
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,395
THAT SOUNDS SO AWFUL

265
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,564
Whether you live your life to the fullest

266
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,399
or just waste it away
like you're doing right now,

267
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,567
every person

268
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,154
gets to be young once.

269
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,239
So you might not think much of it.

270
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,576
But look at me

271
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,789
and realize
what a precious thing you have.

272
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,460
Realize the value
of the most mundane things.

273
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,630
Keep this in mind.

274
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,882
The Law of Equivalent Exchange.

275
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,718
Nothing in this world

276
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,512
is free.

277
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,348
EQUIVELENT

278
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,685
Equivalent, not "equivelent."

279
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,603
Equivalent.

280
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,856
EQUIVELENT

281
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,609
EQUIVALENT

282
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,664
It might really be my watch.

283
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,082
I have to make sure.

284
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,543
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

285
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,467
Are you in a hurry?

286
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,344
Tell me what it is. I can do it for you.

287
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,637
I have to go myself.

288
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,517
See you later.

289
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,445
How is your wrist?

290
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,155
You don't have to do that.

291
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,366
You're just pretending to be worried
because you have nothing to say.

292
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,048
Am I too early?

293
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,310
He didn't see me?

294
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,148
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

295
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,114
I usually go to
the next neighborhood first.

296
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,699
If you get on now it'll take a while.

297
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,743
Can't you just drop me off first
at the exhibit hall?

298
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,453
There are people I have to pick up.

299
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,121
Will this make any difference?

300
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,462
Fine, I'll be quiet.

301
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,300
How is she doing?

302
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,551
Who?

303
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,969
Your great-niece.

304
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,054
Who...

305
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,598
Oh, you mean Hye-ja, my great-niece.

306
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,935
You said you didn't care about strangers.

307
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,354
I can still ask how she is doing, can't I?

308
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,649
She will come back soon.

309
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,319
There is a way.

310
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,590
-Good morning.
-Hi.

311
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,262
Good morning.

312
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,723
Hi. Come on in.

313
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,433
Oh, my.

314
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,145
You're already addicted to me.
You desperately--

315
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,824
It's pretty warm today.

316
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,538
Well, sir.

317
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,250
Where did you get this watch?

318
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,461
May I take a closer look?

319
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,384
There is something going on.

320
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,054
Sir, the thing is--

321
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,389
When did you come?

322
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,142
You weren't there when I got in the car.

323
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,352
I was a bit early today.

324
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,422
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

325
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,800
Enjoy.

326
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,885
Thanks.

327
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,178
I'll put it here.

328
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,429
Okay.

329
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,309
I'm the older one.

330
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,186
I'm the younger.

331
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,623
Let me help you.

332
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,375
Hold my arm.

333
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,631
I'll pull out your chair for you.

334
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,050
Okay. You can grab the table.

335
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,471
Here are your chopsticks.

336
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,807
Take this.

337
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,600
Sit here.

338
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,227
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

339
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,353
Here you go, sir.

340
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,397
I'll help you.

341
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,024
-I can do it.
-It's all right.

342
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,526
I'll help you.

343
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,659
I'll do it. You can go eat.

344
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,786
Go help someone else. I got this.

345
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,416
You can go now.

346
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,545
Have some of this before you eat.

347
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,685
How does it taste?

348
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,649
HOW TO MAKE CURRY

349
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,159
Sir, you're chopping up
the vegetables too much.

350
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,744
You have to chop them in a bigger size.

351
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,419
You can grab the carrot
and chop it like this.

352
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,421
I will help you.

353
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,681
Sir. This watch isn't yours, is it?

354
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,187
Right? It's not yours, is it?

355
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,354
This is mine--

356
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,530
Sir! What are you doing?

357
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,490
Put the knife down.

358
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,617
-No...
-What's the matter?

359
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,369
It's all right. My gosh.

360
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,415
Sir. Sir?

361
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,918
-Sir.
-Sir?

362
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,045
-Take him to the hospital.
-Hurry up.

363
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,963
Hurry.

364
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,300
Hang in there!

365
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,069
Hye-ja. I thought about
today's broadcast concept.

366
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,403
I need to lie down.

367
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,197
You want to lie down?

368
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,282
Let's do a lying down show!
You're a genius.

369
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,910
-Follow me.
-Let go of me.

370
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,620
Today's concept is a lying down show.

371
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,957
I hope all of you in front of
the monitor lie down too.

372
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,125
Then I will...

373
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,377
What kind of rubbish is this?

374
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,129
What is it?

375
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,714
What are you giggling at
and watching alone?

376
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,966
Who says I'm giggling?

377
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,635
Hey, you have a customer.

378
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,220
Welcome.

379
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,102
How pathetic is he to beg for candies
using his grandma?

380
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,103
What a loser.

381
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,021
Who is this jerk?

382
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,066
"The Hard Puncher of Doksan-dong"?

383
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,362
I can already tell he's a
total loser from his nickname.

384
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,158
Who's calling who pathetic?

385
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,326
Anyone watching this is pathetic too.

386
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,412
Why are you getting all angry?

387
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,205
Are you friends with that Prince guy?

388
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,334
That's what I wanted to ask.

389
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,669
I never mentioned your nickname.

390
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,796
Why are you overreacting
when I said you're pathetic?

391
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,424
-It's a fight!
-This is exciting!

392
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,051
Wait... What's going on here, guys?

393
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,553
You can't fight.

394
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,097
I, Prince Yeong-su, aim for
a peaceful broadcast.

395
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,765
Hold hands with those next to you.

396
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,018
Let's hold hands and get along in harmony.

397
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,649
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

398
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,953
If someone suddenly disappears at
this age, there's only one answer.

399
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,206
It means he's gone to the other world.

400
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,875
It worked out for the best.

401
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,794
He barely even breathed
in that wheelchair of his.

402
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,880
He was practically a dead person.

403
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,009
Oh, gosh. Did that man in
the wheelchair pass away?

404
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,679
At that age, no one can guarantee
he'll live another day.

405
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,766
Didn't you see him gasping
for breath yesterday?

406
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,942
PROGRAM PROPOSAL

407
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,283
INSURANCE CONTRACT

408
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,247
SIGNED BY KIM DONG-SEOK

409
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,542
This is your handwriting, right?

410
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,965
It took me a whole day
to fill in this form.

411
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,758
I never even asked,

412
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,053
and he blabbered on all day
about the January–Fourth Retreat.

413
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,181
Why is there no name
for the insured though?

414
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,891
That...

415
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,144
It's blank?

416
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:05,981
I forgot.

417
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,694
It's just a mistake.

418
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,038
Did you contact that man
who was sick yesterday?

419
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,165
-Contact him?
-I found out today.

420
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,334
What if something bad happened?

421
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,754
That man didn't come here for
about a month couple of months ago.

422
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,465
His condition is quite unpredictable.

423
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,843
That's why you should contact him
even more.

424
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,011
Look what happened yesterday.

425
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,555
We should? Why?

426
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,015
Even his family doesn't contact him.

427
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,766
What's this about?

428
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,103
What's his address? You must have
his personal information.

429
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,897
We can't tell you that. It's confidential.

430
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,234
Is that important when a man
is about to die at this moment?

431
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,156
That grandma's condition
seems critical too.

432
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,200
I wonder if she has insurance.

433
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,455
I don't know.

434
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,832
He was always on the bus when I got on.

435
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,669
I think he got off right before
we passed that underpass.

436
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,546
I saw him once.

437
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,011
It's 9 times 1 is 9. 9 times 2 is 18.
9 times 3 is 27.

438
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,263
The capital of Brazil is Brasilia.

439
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,099
I'm fine.

440
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,685
I didn't run away from home.
I never did before either.

441
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,979
Ma'am we didn't suspect you.

442
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,565
You have an amazing memory.

443
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,817
I didn't know about Brasilia either.

444
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,154
Stop laughing. Since we've met,
find someone for me.

445
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,864
Ma'am.

446
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,909
How could we tell you his address
when you don't know his name?

447
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:45,205
Even if you did know, we can't tell
anyone except family members.

448
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,539
I'm not doing this for me.

449
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,917
I explained that elder man is--

450
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,919
He's an ill man

451
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,129
and you're worried because
he didn't come today?

452
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,508
Like you said, if his condition
is critical,

453
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,635
his family probably took him
to a hospital already.

454
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,095
He might live alone.

455
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,556
He must still be able to move
because someone's helping him.

456
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,643
But since you insist, we'll take
a patrol around the neighborhood.

457
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,479
Forget it. I know it's merely a routine,
so I'll do the patrol.

458
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,814
Tell me his address.

459
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,233
I won't move an inch if you don't tell me.

460
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,776
Let go of me.

461
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,654
I'm telling you, I must know!

462
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,240
Be careful on your way home, ma'am.

463
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,288
I wasted all my energy for nothing.

464
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,708
Where am I going to find him?

465
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,011
My knees hurt too much to even bend down.

466
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,809
-Thank you.
-Here.

467
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,742
It's him. It's that old man.

468
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,076
What's going on?

469
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,791
The watch. Right, he turned
the crown on the watch.

470
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,918
Wait.

471
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,674
Sir. Mister!

472
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,009
Sir!

473
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,562
My knees can't give in right now. Please.

474
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,033
Where did he go?

475
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,080
I knew it. He turned back time.

476
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,208
That's why he got old like me.

477
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,628
That means if I find him and
take back my watch,

478
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,714
I have a chance to turn back time!

479
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,981
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

480
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,945
What is this?

481
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,405
Divorce?

482
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,830
Are you already home, Dad?

483
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,457
Yes. What are you doing?

484
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,877
I hurt my toe, and was about to
put on some ointment.

485
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,629
You should be careful.

486
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,559
Why aren't you washing up?
Mom will get mad again.

487
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,643
Hey, when did you get here?

488
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,855
What is it? Are you hungry?

489
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,023
No.

490
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,288
Guys, what I'm saying is...

00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,668
When will you grow up?

493
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,753
What's with you?

494
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,547
Is this the angry grandma theme?

495
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,590
Great, sounds good.

496
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,050
What? What's your problem?

497
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,176
I don't know!

498
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,844
Are you kidding me?

499
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,971
Until when
are you going to live like this?

500
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,723
OH, THE GRANDMA IS HERE!
SHE'LL SMACK HIM!

501
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,725
Good. The response is great so far.
Go louder.

502
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,852
Smack my back. Come on. Do it.

503
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,772
Hey! Gosh!

504
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,565
Why did you turn the computer off?

505
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,068
Knowing the situation I'm in,
at least you should come to your senses

506
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,362
and try to be good to Mom and Dad.

507
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,865
That's why we decided
to do the broadcasting together.

508
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,408
You call that a plan?

509
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,703
You can't even earn 1,000 won a day
without your aged sister's help.

510
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,039
That's harsh.

511
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,582
You know I'm being harsh,

512
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,542
and yet you don't know
how pathetic you are?

513
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,130
Do you know what I even considered
because of you?

514
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,883
I seriously considered
getting life insurance.

515
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,719
If I do that, I can take your place

516
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,846
and help Mom and Dad prepare

517
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,140
for their retirement

518
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,729
Stop staring at your computer,
stuck in your room all day.

519
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,275
Can you please pay attention
to our family's situation? Please.

What's this? Is it over?

522
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,295
This is probably his new theme.

523
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,256
The themes today have been pretty wicked.

524
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,590
What's this?

525
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,800
It's actually off?

526
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,012
Kim Yeong-su, you're a real piece of work.

527
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,974
What a crook.

528
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,435
How could he just shut it off
after getting all the candies?

529
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,562
This jerk is acting up again.

530
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,565
You're so dead.

531
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,276
Maybe something really happened to him.

532
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,696
What can happen to a jobless guy
who's stuck at home all day?

533
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,989
-Maybe he's dead.
-What the...

534
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,158
Hard Puncher, you're out of line again.

535
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,160
You're posting comments
as you have nothing else to do.

536
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,327
Are you a teacher or what?

537
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,746
Stop lecturing me.

538
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,205
Take notes when I'm giving you advice.

539
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,457
Don't be such a kid.

540
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,792
Why are you watching this idiot's show
if you're that smart?

541
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,335
Go watch National Geographic!

542
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,257
I'm watching this
to educate losers like you.

543
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,925
Look at you, keyboard warriors.

544
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,677
Look at them bashing each other.

545
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,845
Hey, don't just argue.

546
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,597
-Gosh!
-Meet up and fight!

547
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,289
This is an opportunity.

548
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,708
The watch I had thrown away
showed up again,

549
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,211
and the broken watch is working fine now

550
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,587
because this was meant to happen.

551
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,089
I'll get it back.

552
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,715
It was my watch to begin with.

553
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,342
It's mine.

554
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,261
That watch is mine.

555
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,059
Did you get a new job or something?

556
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,561
Gosh, not at all.

557
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,146
This is all I do these days.

558
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,897
This is my third day in a row.

559
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,858
We need four laborers!

560
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,985
-Laborers?
-Yes, Mr. Kim. Get in.

561
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,987
-Let's go.
-We need four guys here!

562
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,655
-Three more.
-Hey, hurry up.

563
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,365
The young guy over there!

564
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,867
Get in the car.

565
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,078
Hey, move over a little.

566
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,872
Let's go!

567
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,755
This way.

568
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,048
Lay him on the bed.

569
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,800
Hurry up. My gosh.

570
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,511
Dad, slow down! Go slowly, please.

571
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,806
You're so used to living like dust
under the closet.

572
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,142
Why did you even think
to work at a construction site?

573
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,771
Oh, dear.

574
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,482
What did the doctor say?

575
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,693
He's in pain because he used muscles
that he rarely uses.

576
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,403
The doctor said he'll recover
in a few days.

577
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,655
Mom, I'm in so much pain now.

578
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,742
This severe pain is making me
crave grilled pork.

COLORING CLASS

580
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,723
Yes, I just need to get my watch back.

581
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,226
Then everything will go back
to the way it was.

582
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,979
All right, it's lunchtime!

583
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,774
I'll help him.

584
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,735
-Will you?
-Yes.

585
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,113
Let's go.

586
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,537
I'll go bring your lunch.

587
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,873
I was going to do it.

588
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,208
Please don't worry. It's okay.

589
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,170
Here you go.

590
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,260
What's wrong, sir? Are you feeling unwell?

591
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,224
I'll look after him. Just have your lunch.

592
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,185
Sir. It's me, Yeon-hwa.

593
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,853
I'll help you with your lunch.

594
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,356
What would you like to eat first?
Tell me, sir.

595
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,651
Do you know that man?

596
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,820
No.

597
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,907
It seemed like you were helping him often.

598
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,577
I feel bad...

599
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,289
for myself.

600
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,710
And for you too.

601
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,838
I feel bad for you.

602
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,673
Just wait.

603
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,009
I'll help you.

604
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,510
No.

605
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,095
Hye-ja will help you.

606
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,057
I don't need any help, so--

607
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,854
Hye-ja will help you.

608
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,651
I can change things.

609
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,989
I mean it.

610
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,034
The opportunity to turn back time.

611
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,119
It is true.

612
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,455
It's possible.

613
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,873
Don't regret later.

614
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,000
Once it's done, there's no going back.

615
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,256
Hye-ja is coming back?

616
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,009
Yes.

617
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,303
When?

618
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,807
Soon.

619
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,097
Give it back!

620
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,974
It's mine.

621
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,769
It's mine!

622
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,896
-Give it back!
-It's mine!

623
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:44,525
-It's mine!
-No!

624
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,112
I know it's mine!

625
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,989
What are you doing?

626
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,574
-It's mine!
-What's wrong?

627
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,700
-It's mine.
-Are you okay?

628
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,536
-It's mine!
-Stop it.

629
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,663
-Stop it!
-Calm down.

630
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,789
It's mine.

631
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,418
-What are you doing?
-It's mine.

632
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,504
-That watch is mine!
-What's going on?

633
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,716
Drink this.

634
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,065
-Ma'am.
-It's my watch.

635
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,528
What makes you think so?

636
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,946
I just know.

637
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,785
Who would believe that?

638
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,872
Do you have proof that it's yours?

639
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,707
Has anyone else seen it?

640
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,590
You know, don't you?

641
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,676
You've seen it.

642
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,685
Well, ma'am...

643
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,066
If you insist on claiming
someone else's stuff without any proof,

644
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,652
it's theft.

645
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,153
There are some old people

646
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,906
who steal others' stuff out of greed.

647
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,201
But that would stop people
from wanting to come here.

648
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,161
They'd be afraid of you.

649
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,498
If you're struggling financially--

650
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,166
Let me take her home.

651
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,002
It's my watch.

652
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,215
It's my watch.

653
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,095
It's mine.

654
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,732
She didn't look like that kind of person.

655
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,776
How could she try to steal?

656
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,589
If you go home now,
your family would be worried.

657
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,174
I'll take you home once you calm down.

658
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,887
You think I was trying to steal,
don't you?

659
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,726
Of course.

660
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,228
Because I'm the only one who remembers.

661
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,897
I don't know what happened,

662
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,110
but I don't think you should
come back here.

663
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,572
You shouldn't really be in
the same room with that man again.

664
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,867
Is that what your boss said?

665
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,623
I agree with him too.

666
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:49,835
How can you say that? How can you...

667
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,883
I'm not doing this just for my own sake.

668
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,642
I don't need your help, ma'am.

669
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,812
You don't have to feel sorry for me.
I'm getting...

670
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,776
a little tired of it.

671
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,030
There are too many things to undo.

672
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,909
But there is nothing I can do

673
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,120
without that watch.

674
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,886
Hye-ja, you must have been so surprised.

675
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,806
How are you? Are you okay?

676
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,727
Because you guys are my friends,
you worry about me first.

677
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,148
Now that I think about it,

678
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,194
I don't understand why I went that far.

679
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,947
With all the people watching

680
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,824
and the old man resisting so much,

681
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,118
I would have backed down.

682
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,454
That watch is not just
an ordinary watch to you.

683
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,254
Hye-ja, can't we...

684
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,715
just live like this?

685
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,468
We wouldn't mind.

686
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,513
She's right. We'll be fine.

687
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,682
We can still drink together like before.

688
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,269
It's not just about me.

689
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,814
Everything...

690
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,150
has been ruined.

691
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,571
So much that I can't do anything about it.

692
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,909
You guys probably wouldn't understand

693
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,831
until you get old
and become helpless like me.

694
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,671
I always thought there was
something peculiar about her.

695
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,966
When she flung herself at him,
it totally scared me.

696
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,386
You know her great-niece? Is

697
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,097
that right?

698
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,560
Did you date her?

699
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,358
I don't think so.

700
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,069
Oh, there's a rainbow.

701
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,947
Look at that. It's a rainbow.

702
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,742
It's not a rainbow. It's just oil.

703
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,118
I can't believe you.

704
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,954
You're so unromantic.

705
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,126
You know

706
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,713
you can see auroras
in the North Pole, right?

707
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,798
Yes.

708
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:47,888
I'll definitely see auroras one day.

709
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,558
Like this, I'll take

710
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,437
the Trans-Siberian train.

711
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,107
Okay.

712
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,196
In my opinion, auroras are an error.

713
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,201
An error, a bug, a mistake.

714
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,081
I read this somewhere.

715
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:18,085
Auroras are originally
magnetic fields outside the Earth.

716
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,713
But they accidentally flowed
into the North Pole.

717
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,799
That means

718
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,427
auroras were not intended

719
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,929
to exist.

720
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:33,058
They're just an error
that happened by chance.

721
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,061
Like me.

722
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:44,945
But the thing is, they're so beautiful.

723
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:49,992
The error is so beautiful.

724
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,704
Even though it's just an error.

725
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,960
An error can be beautiful too.

726
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,629
So beautiful that it makes you cry.

727
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,969
I think...

728
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,098
the moment I see auroras,

729
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,977
I'll burst into tears.

730
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,862
Auroras.

731
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,581
I think they'll be so lovely.

732
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,837
If everything goes as planned,

733
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,298
we'll move to China.

734
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,926
I'll say "How are you?", "Thank you,"

735
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,638
"Did you eat?" Things like that.

736
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,764
Hui-won.

737
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,642
Do you remember your promise?

738
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,521
You said I could leave whenever
I want to do something else.

739
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,731
I did.

740
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,112
And? Do you want to do something else now?

741
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,449
No, not yet.

742
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,493
But I'll leave once I do.

743
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:19,373
Hey, then talk to me later.
We have to move to China first.

744
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,750
What are you talking about? Let's drink.

745
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,502
Talk to me later.

746
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,048
China has a large population.

747
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,301
INJURED PRINCE'S SHOW

748
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,762
Hello, everyone.

749
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,764
I'm a bit late today, right?

750
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,600
I hurt my back,

751
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,560
and I have no choice but to
lie down for today's show.

752
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,895
I hope you understand.

753
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,398
LOOK AT THIS DUDE
HE'S TRYING SOMETHING ELSE

754
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,649
IS IT ANOTHER LYING DOWN SHOW?

755
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,067
GRANDMA THE OTHER DAY
AND NOW IT'S YOU?

756
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,402
HE'S MAKING UP ALL KINDS OF EXCUSES

757
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,570
I'm serious. I'm not making up an excuse.

758
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,949
I went out to work to support our family,

759
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,659
and I hurt my back. Look.

760
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,369
Do you see this waist support band?

761
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,704
I'm really injured.

762
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,706
It's obvious. He'll act pitiful
and say he's hurt

763
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,832
to beg for more candies.

764
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,625
He might really be injured.

765
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,001
What are you, his lawyer?

766
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,378
He's a guy who lives off his lies.

767
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,546
Did you lend him money?

768
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,880
Did he take away your girlfriend?

769
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,048
Did he lend you money or what?

770
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,719
This looks really serious.

771
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,721
Hey, guys!

772
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,347
It's my fault, so stop fighting.

773
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,266
You can't fight. We'll get in trouble!

774
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,369
She should go to her room and sleep.

775
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,163
Dad?

776
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,835
You weren't asleep?

777
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,506
Dad, what is wrong with your leg?

778
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,184
It wasn't just a sprain?

779
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,772
Well, that's...

780
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,234
What on earth happened?

781
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,653
It just happened.

782
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,738
I'm fine.

783
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,698
Dad!

784
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,578
That time.

785
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,831
That time...

786
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,625
I'm okay now.

787
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,504
I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry...

788
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,507
Dad. Dad...

789
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,217
I'm sorry, Dad.

790
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,718
Dad...

791
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,096
Dad, I'm sorry.

792
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,014
Dad.

793
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,975
Dad...

794
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,768
Dad...

795
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,604
How did this happen?

796
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,942
But there is this thing called
the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

797
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,196
When you want something,

798
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,284
you have to give up something
that is just as valuable as that.

799
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:48,164
It's what the world is based on.

800
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:50,876
Oh, gosh.

801
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,635
The rule of exchange in this world
was different than I thought.

802
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,763
I thought Dad's death and my youth,

803
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,267
dream, and love were equivalent.

804
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,103
However, this was foolish as a young kid

805
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:12,814
trying to buy an expensive gift
at a supermarket

806
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,691
with only 100 won in his hand.

807
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,360
I know.

808
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,572
If I turn the watch and become
young again,

809
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,618
and if something needs to be
sacrificed again in exchange,

810
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,996
I won't be able to handle it.

811
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,884
What are you doing?

812
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,677
I was going to get up and make breakfast.

813
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,846
I got up first, so I decided to make it.

814
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,182
I'm making braised mackerel. Taste it.

815
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,642
Okay.

816
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,185
Let me see.

817
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,941
Did we have mackerel at home?

818
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,735
It's been a long time since
I went grocery shopping.

819
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,987
You're too busy to go for groceries.

820
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,740
Do you want to go to the market
with me after breakfast?

821
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,910
I used to tag along and eat
Korean pancakes when I was young.

822
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,538
Hot and fresh Korean pancakes
are so delicious.

823
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,833
Sure.

824
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,398
It's time for breakfast.

825
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,110
I better bring breakfast to my son

826
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,695
who broke his back.

827
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,030
I already brought him some. Go on and eat.

828
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,240
Really? You already did?

829
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,408
Yes.

830
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,743
Dad, come and sit down.

831
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,037
I made braised mackerel with radish.

832
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,455
It tastes so sweet.

833
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,915
Come and eat.

834
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,460
You can eat all these bones.

835
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,088
It'll be fine. They're a great
source of calcium.

836
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,339
Go on and eat.

837
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,218
Okay.

838
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,638
Did you have a nice dream or something?

839
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,723
A lucky dream?

840
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,685
I did dream for a short moment.

841
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,103
What was it about?

842
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,732
I don't remember.

843
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,608
Eat up.

844
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,118
We'll be back later.

845
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,413
It's heavy, give it to me.

846
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,832
It's not heavy. I can carry this much.

847
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,084
Mom, they have beans.

848
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,003
Let's buy some beans and have
rice with beans.

849
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,755
You don't even like beans.

850
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,382
Beans are good for menopause
since they're full of estrogen.

851
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,633
They have beans here.

852
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,553
Hello.

853
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,013
-Welcome.
-We'll take some beans.

854
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,097
Okay.

855
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,558
I heard pomegranate is good too.

856
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,851
-Come on.
-Pomegranate.

857
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,519
Do you have pomegranate too?

858
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,772
Oh, I better go ask
at a fruit shop for that.

859
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,023
Goodness, ma'am.

860
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,776
Who sells pomegranate during this season?

861
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,652
I see. I didn't know.

862
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,405
It's nice to see you shopping
with your daughter like this.

863
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,865
What are you saying?

864
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,700
-Why?
-It's her daughter-in-law.

865
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,536
Can't you tell they look
totally different?

866
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,914
You're her mother-in-law, right?

867
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,458
Yes, I am.

868
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,168
I need something that's good
for her menopause.

869
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,087
How about herbal medicine?
Is it effective?

870
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,005
-I heard evening primrose is...
-No.

871
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,508
I heard they make tea using fleeceflower.

872
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,884
Oh, fleeceflower?

873
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,969
Let's buy a bunch of fleeceflower.

874
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,971
I make enough money for that.

875
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,849
Your daughter-in-law must've been
nice to you.

876
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,894
You're even taking care of her when
she's going through menopause.

877
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,229
Right, ma'am?

878
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,438
Of course.

879
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,524
My daughter-in-law is the best.

880
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,693
You're so humorous, ma'am.

881
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,695
People might think she's your daughter.

882
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,740
I'll give you another handful of beans.

883
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,204
MIDNIGHT SNACK BAR

884
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,042
ANCHOVY BROTH NOODLES

885
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,962
I can smell anchovy broth noodles.

886
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,714
This menu has to be specified as a drug.

887
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,675
Aren't you hungry, Mom?

888
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:09,717
What?

889
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,512
Enjoy.

890
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,890
I always came here with Dad.
It's my first time with you.

891
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,851
Is this what you two always went out
to eat?

892
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,727
I thought it was something more special.

893
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,604
Do you know how good this is?

894
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,189
When you lie down to sleep,

895
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:26,067
the scent of this broth lingers
in your nose.

896
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,402
I mean it.

897
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,570
What a lame excuse.

898
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,697
This is my treat too, so don't pay.

899
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,781
Okay.

900
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,168
Even if you and Dad get divorced,

901
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,546
I will be on your side.

902
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,468
Only you can put up with someone like Dad.

903
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,761
Even Buddha can't live with him.

904
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,098
He never answers when
you ask him something.

905
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,726
Even when he answers, it's so vague.

906
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:02,687
He's always trouble-free,
not caring about others.

907
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,899
Even when we run out of rice,
he just keeps reading his book.

908
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,151
Your dad isn't that bad.

909
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,862
Still, he must've had a good taste
for women.

910
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,198
He chose you who was good at
making a living,

911
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,783
and never let his children starve
at least.

912
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,496
If I was your mom,

913
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,498
I would've beaten Dad up

914
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,585
and asked him if he married you
because he needed a maid.

915
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,799
I'll always be on your side
no matter what.

916
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:36,137
You'll have my support regardless of
what decision you make.

917
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,517
Mom.

918
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,925
Those keyboard warrior jerks.

919
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,010
They talked as if
they'd show up here together.

920
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:26,896
Hard Puncher?

921
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,026
-I guess he's not a total loser.
-Are you Ppukka?

922
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,906
Why? Are you scared?

923
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,616
You're wearing a helmet.

924
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,077
I didn't want to show you my face.

925
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,245
What? You're a woman?

926
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:45,832
Why? Are you going to act like
a gentleman who doesn't hit women?

927
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,376
Just treat me like how you usually
talk to me in the chatroom!

928
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,255
Goodness, how lame.

929
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,799
-What?
-You like that loser, don't you?

930
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,217
-Cut it out.
-You obviously do.

931
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,136
That's why you can't answer my question.

932
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,305
Why? Do you pity him?

933
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,932
I heard all women dream of

934
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,852
acting like Mother Teresa
while putting up with a loser like him.

935
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,564
You got the wrong idea!

936
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:10,940
Hello.

937
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,651
I'm not feeling well now,

938
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:17,238
but I feel responsible for this
as it happened in my chatroom.

939
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,740
With that sense of responsibility,

940
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,826
I'll give you live updates from
where their meet-up is taking place.

941
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,830
I'm all ready to call the police
if it's needed, so don't you worry.

942
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,499
But you have to stay quiet.
Be quiet from now on.

943
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,834
We're almost there. Okay?

944
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,753
I'll give you updates in a minute.
Let's go.

945
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,757
OH, MY
THEY ACTUALLY MET UP?

946
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,053
Over there.

947
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,472
I think they're standing
face-to-face over there.

948
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,806
I'll show you.

949
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,604
THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING
THIS WILL BE FUN

950
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,899
-That looks like Hyeon-ju.
-It's not that!

951
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,150
Then what is it?

952
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,195
What is it, then? Doesn't watching
that idiot make you feel,

953
01:00:57,278 --> 01:01:00,156
"Oh, my life isn't too bad"
Doesn't it give you a relief?

954
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,783
That's probably how you feel.

955
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,868
Yes, that's why I go into that chatroom.

956
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,286
Even such a pathetic idiot can live.

957
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,917
Darn it.

958
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,961
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
HELLO, I'M DDANG

959
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,388
THIS IS SO THRILLING
GOSH, THIS IS FRUSTRATING

960
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,979
Fine. He was my first love.
Are we good now?

961
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:35,066
And I still have feelings for him.

962
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,194
I know that he's a complete loser,
but I like him.

963
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,780
So if he needs to be bashed, I will do it.

964
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,032
If I catch you speaking ill of him
once again...

965
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,745
You know what "castration" means, right?

966
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,469
SENT 200 CANDIES

967
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:04,804
WHY IS HARD PUNCHER ON THE GROUND?

968
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,055
MY GOSH!
GREAT EDITING

969
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,307
What? That little...

970
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,107
My gosh.

971
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,361
HYOJA TRAIL, RESTING AREA, REAR
ENTRANCE, MAIN HALL, MINERAL SPRING

972
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:23,030
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

973
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:55,062
Sir, what did you get

974
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:58,107
in exchange for your youth?

975
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,869
What did you want to change

976
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,080
by turning back time?

977
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:17,752
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

978
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,712
Your family's happiness?

979
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,643
Your ruined health?

980
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:46,030
Or a love that failed to last?

981
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:02,922
Whatever it was,

982
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,719
I hope it was worth it.

983
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,983
You probably know this already.

984
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,695
Everything in life

985
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,156
costs something.

986
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,582
My gosh! Mr. Lee, are you okay?

987
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,834
Sir, why are you being like this?

988
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,461
It won't happen again.

989
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,462
Are you going to quit?

990
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:27,173
Stop worrying about me,
and enjoy your life.

991
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,966
Do you want to do a business with me?

992
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,052
You know We Got Married?
People pretending to be married.

993
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,386
I was her first love.

994
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,804
She totally chased me around.

995
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,723
-Did you chase me or not?
-Are you crazy?

996
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:36,974
Who? Who chased you?

997
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,643
I have proof. Wait, okay?

998
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,019
I'll be quick. I'll be right back.

999
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,439
I lied to you. I'm sorry.

1000
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,150
-Where is Mr. Lee Jun-ha?
-He's not here today.

1001
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:47,735
She'd be okay, right?

1002
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,236
But why do I feel so anxious?

1003
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,739
