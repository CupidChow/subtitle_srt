1
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,986
All right! Let's sing together!

2
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,196
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,906
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,658
Hyoja Exhibit Hall's mascot

5
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,662
and your forever little brother
is here to entertain you.

6
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,164
Give him a big hand!

7
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,208
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL IS HERE
FOR YOUR HAPPINESS

8
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,466
Hey, hey, hey

9
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,594
What's wrong with my age?

10
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:58,975
Age doesn't matter when it comes to love

11
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,271
My heart feels the same

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,192
This feeling is the same too

13
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,779
You are my one and only true love

14
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,905
Why?

15
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,948
What are you doing here?

16
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,246
You should've become a reporter already.

17
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,875
You had no problem at all
passing the interview.

18
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,752
What are you doing here?

19
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,546
Let's invite Mr. Kim to the stage!

20
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:35,678
One day, by chance
I saw my reflection in the mirror

21
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,972
Thank you very much
for visiting Hyoja Exhibit Hall.

22
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:42,268
All you have to do is
have an enjoyable time today. Okay?

23
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,815
I hope time stops

24
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,110
What's wrong with my age?

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,657
It's the perfect age to fall in love

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,618
-Please give him a hand!
-Thank you very much!

27
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,370
Thank you!

28
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,625
Are you having fun, everyone?

29
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,043
-Yes.
-Good.

30
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,336
We have a new visitor today.

31
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,504
Ma'am?

32
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,589
Hello.

33
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,883
Is it your first time today?

34
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,094
Please come this way.

35
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,681
Everyone here is around your age.

36
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,891
You should say hello before you leave.

37
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,977
Let's give her a big hand!

38
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,313
Wait, ma'am.

39
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,898
Ma'am, hold on.

40
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,109
You should introduce yourself.

41
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,360
This way.

42
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,529
Let's give her a hand!

43
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,324
Your name is?

44
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,618
Kim Hye...

45
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,871
It's Kim Hee-seon.

46
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,957
Wow, Kim Hee-seon. What a beautiful name.

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,959
Please give her a big round of applause!

48
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,753
I'm glad you're here.

49
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,505
I hope you have an enjoyable time.

50
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,676
All right.

51
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,013
Let's see. How was it?

52
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,056
Isn't it fun to spend time
with elders your age?

53
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,391
It's not fun.

54
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,311
Come on. It's better than
staying alone at home.

55
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,396
You can get fresh air
and enjoy a conversation.

56
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,731
It's nice, isn't it?

57
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,066
Ms. Kim Hee-seon.

58
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,402
Please tell me your birthday
and your home address.

59
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,779
Why are you asking for
my personal information?

60
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,408
This is just a formality.

61
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,118
I just need it to fill in this form.

62
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,580
I just came here to see
what kind of place this is.

63
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:29,042
Ma'am, this place isn't such a bad place.

64
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,755
Some people have negative thoughts
about exhibit halls,

65
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:38,176
but some people drop off their
parents on their way to work

66
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,136
and come pick them up after work.

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,014
If this was a bad place, would they
do that? Don't you agree?

68
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,433
I don't think this place suits me.

69
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,229
It's just a place where elders
take fun classes together.

70
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,564
You know kindergarten, right?
It's the same thing.

71
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,276
Some people even call this place
an "oldergarten".

72
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,737
I understand, but I'll come next time.

73
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,490
Why don't you stay for just one day then?

74
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,532
You saw him earlier, right?

75
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,786
Mr. Lee Jun-ha, who is
the mascot of this exhibit hall.

76
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,164
To put it simply, that guy
is truly full of charm.

77
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,209
All the elders in here have
better eyesight now.

78
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,628
Since they try so hard
to look at him closely.

79
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,682
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

80
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,834
You should try it too.

81
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,216
What is he doing here?

82
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,469
Why is that aspiring reporter
with a bright future working here?

83
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,638
What on earth happened to him?

84
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,934
Hye-ja, think. Think harder!

85
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,061
An undercover reporter?

86
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,524
Is he here to reveal the corruption
that's been going on

87
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,651
in this place that's been scamming
elder people?

88
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,988
That must be it!

89
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,994
Oh my goodness.

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,206
What is this ugly dude?

91
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,591
Enjoy your meal.

92
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,051
Welcome...

93
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,970
What do you want?

94
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,680
Don't treat a customer like that.

95
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,931
What?

96
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,767
I'll have jjajangmyeon.

97
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,685
Hey. Go sit in that corner.

98
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,020
-Why?
-The customers are looking.

99
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,688
We have to do business.

100
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,940
I'm a popular BJ, you know.

101
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,401
You only had eight viewers.
Go somewhere else then.

102
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,153
Go sit in that corner. Come on.

103
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,572
You better

104
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,199
give me more pickled radish then.

105
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,826
Welcome. How many are there in your party?

106
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,578
-Three.
-Sit here.

107
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,999
Lee Hyeon-ju?

108
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,796
Hey.

109
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,050
Do you work here?

110
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,178
This is my parents' restaurant.

111
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,014
Oh, right. You said your parents
owned a Chinese restaurant.

112
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,225
I got a job at Samji Electronics.

113
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,977
You made it.

114
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,772
What about you? Are you looking for a job?

115
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,857
No. I'm just...

116
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,735
I'm getting married next month.

117
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,029
You know Ji-yeon, right?

118
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,864
With her.

119
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,909
I'm not surprised.

120
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,204
You cheated on me and
eventually ended up marrying her.

121
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,914
Cheating doesn't sound right.

122
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,791
When I went out with you,

123
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,168
all my friends said that
we wouldn't last long.

124
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,711
But I still put up with you.

125
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,005
Also

126
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,092
was there anything left between us
when I was dating Ji-yeon?

127
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,887
If you're not busy,
you should come and congratulate us.

128
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,807
I'm getting married at Shinha Hotel.

129
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,143
The buffet over there is
very expensive and delicious.

130
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,019
There's no need to pay
congratulatory money.

131
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,771
Just come and enjoy the food.

132
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,317
Seriously, I can't stand this anymore.

133
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,154
Mister.

134
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,156
Can I say just one thing?

135
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,326
Can I go to that buffet too?

136
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,829
Please.

137
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,789
You should come.

138
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,541
With your boyfriend.

139
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,002
Thank you! Thank you so much.

140
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,086
Yes!

141
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,928
Go tell him you're not my boyfriend.

142
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,306
It's the buffet at Shinha Hotel.
Please let me go!

143
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,851
You should've beat him up for me.
What is wrong with you?

144
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,769
Why should I? He did nothing wrong.

145
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,606
You know nothing about women.
That's why you've never dated.

146
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,065
-I dated you.
-Hey.

147
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,067
Back then, I lost my mind for a while.

148
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,905
I bet I was your first
and last girlfriend.

149
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,200
A girlfriend? If I put
my mind to it, I can date anyone.

150
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,452
That's absurd.
What crazy girl would date you?

151
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,120
You know nothing about life.

152
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,705
What will you do if I date someone?

153
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,458
If you manage to date someone,
I'll do everything you ask me to do.

154
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,920
You said you'd do anything.

155
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,880
Yes. What do you want me to do? What?

156
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,091
If I date a girl, take me with you
to the Shinha Hotel buffet.

157
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,344
You promised me!

158
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,820
It's for your sugar level.

159
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,739
This is driving me nuts.

160
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,034
By the way, aren't you cold?

161
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,369
I'm not cold.

162
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,829
You're still young.

163
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,127
Hello.

164
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,837
Hello, ma'am.

165
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,880
-Hello, Jun-ha.
-Hello.

166
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,883
Hello.

167
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,718
-Hello.
-I feel pity for him.

168
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,887
That cranky guy has to keep smiling

169
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,764
just to get himself a decent story.

170
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,767
Fine, I'll help him.

171
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,186
I will be your strategic partner.

172
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,566
You know me, right? Hye-ja's great-aunt.

173
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,652
-Sorry?
-Look forward.

174
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,448
The others can't find out, right?

175
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,118
-What do you mean?
-Shut up and look forward.

176
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,538
Are you working undercover

177
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,124
to reveal the scam that's been
going on here against elders?

178
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,628
Am I right? I catch on quite fast.

179
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,422
How can I help you?

180
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,756
Do you want to do an interview?

181
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,843
Shall I bring some people
out to the garden one by one?

182
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,678
Look forward.

183
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,683
-Mr. Park.
-Yes.

184
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,728
It's her first time here,
but the craft class has begun.

185
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,730
Ma'am, you can follow this gentleman.

186
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,111
That rude punk.

187
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,530
How dare you.

188
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,059
Hello.

189
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,861
All right, please remember
everyone at your table.

190
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,905
They're your team members.

191
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,325
From now on, each class will be
a team-based workshop.

192
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,994
Today... Ta-da!

193
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,914
You'll make snowflakes
using colored paper.

194
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,969
We were partners
during the exercise class too.

195
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,180
I think we're meant to be.

196
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,183
Kim Hee-seon is my favorite actress,

197
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,394
and you happen to have the same name.

198
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,065
You can just call me Hyun.

199
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,240
HYUN

200
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,269
That's it for today's class.

201
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,396
I hope you all have a good lunch,

202
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,773
and enjoy the performances as well.

203
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,195
She went to the exhibit hall.
She said she wanted to check it out.

204
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,407
It's okay, then. We'll just eat this
without her and get going.

205
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,117
Let's eat.

206
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,662
-All right, let's eat.
-It's too bad.

207
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,914
These are all Hye-ja's favorites.

208
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,292
You can eat more today.

209
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,669
You need energy to sing well.
You know that, right?

210
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,047
Hye-ja, my shrimp chips...

211
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,692
What are you doing? What's with you?

212
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,703
I heard women are most attracted
to men in uniforms.

213
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,999
Weren't you smitten by me when
you saw me in the school uniform?

214
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,501
What is this about?

215
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,630
You promised me to accompany me
to the buffet if I get a girlfriend.

216
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,590
So what?

217
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,676
You're the only girl I know,

218
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,845
so I'm making you fall for me again.

219
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,642
-Hey, get lost. Get lost!
-Wait!

220
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,145
You have something here.

221
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,608
Gosh, I told you to get lost.

222
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,278
For goodness' sake!
Has he gone crazy or what?

223
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,282
-It's odd.
-What's odd?

224
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:49,119
My heart fluttered a little
when I saw Yeong-su just now.

225
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,998
Girl, come to your senses.

226
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,711
I'm here.

227
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,968
-You were looking for me, right?
-No, I wasn't.

228
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,054
The cafeteria is on the right
at the end of the hallway.

229
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,765
They serve stamina-boosting dishes
every Wednesday, so don't miss it.

230
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,309
The exercise room is also called
"Rehabilitation Room",

231
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,562
but there are no exercise equipment
or shower facility.

232
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,314
There's no fitness trainer either,
and I don't have a wife.

233
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,525
Sorry?

234
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,028
I rarely tell people this,
but since you're asking...

235
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,906
Well, I'm still single.

236
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,742
I didn't get divorced
or anything like that. I'm single,

237
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,369
which means I've never been married,

238
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,121
which means I'm a bachelor.

239
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,039
I never asked.

240
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,669
Dentures? Dental implants?

241
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,881
They're all my teeth.

242
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,886
I feel that we're meant to be.

243
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,764
I'm feeling murderous intent.
Out of my way, please!

244
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,810
Gosh. I'm flustered.

245
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,688
I've never met a lady
who reacted this way before.

246
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,817
What part don't you like about me?
May I ask?

247
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,529
I can't name a specific part

248
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,617
because everything about you irks me.
Every part of you.

249
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,745
-Ma'am.
-"Ma'am"?

250
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,288
You're obviously older than me.

251
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:18,000
I think you should date a younger man.

252
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,169
Where can we find
a nice younger man for you?

253
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,880
You know what?
I just happen to be younger than you.

254
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,842
Judging from your face,
you can't be younger than me.

255
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,595
Some people guess as low as 58 for my age.

256
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,222
Who? Where do you meet these people?

257
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,892
-Hyochang Park.
-For goodness' sake!

258
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,039
Don't ever go down there.

259
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,041
Some people went down there
to check it out,

260
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,043
but none of them made it back.

261
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,757
Ma'am, wait up.

262
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,161
-Don't you see that?
-Pardon me?

263
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,163
My Chanel is there.

264
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,250
-You mean, this?
-That's not what I meant.

265
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,043
That's Chanel's seat.

266
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,045
Don't you get it?

267
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,843
You can sit here. I'm done.

268
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,019
Enjoy your lunch.

269
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,688
-I don't need this.
-My gosh.

270
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,111
Obnoxious people are everywhere.

271
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,905
Are you not going to eat this?

272
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,242
No.

273
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,001
Actually, I hate everyone here.

274
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,838
STATIONERY

275
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,633
Please! Please.

276
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,222
Darn it!

277
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,934
What are you doing here?

278
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,936
I'm doing this to go to the buffet
with you.

279
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,146
Come out!

280
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,190
Come out.

281
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,907
I didn't get it again.

282
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,701
Wait, are you trying get that one?
That steel ring?

283
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,538
Are you planning to seduce me
with that ring?

284
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,831
That 500-won ring?

285
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,958
When it comes to gifts,
what it is doesn't matter.

286
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,960
What's important is who gave it to you.

287
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,170
You drive me bonkers.

288
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,716
-You used to like me.
-Gosh!

289
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,970
Stop talking about the old days.
It offends me.

290
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,316
They must be selling an expensive
item by treating the elders well.

291
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,779
I wonder if
his investigation is going well.

292
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,829
Oh, ma'am.

293
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,873
It's okay. Relax.

294
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,584
You don't have to put on an act
when it's just the two of us.

295
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,128
I'm on your side, you know.

296
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,090
There will be fun performances
later. You should stay for them.

297
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,010
You really look like an employee here.

298
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,263
I am an employee here.

299
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,181
I know everything.

300
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,809
You're here as an undercover reporter.

301
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,855
My gosh. Ma'am, it looks like
you got the wrong idea.

302
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,023
I'm not here as an undercover reporter,

303
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,067
and I'm not even a reporter to begin with.

304
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,610
Are they bugging this room?

305
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,195
Gosh, what are you talking about?

306
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,742
-There are no bugging devices here.
-My gosh.

307
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,871
What's the matter with this lady?

308
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,873
She's very funny.

309
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,041
She thought I was here
as an undercover reporter.

310
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,043
Ma'am, I'm not a reporter.

311
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,213
-I guess you mistook me for--
-No, I didn't.

312
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,048
You know me well.

313
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,925
I know this guy well.

314
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,678
I see. I, too, know this guy very well.

315
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,555
I've known him for 20 years.

316
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,849
-Right? Hasn't it been 20 years?
-Yes, it's been 20 years.

317
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,025
Do you really work here? Why?

318
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,027
This place is nice.

319
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,778
Try all the classes today.

320
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,281
If you still don't want to stay,
I won't stop you.

321
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,034
Promise?

322
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,373
It's a promise.

323
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,213
Hey. You really...

324
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,090
What is going on?

325
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,469
Jun-ha really works here?

326
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,763
Why?

327
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,307
Why is working here better
than being a reporter?

328
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,683
Money?

329
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,894
Even if he wants a lot of money...

330
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,442
Seriously. Even after seeing this?

331
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,780
Why do they even take a nap as a group?

332
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,659
How can they sleep at a place like this?

333
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,245
They're not even home.

334
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,256
Welcome.

335
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,970
What are you doing here?
Where is Sang-eun?

336
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,471
Hyeon-ju, you're here.

337
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,889
I'm over here!

338
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,517
Yeong-su is helping me out.

339
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,310
That's unexpected.

340
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,486
CRAB TUNA MAYONNAISE

341
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,282
What's that?

342
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,075
You must be hungry.

343
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,953
You're too busy during lunch time
at the restaurant.

344
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,539
This is the only time you can eat,
but you came here.

345
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,624
You must be sick of leftover Chinese food.

346
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,220
Give it to me.

347
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,890
All you can do is make noodles

348
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,392
and ride a motorcycle.

349
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,811
You can't do anything on your own.

350
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,899
Here.

351
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,115
Hey.

352
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,702
Are you hitting on me?

353
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,078
No.

354
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,291
I do what I want to do as your man.

355
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,876
If you feel touched...

356
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,504
or fall for me,

357
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,465
that's your responsibility.

358
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,973
Ridiculous.

359
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,062
When the director comes,
introduce yourself right away.

360
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,813
-This is your chance.
-Okay.

361
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,023
Thank you for giving me chance.

362
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,107
-No problem.
-I'll work hard.

363
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,025
-Do your best.
-Okay.

364
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,818
-Here he comes.
-Hello.

365
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,111
Hello.

366
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,657
This is Byung-man, a friend of mine.

367
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,992
I'll work hard.

368
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,410
What is he doing here?

369
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,121
I'm thinking of putting him
on the stage later.

370
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,956
-What can he do?
-Well...

371
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,166
He can do a strength show.

372
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,751
-You're good at it, right?
-Yes.

373
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,127
Show him.

374
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,591
That's enough.

375
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,675
Can you try something else?

376
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,511
-You can spin nunchaku.
-Yes.

377
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,720
I can spin two.

378
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,806
Hey.

379
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,391
This is better than the newspaper.

380
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,684
Try it later.

381
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,852
Okay.

382
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,938
I'll try to be calm. Thank you so much.

383
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,815
Yes, try to be calm.

384
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,155
Ma'am, do you see
that empty seat over there?

385
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,115
You can sit there.

386
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,075
I'm leaving soon.

387
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,785
Suit yourself then.

388
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,312
-Oh, my.
-No!

389
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,689
-Be careful.
-It must be hot.

390
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,074
What is he doing?

391
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,826
-Oh, my.
-Oh, no.

392
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,330
My goodness.

393
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,166
This man here

394
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,377
couldn't even walk three months ago.

395
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:26,006
How did he become so strong
even without much training?

396
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,217
It's because his bones have become strong.

397
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,179
Do you want to see
how strong his bones are?

398
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,555
Let me show you.

399
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,933
Do you see this?

400
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,436
This is used to hold up heavy things

401
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,146
at construction sites.

402
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,982
I'm going to hit this man
with this stick now.

403
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,193
The stick might break,

404
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,445
but this man won't.

405
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,705
Let me try again.

406
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,789
Here we go.

407
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,125
My goodness.

408
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,793
Oh, no.

409
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,882
You didn't break it beforehand?

410
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,884
I was supposed to?

411
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,513
Do you hear that sound?

412
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,766
He might look okay on the outside,

413
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,852
but his bones are wrecked inside.

414
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,604
Do you know why?

415
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,939
His bones are too weak.

416
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,483
I told him

417
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,193
to take this supplement,

418
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,612
but he didn't listen to me.

419
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,822
That's why his bones are wrecked now.

420
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,908
Take the supplement from now on.

421
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,159
Thank you.

422
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,744
You can leave the stage now.

423
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,996
Let's give him a big hand.

424
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,877
Take the supplement.

425
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,422
Take the supplement for three days,
and you'll be fine.

426
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,093
He ended up in that state

427
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,887
because his bones are weak.

428
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,682
And what's crucial to bone health?

429
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,891
-Calcium.
-Calcium.

430
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,309
You all seem to know.

431
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,771
That's right.
Our special technology allows us

432
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,982
to concentrate calcium.

433
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,233
It's right here.

434
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,526
Concentrated calcium.

435
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,944
I knew it.

436
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,654
Here it comes.

437
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,489
All right. Take a look.

438
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,284
This contains calcium

439
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,787
plus vitamins A, B, C, and D.

440
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,789
Low energy in the morning?

441
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,250
Blurry vision? Dry mouth?

442
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,002
Cracked nails?

443
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,878
Take three of these pills a day

444
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,755
for just a month.

445
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,800
All of those symptoms will disappear.

446
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,302
You're trying too hard.

447
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,680
Everyone, you don't have to buy this.

448
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,932
We don't want you to think

449
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,310
we're only being nice to you
to sell things.

450
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,438
You don't have to buy anything.
Just come here to have fun.

451
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,898
On your way out,
take a box of tissues for free.

452
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,235
Then you'll lose money.

453
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,945
We just want to show our respect.

454
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,031
We don't care about money.

455
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,700
Don't you have to sell something
to get paid?

456
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,244
-Exactly.
-You're right.

457
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,496
But we'd rather lose our money.

458
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,083
It'd be too much trouble
for you to pay back the money.

459
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,295
You're giving us so much for free.
We feel bad.

460
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,756
We're giving it to you
because you deserve it.

461
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,007
This is a new approach.

462
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,926
It's true that these calcium
and vitamin supplements

463
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,762
are good for you.

464
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,221
I'm speaking from experience.

465
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,723
There you go.

466
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,141
Nice build-up.

467
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,310
Calcium strengthens your bones,

468
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,687
and the vitamins

469
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,398
will fill you up with energy each morning.

470
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,566
Still,

471
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,651
you don't have to buy it.

472
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,154
This supplement sure can make you

473
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,865
stronger and younger in a short time.

474
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,867
However, if you come here,

475
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,870
work out, and laugh together,

476
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,122
it'll have a similar effect

477
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,709
even though it might take longer.

478
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,170
So don't feel pressured
to buy this supplement.

479
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,006
He's right.
Please give Mr. Lee a big hand.

480
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,801
You really don't have to buy it.

481
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,010
I want one.

482
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,554
Please don't buy it.

483
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,181
-Just take a look.
-I want one too.

484
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,058
-Just take a look.
-One here!

485
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,559
One over there.

486
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,645
-I want two.
-You want two?

487
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,271
I want two.

488
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,817
They're selling supplements after all.

489
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,112
Try and convince me.

490
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,655
I'll never fall for it.

491
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,989
See you on Monday.

492
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,788
I totally feel the holes in my bones
filling up.

493
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,581
I probably won't return it.

494
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,584
But I don't have any money.

495
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,461
I'll have to ask Mom for help.

496
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,052
Why are you already home?

497
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,846
Mr. Jeong is going somewhere tomorrow.

498
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,139
So we switched.

499
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,224
He is working today instead of me.

500
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,018
There is no cooked rice.

501
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,562
Just start it.

502
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,274
There is no hot water in the shop?

503
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,401
The instant hot water dispenser
is broken again.

504
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,487
You have to hold down the button
for quite a while.

505
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,170
It's not washed.

506
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,595
How was it today?

507
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,054
Was it fun?

508
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,222
Not really.

509
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,516
There were only old people.

510
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,684
It wasn't fun.

511
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:35,190
I really don't mind.
You can stay home if you want.

512
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,942
You don't have to force yourself
to go there.

513
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,946
Do you have something to tell me?

514
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,198
No.

515
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,824
Well...

516
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,661
-Mom.
-What is it?

517
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,371
Just

518
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,751
don't grab anything
until I'm done talking.

519
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,919
Okay.

520
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,670
Come on.

521
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:02,884
Your 25-year-old daughter...

522
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,344
What?

523
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,721
My nails keep getting cracked.

524
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,099
I told you to wear gloves.

525
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,186
How could you touch those chemicals
with your bare hands!

526
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,772
-Let me see.
-I'm fine.

527
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,565
I have to wash their hair

528
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,528
and curl their hair right away.
When can I wear gloves?

529
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,738
What were you saying?

530
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,617
-What?
-Your 25-year-old daughter what?

531
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,162
-Your 25-year-old daughter
-Yes.

532
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,248
will be good to you from now on.

533
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,333
Was that it?

534
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,252
It seemed like you wanted to say
something else.

535
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,546
No, that was it.

536
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,632
-I better go to my room.
-Okay.

537
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,425
I better do the laundry.

538
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,886
What is wrong with this hanger?

539
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,642
GOOD LUCK

540
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,602
So you failed to ask help from your mom?

541
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,064
Not only did I fail,
but I feel so depressed.

542
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,942
Can't you just return it?

543
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,528
Not only is it impossible to return it,

544
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,949
but my mom is so unfortunate.

545
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,493
She raised me for her entire life

546
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,247
and expected me to make money now,
but I ended up like this.

547
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,627
If she raised a pig instead,
she could've sold it at least.

548
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,923
-So you'll earn money yourself?
-Yes.

549
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,009
A lot of money.

550
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,972
-Hye-ja.
-What?

551
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,141
Do you know how to drive a dump truck?

552
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,810
No.

553
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,854
Then do you know how to use
a sewing machine?

554
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,690
-Hey, put that down.
-I can't do any of those stuff.

555
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,154
I saw Lee Jun-ha.

556
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,573
He must be really busy
with his new job and all.

557
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,658
Right. He's busy selling supplements.

558
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,035
-What?
-What?

559
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,288
He's busy selling supplements
at an exhibit hall.

560
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,962
She's gotten so lame
after turning into an old lady.

561
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,840
I really wish it was a lie too.

562
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,885
What? Are you serious?

563
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:13,056
Lee Jun-ha is selling supplements
at an exhibit hall? Why?

564
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,683
He wears a goofy outfit
and even sings a trot song.

565
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,144
He treats the old ladies
with so much respect.

566
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,063
He seemed like a totally different person.

567
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,731
Gosh, really?

568
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,733
Isn't it someone who just looks like him?

569
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,862
You should've asked him
what he was doing there.

570
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,113
I did.

571
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,157
But he said it was all
because he enjoyed hanging out

572
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,618
with elder people and avoided
talking to me.

573
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,162
It was impossible to communicate with him.

574
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,209
It's not easy for a person
to act so differently.

575
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,087
From a reporter to a swindler?
There's nothing in common.

576
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,589
-Did something happen?
-Like what?

577
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,092
Didn't you say his grandmother
passed away?

578
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,135
Maybe he changed because of the shock.

579
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,846
Hye-ja, isn't it because of you?

580
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,139
Me?

581
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,266
He liked you so much

582
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,979
but suffered a mental breakdown
after you suddenly disappeared.

583
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,190
The tragic story of a man
who was abandoned

584
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,234
and hurt by his first love.

585
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,321
Hey, are you shooting a movie
or something? First love my foot.

586
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,658
It ended before anything happened
between those two.

587
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,785
I wouldn't say there wasn't anything
at all between us.

588
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,456
Even so, I don't think it's because of me.

589
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,961
And if it really is because of me,
that's very worrisome as well.

590
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,756
I'm going back on Monday,
so I'll ask him again.

591
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,633
For his grandma's sake.

592
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,427
How is that place?

593
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,594
Is it fun?

594
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,887
"Fun"?

595
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,058
Everyone in that place is weird.

596
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,810
This ugly old man

597
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,980
said he liked me even though
he only saw me once.

598
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,400
And there was this old lady who bragged
and asked me if I knew Chanel.

599
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,235
She kept talking to me nonstop.

600
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,196
And another lady put something
in my mouth without even asking.

601
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,533
That's right. Elder people
always act like that.

602
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,661
My grandma used to sit perfectly still

603
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,497
and suddenly started yelling
and getting angry.

604
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,626
Don't you think old people
are on slow-motion?

605
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,129
When they cross the road, they're like...

606
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,345
Right. And some act like they're on
silent mode or something.

607
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,224
Their faces and hands tremble
and vibrate like mobile phones.

608
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,770
Seriously, I can't stand
hearing this anymore.

609
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,981
What do you know? I'm like that too.

610
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,151
They walk like that because
they have weak knees.

611
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,196
In their minds, they're already
running as fast as they can.

612
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,990
Although you may take it for granted,

613
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,159
seeing well, walking well,
and breathing well

614
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,079
are not things that
we can take for granted.

615
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,206
We feel very thankful.

616
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,292
Our bodies feel different each day.

617
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,586
Do you guys even know that?

618
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,381
-I'm sorry, Hye-ja.
-I'm sorry.

619
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:56,052
-Forget it. I'm leaving.
-Hye-ja, wait.

620
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,777
I didn't even walk that long.
My legs hurt.

621
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,278
Those brats.

622
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,158
Let's see if they can say that
when they get old.

623
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,124
Only if I'm still alive then.

624
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,012
RECRUITMENT NOTICE FOR CALL CENTER

625
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,014
"A person with a nice voice.

626
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,641
Receiving calls from customers."

627
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,400
Eggs for sale.

628
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,027
I have fresh eggs for sale.

629
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,947
Eggs! Eggs...

630
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,240
Give me one egg.

631
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,534
-I don't sell just one egg.
-Why not?

632
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,411
I only sell them by cartons.

633
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,746
I just need one. Sell me one egg.

634
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,832
If I sell one, there will be
one missing from the carton.

635
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,710
This is for something very
important. Please sell me one.

636
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,795
My goodness.

637
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,716
-How much is it?
-It's fine.

638
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,551
I'll go somewhere else.

639
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,480
Yes. This is just the egg!

640
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,985
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am!

641
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,989
Why is my seat belt on?

642
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,033
Ma'am!

643
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,035
Ma'am!

644
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,871
You said age doesn't matter.

645
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,040
It's true that age doesn't matter.

646
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,543
Ma'am.

647
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,381
Our company has no competitors
and is a real blue ocean business.

648
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01,844
If you have the skills, anyone can
work here regardless of age or sex.

649
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,512
But...

650
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,765
Hold on.

651
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,978
Hey, find the person who posted
this recruitment notice

652
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,607
and the person who sent this lady
up here, and fire them.

653
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,901
I can do anything.

654
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,531
-Ma'am, close your eyes.
-Okay.

655
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,952
Which side did you hear that from?

656
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,539
-This side.
-At least you can hear.

657
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,707
I can hear well.

658
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,877
Of course you do. For now, you do.
But ma'am...

659
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,923
Hey, you punks! Come here
and take her away. Hurry.

660
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,551
I don't know if you'll believe me,

661
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,971
but I am 25 years old.

662
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,974
If your grandson is 25,
you should bring him here.

663
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,726
I'm saying, I am 25.

664
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,145
I turned my watch the wrong way,

665
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,274
and I ran again and again
to save my dad's life.

666
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,943
Eventually, I saved my dad

667
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,320
but I ended up getting old.

668
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,539
My gosh.

669
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,624
Ma'am, you got the job.

670
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,543
You got the job.

671
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,170
Guys, how could she
tell such a ridiculous lie

672
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,131
without even blinking?

673
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,634
If you had this kind of ability,
you should've told me so.

674
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,635
CUSTOMER LURING TECHNIQUES

675
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,096
Yes, sir. Did you come out of the bank?

676
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,764
Good job.

677
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,726
Then take those twenty million won
and go home.

678
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,853
Do you have a fridge at home?

679
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,897
Then put that cash in the freezer.

680
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,941
You don't have a safe, do you?

681
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,818
Then put it in the freezer

682
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,445
and meet your friends,

683
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,698
-and act like nothing's wrong.
-Here, look at this.

684
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,992
Right here. Let's see.

685
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,078
Do you see the number here?
Call this number

686
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,955
and start talking according to this.

687
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,623
-Now?
-Yes, now.

688
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,174
Hello?

689
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,176
It's your grandma.

690
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,095
There's been an accident,

691
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,847
so I'm at the hospital.

692
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,432
I don't have a grandma.

693
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,811
Hello.

694
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:19,106
This is the welfare foundation,
"Look at the Green Pine Tree."

695
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,776
At our foundation,

696
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:25,112
we are holding a fundraiser
in order to help out

697
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,281
elder people around us who are in need.

698
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,741
This is phone scam, isn't it?

699
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,368
How did you get my number?

700
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,953
Tell me how you got my number.

701
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,374
Fine, do whatever you want, punk.

702
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,628
How was I?

703
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,089
You did well. Stand up.

704
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,174
-Everyone, gather around.
-Wait.

705
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,468
Isn't this a phone scam?

706
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,137
It's not phone scam!

707
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,432
How could this be phone scam?

708
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,685
I've been running this business
for 25 years.

709
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,188
Do you think I'd still be here
if this was illegal?

710
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,689
I would've gotten arrested.

711
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,566
How could you say that it's...

712
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,194
Did you forget to fix
the security cameras? Did you?

713
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,654
The security cameras?

714
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,864
Where's... Where's Lieutenant Kim?

715
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,451
Gosh, you don't need to cuff me.

716
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,620
Just hold my arm. Yes, you too.

717
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,163
It'll take me two years to be released.

718
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,873
Manage all financial statements carefully.

719
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,168
The company needs to go public,
so manage all reports well, okay?

720
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,503
Did Lieutenant Kim go somewhere?

721
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,671
Let's go.

722
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,092
Oh, boy.

723
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,137
Gosh, I have blisters.

724
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,224
Ma'am!

725
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,810
You, the lady who's looking around now.

726
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,023
Can we have a quick chat?

727
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,284
What did you say after eating the egg?

728
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,205
"Yes. This is just the egg."

729
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,875
Oh, my.

730
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,627
Your voice is just perfect for eggs.

731
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,087
Is there such a voice?

732
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,214
I've been selling eggs for two decades.

733
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,550
I've recorded over 60 people's voices,

734
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,594
saying "Eggs for sale."

735
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,053
Your voice is perfect for it.

736
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,306
With your voice,
my eggs will sell like hotcakes.

737
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,643
So are you asking me
to record that line for you?

738
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,937
-That's right.
-How much will you pay me?

739
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,440
The base pay will be low,

740
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,358
but the commission is high.

741
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,943
I'll give you ten percent

742
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,696
of the net sales from each egg sold.

743
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,033
How much do you make off an egg?

744
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,118
I'm left with barely anything.

745
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,996
You can either raise my base pay

746
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,915
or give me 25 percent of the net sales.

747
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,049
Let's settle at 20 percent.

748
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,554
Are we recording it here?

749
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,931
Listen carefully.

750
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,183
To move people's hearts,

751
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,685
your voice has to have an echo.

752
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,563
Eggs for sale!

753
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:06,941
You heard that echo, right?

754
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,943
Oh, that echo?

755
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,069
All right, here.

756
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,573
Here we go. You're ready, right?

757
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,203
Eggs for sale.

758
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,704
Check out these large, fresh--

759
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,164
Gosh, stop.

760
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,584
Why are you trying to make
your voice sound so pretty?

761
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,044
Just be natural.

762
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,339
Think of a wild hen laying eggs.
It has to sound fresh.

763
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,840
All right, cue!

764
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,468
Eggs for sale.

765
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,304
Check out these large, fresh eggs.

766
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,474
Okay! That was very nice.

767
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,355
You gave me your contact information
and bank account number,

768
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,816
so I'll make sure
I send you all your commission.

769
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,025
Thank you.

770
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,946
DONGAN CHINESE RESTAURANT

771
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,075
What brings you here?

772
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,453
Fine, I lost.

773
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,830
I was an idiot.

774
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,125
Thinking that I'd be able
to date you again.

775
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,586
You're right.

776
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,005
I didn't know much about women.

777
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,093
But I promise you that I'll beat up
that guy if I ever see him again.

778
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,013
So...

779
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,142
stand tall, and don't be upset.

780
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,479
And you should go to his wedding,
looking stunning.

781
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,274
Look like the prettiest woman
in the whole world

782
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:34,069
so that he regrets leaving you
and marrying another woman.

783
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,739
-Well...
-And...

784
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,657
when you're at the wedding,

785
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,909
make sure you ask for two meal tickets,

786
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,077
including mine.

787
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,163
I knew it. You jerk!

788
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,709
Gosh, Hyeon-ju. My leg hurts so much.

789
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,794
It looks like you'll have to walk me home.

790
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,880
You're being ridiculous. Get lost!

791
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,800
Stand tall!

792
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,385
Be confident!

793
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,534
I found this on the street.

794
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,829
Yeong-su.

795
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,873
This is so pretty.

796
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,833
It's not the ring that's pretty.

797
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,127
Your hand is pretty.

798
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,883
I was crazy.

799
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,802
I must've been out of my mind.

800
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,644
Darn it!

801
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,772
One, two.

802
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,569
They really should use
one-touch lids for these things.

803
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,534
I'll sprain my wrist at this rate.

804
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,205
I need to protect my voice.

805
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,677
In a way, he did look like
he was enjoying the job.

806
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,638
It's true that these calcium
and vitamin supplements

807
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,598
are good for you.

808
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,016
I'm speaking from experience.

809
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,144
I get that money is important,

810
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:33,063
but why would that young guy
waste his time with a job like that?

811
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,607
Was I really wrong about you?

812
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,109
Lee Jun-ha.

813
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,030
-Hello.
-Hello.

814
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,240
Come on in.

815
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,700
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

816
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,243
Hello, you're back.

817
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,287
-Hello.
-Hello.

818
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,538
-Go on in.
-Please go in.

819
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,250
Are you returning this?
I'll take care of it.

820
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,668
This isn't important.

821
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,378
I have to talk to you about something.

822
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,880
Can you spare me a moment?

823
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,549
I'm a little busy right now,
so I'll talk to you later.

824
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,092
See you in a bit.

825
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,511
Please go in. Go on in.

826
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,392
Ma'am!

827
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,396
Is that a thimble or what?

828
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,939
Do you want to watch a movie with me?

829
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:16,899
I'm busy today.

830
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,734
-Then how about tomorrow?
-I'll be busy tomorrow.

831
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:19,776
What about the weekend?

832
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,403
I have a feeling that I'll get sick.

833
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,530
-Can I take you out for a meal?
-I'm on a diet.

834
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,699
-Then how about some salad?
-I'm allergic to leafy greens.

835
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,618
-What about beef?
-I'm a Hindu.

836
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,244
-Since when?
-Since yesterday.

837
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,289
She sure doesn't let her guard down.

838
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,999
You passed my test.

839
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,897
You can have this.

840
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,232
No, thank you.

841
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,609
I'll just get myself another one.
Have this.

842
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,194
I told you I don't want it.

843
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,958
Everyone who wants a refund
is waiting at the office now.

844
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,677
What's the matter?

845
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,429
Please send this to my son.

846
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,474
You mean, your son in Los Angeles, right?

847
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,726
The same address as last time?

848
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,144
Please do it for me.

849
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,814
Did the red ginseng arrive safely?

850
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,148
It did.

851
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,942
I checked, so don't worry.

852
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,819
I'll send this first thing tomorrow.

853
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,529
Thanks for your help, every single time.

854
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,198
It must cost quite a bit
to send parcels overseas.

855
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,158
We can definitely take care
of expenses like this.

856
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,289
You're all here. Please give me a moment.

857
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,041
Ma'am, you're here to return that, right?

858
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,544
There are six of you here.

859
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,087
With you, there are seven in total.

860
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,630
Mr. Park will take care of it.

861
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,923
Please have a seat.

862
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,300
Have a seat.

863
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,261
-Just a moment, please.
-Be careful.

864
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,099
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

865
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,687
You drive me bonkers.

866
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,522
What on earth are you doing?

867
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,858
-I'm sorry.
-Do you know how expensive this is?

868
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,818
Do you see this logo here or not?

869
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,320
I do.

870
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,529
What does it say?

871
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,406
"NASA"?

872
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,657
That's right, you fool.

873
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,118
The National Aeronautics
and Space Administration

874
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:36,079
developed this supplement.

875
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,124
Do you know how astronauts travel in space

876
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,084
for hundreds of days
or up to multiple years,

877
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,712
while living on things
that don't even look edible?

878
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,256
It's all because of this supplement.

879
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,341
Do you want to hear a story?

880
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,676
-Yes.
-In Arizona,

881
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,720
-there were twin brothers.
-Okay.

882
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,890
-And the older one became an astronaut.
-Yes.

883
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,351
Once, the older brother was
out in space for two years,

884
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,435
only taking this.

885
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,103
-When he got back to Earth,
-Yes.

886
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,856
they weren't twins anymore.

887
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,901
-They looked like father and son.
-Oh, my.

888
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,569
Do you know what happened?

889
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,864
The older brother, who took this,
didn't age a bit

890
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,658
while the younger brother did.

891
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,785
It's that effective.

892
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,536
To get my hands on this,

893
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,914
I had to ask so many people for help.

894
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,124
I bought them millions of won
worth of drinks.

895
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,085
-I see.
-My goodness.

896
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,504
Why couldn't you get some more?

897
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,924
You can't get more
just because you want to.

898
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,551
It's not even for sale.

899
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,512
I just got some for myself.

900
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:34,638
Why isn't it for sale?

901
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,015
Sadly, it has one drawback.

902
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,184
It weakens your bones.

903
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:43,188
When astronauts come back
to Earth after some years,

904
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,857
they can't walk properly because
their bones have become weak.

905
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,568
So it's useless?

906
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,779
You don't understand.

907
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,574
We sell calcium supplements, right?

908
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,036
They're a perfect combination.

909
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,707
This weakens your bones,
and the calcium strengthens them.

910
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,675
Hey. "NASA".

911
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,761
It's obviously fake.

912
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,681
You've been doing this for years.
Why isn't your acting

913
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,015
getting any better?

914
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,601
We might get caught because of you.

915
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,770
Acting is too difficult for me.

916
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,939
I'm too nice by nature.

917
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,609
Am I a good actor
because I'm mean by nature?

918
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,406
If you think about it,
Jun-ha is incredible.

919
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,867
He is so good. So good.

920
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,579
How can he fool people so perfectly?

921
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,999
Hey. This job isn't really for him.

922
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,919
But we're making money
thanks to him. So be nice to him.

923
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,506
-I have to be nice to him?
-You complain too much.

924
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,681
Hee-seon!

925
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,767
Hee-seon!

926
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,562
I saw her here.

927
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,314
Hee-seon!

928
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,904
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

929
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,364
Please do me a favor.

930
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,408
Did the red ginseng arrive safely?

931
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,036
It did. I checked, so don't worry.

932
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,829
I'll send this first thing tomorrow.

933
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,624
This is crazy.

934
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,969
Isn't that for the Chanel lady's son?

935
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:49,648
The whole room is packed with boxes.

936
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,025
How many are there?

937
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,486
You must have done this many times.

938
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:58,031
You never sent them after getting paid?

939
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:02,702
This is different
from just selling supplements.

940
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,580
How can you do this to the lady?

941
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,708
How much do you get paid for this?
100 million won a year?

942
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,544
Is this the job you like?

943
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,423
I'm going to send them.
It's cheaper that way.

944
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,801
You found your place.

945
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,136
I knew you were a good talker,

946
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,889
but I didn't know
you were good at lying too.

947
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,892
Move. I'll send them.

948
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,897
-Ma'am.
-Stop me, and I'll report you.

949
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,025
-You can't send them.
-You just don't want to.

950
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,570
I don't have her son's address.

951
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,698
What?

952
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,033
There is no son.

953
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,748
Her son

954
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,753
might be living abroad or dead.
Nobody knows.

955
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,464
She never heard from him
after he left home.

956
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,008
So I wanted to do something nice.

957
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,846
She's become a lot happier
since she heard from her son again.

958
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,224
Then why did you get paid?

959
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,436
Nothing is for free.

960
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,313
The lady is happy to hear from her son,

961
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,647
and I'm happy to make some money.

962
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,441
It's a win-win situation.

963
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,484
You...

964
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,030
I'll tell her everything.

965
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,032
-I'll...
-Go ahead.

966
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,035
Go to the lady and tell her.

967
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,121
"Your son has been out of reach for years.

968
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,832
No one knows if he is still alive.

969
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,751
Maybe he is doing very well.

970
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,754
He is just not talking to you."
Tell her that.

971
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,423
Stop.

972
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,842
Quit this job.

973
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,763
This is my workplace.
Why do you tell me to quit my job?

974
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,391
This is not just an ordinary
workplace. This is a bad place.

975
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,228
What is an ordinary workplace?

976
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,399
A company? A government office?

977
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,652
It's all the same.

978
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,403
They might look different,

979
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,949
but they all work for their
own benefit, not anyone else's.

980
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,702
I'll tell her everything.

981
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,538
I'll make sure...

982
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,000
you quit working here.

983
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:15,669
Fine, go ahead.

984
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,672
Even if everyone asks for a refund
and stops coming here,

985
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,632
what can I do?

986
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,761
You stop coming here too.

987
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,306
This is a bad place.

988
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,726
Now you know.

989
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,729
So don't ever come back here.

990
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,401
All right. I won't.

991
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,069
I can't stand

992
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:44,781
this mean, unfair place anymore.

993
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,789
Oh, my.

994
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,128
The thing is...

995
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,764
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

996
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,111
I called a repairman. Leave it.

997
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,863
Why would you waste money?

998
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,410
It doesn't work. I already tried it.

999
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,422
I said, it doesn't work!
Don't you hear me?

1000
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,582
MIDNIGHT SNACK BAR

1001
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,101
One udon, please.

1002
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,111
Enjoy.

1003
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,751
You ordered something else.

1004
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,130
You made some money?

1005
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:53,678
From being loved by all the old people,

1006
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,557
has your life improved now?

1007
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,359
She says she misses you.

1008
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,573
Hye-ja misses you.

1009
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,122
Thanks to you, she had so much fun.

1010
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,459
When she was with you,

1011
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,461
even if all she had was

1012
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,880
a bowl of udon and a bottle of soju
with you,

1013
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,382
she felt happy.

1014
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:37,096
Something urgent came up,
and she couldn't even call you.

1015
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,518
She didn't want to leave either.

1016
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:45,063
I'm just trying to tell you
that you should love yourself more.

1017
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,482
That will help you become
more generous with yourself.

1018
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,070
That's heart-wrenching.

1019
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,991
Don't let her suffer again.

1020
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,746
I feel so bad for you.

1021
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,415
Just in case you get the wrong idea,

1022
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,960
I didn't nag her to tell me
like a stalker or something.

1023
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:11,256
We were just having a casual
conversation and I found out.

1024
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,384
You know Hye-ja, right?

1025
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,512
My niece who is in Germany.

1026
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,975
If she comes back from Germany, Hye-ja

1027
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,894
will be very upset.

1028
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,773
Kim Hye-ja.

1029
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,459
Tell Hye-ja in Germany.

1030
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,796
All I've done is bump into her
a few times in this neighborhood.

1031
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,383
Tell her not to make such a big fuss
after only sharing a bowl of udon.

1032
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,261
Whether she comes back to Korea
or whether she's upset or not,

1033
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,846
tell her it's none of my business.

1034
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,641
And let me ask you one last favor.

1035
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,522
Please stop your curiosity towards me
from now on.

1036
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,986
I don't want to see you ever again.

1037
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,342
Are you the Jun-ha I know?

1038
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,638
That face is so unfamiliar and scary.

1039
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,726
Eggs for sale.

1040
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,688
Check out these large, fresh eggs.

1041
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,276
Yeong-su, come have some eggs.

1042
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,637
A 48-HOUR SLEEPING SHOW!

1043
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,180
WHO IS THAT?

1044
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,848
PLEASE WAKE HIM UP

1045
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,101
TEACH HIM SOME PROFESSIONAL SKILLS
AND SEND HIM TO A FACTORY!

1046
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:32,730
I'LL GIVE YOU 100 CANDIES
IF YOU WAKE HIM UP

1047
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,566
He doesn't even pitch in a penny
for the electricity bill.

1048
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,777
He should turn off the computer at least.

1049
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,531
OH MY GOSH! SHE LOOKS LIKE A GHOST

1050
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:42,907
IT'S AN OLD LADY

1051
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,034
THAT GRANDMA JUST SITTING THERE
IS MORE INTERESTING

1052
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,661
He's broadcasting something.

1053
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,666
"A 48-hour Sleeping Show"?

1054
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,419
What is a Sleeping Show?

1055
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,045
A SHOW WHERE YOU DO NOTHING BUT SLEEP

1056
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,797
LYING DOWN AND EARNING CANDIES FOR FREE

1057
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,173
IT'S SUCH A COMFORTABLE WORLD

1058
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,925
A show where you do nothing but sleep?

1059
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,552
Why would you watch that?

1060
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:07,181
LOL

1061
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:11,102
LADY, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

1062
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,228
Me?

1063
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,105
How old am I?

1064
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,940
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S FROM THE STONE AGE

1065
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:18,401
YOU SHOULD TREAT ELDERS WITH MORE RESPECT

1066
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,153
STOP PRETENDING TO BE NICE

1067
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,612
I'm 25 years old.

1068
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:22,989
MY GOODNESS

1069
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,991
THAT'S SO FUNNY! OH MY GOSH

1070
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,580
SPECIAL THANKS TO IM CHANG-JUNG,
CHOI MOO-SEONG, KIM BYUNG-MAN

1071
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,598
Do my eyes look alive to you right now?

1072
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:49,849
Tell your niece.

1073
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,893
That the Lee Jun-ha she knows is dead.

1074
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,896
If I can make everything go back
to the way it was...

1075
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,482
Please, just once.

1076
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:58,858
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

1077
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,986
Did my prayer really come true?

1078
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,906
It was possible to return back
to the way I was!

1079
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,073
Jun-ha.

1080
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,701
Promise me you will become a reporter.

1081
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,786
Don't ask me why.

1082
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,537
So you should be my girlfriend.

1083
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,580
Don't ask me why.

1084
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,457
Oh, my. Jun-ha!

1085
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,542
Wait. What's going on?

1086
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,045
Jun-ha.

1087
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,089
