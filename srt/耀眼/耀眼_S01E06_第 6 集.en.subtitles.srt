1
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,785
NO FOOD, NO BATHROOM, NO EDITING
A 48-HOUR SLEEPING SHOW!

2
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,912
What? What is it? What do you want to say?

3
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,998
I almost made it for 48 hours,

4
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,958
but failed because you kept talking to me.

5
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,711
What is wrong with the camera angle?

6
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,297
I'm certain I adjusted it
in this direction last night.

7
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,342
I really didn't do anything.

8
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,094
The camera just moved on its own.

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,220
Darn it.

10
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,306
I could've gathered a ton of candies.

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,185
I wonder how many I've received.

12
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,103
ACCUMULATED CANDIES: 11,250

13
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,982
One, ten, hundred, thousand...

14
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,363
One, ten, hundred, thousand...

15
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,908
Ten thousand?

16
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,786
Ten thousand? 11,250 candies?

17
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,537
11,250 candies!

18
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,627
Thank you!

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,712
Who is it? Who sent me all these candies?

20
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,380
Who sent them? Why?

21
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,882
What on earth happened?

22
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,843
A grandma? Who? Hye-ja?

23
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,595
A grandma?

24
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,348
Hold on. Let me rewind this.

25
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,892
ARE YOU REALLY 25?

26
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,936
I'm telling you, I'm really 25.

27
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,773
You don't believe me, do you?

28
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,400
Getting old happens in a flash,
you idiots.

29
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:54,781
Now you're spending time watching
this worthless guy's show,

30
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,283
but, suddenly, you'll end up like me.

31
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,410
I didn't know either.

32
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,913
That I'd suddenly grow so old.

33
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,166
I LOATHE SMELLY OLD LADIES

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,294
"Loathe smelly old ladies"?

35
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,504
Hey.

36
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,675
I totally loathe losers like you too.

37
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,927
YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 CANDIES!

38
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,303
Stop sending candies.

39
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,182
Stop sending them. Buy your mothers
a beverage with that money.

40
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,810
Stop sending them.
Why aren't you listening?

41
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,812
I told you to stop!

42
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,031
SHOPPING MALL

43
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,037
Why don't you get something better
instead of kitchen supplies?

44
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,914
I wanted a new frying pan.

45
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,374
-This is good enough for me.
-Goodness.

46
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,042
Don't regret it later.

47
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,753
I'll go pay for this
and get gift certificates.

48
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,213
-Wait for me here.
-Okay.

49
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,265
Oh, gosh.

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,976
What is that sound?

51
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,670
CAPACITY REACHED

52
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,264
Mom.

53
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,849
This is an announcement.

54
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,311
The alarm went off due to an error.

55
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,231
We apologize for the concern
and inconvenience this has caused.

56
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,900
This is an announcement.

57
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,320
The alarm went off due to an error.

58
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,657
We apologize for the concern
and inconvenience this has caused.

59
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,120
You must've been scared.

60
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,415
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm okay.

61
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,839
-It's all right.
-Mom...

62
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,716
It's okay.

63
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,991
Oh, you must be that lady.

64
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,786
You look like the lady I heard about.

65
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,873
-Didn't you record "Eggs for sale"?
-Right, well...

66
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,709
Mr. Choi told me so much about you.

67
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,295
He said you live
at the hair salon up the street,

68
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,006
so I've been meaning to visit you.

69
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,215
I see. But why?

70
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,218
You have such a heartwarming voice.

71
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,930
Our theme for this quarter
is Mom's home-cooked food.

72
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,768
I got a young female employee
to record it, but it wasn't good.

73
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,771
If you're okay with it,
I'd love to have you record

74
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,315
-our sales pitch.
-No, I can't.

75
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,901
Even last time, I kept saying
I couldn't do it,

76
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,071
but the owner of the egg truck
looked so scary that I had to...

77
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,156
I'll pay you well.

78
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,286
-Let's go.
-Oh, okay.

79
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,874
Marinated bulgogi is on sale
for 12,000 won per 600g

80
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,461
at our fresh meat section at the moment.

81
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,881
Moms' home-cooked food
is always the best, isn't it?

82
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,676
There's a buy-1-get-1-free
promotion going on

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,137
for the healthy beverage,
Chamcham Soy Milk.

84
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,267
Yes, this is it.

85
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,146
Were you a dubbing artist or something?

86
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,731
You're so good at this.

87
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,110
I think I'm coming down
with a cold though. Was it okay?

88
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,319
Yes.

89
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,031
We're getting tuna and fresh sashimi
the day after tomorrow.

90
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,950
It'd be great if you could
help us out again.

91
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:53,037
I need to check my schedule,
so I can't confirm that right now,

92
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,208
-but I'll try to fit it in.
-Okay, thank you.

93
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,919
Well, how much would be enough
for your pay?

94
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,380
How much are you thinking?

95
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,384
Could you pay me in products
instead of money?

96
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,929
Right, rubber gloves.

97
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,557
Mom's hands are always chapped.

98
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:25,111
-Ultra thin medium pads with wings.
-Are you looking for something?

99
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,906
-Ultra...
-Most young ladies use this.

100
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,324
My daughter uses it too.

101
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,078
I'll give you many samples.
Tell your granddaughter to try it.

102
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,164
-It's okay.
-What's wrong?

103
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,373
Would you like more samples?

104
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,877
-No, it's okay. Have a good day.
-Why? It's good.

105
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,421
I'll give you two more samples.
Just take this one...

106
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,261
This one is good because it's thin
and highly absorbent.

107
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,056
Since you're slim...
Small will be fine, right?

108
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,059
This will fit you.

109
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,900
What are you talking about?
Why would I need this?

110
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,154
What's with her?
I was just trying to help.

111
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,614
Seriously.

112
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,991
What happened? Why...

113
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,829
ADULT DIAPERS

114
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,346
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

115
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,182
You can get off now.

116
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,644
Please be careful.
Ma'am, your hand, please.

117
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,231
Please be careful.

118
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,815
Watch your head.

119
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,984
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye.

120
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,152
Goodbye.

121
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,077
-Get home safely.
-Look at that.

122
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,120
He saw me but didn't even say hello.

123
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,792
He needs to be taught
how to respect the elderly.

124
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,169
Why haven't we seen you
at the exhibit hall?

125
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:09,131
Yesterday, a singer came and sang for us.

126
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,675
That place isn't fun.

127
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,762
Even that time, I only went there
to check it out.

128
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,140
Chanel or whatever her name is
didn't come today either.

129
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,810
The place feels empty without you ladies.

130
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,771
Chanel? Why? Is she sick?

131
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,608
Who knows? She was always so snobby.

132
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,610
I wonder what got on her nerves this time.

133
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,697
What are you talking about?
Why would I need this?

134
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,997
Ma'am, ma'am!

135
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,748
Give me that.

136
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,751
My place is that way. Why did you
come from that direction?

137
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,838
You didn't come today,
so I thought you might be sick.

138
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,008
I was fine, but I'm suddenly
starting to feel sick.

139
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,927
Look at her playing hard to get.

140
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,054
She drives me crazy. Ma'am!

141
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,640
Kim Hye-ja!

142
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,061
That old man keeps following me.
Do something, please.

143
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,732
What will you do for me
if I make him leave?

144
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,151
I'll do anything you ask me to,
so do something.

145
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,114
Sir, let's talk.

146
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,369
What are you doing?

147
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,042
Look, young man.

148
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,712
I need to have a chat with her,
so step aside.

149
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,381
Well, I'm her brother...

150
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,759
I mean, I'm her grandson.

151
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,761
You're her grandson?

152
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,098
My grandmother doesn't like you,
so please leave.

153
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,892
Do you drink?

154
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,896
-Sir, please leave.
-What about grilled pork?

155
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,650
I know a good grilled pork place.

156
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,151
Let's go.

157
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,037
What is all that?

158
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,997
Did you rob a grocery store or something?

159
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,083
I recorded their sales pitches
and got these in exchange.

160
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,251
What's taking him so long?

161
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,961
Yeong-su? What's he doing now?

162
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,756
-I asked him to do something.
-Gosh, tell him to come back in.

163
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,093
All he does is sit in front
of the salon and yawn all day.

164
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,428
All our neighbors are saying
the coal briquette smoke

165
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,097
turned him into an idiot.

166
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,723
Mom, don't put these away.

167
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,683
-I'll do it when I get back.
-Hey, wait.

168
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,945
Sir.

169
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,780
Hye-ja...

170
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,783
I mean, my grandma

171
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,953
can't date you because she has
a bit of a situation.

172
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,871
I was in the same boat.

173
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,290
I was never in a situation
where I could date someone.

174
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,543
And 40 years went by like that.

175
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,879
-But the thing is... Flip this one.
-Oh, okay.

176
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,217
Anyway, that's your situation.

177
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,679
My grandma has a legitimate reason
why she can't date you.

178
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,974
By the way, will grilled pork be enough?

179
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,893
We should have some ribs too.

180
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,229
Bing...

181
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,898
Where's "go"?

182
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,276
You're not quite there yet.

183
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,154
Do you really want to date my grandma?

184
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,989
Then you'll have to pass a few tests.

185
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,657
That much I was expecting.

186
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,159
Okay, sounds good. Then

187
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,036
order the second thing
from the top of the menu over there.

188
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,331
You need good eyesight
to recognize my grandma, right?

189
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,259
RIB EYE, 16,000 WON PER 100G

190
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,304
-Excuse me.
-Would you like anything else?

191
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,599
We'd like to order the second thing
from the top of the menu,

192
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,352
-rib eye. We'll get two servings.
-Sure.

193
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,939
Bingo! You got it!
You got the correct answer!

194
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,865
How could you eat meat in that situation?

195
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,285
What? Rib eye?

196
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,039
Did he feel like your future self?

197
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,667
Yeong-su, will you answer me?

198
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,877
What?

199
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,629
IS HE BEING SCOLDED FOR REAL?

200
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,047
IT'S JUST LIKE WHEN MY MOM SCOLDS ME

201
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,131
What's that?

202
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:20,883
HE GOT CAUGHT

203
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,218
IT FEELS LIKE I'M BEING SCOLDED TOO

204
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,804
Are you crazy?
Why would you broadcast this?

205
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,723
It's because

206
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,017
everyone was curious.

207
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,895
Who? Why would anyone want
to watch you being scolded?

208
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,563
That's not it. They're curious about you.

209
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,648
Me?

210
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,024
Why?

211
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,069
My goodness.

212
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,947
Did you tell them about me?

213
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,281
You did.

214
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,743
I'm telling you, I'm really 25.

215
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,788
You don't believe me, do you?

216
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,998
Getting old happens in a flash,
you idiots.

217
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,208
-Do you see that?
-Now you're...

218
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,668
I think you have a talent.

219
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,503
spending time watching
this worthless guy's show...

220
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,796
What's that?

221
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,964
Oh, that?

222
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,092
They're chipping in to get me a projector
for watching soccer games.

223
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,595
-I didn't know either.
-The computer monitor is too small.

224
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,514
Also, overseas games
are broadcast late at night.

225
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,140
I couldn't watch them in the living room.

226
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,064
Delete the video.

227
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,526
Delete it from every site.

228
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,696
No! Do you know how many
new viewers it got me?

229
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,073
Why don't we broadcast together?

230
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,157
I already have some ideas.

231
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,743
Yeong-su, is this fun?

232
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,328
Absolutely. Don't you think it's fun?

233
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,371
Hey!

234
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,999
Do you think I'm funny?

235
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,128
Don't you feel sorry
for your little sister who got old?

236
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,547
Do you think it's just funny?

237
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,132
No.

238
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,259
Now that it happened...

239
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,677
"Now that it happened"?

240
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,887
I mean...

241
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,473
If you got old anyway, making some money

242
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,725
might make you feel better--

243
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,976
Yeong-su!

244
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,733
You know you're stupid, right?

245
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,734
I do.

246
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:06,030
But imagine someone
goes to a crowded place

247
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,782
and shouts, "Kim Yeong-su is stupid!"

248
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,367
-Again?
-I mean,

249
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,077
what I'm saying is

250
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,706
You asking me to broadcast with you

251
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,125
is no different from that.

252
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,212
I know there's nothing I can do
about me getting old.

253
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,924
Still, I don't want to

254
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,176
advertise it to everyone!

255
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,011
All right.

256
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,098
Come look at this.

257
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,183
West sea mudflats!

258
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,311
-Yes, yes.
-This is all a mudflat.

259
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,729
It woke you up?

260
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,857
I did turn down the volume.

261
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,946
I'm not really watching it.

262
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,908
It's just that the menopause
keeps me awake.

263
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,206
Mom.

264
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,916
Yes?

265
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,709
How is going through menopause?

266
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,877
Is it tough?

267
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,799
It is.

268
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,844
Even if it's winter
and you're just sitting still,

269
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,597
you get hot flashes.

270
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,933
You get

271
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,185
forgetful too.

272
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,646
Your body

273
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,565
feels heavy all the time.

274
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,902
Also, you get pretty irritable.

275
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,948
That's why you're like that to Dad.

276
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,534
I've been always like that to your dad.

277
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,954
Why?

278
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,123
Are you not feeling well?

279
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,626
That's not it. I was just wondering

280
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,212
how much worse it'd get.

281
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,971
These days,

282
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:58,517
I'm surprised every morning
when I wake up.

283
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,022
I get worse each day.

284
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,192
Yesterday I made it that far.

285
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,194
But today I'm out of breath.

286
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,159
How much worse will I get from now on?

287
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,910
I wonder that.

288
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,624
I heard old people even have
trouble going to the bathroom.

289
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,964
If I had gotten old gradually,

290
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,427
would it have been easier
for me to accept it?

291
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,220
I'm curious.

292
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,975
It's like you're going back
to being a baby.

293
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,812
You can't even stand up

294
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,774
without someone's help.

295
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,321
If you look at it that way, it's simple.

296
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,617
You're going back...

297
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:03,332
You can't live
without help from others anymore.

298
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,594
Babies...

299
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,057
are at least cute.

300
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,825
Hye...

301
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,368
Auntie!

302
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,295
We need help with announcements today.

303
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,256
What announcements?

304
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,008
I'm not good at this.

305
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,678
I'm a bad liar.

306
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,513
At places like this, you have to pretend

307
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,974
even bad products are good, right?

308
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,018
By the way, this flatfish looks great.

309
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,645
This is farmed, right?

310
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,772
It's wild?

311
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,858
At this price?

312
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,818
My goodness.

313
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,111
It looks so fresh.

314
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,322
Then you wouldn't have to travel
all the way to the fish market.

315
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,532
I can't believe it.

316
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,702
Because of the low price,
I was so sure it was farmed.

317
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,620
It looks really good.

318
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,543
Where did you learn this?

319
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,670
From a place I went to
a couple of days ago...

320
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,047
Was it okay?

321
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,801
You have no black plastic bags?

322
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,637
We only have garbage bags.

323
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,639
There's nothing I can do.

324
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,184
Just wrap it in some newspaper
or something.

325
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,644
I can't carry it around as it is.

326
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,688
Forget it. I'm not buying it.

327
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,069
Gosh, what an obnoxious old lady.

328
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,450
DONGAN CHINESE RESTAURANT

329
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,798
Hey.

330
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,677
Gosh, when did you come?

331
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,012
You look startled.

332
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,805
You still haven't got used to seeing me?

333
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,973
That's not it.

334
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,602
I just delivered a group order.
That's what distracted me.

335
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,354
Your dad didn't seem to recognize me.

336
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,856
I even asked for the usual chunjang
as a side to my fried rice

337
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,859
to jog his memory.

338
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,486
He's a little distracted these days.

339
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,987
He's getting forgetful, that old...

340
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,036
Welcome. Sit wherever you want.

341
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,705
One jjajangmyeon, please.

342
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,873
Sure.

343
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,792
One jjajangmyeon!

344
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,017
Here you go.

345
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,145
Enjoy.

346
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,663
Do you want some water?
Or some jjamppong soup?

347
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,956
It's okay.

348
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,963
You know her?

349
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,471
Here's some water.

350
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,889
I said, it's okay.

351
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,688
I said I didn't want any water.

352
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,200
Did I do something wrong?

353
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,618
I shouldn't have given her the water?

354
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,912
You don't understand because you're young.

355
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,916
I'll get going.

356
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,920
Her phone.

357
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,715
I think it's the old lady's.

358
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,925
I'll take it. I can give it to her.

359
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,646
Was she a race walker when she was
young? She walks so fast.

360
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:37,856
Excuse me!

361
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,943
PRAHA MOTEL

362
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,866
A motel?

363
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,701
Why did she

364
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,745
go into a motel?

365
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,498
I still have to return her phone.

366
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,502
I never got inside a motel
when I was young.

367
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,836
And here I am now.

368
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,467
-What are you doing?
-What?

369
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,718
You're so silly.

370
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,470
Who are you?

371
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,599
Are you here to see the
elder lady in room 203?

372
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,102
Room 203? Yes, the pretty old lady.

373
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,187
Yes. You mean Lady Prague.

374
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,816
-Are you her friend?
-I need to give her this.

375
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,526
Why is she Lady Prague?

376
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,155
The lady in room 203 is
a long-term guest at this motel.

377
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,408
I think it's been almost a year.

378
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,618
A year?

379
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,621
A long time ago, I heard
she went to Prague

380
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,666
with her husband on her honeymoon.

381
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,585
I think she's quite wealthy.

382
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,796
She went on an overseas trip

383
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,798
when everyone couldn't even afford
to buy rice.

384
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,510
Excuse me. Ma'am?

385
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,014
This. You left this in
the Chinese restaurant.

386
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,109
Thinking that I have
to see those old farts

387
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,027
until they become
100 years old is terrifying.

388
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,657
Five people? Five?

389
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,910
Why don't you go out and try it then?

390
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,620
They can't even hear well,

391
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,914
and I have to say the same thing
to them dozens of times.

392
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,251
Once I tell them, they forget
instantly. It's so frustrating.

393
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,672
I'd rather go sell underwear
at a market or something.

394
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,261
Mr. Lee, you came empty-handed.

395
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,890
-Oh, the insurance?
-Yes.

396
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,976
Do I have to do that?
I can just sell more products.

397
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,729
When will we make enough money
by selling vitamins and supplements?

398
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,650
Don't worry about it. Your sales
performance is always top-notch.

399
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,027
Keep up the good work.

400
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,613
And while you sell products,
you should sometimes

401
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,656
promote our insurance products.

402
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,534
I'm just saying,
that would be much better.

403
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,331
I haven't seen Lady Chanel
come here lately.

404
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,626
She has to spend money
for us to increase our sales.

405
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,295
You should bring her.

406
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,547
Do you think she's a kid
that I can just carry over here?

407
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,133
Shall I go and bring her? In return,

408
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,011
if I bring her in and improve our sales,

409
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,888
you better not get in my way. Deal?

410
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,933
Are you still addicted to stuff
like gambling and making bets?

411
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,310
You make bets on people now?

412
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,978
Why? Are you afraid?

413
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,772
If you're afraid, get lost.

414
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,067
I'm going home.

415
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,070
Okay, Jun-ha.

416
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,572
Good job today.

417
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,743
Why are you so mean to him?

418
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,203
He's so arrogant.

419
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,871
That young little punk.

420
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,709
We're both doing something that
we shouldn't be proud of.

421
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,753
Does he think he's any different or what?

422
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,047
Didn't I tell you before?

423
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,883
He's not someone like us.

424
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,094
Goodness.

425
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,638
You and I are the same.

426
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,850
Let's see who lasts longer here.

427
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,024
You're late.

428
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,151
I went to see Hyeon-ju on the way home.

429
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,196
What is that?

430
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,744
It's a projector! A projector!
Is this for me?

431
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,204
Is this really for me? Seriously?

432
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,458
Come to my room later.
I'll make you into a star.

433
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,626
Okay? See you soon.

434
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,672
Someone's happy.

435
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,467
Where did you get the money?

436
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,263
I got paid for working at the
supermarket and had some saved up.

437
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,056
You should've spent it for yourself.

438
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,851
There's nothing I want to buy
after getting old.

439
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,653
You should be nicer to Mom.

440
00:26:56,364 --> 00:27:00,452
I heard women lose their temper
over nothing during menopause.

441
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,371
You're really a frustrating guy yourself.

442
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,458
You never reply when someone talks to you.

443
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,802
I keep getting shorter,
but my toenails keep growing.

444
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,932
-I'll cut them for you.
-No, I'll do it.

445
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,602
I was cutting mine anyway.
You can't even see well.

446
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,605
I can wear the glasses you bought me.

447
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,711
I'm sorry.

448
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,229
It looks way clearer than I thought.

449
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,606
Isn't it awesome?
It's like we're in a movie theater.

450
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,733
Is it difficult to turn this on?

451
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,568
No. You can even connect this
with your phone.

452
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,112
So wherever you go with your phone

453
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,571
becomes a movie theater.

454
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,365
Isn't it amazing? It's awesome.

455
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,909
Help me.

456
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,120
Sure! Just ask me and I'll help you.

457
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,185
Yes?

458
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,697
-What do you want?
-This won't take long.

459
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,240
I have nothing to say, so leave.

460
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,909
She told you to leave.

461
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,120
This is why you never get to date.

462
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,626
What do you want?

463
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,975
Right there.

464
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,145
That square.

465
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,584
I'm freezing to death.
When is she coming out?

466
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,002
It's so cold.

467
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,675
PRAHA MOTEL

468
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,391
-What are you doing here?
-What about you?

469
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,812
At this motel?

470
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,522
How could a girl go in there alone?

471
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,774
-Give it to me. I'll deliver it.
-I said it's okay.

472
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,527
-I'm not okay with it.
-He's a regular that orders often.

473
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,071
I don't care who it is.
I don't want you going in there!

474
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,532
Don't deliver to places like this
from now on.

475
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,033
If your dad's busy, you can call me.

476
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,370
What's gotten into him?

477
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,084
What is this?

478
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,586
I hate this feeling.

479
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,839
Darn it!

480
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,468
Goodness. Why is my heart thumping? Why?

481
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,512
Does that look cool to you?

482
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,681
He had snot running from his nose.

483
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,016
Darn it!

484
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,937
Here.

485
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,108
Why are you giving free dumplings
for two bowls of jjajangmyeon?

486
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,861
-You'll go bankrupt.
-Why are you eating that?

487
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,572
Hey, did you always put onions
in your jjajangmyeon?

488
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,074
I can't eat onions, so that's why
I always went to your restaurant.

489
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,910
-But I just saw onions in there.
-What are you saying?

490
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,921
How could onions
not be in jjajangmyeon? Stupid.

491
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,803
Thank you.

492
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,641
Thank you.

493
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,936
But aren't you afraid
staying here like this?

494
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,730
You should go back home.

495
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,985
After my husband died,
and my only son went to the U.S,

496
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,154
my house felt so empty.

497
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,074
So I just kept thinking I'd stay
for one more night

498
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,827
and it's already been over a year.

499
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,206
It was room 203.

500
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,835
The room that my husband and I
stayed at in Prague.

501
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,922
That's why...

502
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,551
I've only told this story to you

503
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,929
and Mr. Lee.

504
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,972
Mr. Lee? Oh, right.

505
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,934
You two must be very close.

506
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,980
A lonely person usually
recognizes another lonely person.

507
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,068
Mr. Lee is such a lonely person too.

508
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,071
He is left alone after
his grandmother passed away.

509
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,864
And that issue with his father...

510
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,616
His father?

511
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,452
Yes, we're strangers now.

512
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:38,581
So let's just divide up the money
and part ways.

513
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,500
BEWARE OF DOG

514
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,128
Hee-seon!

515
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,923
Hello, there.

516
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,680
I can't believe you wanted
to see me first.

517
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,556
-I feel flattered.
-Turn around.

518
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,517
Oh, okay. One, two.

519
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,769
Don't turn back around and listen.

520
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,523
I heard you have some connections
with the local cops

521
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,650
-in a bad way.
-Ma'am, I can explain--

522
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,569
See what you can find out on
Mr. Lee Jun-ha at the exhibit hall,

523
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,822
especially about what happened
between him and his father.

524
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,533
Don't leave out any details.
I want to know everything.

525
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,617
Then

526
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,412
in return, would you go out
on a date with me?

527
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,462
I must say, she's irresistibly charming.

528
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,171
Darn it.

529
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,802
I got my guys to ask around about him,

530
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,804
and it sounds like
he's in a complicated situation.

531
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,182
I feel bad for him.

532
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,851
I think he even hurt himself
to protect his grandmother,

533
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,603
but she passed away right after that,

534
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,438
and he's been sued
for falsely accusing his dad.

535
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,777
You see, every handsome man
has a rough life, just like me.

536
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,903
Thanks for the information.

537
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,031
You know that you shouldn't tell
anyone else about this, right?

538
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,616
What? Why--

539
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,660
It'll be our secret.

540
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,995
Our secret?

541
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,125
Just between you and me.

542
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,968
Is he not home yet?

543
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,187
Isn't your neck cold?

544
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,231
You should've worn a scarf.

545
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,566
I'm fine. I'm young, you know.

546
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,694
What are you up to these days?

547
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,822
Well, you know.

548
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,116
I watch TV and go for walks.

549
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,076
Come to the exhibit hall.
You must be bored.

550
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,286
I got a friend.

551
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,871
Who?

552
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,582
Someone.
I'll introduce you to her next time.

553
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,917
Here.

554
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,963
I'm sorry I have to ask you
every single time.

555
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,215
I should send it
to the same address, right?

556
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,716
Yes.

557
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,844
And I'm just wondering.

558
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,638
He hasn't replied, right?

559
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,975
Yes, not yet.

560
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,935
He'll write back soon.

561
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,441
Now, I see what's going on.

562
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,403
I guess you've been giving him allowance.

563
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,655
Go in. I'll be back tomorrow
to pick you up.

564
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,781
Ma'am.

565
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,825
Watch out.

566
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,244
This guy is dangerous.

567
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,873
He stirs up the protective instinct
with those sad-looking eyes of his.

568
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,125
It's okay. Please go in.

569
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,796
Good night.

570
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,718
We can talk at the exhibit hall tomorrow.

571
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,430
Look at you running away
now that I've caught you red-handed.

572
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,807
I knew you'd be here.

573
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,142
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

574
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,810
I have to talk to you about something.

575
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,895
Ma'am!

576
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,563
Please be careful.

577
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,648
This punk is a con man.

578
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,609
Not a swindler like me.

579
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,194
He's a real con man
with a criminal record.

580
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,654
Aren't you still making
frequent visits to the court?

581
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,741
Then tell me how innocent
your life has been.

582
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,034
I'm all ears.

583
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,036
Everyone has flaws.

584
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,537
It's really all the same.

585
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,831
We all do bad deeds.

586
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,543
You should be making an effort
to get along with your co-worker.

587
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,878
Look.

588
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,047
That guy hit his own father
and killed his grandmother.

589
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,132
I can't be friends with such a scumbag.

590
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,511
Gosh, how could you say that?

591
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,930
-Darn it.
-My goodness.

592
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,016
-You piece of--
-No! Don't. Please don't.

593
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,018
You mustn't hit him. Don't.

594
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,103
Don't do it, please.

595
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,282
You see,

596
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,035
I wanted to tell you

597
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,830
that I'm sorry for jumping
to conclusions about you.

598
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,541
I found out just today

599
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,961
about everything you had been through.

600
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,338
I also heard you gave up
on becoming a reporter.

601
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,049
I might not have become a reporter
even if that had never happened.

602
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,927
What if this is just how I am?

603
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,764
Whenever I get angry,
I punch people first.

604
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,974
I can't control my temper

605
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,768
and always cause trouble like
a lunatic. What if that's how I am?

606
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,186
No.

607
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,147
I know very well
that it's not how you are.

608
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,525
My father is a total scumbag,

609
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,653
and my mother abandoned me
when I was a baby

610
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,071
because she didn't want to struggle.

611
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,073
Their child can't be a good person.

612
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,742
Don't talk about yourself in that manner.

613
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,704
Stop saying things like that!

614
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,541
Please stop reminding me
that I'm at rock bottom.

615
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,585
Gosh, I'm only living because I can't die.

616
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,921
But you keep telling me
that I'm at rock bottom

617
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,131
and that I have to do better.

618
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,717
Don't make such irresponsible remarks.

619
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,722
Do my eyes look alive to you right now?

620
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,849
Do they?

621
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,771
This isn't called living.

622
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,235
Tell your niece

623
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,155
That the Lee Jun-ha she knows is dead.

624
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,848
Wash up before you sleep.

625
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,560
Take your socks off at least.

626
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,230
Gosh, take your socks off.

627
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,609
You've never taken your own socks off.

628
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,029
When I die, I want you to take

629
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,739
your socks off and put them on...

630
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,494
Please give me just one chance.

631
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,579
If I can go back in time,

632
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,123
and if I can make everything go back
to the way it was...

633
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,751
Please, just once.

634
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,986
When did I fall asleep?

635
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,042
My gosh.

636
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,836
-Look at this.
-Oh, dear.

637
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,338
Gosh, how did we live like that
in the old days?

638
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,507
-Oh, boy.
-It's not here.

639
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,176
I'll find it for you.

640
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,137
Stop looking for it. It's right here.

641
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,264
That's right.

642
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,307
Hye-ja.

643
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,059
-Yes?
-Can I get a cup of coffee?

644
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,185
Sure.

645
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,148
You know I don't like
my coffee sweet, right?

646
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,775
Just add one spoonful of cream.

647
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,655
What did you just say?

648
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,949
Gosh, you're still young.

649
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,909
Are you already becoming forgetful?

650
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,120
She said, just add one spoonful of cream.

651
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,080
Young?

652
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,166
I'm young?

653
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,099
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

654
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,061
Mom, Mom!

655
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,524
Mom! Look at me. I look young, right?

656
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,609
Ma'am!

657
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,861
Ma'am, yes!

658
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,530
Ma'am, look at me. How old do I look?

659
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,825
What do you think? You look like
a young lady in her 20s.

660
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,035
I do?

661
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,287
Thank you, ma'am!

662
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,663
-Mom!
-Gosh.

663
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,131
How did this happen?

664
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,591
Why, all of a sudden?

665
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,306
Did my prayer really come true?

666
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,227
Right, I aged like that overnight.

667
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,645
Becoming young overnight is...

668
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,812
No.

669
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,774
It was possible to return back
to the way I was!

670
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,942
Right?

671
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,362
My gosh, Hye-ja.

672
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,738
Hye-ja.

673
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,075
You were this pretty.

674
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:24,416
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

675
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,877
Gosh, have you lost your mind?
I almost hit you!

676
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,712
Hey, look at me. It's me, Hye-ja.

677
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,131
-So what?
-It's me, Hye-ja!

678
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,217
I'm Kim Hye-ja!

679
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,054
What's wrong with her?

680
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,098
Did she get that from Yeong-su?

681
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,229
I can run. I can run now.

682
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,439
I can move my legs however I want!

683
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,733
My knees no longer make
that cracking sound!

684
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,193
Yes!

685
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,503
Gosh, you startled me.

686
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,382
Hey! I'm the 25-year-old Hye-ja!

687
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,968
So what? Did you get turned down again?

688
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,177
What do you mean?

689
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,388
Did you get turned down by the guy

690
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,098
who wants
to become a reporter and go crazy?

691
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,017
Oh, Jun-ha.

692
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,893
Right. Jun-ha.

693
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,775
-Ma'am.
-Hey.

694
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,821
-You're the hairdresser's daughter.
-Hello.

695
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,782
Jun-ha is not home.

696
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,493
He won't come home until late.

697
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,704
-Because of his part-time job.
-I see.

698
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,664
Why are you out of breath?

699
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,042
-Do you want some water?
-Yes, please.

700
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,967
Here. Drink it.

701
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,762
-Thank you.
-No problem.

702
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,225
-Well, ma'am...
-Yes?

703
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,854
-Please stay healthy.
-What?

704
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,232
Oh, my. Thank you.

705
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,610
Promise me.

706
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,528
Okay.

707
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,723
My girl.

708
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,897
Why are you outside?

709
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,943
Were you waiting for me?

710
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,283
You're the best.

711
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,455
What do you say to a bowl of udon with me?

712
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,127
Let's go.

713
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,588
Let's go.

714
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,641
What is it?

715
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,978
Is there something wrong?

716
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:35,399
No. It's just that you're so pretty.

717
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,734
Gosh, what's with you?

718
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,528
You scared me.

719
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,577
Seriously...

720
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,709
Well, your udon is here.

721
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,794
Here you go.

722
00:45:56,753 --> 00:46:00,382
-Extra noodles for my regulars.
-Thank you.

723
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,059
Eat slowly. You'll get an upset stomach.

724
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,692
Dad, I have to be somewhere.

725
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:19,985
Is that okay?

726
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,198
-See you later.
-Hye-ja!

727
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,202
MIDNIGHT SNACK BAR

728
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,625
Hey. He'll leave soon.

729
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,043
So just--

730
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,004
Oh, my. Jun-ha!

731
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,840
Wait. What's going on?

732
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,909
Don't.

733
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,120
It'll hurt.

734
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,249
It'll hurt you.

735
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,713
It'll hurt you for a long time.

736
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,216
Okay?

737
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,063
I feel better,
but this is embarrassing though.

738
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,610
You were cute.

739
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,194
It was okay.

740
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,831
There's no place...

741
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,876
I haven't lived in except for Jeju Island.

742
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,339
My dad kept running into money problems.

743
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,053
I moved every year in elementary school.

744
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,599
That sounds tough.

745
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,601
It must have been hard to make friends.

746
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,189
Wherever I lived,

747
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,151
I always thought
I was living there only temporarily.

748
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,199
I never understood what it was like
to become attached to an area.

749
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,285
But now...

750
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,580
I'm starting to understand it.

751
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,001
Why? I kind of like our neighborhood.

752
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,921
Except that people talk too much.

753
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,591
It's quite nice in the spring though.

754
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,010
Flowers are everywhere...

755
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,679
It's beautiful.

756
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,722
It's pretty nice.

757
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,183
I see.

758
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,103
Let's see it together.

759
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,152
Spring.

760
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,987
Let's see it together.

761
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,629
I must be getting drunk.

762
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,756
I'm burning up.

763
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,970
Shall we go?

764
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,515
Let's go.

765
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,047
Get home safely.

766
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,550
Okay.

767
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,555
I'm going in.

768
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:15,989
See you tomorrow.

769
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,501
What should I do?

770
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,003
"See you tomorrow."

771
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,758
Why would he say that?

772
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,676
My goodness.

773
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:02,410
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

774
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,838
Are you going on a date, Hye-ja?

775
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,465
I envy you. You should enjoy it
when you can.

776
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,176
Don't be silly. It's not date.

777
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,928
Who is it? Is he handsome?

778
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,721
I can't deny that he's attractive.

779
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,308
Men must have a big build.

780
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,601
And they have to be tall.

781
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,478
He's not that tall.

782
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,814
Just about 187cm?

783
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,608
I guess you can say
he's a pretty tall guy.

784
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,861
Gosh, I'm not that sure.

785
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,779
Everyone else says he's so handsome,

786
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,823
so I just nod along.

787
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,825
See you, then.

788
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,062
He's so handsome.

789
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:12,939
Totally.

790
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,108
He looks so dashing.

791
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,527
You've passed!

792
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,136
How was that?

793
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,567
Wait, the other foot.

794
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,528
Yes!

795
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,286
Did you have fun?

796
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,958
I held out my arms, and my friends

797
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,209
all shouted like this.

798
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,627
How do I look?

799
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,296
Do I look pretty right now?

800
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,174
People say that I'm pretty.

801
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,885
But I'm not sure.

802
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,770
This tastes nice.

803
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:35,730
You don't like it?

804
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,129
Shall I carry it if it's heavy?

805
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,922
What? Oh, it's okay.

806
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,176
It's not heavy.

807
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,328
Did you take care of that thing
from before?

808
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,872
What thing?

809
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,000
When you came to take back your watch,

810
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,920
you said it was something
that you couldn't give up on.

811
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,423
Yes. Thanks to you.

812
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,345
By the way,

813
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,557
can you promise me one thing?

814
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:41,564
Promise me you will become a reporter.

815
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,110
Just promise me.

816
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,861
Don't ask me why.

817
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,865
Okay. Then--

818
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,909
But you shouldn't

819
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:57,205
tell me to become a news anchor
or something. That's cruel.

820
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,750
I wasn't about to say that.

821
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,045
Then what is it?

822
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,716
I will become a reporter
just like you said.

823
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,885
So you should...

824
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,764
be my girlfriend.

825
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,391
Don't ask me why.

826
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:23,982
Silly.

827
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,035
What is this?

828
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,912
What...

829
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,956
What is wrong with me?

830
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,051
Jun-ha.

831
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,723
I feel very strange.

832
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,770
What is wrong with my body?

833
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,258
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

834
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,635
Do you want to go to the hospital?

835
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,362
Jun-ha.

836
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,661
Can I please

837
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,704
hug you just this once?

838
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,231
Jun-ha.

839
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,359
Even if

840
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,944
I go back,

841
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,322
you

842
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,158
better not forget me.

843
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,330
My memories...

844
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,710
are the only things that I can live with.

845
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,548
If you forget me,

846
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,677
I will be so upset.

847
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,197
I...

848
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,245
became an old lady.

849
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,248
Isn't it funny?

850
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,670
I find it funny too.

851
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,090
When I wake up from this dream,

852
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,180
I'll go back to being an old lady.

853
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,226
I'm sorry, Jun-ha.

854
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,229
I'm sorry.

855
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,677
Had I known I'd wake up like this,

856
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,680
I would've kissed him.

857
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,767
I'm thirsty.

858
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,697
I want 70 percent.

859
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,490
If you complain, I'll make it 80.

860
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,451
-What are you talking about 80?
-I want 90, then.

861
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,996
-What are you talking about?
-I'll be in your live broadcast,

862
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,622
but I want 90 percent of the candies.

863
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,041
There will be no negotiation.
We'll start this evening.

864
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,585
Get ready.

865
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,087
Deal.

866
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:05,323
PRAHA MOTEL

867
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,671
I'm even wearing a cover.

868
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,301
Let's go.

869
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,822
Don't worry.
We're slim, so no one can tell.

870
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,365
It's okay.

871
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,331
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

872
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:07,176
-Hey, hey, hey
-Hey, hey, hey

873
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,555
-What's wrong with my age?
-What's wrong with my age?

874
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,349
-When it comes to love
-When it comes to love

875
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,977
-Age doesn't matter
-Age doesn't matter

876
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,940
-We think the same
-We think the same

877
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,902
-And feel the same way
-And feel the same way

878
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,737
-You are
-You are

879
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:30,032
-My only true love
-My only true love

880
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:47,592
Come with me.

881
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,595
The flowers over there are so beautiful.

882
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,601
Gosh, don't worry about him.

883
01:04:56,684 --> 01:05:00,438
-I'll just go fix his bib.
-Don't bother.

884
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,523
He's very cranky.

885
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,901
I don't even think he showers. He stinks.

886
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:06,736
I'll be quick.

887
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,033
I'll fix your bib. That's okay, right?

888
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,794
Is there anything else you need?

889
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,731
This can't be repaired.

890
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:53,449
Sir, this watch...

891
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,491
This watch isn't yours, right?

892
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,578
There's something.

893
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,747
How lame. You like that loser, don't you?

894
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,874
-Cut it out.
-All women dream of

895
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:46,502
acting like Mother Teresa while
putting up with a loser like him.

896
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:48,546
Stop staring at your computer.

897
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:52,591
Can you please pay attention
to our family's situation?

898
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,176
Thank you.

899
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,678
This watch. What's going on?

900
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,596
That old man must've turned
the crown on the watch.

901
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,265
I can change things.

902
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,434
Wait, Hye-ja will help you.

903
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,685
Hye-ja is coming back?

904
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,021
-When?
-Soon.

905
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:07,898
