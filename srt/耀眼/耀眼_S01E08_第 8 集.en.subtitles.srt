1
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,908
I don't need any help, so--

2
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,369
Hye-ja will help you.

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,039
I can change things. I mean it.

4
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,415
Hye-ja is coming back?

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,500
-Yes.
-When?

6
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:43,960
Soon.

7
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,637
You're back?

8
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,183
Do you know how worried I was
that you'd never return?

9
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,102
I'm not actually back. I'm just briefly...

10
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,692
Not yet. I'm not ready yet.

11
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,573
Hello.

12
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,622
Did you even look forward to it?

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,500
For the real me to return?

14
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,753
Hui-seon!

15
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,338
-Shut your mouth.
-Done.

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,092
Hey.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,429
What was this called again?

18
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,932
Aura? No.

19
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,934
-Maura?
-Move.

20
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,103
Hold on. Aurora! Am I right?

21
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,816
Okay.

22
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,161
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

23
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,709
I love your new song.

24
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,295
You really are the best composer in Korea.

25
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,047
Why are you flattering me?

26
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,799
Do you need anything? What is it?

27
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,677
I heard you have some songs
hidden away for JYC.

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,886
Give us those songs.

29
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,639
Those songs don't match
with the singers from your agency.

30
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,851
Come on. It's up to the singer
to make it match.

31
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,018
-Give them to us.
-Hey.

32
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,854
I might take back the ones
I've given you already.

33
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,065
I brought coffee.

34
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:29,983
VOICE

35
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,487
Goodness.

36
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,406
Thanks.

37
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,118
Let's test the microphone
in the recording studio.

38
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,787
Anyone, get in there.

39
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,665
Sang-eun.

40
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,125
-Yes?
-Get in there.

41
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,002
Me?

42
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,510
I'll begin then.

43
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,861
For real? He's really going to
release your album?

44
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,614
Yes. The composer promised to
give me a song too.

45
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,450
He didn't charge you
ten million won or something?

46
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,743
It's not like that.

47
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,036
Wow, Sang-eun.

48
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,496
We can't just sit here like this!

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,498
-Let's go out!
-Okay. Let's go celebrate!

50
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,834
CHINESE FOOD

51
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,003
ORIGINAL DOLLS FOR SALE

52
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,635
Hey, doesn't this remind you
of the old days?

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,345
Did you give up on that watch?

54
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,804
Both the watch and the exhibit hall.

55
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,348
I won't have any regrets from now on.

56
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,683
You guys have to hang out with me
more often from now on. Okay?

57
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,518
-Of course.
-Okay!

58
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,065
Try this on. This looks perfect.

59
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,650
It looks weird.

60
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,401
Come on. You should try clothes like this.

61
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,154
I won't even be able to wear this
even if I'm young.

62
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,866
Do you want to go somewhere else?

63
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,035
Why? There are so many
pretty clothes here.

64
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,161
What do you think of this?

65
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,413
Won't it look great on me?

66
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,584
You must be very close to
your granddaughters.

67
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,919
I envy you.

68
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,381
This looks weird, doesn't this?
I won't buy this.

69
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,882
My gosh. Why?

70
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,133
You look dashing in it.

71
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,969
It just feels awkward
because it's a new look.

72
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,887
It looks really weird to me.

73
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,723
Come on. Even your grandma says
it looks pretty.

74
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,978
Your grandma has more sense
for fashion than you.

75
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,064
You should wear it when you're
young. Don't regret it later.

76
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,524
Don't you agree, ma'am?

77
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,402
Let's go.

78
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,615
Why does she keep calling you a grandma?

79
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,325
Hey, don't mind her.

80
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,369
I don't care. I'm totally fine.

81
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,662
You guys should keep shopping.

82
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,330
No. When I tried it on,

83
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,249
the needlework was so poor
that I didn't like it.

84
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,751
Right. Honestly, it didn't look good
on you. Don't you agree, Hye-ja?

85
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,628
You just said it looked good on me.

86
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,964
Hye-ja, you said it looked good too!

87
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,515
Those young brats don't know
how to respect elders.

88
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,600
Hey, aren't you guys hungry?

89
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,977
Look! Korean pancakes.

90
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,437
-Korean pancakes.
-Yes!

91
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,730
Hello.

92
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,897
How much are they?

93
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,191
We'll have three.

94
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,820
We'll get fat if we keep eating this late.

95
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,855
Go on in first.

96
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:05,364
MARBLE ICE-CREAM

97
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,748
Are we kids or what?

98
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,584
Let's do this to celebrate the fact
that I'm finally releasing an album.

99
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,044
Okay, let's do this.

100
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,797
I'm not really in the mood to take photos.

101
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,090
How about karaoke?

102
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,509
-That sounds great.
-I'm in!

103
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,690
Hye-ja has been asleep for so long.

104
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,986
-Isn't she so soundly asleep?
-Yes.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,738
What should we do?

106
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,116
Shall we extend our time?

107
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,576
We can do that when the owner is back.

108
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,120
-Hand me the sweater.
-Okay.

109
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,795
Back in the old days,

110
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,006
Hye-ja was the most energetic one
out of the three of us.

111
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,843
I bet she would've won if there was
an all-nighter challenge.

112
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,180
Hey, do you remember the time
when we learned that card game?

113
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,225
Gosh, don't even get me started.
I nearly died that day.

114
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,310
She totally got hooked.

115
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,728
She didn't let us go home

116
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,398
and made us stay up all night
for two days straight to play cards.

117
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,818
It came to an end because I begged
in tears to let us go home.

118
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,160
I won! I won this round.

119
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,411
Give me my--

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,957
Hye-ja, what about you?
I'll just take this. This is enough.

121
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,209
I need to use the bathroom.

122
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,255
Hye-ja, I need to relieve myself badly.

123
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,343
Use this.

124
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,971
I have to say, those were fun times.

125
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,391
I know.

126
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,025
Are you just getting home?

127
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,194
I heard you're selling your place.

128
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,321
The realtor, Mr. Kim, told me.

129
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,281
Are you planning to move?

130
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,035
I was going to,
but I'm still thinking about it.

131
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,206
I thought you were marrying
a nice lady or something.

132
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,417
-Go on in.
-Good night.

133
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,467
What if she comes back?

134
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,222
What if Hye-ja comes back?

135
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,023
I'll tell you how it happened.

136
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,776
My boss sent me on an errand
to pick up coffee.

137
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,779
I had to pick up coffee
for five or six people.

138
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,864
I had to carry it all by myself,

139
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,158
so I started sweating while carrying

140
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,245
Then when I got back...

141
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,998
LOOK TEN YEARS YOUNGER

142
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,792
Ten years?

143
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,919
Ten years won't be enough.

144
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,339
Lift this part and tighten the skin
right here.

145
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,384
Like this.

146
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,427
I'll still look like a granny.

147
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,764
Gosh, whatever!

148
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,114
Ma'am.

149
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,158
Level Four is a plastic surgery clinic.

150
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,868
Pardon?

151
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,370
The dental clinic is on Level Three.

152
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,374
You're right.

153
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,840
Wait!

154
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,383
Hello.

155
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,885
What brings you here?

156
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,054
I'm just here for...

157
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,185
Level Four is a plastic surgery clinic.

158
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,857
Yes, I see it here.
"Plastic Surgery and Laser Center".

159
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,462
We're here for a consultation.

160
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,173
-Both of you?
-Yes.

161
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,052
What does it say here?

162
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,472
Right? Why is the font size so small?

163
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,891
Shouldn't they be at
an eye care clinic instead?

164
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,060
Totally.

165
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,490
What did you just do?

166
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,076
-Pardon me?
-You took a photo of us.

167
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,162
-Sorry?
-You took a photo with your phone.

168
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,373
-No, I didn't.
-Then show me.

169
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,294
I'll delete the photo.

170
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,548
Here, I'm deleting it.
We're good now, right?

171
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,096
Is she getting married or what?

172
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,482
You think this is funny, right?

173
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,025
I bet you're thinking,

174
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,069
"She's old and wrinkly. No one
would even look at her,

175
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,904
so why bother? What a waste of money."

176
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,490
I'm doing this for myself,
not to show someone else.

177
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,409
We, old people, also look
in the mirror when we're

178
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,868
brushing our teeth in the morning.

179
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,288
I'm doing this because I want to be
happier every morning.

180
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,417
You, young people,
come here to get things done

181
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,961
because you're not happy with something.

182
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,464
Let's see. What are you not happy with?

183
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,384
Double eyelid surgery and inner
and outer corner fold removal

184
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,011
are a must for you to at least get
some sunlight into your eyes.

185
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,472
And look at that flat nose.

186
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,933
Do you get punched in the nose every day?

187
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,603
If you don't like your face,
go abrade it against the asphalt.

188
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,106
-Don't talk about my face that way.
-Why not?

189
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,858
Why can't I?

190
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,777
You guys can say whatever you want
about my old, wrinkly face,

191
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,112
but I can't talk about yours?

192
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,239
Is being old a crime?

193
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:24,201
Do we deserve to be mocked and made
fun of just because we're old?

194
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,245
Apologize to her.

195
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,165
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,959
You guys probably feel like
you'll never age.

197
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,005
Your desire to be beautiful
stays the same.

198
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,257
It's just the outer shell that ages,
you fool.

199
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,009
-Ma'am.
-What?

200
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,303
Oh, you can go in now.

201
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,221
I see, thank you.

202
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,225
Do I need to get a lot done?

203
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,312
PLASTIC SURGEON PARK JEONG-MIN

204
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,274
So how much do you need to get done?

205
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,653
He said injectable fillers
between eyebrows

206
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,156
and along the laugh lines would be
enough because I have a nice face.

207
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,909
He told me I only need injections
for my laugh lines.

208
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,411
I shouldn't have taken out so much cash.

209
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,747
We can wipe it off now.

210
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,457
-Okay.
-Okay.

211
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,965
Darn it.

212
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,052
Gosh. Hey.

213
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,387
How could you say "Darn it"
as soon as you saw my face?

214
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,681
-What do you want?
-What do you think?

215
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,141
Cut it out. Why are you here?

216
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,893
Have a seat here.

217
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,687
Fine, you can stand there.

218
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,192
Do you want to do a business with me?

219
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,153
"Business"? As if. You're jobless.

220
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,739
There's a new trend
amongst content creators.

221
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,742
You know We Got Married?
People pretending to be married.

222
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,995
It's so popular that its own fandom
has been created.

223
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,705
And you can rake in tons of candies.

224
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,791
-So what?
-Come on.

225
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,169
Do you want to be
in my We Got Married broadcast?

226
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,796
We'll split the candies in half.

227
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,049
Get out. Get out at once!
Do you think I'm crazy?

228
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,301
Why would I do that? Especially with you.

229
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,929
I knew you'd say that.

230
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,181
Can you just take my order, then?

231
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,769
A lowbrow like you can't afford
to eat at our restaurant.

232
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,813
-Just leave.
-I have money.

233
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,440
Treat me like a customer, will you?

234
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,280
What do you want?

235
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,953
This. And this.

236
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,830
I'll get this one too.

237
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,333
Give me everything from here to here.

238
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,128
Did you win the lottery?

239
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,254
Just give me my food.

240
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,252
The tangsuyuk is on the house.

241
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,129
It's 230,000 won, please.

242
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,304
Hyeon-ju, thanks for putting it on my tab!

243
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,513
Hey. Stop!

244
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,223
Hey!

245
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,808
Dad, I didn't!

246
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,435
I didn't put it on his tab!

247
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,479
Hey!

248
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,189
Gosh.

249
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,997
Which one is better?

250
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,166
Aren't they the same?

251
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,502
They're completely different.

252
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,171
-The necklines look different,
-Yes.

253
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,965
and the colors are different too.

254
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,217
-I see.
-They have different purposes as well.

255
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,760
The details aren't the same.

256
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,138
Whatever the details are,

257
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,099
I'm not interested.

258
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,352
I think this will look great on you.

259
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,895
It's too big.

260
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,647
It's the wrong size.

261
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,815
Just try it on.

262
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,192
You never know
until you actually try it on.

263
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,902
I don't think so.

264
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,831
Oh, my. It fits me perfectly.

265
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,125
As if it was sewn while I was wearing it.

266
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,210
See?

267
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,962
I have a sharp eye.

268
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,088
It fits you well, doesn't it?

269
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,049
Why does it fit me?

270
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,926
It looks pretty good on me.

271
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,553
It's very comfortable, isn't it?

272
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,847
It is. Like I've always been wearing it.

273
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,390
You should take it.

274
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,727
Next time.

275
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,980
I need some mental preparation first.

276
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,235
We didn't even walk a lot,
but my feet hurt so much.

277
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,450
This feels much better.

278
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,078
I don't like walking around anymore.

279
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,539
I prefer sitting down and chatting.

280
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,457
Same here.

281
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:26,045
The clothes looked great on you.
Why didn't you buy them?

282
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,381
I didn't really feel ready.

283
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,966
"Ready"?

284
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,887
I have to use the bathroom.

285
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,768
Yes. I haven't picked out photos
for my album cover yet.

286
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,770
I'll send them tomorrow.

287
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,438
Okay. Bye.

288
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,483
It's Hye-ja.

289
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,360
Hye-ja.

290
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,076
I was on my way to your place.

291
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,828
We're designing my album cover today,

292
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,455
and we're using my old photos.

293
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,166
So I was going to ask you
to pick some out with me.

294
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,043
Later. Let's do it later.

295
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,753
But I'm in a hurry.

296
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,213
Let's just do it later.

297
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,215
Are you with someone?

298
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,383
-Yes.
-Who?

299
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,760
A friend.

300
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,345
A "friend"?

301
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,846
Who? Hyeon-ju?

302
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,889
No.

303
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,351
All right. Please say hi to your grandma.

304
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,894
See you later.

305
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,062
Okay.

306
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,030
A "friend"?

307
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,201
Well...

308
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,831
It feels so nice to take off my shoes.

309
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,126
Where do you get your hair done?

310
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,420
Your family runs a hair salon, right?

311
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,258
Can I get my hair done there later?

312
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,302
We're very small.

313
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,764
I'm sure you usually go
to a famous hair designer

314
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,349
in Gangnam.

315
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,977
They always tell me the same thing.

316
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,062
"Your hair is too thin.

317
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,231
It's hard to curl your hair
because it's too weak."

318
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,108
Do they think I don't know that?

319
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,526
That's why, at our shop,

320
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,278
we only do very tight perms

321
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,072
that last at least a year.
Is that okay for you?

322
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,825
I'm just joking.

323
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,577
Let me give you a perm.

324
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,953
You know how to do that?

325
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,371
I'm quite good.

326
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,914
Later when my mom...

327
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,833
When my daughter-in-law closes the shop,

328
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,376
I'll give you a perm for free.

329
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,711
No way.

330
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,379
I'll pay.

331
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,089
I'll do it for free.

332
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,759
So that you won't want your money
back even if something goes wrong.

333
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,971
I'm joking.

334
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,436
By the way, did something good happen?

335
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,770
Sorry?

336
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,815
The procedures, shopping, and perm...

337
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,443
You look a lot happier too these days.

338
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,198
I'm getting ready for something too.

339
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,786
Hey, Yeong-su! Come out!

340
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,374
I'm here. What is it?

341
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,500
Hey.

342
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,128
Give me the money, or I'll be kicked out.

343
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,796
Do I ever have any money?

344
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,175
Before, you would steal
just a few fried dumplings.

345
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,927
You've come a long way.

346
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,845
I already told you what to do.

347
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,430
-We Got Married.
-Are you crazy?

348
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,182
Why would I do that?

349
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,100
I guess you'll be kicked out then.

350
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,352
Fine, let's do it.

351
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,686
Are you sure?

352
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,480
Otherwise, you won't be able to pay.

353
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,065
What exactly am I supposed to do?

354
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,108
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I'm serious.

355
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,818
Okay. Let's do it.

356
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,111
Here's the deal.

357
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,696
We have to act like a married couple.

358
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,740
Viewers these days are extremely smart.

359
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,283
Once they realize it's just a show,

360
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,744
they'll stop sending us any candies.
Do you understand?

361
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,248
But we're only doing this until
we make as much as you owe me.

362
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,332
Okay.

363
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,292
I'll go make an announcement.

364
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,169
Come back at this time tomorrow, okay?

365
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,254
Bye.

366
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,136
Gosh, I must be out of my mind.

367
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,930
Why am I doing this?

368
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,811
MIDNIGHT SNACK BAR

369
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,908
I guess I should tell him.

370
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,079
In case he's been waiting.

371
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,126
But what should I tell him?

372
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,295
That she can't come back anymore?

373
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,807
Give me just a second.

374
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,934
I'll tell you something
when I feel a bit tipsy.

375
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,148
I didn't know
you still had something to tell me.

376
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,405
She can't come back.

377
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,910
Hye-ja said...

378
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,788
she was sorry.

379
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,003
She said she was very sorry.

380
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,841
She might

381
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,011
never come back here.

382
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,932
She found a good job there.

383
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,226
After working there for a few years,

384
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,022
she can get citizenship.

385
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,067
Then she'll...

386
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,738
completely settle down there.

387
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,495
She said she was sorry she couldn't

388
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,705
keep her promise.

389
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,842
Okay.

390
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,511
Are you okay?

391
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,307
Yes.

392
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,188
Were you waiting for her?

393
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,110
You two look so cute together.

394
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,406
Hold on.

395
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,783
Let me show you how.

396
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,786
This is how you drink soju.

397
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,288
You shake it.

398
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,792
With your thumb

399
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,878
Snap your wrist and

400
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,214
With my thumb...

401
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,259
-Wrist snap.
-And then...

402
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,845
What is this?

403
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,555
Did I do it wrong?

404
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,016
-No. But hit it harder.
-Let me try again.

405
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,443
No.

406
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,906
Tell her I'm happy for her.

407
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,910
That's good.

408
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,414
I was worried you'd be waiting for her.

409
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,672
By the way, I don't think
I'll go back to where you work.

410
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,174
I have no reason to.

411
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,969
Also, it'd bother you if I come, right?

412
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,804
No. It's okay.

413
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,140
I know how you feel.

414
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,354
You must want to be alone.

415
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,272
I'll leave then.

416
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,028
I know you're disappointed,
but don't drink too much.

417
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,321
It will upset your stomach.

418
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,891
Oh, gosh.

419
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,437
You must've had a hard time.

420
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,188
Your face looks terrible.

421
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,108
Why?

422
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,320
Did you come to beg to drop the charges?

423
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,991
What if I beg? Will you drop the charges?

424
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,951
You don't have that kind of
sympathy in you.

425
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,745
You punk.

426
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,373
Forget it.

427
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,793
What would I expect from a jerk
who bashed his own head

428
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,295
to get his dad arrested?

429
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,547
What is it?

430
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,967
Unless it's about money, I don't
even want to talk, so make it quick.

431
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,520
I put the house out for sale,
so do whatever you want with it.

432
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,316
I told the realtor someone else
will come instead of me.

433
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,903
You are going to give me the house?

434
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,406
No matter how much I hate you,
you were Grandma's precious son.

435
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,702
I'm also sick of you cleaning up
the house when I'm not home.

436
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,204
My goodness.

437
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,540
That shabby house won't even cost much.

438
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,585
Do you intend to give me that house

439
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,962
and take all the insurance payout?

440
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,964
You can see for yourself.

441
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,843
Whether I took Grandma's
insurance payout or not.

442
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,181
Why? Did you win the lottery or something?

443
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,933
Did you find a way to make money?

444
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,143
Are you going somewhere far?

445
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,107
Stop asking questions.
It's making me uncomfortable.

446
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,111
You were never curious about me
for your entire life.

447
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,279
Keep acting like you always did.

448
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,452
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

449
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,287
Goodness.

450
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,085
-Oh, my. You're here.
-Yes.

451
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,963
Ma'am, you're here too.

452
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,550
-I thought I'd never see you again.
-Did you think I was dead?

453
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,303
No way. You shouldn't make jokes
like that.

454
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,849
-Come on in. This way.
-Okay.

455
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,272
Hello.

456
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,401
SOCIETY WHERE ELDERS CAN LIVE COMFORTABLY

457
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,371
TOILET

458
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,719
Sir, do you want to use the bathroom?

459
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,062
What's wrong?

460
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,690
Sir, what's wrong? Calm down.

461
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,194
It's all right, relax. Come this way.

462
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,864
What is wrong with you lately?

463
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,580
Hello.

464
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,374
You're here.

465
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,087
You're probably wondering
why I'm here after I said I'd quit.

466
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,174
I didn't get to say goodbye

467
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,926
to the people here.

468
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,053
Everyone here likes me so much.

469
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,640
I thought it was a bit rude
to leave without even saying goodbye.

470
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:54,018
If I suddenly disappear,
they might miss me.

471
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,687
They might be curious.

472
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,063
You would've missed me too, right?

473
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,028
All right then. I've said goodbye to you.
We're settled, right?

474
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,825
Then I'll go and say goodbye
to the other people.

475
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,076
Stay until the evening.

476
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,954
I'll take you home.

477
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,831
Come on.

478
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,168
Should I stay then?

479
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,134
BJ PRINCE'S WE GOT MARRIED

480
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,011
Hello, this is BJ Prince.

481
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,762
I told you yesterday, right?

482
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,015
Today's broadcast theme is We Got Married.

483
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,060
Before we begin, let me introduce
the girl who will join me today.

484
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,439
THERE'S A GIRL WHO WANTS TO MARRY YOU?

485
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,857
OH MY GOSH!

486
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,025
Okay.

487
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,152
She's not a BJ like me.

488
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,987
She's a friend I've known
since we were kids.

489
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,238
She's my sister's friend.

490
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,573
Say hi.

491
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,657
THIS IS INCREDIBLE

492
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,742
Hey.

493
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,244
Do you not want to make money?

494
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,290
Hello.

495
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,292
Do it more brightly!

496
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,879
Hello, everyone!

497
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,172
LET US BE IN LOVE!
VIEWERS: 29

498
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,590
SHE'S PRETTY. DID YOU KIDNAP HER?

499
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,133
SHE'S TOO GOOD FOR YOU

500
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,052
She's pretty?

501
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,221
I'm not sure about that.

502
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,933
Anyway, before we begin We Got Married

503
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,685
we will take some time
to answer some questions.

504
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,354
Start asking!

505
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,230
WHY DO THIS
WITH SUCH A LOSER?

506
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,650
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN DATED
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MARRIAGE?

507
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,027
You guys are a bit too harsh.

508
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,780
I don't think you're aware

509
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,283
that I used to be really popular with
the ladies. I'm serious.

510
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,451
STOP LYING

511
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,620
SHE CAN ANSWER INSTEAD
WAS HE REALLY POPULAR?

512
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,163
Fine. You tell them.

513
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,248
I was really popular
a long time ago, right?

514
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,376
Popular, my foot.

515
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,461
I KNEW IT
HE'S JUST CRAVING ATTENTION

516
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,838
How could you say that?

517
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,423
What? I was being honest.

518
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,175
You little...

519
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,012
Everyone, I was her first love.

520
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,098
She totally chased me around
when we were young.

521
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,350
Hey. Did you chase me or not?

522
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,978
Are you crazy? Who? Who chased you?

523
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:00,937
THIS IS TOTALLY FAKE

524
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,897
IS HE A MYTHOMANIAC OR SOMETHING?

525
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,067
The spring picnic when you were
a freshman and when I was a senior.

526
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,193
-Don't you remember?
-I don't.

527
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,070
There used to be a tunnel near our school.

528
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,655
She was waiting for me there.

529
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,198
I met her on my way home from school.

530
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,658
I asked, "What are you doing here?"

531
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,909
What were you doing?

532
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,411
She was drawing an "O" on the ground.

533
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,620
Do you know why?

534
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,122
My name is Kim Yeong-su.

535
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,749
She was trying to write my name
on the ground.

536
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,084
So I told her.

537
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,962
"If you don't have anything to say,
I'm leaving."

538
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,255
What did you say?

539
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,090
She had tears in her eyes.

540
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,676
"Yeong-su, can I like you?"

541
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,261
Hey! Did you say that or not?

542
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,888
Did you have a dream? I don't remember.

543
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,056
What the...

544
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,892
THEY'LL GET DIVORCED SOON
I BELIEVE WHAT SHE SAYS

545
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,978
SHE LOOKS PRETTY SMART
WHY WOULD SHE LIKE HIM?

546
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,688
I really mean it. It's true!

547
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,772
She's lying and I'm not!

548
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,191
Seriously. Go on and tell the truth!

549
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,443
What?

550
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,778
Darn it.

551
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:54,532
DON'T ANSWER IT

552
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,415
I listed up

553
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,085
everyone's address and personal data
on an Excel file.

554
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,796
-Do you know how to use Excel?
-Of course I do.

555
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,342
Also, I added a shortcut to
all your favorite card games

556
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,470
right here on the start screen.

557
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,639
So don't bother the employees
when they're busy with work.

558
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,058
You can just click on it.

559
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,271
DON'T ANSWER IT

560
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,192
-Hey. What are you doing--
-Let me order a heater for you.

561
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,944
All the other rooms are fine,
but this office is so cold.

562
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,446
Don't you feel cold often in winter?

563
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,448
I'll order a heater.

564
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,867
Hey, don't.

565
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,620
-Why?
-You're acting strange today.

566
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,788
No, I'm not.

567
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,666
-I'll order it, so forget it.
-No, I'll buy you one.

568
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,212
What's all this about? Is something wrong?

569
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,881
You're acting like someone
who's about to leave.

570
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,049
What are you talking about?

571
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,801
Stop it. I'll take care of this.

572
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,222
Here. I'll make this for you.

573
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,765
Sit over here.

574
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,934
Okay.

575
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,607
What are you making?

576
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,069
We're making necklaces using rice puffs.

577
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,702
Here.

578
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,996
Use this.

579
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,835
There.

580
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,388
Seriously, I'm so disappointed.
You guys totally let me down today.

581
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,765
Is this all the trust you guys had in me?

582
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,102
This girl is only a guest.
How could you trust her more?

583
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,271
DON'T BE SUCH AN AMATEUR
STOP LYING

584
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,023
I'm not lying. It's true!

585
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,151
She really had a crush on me.

586
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,652
LIAR
SHOW US PROOF

587
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,736
Proof?

588
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,071
Proof.

589
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,574
Yes! I have proof. Wait, okay?

590
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,075
I'll be quick. I'll be right back.

591

PRINCE YEONG-SU TV
VIEWERS: 29

592
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,247
WE GOT MARRIED
STARRING PRINCE AND A BEAUTY

593
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,415
All right.

594
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,750
I have proof right here.

595
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,836
I'll show you what's inside,
so if I was right,

596
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,589
those of you who said I was lying
must send me candies. Got that?

597
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,965
SHOW US, AND YOU'LL GET CANDIES

598
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,634
Okay, this! Stars.

599
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,261
She folded all these origami stars for me.

600
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,638
It's said that 1,000 of these stars
can make your wish come true,

601
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,599
but she only folded 999 stars for me.

602
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,808
Do you know why?

603
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,768
She'd fold the last one
only if I dated her.

604
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,437
You must remember that.
You said that, right?

605
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,274
Hey, you obviously bought these.
I don't know how to fold stars.

606
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,442
Gosh.

607
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,818
What is with you?

608
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,320
My viewers really don't believe me.

609
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,489
DID HE REALLY BUY THOSE?

610
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,408
HE OBVIOUSLY DID

611
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,952
Why on earth would I buy origami stars?

612
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,120
I didn't buy them.

613
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,289
Fine, okay.

614
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,916
What's your name? What is your name?

615
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,084
Enough, okay?

616
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,045
You won't say your name? Okay.

617
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,172
Her name is Hyeon-ju.

618
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,798
All right? She's Hyeon-ju.

619
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,094
She spent an entire summer
knitting this scarf for me.

620
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,763
What did I say her name is? Hyeon-ju.

621
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,598
And what's my name? Yeong-su.

622
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,351
Hyeon-ju, HJ. Yeong-su, YS!

623
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,063
Here. Do you see this?
You all see this, right?

624
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,606
Do you believe me now?

625
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,732
Don't you remember this?

626
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,109
DID HE KNIT IT HIMSELF?
ISN'T IT SAFE TO SAY HE'S DELUSIONAL?

627
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,737
Why turn off the microphone?

628
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,656
Why are you being like this?

629
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,823
What's your problem?

630
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,826
Why pull out the stars
and the scarf? You're such a loser.

631
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,662
WHAT?

632
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,080
AM I THE ONLY ONE CAN'T HEAR A THING?

633
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,998
If you keep this up, I'm going to leave.

634
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,668
You should've just admitted
that I was your first love.

635
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,920
Why didn't you admit it?
Why did you lie? Why?

636
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,296
Why is that important?

637
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,882
Public image is everything
for content creators.

638
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,551
Once a loser, always a loser.

639
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,220
Goodbye to joint broadcast with females.

640
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,763
I'll be an outcast.

641
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,892
Fine. Just tell them the truth, right?

642
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,852
You'd better not pull out anything else.

643
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,979
You'll tell them, right?

644
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,314
PRINCE YEONG-SU TV
VIEWERS: 29

645
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,150
Guys, she says she's been teasing me.

646
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,820
She'll tell you the truth now,
so listen up.

647
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,238
Tell them.

648

649
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,285
It's true.

650
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,954
He was my first love.
I had a crush on him.

651
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,206
See? I told you!

652
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,916
THEY'RE COLLUDING

653
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,334
HOW MUCH DID HE OFFER YOU?

654
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,752
RAISE YOUR HAND IF HE THREATENED YOU

655
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:21,924
HE'S A TOTAL DISGRACE TO MANHOOD

656
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,984
Hye-ja is so pretty.

657
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,351
Sir, you should eat lunch.

658
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,852
I'll take you to the cafeteria.

659
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,859
Sir, I know that you don't like me.
I'll just take you there.

660
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,152
Let me take you to...

661
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,829
Sir! Sir!

662
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,998
Mr. Lee! My gosh!

663
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,376
Are you okay? My goodness.

664
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,127
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

665
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,838
I'm all right, but he's really
startled by what happened.

666
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,218
Sir, why are you being like this?

667
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,388
Sir. It's me, Yeon-hwa. Yes, Yeon-hwa.

668
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,889
Shall we go for a walk?

669
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:59,105
He can barely wipe his drool.
Where did he get the strength?

670
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,982
That old man is weird.

671
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,485
This will happen again.

672
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,321
It won't happen again.

673
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,407
How do you know?

674
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,786
Are you going to quit?

675
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,206
You told me to quit.

676
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,376
Right, I did.

677
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:25,089
Then when will your last day be?

678
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,383
I'm not sure yet.

679
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,428
After I wrap up a few things.

680
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,056
Where... Where will you go, then?

681
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,225
Ma'am.

682
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,145
Stop worrying about me

683
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,272
and just enjoy your life.

684
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,961
Should I come by around 9 p.m.?

685
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,463
Yes, you can come around that time.

686
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,298
Are you two going somewhere?

687
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,551
Ms. Kim offered to do my hair.

688
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,511
You said your family
runs a hair salon, right?

689
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,972
Can you do my hair too?

690
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,390
Yes, come by in the evening.

691
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,933
Okay.

692
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,560
This is Lee Jun-ha.

693
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,354
I didn't know we were neighbors.

694
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,943
Then let's try to be more generous
and talk casually to each other.

695
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,946
Come here.

696
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,692
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

697
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,159
Be safe.

698
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,373
Wherever you go,

699
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,459
take good care of yourself.

700
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,956
You never eat fried chicken.
What's gotten into you?

701
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,918
Have some.

702
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,463
It's all right.

703
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,175
My customer brought rice cakes,
so I had some. I'm still full.

704
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,808
Dad... Dad...

705
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,560
Dad, I'm sorry.

706
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:10,230
Dad, I'm sorry...

707
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,112
PRINCE YEONG-SU'S WE GOT MARRIED

708
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,238
And look at this.

709
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,282
She made this for me.

710
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,494
Do you see that? "Kim Yeong-su,
Kim Yeong-su, Kim Yeong-su."

711
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,912
It's my name, all over.

712
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,413
She made it while thinking about me.

713
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,415
And this. It was popular once.

714
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,585
It's made with shoelaces.
She made one for each of us.

715
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,920
And...

716
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,755
IF THAT'S TRUE,
SHE MUST HAVE REALLY LIKED HIM

717
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:35,923
This will prove everything.

718
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,175
Unbelievable. A letter.

719
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,344
Do you know what's incredible about it?

720
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,263
This is the ultimate proof.
Let me show you.

721
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,556
A LETTER?

722
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,308
She even sent pictures with the letter.

723
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:50,187
This was taken in high school,
and this in middle school.

724
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,855
What do you say now?

725
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,232
THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS

726
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,358
READ THE LETTER

727
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,777
-Okay.
-Why don't you stop here?

728
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,487
They're finally starting to believe me.

729
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,948
You don't have to pay me,
so please just stop.

730
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,074
Are you serious?

731
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,992
Yes, just stop.

732
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,285
Okay, deal.

733
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,870
PLEASE READ THE LETTER

734
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,872
Is this enough? Do you believe me now?

735
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,291
All right. We Got Married...

736
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,001
READ THE LETTER, AND YOU GET 1,000 CANDIES

737
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,211
One thousand candies?

738
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,257
"Hi, Yeong-su. It's Hyeon-ju.

739
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,175
It's okay if you don't want
to go out with me.

740
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,261
Just don't tell me
I can't come see you or--"

741
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,720
Hey!

742
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,889
You're such a jerk!

743
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,815
What's with her?

744
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,608
SHE IS SERIOUSLY ANGRY. THAT WAS SCARY

745
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,860
Guys.

746
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,112
Why did she do that?

747
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,114
YOU HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF GIRLS

748
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,158
I have no understanding of girls?

749
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,034
Watch your language.

750
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,162
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WHO LIKES HER?

751
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,997
Gosh, no way.

752
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,207
I'm the one who likes her?

753
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,251
No, it's not true.

754
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,255
Why do I still have all this?

755
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,885
I just happened to keep all this.

756
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,802
THAT'S RIGHT

757
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:04,970
No, that's not it.

758
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,180
THEN THROW IT AWAY

759
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,264
BURN IT AND GET 10,000

760
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,142
What? 10,000 candies?

761
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,977
You'll give me 10,000 candies
if I burn everything?

762
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,312
I'll remember your ID.

763
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,314
If you don't keep your words,
I'll report you.

764
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,149
Okay? You have to send me 10,000 candies.

765
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,155
Hye-ja!

766
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,201
-You were here?
-Yes, I was here.

767
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,161
-The thing is...
-Yes.

768
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,747
Is something wrong?

769
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,373
No, nothing.

770
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,835
Come on. I can tell just by looking
at your face.

771
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,128
Did something happen?

772
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,005
No. I'm fine.

773
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,258
Don't you know
I'm good at cheering you up?

774
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,718
What do you want me to do?

775
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,803
I'm really okay.

776
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,390
-Welcome.
-Hi.

777
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,102
You really look like a hairdresser
in that apron.

778
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,897
I don't have a certificate,
but my skills are pretty good.

779
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,398
-Have a seat.
-Please.

780
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,650
I'll go first.

781
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,878
You do look experienced.

782
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,098
All right. I'll burn them.

783
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,392
Don't forget to send 10,000 candies.

784
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,395
Do you see this?
I'm not hesitating at all.

785
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,146
All right.

786
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:39,982
There you go.

787
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,692
IT CAUGHT FIRE!

788
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,402
Do you see this? I'm burning them.

789
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,779
THERE'S A FIRE! ARREST HIM!

790
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,283
Fine. He was my first love.
Are we good now?

791
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,494
And I still have feelings for him.

792
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,789
I know that he's a complete loser,
but I like him.

793
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,968
WHAT IS HE DOING?

794
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,933
THIS CHANNEL HAS BEEN BLOCKED
DUE TO INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT

795
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,020
I'll pay for it, okay?

796
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,240
Hyeon-ju.

797
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,201
I don't care where it is.

798
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,579
Just take me somewhere, will you?

799
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,415
Let me ask you something.

800
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,461
Why did you put out the fire?
You could have received 10,000 candies.

801
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,963
It was from you.

802
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,843
-You'd throw it away anyway.
-I wouldn't.

803
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,013
Seriously? After peeing on it?

804
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,267
How could I throw it away?

805
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,069
Where do you want to go? The sea?

806
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:14,660
DONGAN CHINESE RESTAURANT

807
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,460
Why are you crying?

808
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,504
Because your channel has been blocked?

809
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,937
Have a seat.

810
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,823
Did she leave?

811
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:59,955
-You don't have to go?
-Go where?

812
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,249
I'll wait until you're finished.

813
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,460
Can you go buy something for me?

814
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,046
-Anything you say.
-A pineapple.

815
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,258
But I only eat Korean pineapples.

816
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,052
Korean pineapples? I'll be right back.

817
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,387
Here I go!

818
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,433
Can you find Korean pineapples?

819
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,852
Yes, in Jeju Island.

820
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:26,440
By the way, what is this all about?

821
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,776
I want to look young in front of my son.

822
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,071
If I look too old, he'll feel sad.

823
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,198
Your son? Is your son coming back?

824
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,992
He is too busy.

825
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,994
I'm going to visit him in the US.

826
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,537
So you heard from him...

827
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,289
I mean...

828
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,541
We've been talking all the time.

829
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,502
He writes to me every week.

830
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,798
He sends me this chocolate I like too.

831
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,883
Her son

832
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,510
might be living abroad or dead.
Nobody knows.

833
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,345
She never heard from him
after he left home.

834
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,182
Please make me look good
in front of my son.

835
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,308
Sure.

836
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,862
I'm sorry, but this is an emergency.

837
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,698
You can't reach
Lady Chanel's son, can you?

838
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,116
Pardon?

839
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,243
This is bad.

840
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,581
She wants to visit her son in the US.

841
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,295
She says she is visiting him
because he is too busy.

842
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,172
She is getting ready for the trip.

843
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:38,011
I didn't see this coming.
I didn't know what to do.

844
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,931
I just thought you should know.

845
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,941
You packed up everything.

846
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,779
You're really moving?

847
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,411
HYOJA TRAIL, RESTING AREA, REAR
ENTRANCE, MAIN HALL, MINERAL SPRING

848
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,790
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

849
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,684
-Are you busy right now?
-No. It's okay.

850
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,185
I have a favor to ask.

851
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,354
Well...

852
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:33,191
I'd like to visit my son.

853
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,903
Can you get me a flight ticket to LA
with this money?

854
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,699
I have no one else to ask.

855
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,287
Ma'am.

856
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,040
Can we talk somewhere else?

857
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:57,799
-Hye-ja, it's me.
-Hi.

858
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,135
I'm signing my album contract today.

859
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,054
Meet me at Arman at 7 p.m..

860
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,973
Okay. I'll be there.

861
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,484
DEAR MY BELOVED SON,
I HOPE YOU CAN COME TO SEOUL...

862
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,286
I don't think we can reach your son.

863
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,166
I lied to you.

864
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,173
Here are all the parcels
you've been sending him.

865
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,219
I'm sorry.

866
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,286
Leave then! Get out of my sight.

867
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,206
Darn it.

868
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,878
Jun-ha, listen.

869
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,504
Jun-ha.

870
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,131
Please reconsider.

871
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,304
Where is Lady Chanel?

872
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:53,266
It's been a while since I saw her.
Did she already leave?

873
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,768
Oh, no.

874
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,647
It's Hui-seon.

875
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,399
Please open the door.

876
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,204
She said she'd come.

877
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,039
But she's not coming.

878
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,083
I guess she's busy.

879
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,048
Hey. Why are you crying? Hush.

880
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,384
Stop crying.

881
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,303
She changed.

882
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,015
She doesn't even seem happy
when she sees me.

883
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,935
She looks happier
when she's with someone else

884
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,394
besides us.

885
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,980
Hye-ja has changed.

886
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,273
Of course I've changed.

887
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,446
I've turned into an old granny

888
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,573
and you two sit here badmouthing me.

889
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,033
I can't believe you two.

890
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,871
Okay, don't cry.

891
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:00,333
When she was with me, she said,
"That's not true."

892
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,418
But when that elder lady
from the exhibit hall came,

893
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,171
her face lit up and she looked so excited.

894
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,631
She said the old lady was her friend.

895
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,883
What about us? Aren't we friends too?

896
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,178
You guys decide.

897
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,890
Whether we should keep staying
as friends or not.

898
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,980
I know you guys feel awkward
whenever you're with me.

899
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,482
I feel awkward too.

900
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,526
It's tough for me, but I can't express it.

901
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,362
I know you guys aren't having fun,
and you're just pretending.

902
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:32,282
It's uncomfortable for all of us.

903
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,493
You want to stop being friends just
because it feels uncomfortable?

904
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,204
I cannot be 25 anymore.

905
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:43,710
I can't become young like you guys
ever again.

906
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,755
If I walk for a few minutes,
I have to rest as much.

907
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,384
I keep looking for spots where I can
rest before reaching my destination.

908
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,762
I can't become like you guys now.

909
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,183
Are you stupid?

910
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,726
What?

911
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,019
Even if you lack energy,

912
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,729
and doze off at the karaoke,

913
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,898
is it wrong for us to be friends with you?

914
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,150
That was not what I meant.

915
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,234
Then what?

916
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,820
If you're tired, you can tell us
that you need to stop and rest.

917
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:14,365
Whether it's 10 or 20 minutes,
we can wait until you feel okay.

918
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,409
If you need a place to sit and rest,
tell us.

919
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,369
We'll go and save a spot for you.

920
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,956
We don't need the 25-year-old Hye-ja.

921
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,875
We just need you, Hye-ja.

922
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,170
I'm not asking you to be friends
with just us.

923
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,922
What makes me sad is that

924
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,425
you might not want to be friends
with us because of someone else.

925
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,052
That's what breaks my heart.

926
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,138
I'm sorry.

927
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,807
Right. You should be sorry.

928
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,269
Decide whether to be friends or not?
Are you insane?

929
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,188
I said I'm sorry, so stop it.

930
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,190
What were you planning to do if we agreed?

931
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,858
I said, stop it.

932
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,904
Here, come and give me a big hug.

933
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,411
-Hey.
-What?

934
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,288
Let's meet the people at
Hye-ja's exhibit hall

935
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,040
and treat them to something good.

936
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,833
No, I don't want to.

937
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,001
Let's go.

938
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,253
Where?

939
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,171
I regret not getting to shoot this before,

940
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,549
and this was always my long-time wish.

941
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,883
You look so happy.

942
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,052
What's your relationship with each other?

943
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,721
-We're friends.
-We're friends.

944
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:29,482
HYOJA EXHIBIT HALL

945
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,652
Have you seen Lady Chanel?

946
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,074
By any chance, have you seen Lady Chanel?

947
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,867
-You didn't see her?
-I didn't see her.

948
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,327
You didn't?

949
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,870
Where did she go?

950
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,127
Where is Mr. Lee Jun-ha?

951
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,255
He's not here today.

952
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,008
I heard he'll quit soon.

953
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,973
Wait. Ma'am.

954
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,766
We received a call
from your granddaughters,

955
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,185
and thanks to you, we'll have
so much fun today!

956
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,228
What is all this?

957
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,480
I told you.

958
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,315
This is our treat to everyone here

959
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,400
-so they can get along with you.
-Am I a kid?

960
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,319
Of course. You're just a kid
in an old woman's body.

961
01:00:57,278 --> 01:01:00,239
You must be so happy that you've
found many of your friends here.

962
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,038
Hui-seon.

963
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,540
Isn't the weather lovely?

964
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:10,958
-No.
-Okay.

965
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,380
Is he that ugly dude you mentioned?

966
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,178
Are you looking for someone?

967
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,389
There's someone I can't seem to find.

968
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,307
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM HYEONG-SEOK

969
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,868
Hye-ja, pull yourself together first...

970
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,995
-Hye-ja! Yeong-su!
-Hye-ja. Yeong-su!

971
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,038
She came to talk to me.

972
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:33,791
I should've stopped her. But I...

973
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,127
Where were you planning to go?

974
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,088
I wanted to take the train
to go see the aurora.

975
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:42,008
You have to tell me all about it
when you get back.

976
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,551
Tell me how much you cried.

977
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,304
Hey, how much is the insurance payout
for accidental death?

978
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:47,972
-It's 100 million won.
-How much did you get?

979
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,515
I didn't get anything.

980
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,518
Seriously? Are you really
going to be like this?

981
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,312
You're Mr. Lee Jun-ha, right?
We're the police.

982
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,814
You know what? I don't think
you can get on that plane.

983
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,275
