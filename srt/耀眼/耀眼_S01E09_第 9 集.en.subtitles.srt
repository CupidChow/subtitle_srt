1
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,275
Here is our next news.

2
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,278
Last night around 5 a.m.,
near the mouth of Yongcheon River,

3
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,947
the body of a supposedly
70-year-old woman was discovered

4
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,490
by a local resident,

5
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,200
and the police has started
an investigation.

6
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,327
Based on the ID she was carrying,

7
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,289
she has been identified as Ms. Choe
from Jagok-dong.

8
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,624
The reason of death
is yet to be confirmed.

9
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,467
BODY OF A WOMAN IN HER 70S
FOUND IN YONGCHEON RIVER

10
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,968
SINGER A AND ACTOR B ADMIT TO DATING!

11
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,013
The police stated Ms. Choe
has no residence near Yongcheon River

12
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,265
where her body was discovered,

13
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,143
and based on the fact
that there were no stolen articles...

14
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,979
It turns out that the second child
of that family

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,523
was born out of an extramarital affair.

16
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,192
My gosh. That explains it.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,904
That kid didn't look like
his mother at all.

18
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,489
This is so shocking.

19
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,199
He didn't look like his father either.

20
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,452
I knew it. Something felt strange
when I saw them.

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,204
Goodness.

22
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,051
Who am I? Kim Yu-sin, who cut off
his horse's neck?

23
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,470
I keep coming back to this house
habitually.

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,599
At least Kim Yu-sin cut off
his horse's neck. What about me?

25
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,269
Should I cut off my ankles or something?

26
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,272
Is he not home?

27
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,067
Did he already leave?

28
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,451
He left. He really left.

29
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,745
How could he leave so cold-heartedly

30
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,540
and clean his home so neatly
like an uninhabited house?

31
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:10,046
If I had known, I should've asked
where he was going at least.

32
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,434
So, did you meet her?

33
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,187
No, I didn't. I guess
he went somewhere nice.

34
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,690
Where? Did that old lady go on a trip?

35
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,110
Old lady? Who are you talking about?

36
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,155
You know, last time when you went
to meet Hyeon-ju and Sang-eun,

37
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,448
that pretty lady who came by here.

38
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,617
Didn't you go to meet her?

39
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,037
Pretty lady? Did Lady Chanel come by?

40
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,831
That time? Why?

41
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,374
How would I know?

42
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,001
She seemed to be looking for you,

43
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,044
so I told her to come inside and wait.

44
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,671
But she said she had somewhere to go.

45
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,217
She came to see me?

46
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,512
It's me, Hui-seon.

47
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,390
Did she go somewhere?

48
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,644
Oh, my.

49
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,937
What do you want?

50
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,188
Who are you?

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,817
She paid for her room charge
and checked out a few days ago.

52
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,069
Where did she say she was going?

53
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,155
I asked her

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,781
but she just smiled.

55
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,035
She must've come by to tell me something.

56
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,578
Talk about bad timing.

57
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,164
She'd be okay, right?

58
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,458
But why do I feel so anxious?

59
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,754
DON'T ANSWER IT

60
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,967
Mix it for me.

61
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,264
Hello, sir.

62
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,599
How are you doing?

63
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,435
You're not doing well?

64
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,604
The investment?

65
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,358
I'm trying really hard
to pay you back first thing,

66
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,653
but I'm having a bit of trouble
gathering the money.

67
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,530
Where would I run away to?

68
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,867
Even if I do, I doubt
you won't be able to find me.

69
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,287
I know you still have various connections

70
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,705
all over this country.

71
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,582
Sorry?

72
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,209
It's strange you're asking me

73
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,669
about my health right now.

74
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,712
My kidney?

75
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,507
I go to the bathroom really often nowadays

76
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,093
My urine is all bubbly and it stinks too.

77
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,552
I have bad eyesight too.

78
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,681
I don't know if they're ghosts.
I keep seeing things.

79
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,934
My liver? You know that
I'm from the countryside.

80
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,187
As you may know, fatty liver is
quite common in that area.

81
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,942
I'll get your money prepared
within a few days

82
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,569
and bring some of your favorite
30-year-old whisky

83
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,488
and go see you.

84
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,533
Of course I'll go see you.

85
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,077
You don't have to go through
the trouble coming here.

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,121
Okay. Good day, sir.

87
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,375
My goodness, that scumbag.

88
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,919
How could he be interested in
my internal organs?

89
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,337
He didn't hang up.

90
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,215
Hello...

91
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,554
I was joking.

92
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,558
Is that funny?

93
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,436
Are you having fun?

94
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,729
No.

95
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,025
Does he want his money back?

96
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,610
How much was it? 200 million won?

97
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,239
It's 300 million won now,
including interest.

98
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,369
No matter how desperate I was,
I shouldn't have gone to that thug.

99
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,040
Get rid of this.

100
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,042
I lost my appetite.

101
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,588
Still, you should...

102
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,089
Hey.

103
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,216
-Stop eating.
-Come on.

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,385
Let's at least have one proper meal.

105
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,304
If you keep eating your meals properly

106
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,014
and end up having healthy organs,

107
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,141
do you think yours will be safe?

108
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,435
Don't forget the insurance policies.

109
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,853
That's the only way we can make money.

110
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,021
Get rid of this.

111
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,564
Come on, Hui-won...

112
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,649
Is he already here?

113
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,194
Go and open the door.

114
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,570
Hold on.

115
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,281
You go open it. You're the one
who borrowed money.

116
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,206
Before I die, I'll make sure to
tell him your address

117
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,666
and social security number,
so don't regret it later.

118
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,882
OFFICE

119
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,135
Ma'am. My goodness.

120
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,513
Tell me Lady Chanel's contact number.

121
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,682
Why are barging in here so suddenly
and asking that?

122
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,392
-I don't have it.
-She must've written down

123
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,019
her personal information here.

124
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,146
Give me her personal information.
Should I look for it?

125
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,606
No, that's okay.

126
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,609
That woman doesn't have
any personal information.

127
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,196
So whenever she didn't come here,

128
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,448
there was no way for us
to contact her either.

129
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,617
Then what about Jun-ha's number?

130
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,244
You should call him from here.

131
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,913
What do you think this place is?
A public payphone?

132
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,582
-You keep bothering me today.
-Hurry up!

133
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,713
Then I'll try calling him just once.

134
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,801
You see, he ditched us

135
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,595
and went on a trip, all excited.

136
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,932
Even if I call him, he won't...

137
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,227
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

138
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,478
What?

139
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,272
The number is no longer in service.

140
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,732
What?

141
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,028
By the way, did you get the insurance?

142
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,823
The insurance.

143
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,328
Every elder who comes here
has signed up for it.

144
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,700
You're Mr. Lee Jun-ha, right?

145
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,620
We're the police.

146
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,633
-She passed away?
-Yes.

147
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,513
I heard you met her
while working at an exhibit hall.

148
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,598
That's a place

149
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,018
where things like fake supplements
are sold to elders, right?

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,104
Yes.

151
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,150
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
It's nice to meet you all.

152
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,581
I own that building

153
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,585
And you saw my fat wallet earlier

154
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:09,340
If you don't act fast,
you'll let this opportunity slide

155
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:13,052
A hotshot like me is hard to come by

156
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,223
Give me a hug, just once

157
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,059
Isn't this song nice?

158
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,894
Your dog is so cute.

159
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,647
How dare you call her a dog?

160
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,316
She's my daughter!

161
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,611
-You rude punk.
-I'm sorry, sir.

162
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,489
Let's go, my dear daughter.

163
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,535
Where do you live, all alone?

164
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,706
With my tough

165
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,486
I really don't like this place.

166
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,622
I don't like it either.

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,668
A close friend of mine runs this place.

168
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,964
I agreed to work here
because he has helped me out so much,

169
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,050
but I'm not sure.

170
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,719
No matter how we spin it,

171
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,056
I can't stop thinking that
all we do is ripping elders off.

172
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,016
Of course you'd feel that way.

173
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,769
You're young. Do you have
nothing better to do or what?

174
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,312
I know, right?

175
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,733
I'm young, so I should find
something better to do.

176
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,071
What should I do, then?

177
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,201
You have good looks and a nice
voice. What are you worried about?

178
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,287
You're not old like those of us here,

179
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,457
who can't do anything because of our age.

180
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,797
I feel as if I woke up one morning

181
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,801
and became a 100-year-old man.

182
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,430
I have no idea what I should do.

183
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,019
I don't even know what I can do.

184
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,038
Is this for depression?

185
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,124
No, you can die with those pills.

186
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,878
I developed depression

187
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,256
when my son moved to the US
after my husband passed away.

188
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,800
I collected those pills
to take my own life,

189
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,137
but I heard I'd have to take
all of them to die,

190
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,180
and I wasn't sure if I'd be able
to take them all.

191
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,310
I'm not even sure if I can
take all those pills, let alone die.

192
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,063
That's why I just carry them with me.

193
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,859
To remind myself
how much of a coward I am.

194
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,195
Do you need it? Shall I
lend it to you for a few days?

195
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,469
-When...
-Oh, her time of death?

196
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,222
The autopsy is being performed
at the moment,

197
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,017
so we'll find out the exact
time and date when it's completed.

198
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,563
But we believe it was the evening
after she took you to the airport.

199
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,899
We found nothing on her after that.

200
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,568
She accompanied you to the airport, right?

201
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,447
Yes.

202
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,951
When I told her
that I was going on a trip,

203
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,162
she said she'd like to
accompany me to the airport

204
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,623
because I always dropped her off
and picked her up.

205
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,375
Then you parted ways
at the departure gate, right?

206
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,253
Yes.

207
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,546
I got you some emergency medicine.

208
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,549
Don't be sick.

209
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,136
She bought me emergency medicine
and told me not to get sick.

210
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,014
Then she waved her hand at me.
That was the last time I saw her.

211
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,437
Then why didn't you leave that day?

212
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,358
I couldn't leave
because my flight got canceled.

213
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,111
I was told to wait a few days
even for the connecting flights.

214
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,282
May I ask where you were planning to go?

215
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,372
Well, you don't have to tell me
if it's personal.

216
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,464
Okay, I'll be right there.

217
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,385
Please excuse me for a second.
I need to interview another witness.

218
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,305
We can order you some food
if you're hungry.

219
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm all right.

220
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,525
You're Ms. Choe's son, right?
I'm sorry for your loss.

221
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,610
Oh, thank you.

222
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,196
Let's go over there. We'd like to
ask you a few questions.

223
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,715
DEPARTURE GATE

224
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,862
Bye.

225
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,462
-Oh, no!
-What are you doing?

226
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,213
You'll damage all of them.

227
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,134
Darn it. We have to sell them
elsewhere, you idiot.

228
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,553
These are almost expired.
What should we do with these?

229
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,971
What do you think? Throw them out.

230
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,515
Hey, wait! Pass me one.

231
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,726
What a waste. I should drink this.

232
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,895
Hey, that will strengthen your kidneys.

233
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,356
Throw them out.

234
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,566
Hey, hey.

235
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,693
Do I look suspicious?

236
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,738
-You have a suspicious face.
-Why you little...

237
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,991
Be gentle with them. We have to sell them.

238
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,000
Darn it! Why did the cops
have to barge in out of the blue?

239
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,461
She didn't even give us
her contact information.

240
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,465
We always wondered what more
we could do to care for her.

241
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,511
But how could she...
Gosh, I still can't believe this.

242
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,016
Well, I think we got enough information.

243
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,604
By the way,

244
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,024
-what did you sell?
-Pardon me?

245
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,113
Oh, nothing much.

246
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,491
We sold some dietary supplements

247
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,410
that are good for seniors.

248
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,203
They're all approved by KFDA.

249
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,498
We're not here on a crackdown,
so please relax.

250
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,291
Oh, okay. Thank you.

251
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,544
-Thanks for your cooperation.
-No problem.

252
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:48,424
By the way, was it an accidental death?

253
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,177
We'll have to investigate further,
but it seems so at the moment.

254
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,262
I see.

255
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,848
-We'll leave you alone now.
-All right. Bye.

256
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,685
I'll keep on living
as a law-abiding citizen.

257
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,437
Bye.

258
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,652
Hui-won, what was the cause of her death?

259
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,113
It was an accidental death.

260
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,532
That's what they think.

261
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,493
Hey,

262
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,121
how much is the insurance payout
for accidental death?

263
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,372
It's 100 million won.

264
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,961
Then...

265
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,214
We're saved now.

266
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,344
My goodness.

267
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,139
Is it your hobby to look for people?

268
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,850
This time, it might be something huge.

269
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,978
I mean, if what you say is true,

270
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,065
the lady found out her son
was in Korea, not the US.

271
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,275
She probably went to meet her son.

272
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,070
Then why would she have moved out
of her room?

273
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,781
Her son must have felt bad
about neglecting his mother.

274
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,824
He would've probably let her
move in with him.

275
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,410
Would you say that
even if your mother disappeared?

276
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,412
Ma'am!

277
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,335
I'm sure she's fine.

278
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,421
Who knows? She might have
actually moved in with her son.

279
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,467
She hadn't heard a word from him
for two and a half years, remember?

280
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,054
You can't know everything about everyone.

281
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,808
Next, accidents and incidents.

282
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,643
Two days ago, near the mouth
of Yongcheon River,

283
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,229
the body of a 79-year-old woman,
Ms. Choe, was discovered.

284
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,440
It has been discovered
that she had been staying

285
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,609
at a motel in Jagok-dong for some time.

286
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,905
The police suspect suicide
as an autopsy found no signs

287
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,865
of foul play.

288
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,202
Ms. Choe's acquaintances say
she had been distressed

289
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,497
about her son being out of reach
after moving to the US.

290
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,875
There is an investigation going on
while suicide

291
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,378
due to personal reasons being
the most likely cause of her death.

292
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,629
Are you okay?

293
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,302
-Hye-ja!
-Hye-ja!

294
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,097
-Yeong-su!
-Yeong-su, get the bed ready.

295
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,182
Be careful. Lie in your bed.

296
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,480
What are you doing? Massage her legs.

297
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,731
Okay.

298
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,237
I did her hair.

299
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,491
She said she was going to meet her son.

300
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,285
Okay.

301
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,580
We went shopping together too.

302
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,165
Hye-ja.

303
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,501
She came to see me.

304
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,091
She came to talk to me.

305
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,638
I should've stopped her. But I...

306
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,224
I should have stopped her.

307
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,164
-Well...
-Gosh!

308
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,460
You don't like the sauce
over the food, right?

309
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,588
I'm sorry. These ones are okay.

310
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,590
-Eat these.
-That darn lady.

311
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,009
She is of no use ever.

312
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,137
Why did she have to kill herself?

313
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,348
It's not like she had
a long time left anyway.

314
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,393
There is no payout for suicide, right?

315
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,103
Are you kidding me?

316
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,775
Hey.

317
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,568
-Hey!
-Yes?

318
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,156
Why did you order so much food?

319
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,783
Why?

320
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,952
Are we having a party? Are we?

321
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,746
Well, you said
I could order anything I wanted

322
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,332
because we were going to get the payout.

323
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,970
Is this Dongan Chinese Restaurant?

324
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:03,929
It's Hyoja Exhibit Hall.

325
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,473
We'd like to cancel our orders.

326
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,142
We haven't taken off the plastic wrap yet.

327
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,436
It doesn't matter even if you haven't.

328
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,605
You can't return the food.

329
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,234
You're being unreasonable.

330
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,654
What's wrong? Let me talk to him.

331
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,700
Hello, Director.

332
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,078
You're not the director?

333
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,913
Hello, Manager.

334
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,250
What do you expect us to do
with those swollen noodles?

335
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,504
It's none of my business
if things are rough for you.

336
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,132
You can't return the food.
This conversation is over.

337
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,969
What is he thinking?

338
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,555
If you ever get a call like that
again, tell me.

339
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,308
I'll deal with it, okay?

340
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,226
Okay.

341
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,519
That jerk.

342
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,150
My gosh.

343
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,283
Gosh, why did Dad make you do this?

344
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,784
Move over.

345
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,200
Finish up and go home.

346
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,712
Gosh.

347
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,267
So what happened?

348
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,395
Well, it was pretty predictable.

349
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,439
It was about her son.

350
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,566
-Her son?
-Yes.

351
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,819
The man who was here earlier is her son.

352
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,987
He said the lady visited him
before she killed herself.

353
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,323
I know that. I gave her a ride.

354
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,533
You did?

355
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,163
Is there something wrong?

356
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,959
I think I should visit my son.

357
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,963
As I told you, your son is--

358
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,256
He is in Korea.

359
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,383
In Seoul.

360
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,012
He had been out of reach?

361
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,306
But it had been more than two years
since he left for the US.

362
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,521
How could she not suspect anything
in that situation?

363
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,648
Isn't that strange?

364
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,734
Well...

365
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,195
I wrote letters to her.

366
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,613
Pretending they're from her son?

367
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,532
Yes.

368
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,616
Why?

369
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,618
So she wouldn't feel sad?

370
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,915
So when she wanted to visit
her son in the US,

371
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,543
you had no choice
but to tell her the truth.

372
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,631
In the end, she found out
her son had been living in Korea

373
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,134
without saying anything to her

374
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,677
and went to see him.

375
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,430
Do you have to see him?

376
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,184
I just want to make sure
he is doing all right.

377
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,478
Also, my grandchildren must be big now.

378
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,690
You don't have to worry about me.

379
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,193
In any case, I'll get to see my son.

380
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,195
I'm happy.

381
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,664
Let me give you a ride then.

382
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,093
Is this where he lives?

383
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,929
Do you want me to follow you?

384
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,138
No.

385
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,518
Should I buy something?

386
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,105
Maybe some snacks for my grandchildren?

387
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,524
I think it'll be all right today.

388
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,026
Maybe next time.

389
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,819
Okay.

390
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,330
It might take a while.

391
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,207
Don't worry. I'll wait.

392
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,632
She came back after about 20 minutes.

393
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,009
I was relieved because she looked happy.

394
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,427
She looked happy?

395
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,390
It didn't take that long.

396
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,516
Is it because of me?

397
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,017
Not at all.

398
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,687
We're having lunch together this weekend.

399
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,439
-We'll talk more then.
-She said she was having lunch

400
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,899
with her son and his wife that weekend.

401
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,567
How did it go?

402
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,653
Well, he said he was sorry.

403
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,198
He went to the US
with the money we got from our house.

404
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,700
When his business failed there too,

405
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,369
he couldn't bring himself to call me.

406
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,206
My goodness. When they left,
their youngest child

407
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,293
couldn't even walk, and now he talks.

408
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,128
I said, "Who are you?"

409
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,879
And he said, "I'm Yu-bin."

410
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,965
How adorable.

411
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,805
I was so sure

412
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,974
my little boy was a genius.

413
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,937
When other babies who were born
in the same month as him

414
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,564
were barely creeping,

415
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,568
he stood up and started taking steps.

416
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,490
One day, when I was distracted
for a short moment,

417
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,118
he fell down and got hurt
near his eyebrow.

418
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,662
That wound is still visible.

419
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,166
Whenever I see that wound,
I feel so sorry.

420
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,335
It will barely be visible
if it's around his eyebrow.

421
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,796
Still, mothers never stop worrying
about their children.

422
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,969
Are you happy that you got to see
your son?

423
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,264
Yes, I do feel happy.

424
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,808
He's my child.

425
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,484
Did you say you're leaving Korea tomorrow?

426
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,153
Oh, yes.

427
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,824
I'm sorry to see you leave.

428
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,454
I'll go with you to the airport tomorrow.

429
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,540
Since you gave me a ride home
all the time.

430
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,335
That's fine, don't bother.

431
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,421
It's okay. I really want to.

432
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,307
What on earth happened then?

433
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,895
It's difficult for me to say.

434
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,022
I have a mother too...

435
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,234
and I guess all mothers feel the same.

436
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,051
I know it's hard,

437
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,429
but you should have a bite.

438
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,308
Is death always

439
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,269
like this?

440
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,355
What?

441
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,651
Death is...

442
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,071
such a futile thing.

443
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,620
Just up until yesterday

444
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,499
she talked with me

445
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,589
and I felt the warmth of her body.

446
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,471
It's like she never existed now.

447
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,185
As if everything was a dream.

448
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,277
Have a bite. It's not hot anymore.

449
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,072
If I die too...

450
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,452
No.

451
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,081
Don't say things like that.

452
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,128
You should never say things like that.

453
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,350
I know it's been tiring
after all this time.

454
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,519
Thank you for your cooperation.

455
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,978
You can go now.

456
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,401
I'm sorry you missed your trip.

457
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,694
It's fine.

458
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,492
They want to see Mr. Lee.

459
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,619
Mr. Lee. Wait.

460
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,379
A new suspect has been found regarding
the suicide case of the 70-year-old woman

461
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,630
who was found in Yongcheon River.

462
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,383
The probability of homicide
is now being considered.

463
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,261
The police found out she signed
a life insurance policy before...

464
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,180
I heard that man lives
in our neighborhood.

465
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,683
The man who lived next to the house
with the blue door.

466
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,979
I saw detectives continuously
asking about him yesterday.

467
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,438
This case is now being considered...

468
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,861
Why did you turn it off?
I was watching it.

469
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,532
Yes, I saw him several times too.

470
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,826
He picked up elder people with his van.

471
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,997
My gosh. My mother-in-law
also went to that place.

472
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,666
Ask her if she signed some kind of
life insurance there.

473
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,002
Check who the insured is.

474
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,880
This is frightening. How could this
happen in this tiny neighborhood?

475
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,049
No wonder he pretended
to care for her so much.

476
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,719
There was a good reason behind it.

477
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,888
That means I could've ended up

478
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,973
exactly like her if he was nice to me.

479
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,059
How could someone be so evil?

480
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,228
You're all so mean!

481
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,564
During your time at this exhibit hall,

482
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,442
who here didn't receive any help
from Mr. Lee?

483
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,903
Lady from Yongjugol.

484
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,155
You complained all the time

485
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,407
that your TV or laundry machine
was broken.

486
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,367
You always asked Mr. Lee for help.

487
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,453
You over there. Say something.

488
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,165
When you filled up your pushcart

489
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,125
with all kinds of junk,

490
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,086
who was the one who pushed it for you?

491
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,131
How could you be like that?

492
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,218
You can forget your resent,
but never someone's kindness.

493
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,429
How could you be so mean?

494
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,558
My goodness. Dear, what a pity.

495
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,354
You haven't had a bite to eat.

496
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,856
Are you okay?

497
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,443
Look at her face.
Does she look okay to you?

498
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,237
Do you want water?

499
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,617
What are you thinking right now?

500
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:43,002
Hye-ja is about to starve to death
because of that Jun-ha guy.

501
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,963
Jun-ha?

502
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,131
What about Jun-ha?

503
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,886
Aren't you like this
because Jun-ha has been arrested?

504
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:56,975
What?

505
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,560
Hey, Hye-ja.

506
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,816
-Wait. You didn't know?
-Hye-ja, pull Yourself together first...

507
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,444
Hye-ja.

508
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,492
WOMAN MURDERED FOR INSURANCE PAYOUT

509
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,705
AN ELABORATE CRIME PLANNED
BY AN EXHIBIT HALL EMPLOYEE

510
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,461
-Wait, Hye-ja!
-Hye-ja!

511
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,139
I'm telling you, Jun-ha is really
not someone who would do that.

512
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,851
There's no use talking to us.

513
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,103
They're already investigating
up there, so it's pointless.

514
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,772
Who do you mean by "they"?
We'll go meet them then.

515
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,899
Goodness, ma'am.

516
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,737
You look tired. Detective Kang,
please bring her home.

517
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,282
Ma'am? Where did she go?

518
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,497
Hey. You might really faint
if you keep doing this.

519
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,958
You need energy if you want to keep going.

520
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,507
You'll have an upset stomach. Eat slowly.

521
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,262
Do you really have to do this?

522
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,973
Like you said, if he's innocent,
he'll be released.

523
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,266
He has no one.

524
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,644
Jun-ha has no one but me.

525
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,229
What use will it be if you go--

526
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,982
I have to protect Jun-ha!

527
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,699
There were many other elder women
at the exhibit hall.

528
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,910
Was there a particular reason
you were close with her?

529
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,288
-Like I told you...
-I looked into it,

530
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,499
and the deceased was well-known
for being rich.

531
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,462
After your flight was canceled,
where did you go?

532
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,798
To the beach.

533
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,092
-Which beach?
-Just...

534
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,095
-Any place that came along.
-After that?

535
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,222
I stayed there.

536
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,766
Then there will be records of you
using an accommodation nearby.

537
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,017
No.

538
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,853
I just sat near the beach.

539
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,231
-All night?
-Yes.

540
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,319
Did anyone see you?

541
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,113
Anyone who can prove your alibi?

542
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,077
Did you know you were the recipient
of the insurance payout?

543
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,458
No, I didn't know.

544
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,550
Excuse me!

545
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,349
Ma'am, we're closed.

546
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,853
I know you saw everything on the news,

547
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,896
so come with me to the police station.

548
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,901
Why?

549
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,987
"Why?"

550
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,198
He's being wrongly imprisoned right now.

551
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,492
And he's like your brother,
so you should help him.

552
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,329
He's not close like an actual brother.

553
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,291
And we've suffered so much damages
because of him.

554
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,335
The police is carrying out
some investigation

555
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,755
-and business isn't going well.
-A man has been unfairly arrested.

556
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,299
How could you be worried about business?

557
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,386
Let's say Jun-ha was really behind this.

558
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:24,348
Who could say no to that kind of money?

559
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,143
He could've gotten greedy suddenly,
and decided to--

560
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,436
How could you say that?

561
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,105
You jerk. You're a real scumbag.

562
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,482
Which police station is Jun-ha at?

563
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,027
Since it came out on the news, is it
the Central Police Station?

564
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,570
Did they mention it on the news?

565
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,238
Let's grab a taxi.

566
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,282
Hye-ja, this won't do you any good.

567
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,368
Right. And nothing will change
right now even if you go.

568
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,038
-You guys are the same as him.
-Hey.

569
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,539
You don't have to help me.

570
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,083
I'll go save him on my own.

571
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,128
Pull yourself together, please!

572
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,006
-Help me catch a taxi.
-Hye-ja.

573
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,219
You're not eating, right?
Then I'll put this away.

574
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,266
Mr. Lee.

575
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,019
Why aren't you trying to explain yourself?

576
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,232
You know that all the circumstances
are putting you at a disadvantage.

577
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,484
All you do is state the facts.

578
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,071
You don't even deny
the accusations against you.

579
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,406
It's not like you're trying
to take the Fifth.

580
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,035
What is it? Guilt?

581
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,126
Goodness, is this some quiz or what?

582
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,470
Just stay in bed.

583
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,889
No, I want to go. I'll go see him.

584
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,432
I'll go check in on him, okay?

585
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,101
I'll tell you how he's doing.

586
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,103
No, I have to go see him myself.

587
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,606
Gosh. Let me help you with that.

588
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,864
I'll go with you, then.

589
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,454
Please let me meet the detective
in charge of the case.

590
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,248
He's busy with the investigation
at the moment.

591
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,457
Then I'll just see Jun-ha.

592
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,960
Let me make sure he's okay. Please?

593
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,129
He's fine, so please leave.

594
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,256
Why won't you let me see him if he's fine?

595
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,301
-Pardon me?
-Why can't I see him if he's fine?

596
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,720
Is there a reason I can't see him?

597
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,929
Hye-ja.

598
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,055
Did you...

599
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,974
hit him?

600
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,935
Ma'am, how could you say such a thing?

601
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,021
Why can't you let me see him if he's fine?

602
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,857
I bet you interrogated
that innocent guy all night...

603
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,943
and hit him for not saying
what you want to hear!

604
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,154
No one investigates like that these days.

605
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,573
What you just said
could get us in big trouble.

606
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,285
I'm not sure why you're here,

607
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,996
but we can't answer your questions
as we're investigating the case now.

608
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,956
-Please leave.
-Officer,

609
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,833
I can explain everything to you.

610
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,585
-What happened was--
-What can you explain?

611
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,962
The fact that he's
the insurance beneficiary?

612
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,590
Can you tell us anything
that can be used as his alibi?

613
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,216
That's...

614
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,468
All of you, please leave.

615
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,855
RELEASE LEE JUN-HA AT ONCE

616
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:21,692
RELEASE LEE JUN-HA AT ONCE

617
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,281
JUN-HA DID NOTHING WRONG,
SO PLEASE LET HIM GO

618
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,869
LEE JUN-HA DID NOTHING WRONG.
PLEASE LET HIM GO

619
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,498
RELEASE LEE JUN-HA AT ONCE

620
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:39,251
RELEASE LEE JUN-HA AT ONCE

621
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,433
Gosh, those old folks.

622
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,188
You must've taken great care
of those seniors.

623
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,111
Yes.

624
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,697
A letter? What letter?

625
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,077
Are you sure that lady sent it?

626
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,496
Did you check the security footage
from the post office?

627
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,915
Before she died?

628
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,420
Dear warmhearted young man, Lee Jun-ha.

629
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,672
I'm sorry.

630
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,259
You must be in shock.

631
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,511
I'm sorry.

632
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,020
You're Yong-seok, right?

633
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,773
I wouldn't have recognized you
had I run into you on the street.

634
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,733
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch.

635
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,485
Has everything been well with you?

636
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,611
Yes.

637
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,738
Well...

638
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,868
Do you still keep in touch with Su-hong?

639
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,036
Pardon?

640
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,752
-Yes.
-Really?

641
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,380
Did he change his number?

642
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,383
The phone number I have doesn't work.

643
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,926
By any chance,

644
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,762
did something happen to him in the US?

645
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,932
I'm so worried about him.

646
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,810
I'd like to visit him in the US.

647
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,687
Well...

648
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,856
Ma'am.

649
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,735
Su-hong is...

650
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,113
in Korea.

651
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,555
SOLBIT APARTMENT 2-1304
SONGHYEON 3-DONG, SEOUL

652
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,692
Who is it?

653
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,821
What's your name?

654
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,865
I'm Yu-bin.

655
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,451
My gosh, you're Yu-bin?

656
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,161
You're a big boy now.

657
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,704
Yu-bin!

658
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,872
Who is it?

659
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,001
Mom.

660
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,006
What brings you here?

661
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,636
Oh, well...

662
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,017
Yu-bin, go inside.

663
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,978
Daddy will be right back.

664
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,419
How did you get my address?

665
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,589
Oh, right.

666
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,675
Your friend, Yong-seok, gave it to me.

667
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,766
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch.

668
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,603
I understand everything.

669
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,480
Just work hard and live a good life.

670
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,733
That's all I want.

671
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,445
I had a bit of a situation.

672
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,490
Yes, I'm sure.

673
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,452
It must've been so hard for you.

674
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,918
How's your health?

675
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,712
Good.

676
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,674
What about you, Mom?

677
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,218
Yes, I'm fine too.

678
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,472
What about your wife?

679
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,974
She's well.

680
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,935
My gosh.

681
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,480
Yu-bin, that baby,

682
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,482
is already a big boy.

683
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,484
He even talks like a big boy now.

684
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,612
He's four this year, right?

685
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,031
Yes.

686
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:23,285
The older one, Ji-yul,
looks just like her mother,

687
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,995
so I was a little disappointed,

688
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,623
but Yu-bin takes after you--

689
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,249
I should get back.

690
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,669
I have to bathe my youngest one.

691
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,089
Oh, okay.

692
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,633
Well...

693
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,886
Can I see your kids?

694
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,223
I miss Ji-yul, and I want to spend
some time with Yu-bin as well.

695
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,433
I think they're coming down with a cold.

696
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:52,981
If they're coming down with a cold,

697
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,983
they should stay home.

698
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,320
All right, then. You should get back.

699
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,030
Okay.

700
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,408
Stay healthy.

701
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,889
He was too sorry to call me.

702
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,823
If we ever meet in another life,

703
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:30,162
I'd like to be your mom, Jun-ha.

704
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,708
Thank you for everything.

705
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,639
Are you her grandson?

706
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,104
-No.
-Then...

707
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,737
I just know her.

708
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,257
She might have been unlucky with her son,

709
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,259
but she at least had Jun-ha.

710
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,596
Well, pour me one.

711
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,016
You'll get drunk.

712
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,018
Why can't I get drunk on a day like this?

713
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,186
-Pour me a glass.
-My goodness.

714
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,231
Goodbye.

715
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,286
I can go for you.

716
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,289
She was my friend.

717
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:40,626
I should go say goodbye.

718
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,070
CHOE HWA-YEONG

719
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,032
So that's her name.

720
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:18,789
"Choe Hwa-yeong."

721
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,058
Did you eat?

722
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,560
I'm okay.

723
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,788
-Are you tired?
-I'm fine.

724
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,790
Let's go home.

725
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,472
Go on. I'll catch up.

726
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,996
It's so futile, right?

727
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:46,877
Life seems so futile.

728
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,548
She lived for more than 70 years.

729
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,509
And look what's left.

730
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,513
During the 70-something years of her life,

731
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,684
she must have experienced
all kinds of things.

732
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,608
But all that's left now is a picture.

733
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,448
You see,

734
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,618
I mean so much to myself.

735
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,874
To others, I might be just an old person.

736
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,668
There isn't anything
to look forward to anymore.

737
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,922
It'd be pointless to even regret anything.

738
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,009
People would wonder why I even care.

739
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,808
But I still feel so sorry for myself.

740
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,525
I hope you

741
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,362
and your life

742
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,909
mean a lot to you.

743
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,935
Let's go.

744
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,940
Here we go.

745
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,378
LATE CHOE HWA-YEONG

746
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,089
JANUARY 4, 1949
NOVEMBER 20, 2018

747
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,129
Thank you.

748
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,048
"Thank you"?

749
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,138
How could you say, "Thank you"?

750
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,684
Your mother just passed away.

751
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,313
Look. I was just grateful...

752
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,565
For what?

753
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,236
For me mourning for three days
instead of you?

754
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,822
Is that what you're grateful for?

755
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:27,991
Or...

756
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,619
for me checking on your mother
from time to time

757
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,873
while she was staying at a shabby motel

758
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,207
and you were out of reach?

759
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,711
Or...

760
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,924
for me letting her live a few more years

761
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,846
even though she always carried a
bottle of pills that could kill her?

762
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,976
Thanking me...

763
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,813
is not something you should say
to me right now.

764
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,752
This grandma gave me this toy.

765
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:24,464
-What?
-This grandma gave me this.

766
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,132
When?

767
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:30,720
When we were taking a walk
at the daycare center.

768
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,350
You can enjoy your free time now.

769
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,643
Have fun.

770
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,938
Come on, let's play!

771
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,274
Yu-bin.

772
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,986
You're the grandma from yesterday.

773
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,280
Yu-bin.

774
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,958
You look just like your dad.

775
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,212
You look just like him when he was young.

776
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,936
Yu-bin. Who was that?

777
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,938
The grandma from yesterday.

778
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,648
Grandma from yesterday?

779
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,291
Yu-bin.

780
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,919
She's not the grandma from yesterday.

781
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,630
She's your real grandma.

782
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,216
Real grandma?

783
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,954
I knew you'd be here.

784
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,665
Buy me udon. I'm hungry.

785
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,756
Where were you planning to go?

786
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,092
Russia.

787
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,887
Russia? Why?

788
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,607
I'll take the Trans-Siberian train.

789
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,025
I wanted to take the train

790
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,819
to go see the aurora.

791
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,958
Don't you hate Hye-ja?

792
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,461
She left without a word

793
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,129
and said she'd come back

794
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,423
but didn't keep her promise.

795
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,842
Is she playing with our feelings or what?

796
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,432
Missing someone can be done on my own

797
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,559
so it's okay.

798
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,066
And I received a lot from Hye-ja.

799
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,528
And from you too.

800
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,203
You were the first ones
who embraced my life...

801
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,834
and cried for me.

802
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,513
The thing that made me suffer
the most wasn't my mom who left

803
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,974
or my dad who used to hit me.

804
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,603
It was myself.

805
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,193
I suffered my whole life, not being
able to embrace myself.

806
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,908
I was an error made from a mistake,

807
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,331
and I knew well that I was born
without any blessings.

808
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,834
So I really hated myself for it.

809
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,671
But...

810
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,009
even when I couldn't embrace myself,

811
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,513
she was the first one who
embraced me and cried.

812
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,019
Go.

813
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,397
Why aren't you going to see the aurora?

814
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,817
Will I be able to go?

815
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,527
You can just go.

816
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,696
Why are you sitting here like this?

817
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,698
You should go right now.

818
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,077
Go...

819
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,414
and see my share of the aurora too.

820
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:09,916
Okay?

821
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,086
You have to tell me all about it

822
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,631
when you get back.

823
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,050
Tell me how much you cried.

824
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,010
Promise me.

825
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,102
I'll think about you a lot
when I go there, ma'am.

826
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,739
You don't have to think about me.

827
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,705
Just think of Hye-ja.

828
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,583
The 25-year-old...

829
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,045
Hye-ja.

830
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:28,953
Here.

831
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:31,831
What is this?

832
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:33,791
I picked it up on the way here.

833
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,918
Throw it away then.
Or you can just keep it.

834
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,712
Hey.

835
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,632
DONGAN CHINESE RESTAURANT

836
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,426
Give me your hand.

837
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,016
Other hand.

838
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,812
They fit perfectly.

839
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,858
I was banned for life,

840
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,985
but I received a ton of candies.

841
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,448
Why is it red? It's so tacky.

842
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,494
Do you want to watch a movie tonight?

843
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,332
What's wrong with your face? Are you sick?

844
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,792
Hey, forget it.

845
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,585
Why would I watch a movie with you? Move.

846
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,048
I'll see you at seven o'clock.

847
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,037
You must've went through a lot.

848
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,373
Your face looks terrible.

849
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,627
You have a lot of money now.

850
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,420
You should get some herbal tonics
or something.

851
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,464
It feels unfortunate looking at you.

852
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:04,924
It makes me sad.

853
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,425
What do you mean, money?

854
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,594
Goodness.

855
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,972
Come on. There's no secret between us.

856
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,473
Lady Chanel.

857
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,311
You're really good at acting.

858
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,982
What else did she have besides money?

859
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:25,528
And you're the one who
she adored the most.

860
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:26,737
Right?

861
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,448
How much did you get?

862
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:30,825
I didn't get anything.

863
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,661
When her son went to the US,

864
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,454
she sold her house to support him.

865
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,498
She used to stay at a motel.

866
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,417
You know that too.

867
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,711
How would I know, you scumbag?

868
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,672
Seriously? Are you really
going to be like this?

869
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,007
I thought we were like brothers.

870
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:50,970
Gosh.

871
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:54,849
And you talked Lady Chanel into

872
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,686
making you the beneficiary
of the insurance payout?

873
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,481
Gosh, you're a real crook.

874
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:06,944
Speaking of which,

875
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,365
stop selling life insurance policies
to seniors.

876
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,160
It's wrong, Hui-won. You're trying
to make money off people's lives.

877
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:22,960
Look at this little punk.

878
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,340
Fine, you jerk.

879
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,967
I make money off people's lives.
Got a problem with that?

880
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,511
Yes? What are you going to do about it?

881
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,930
Will you report me to the police?

882
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,431
Go ahead, you punk.

883
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,602
You know what?

884
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,605
I don't think you can get on that plane.

885
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,114
Hye-ja.

886
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,577
Hey, just cry if you're sad.

887
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,579
No, I feel relieved.

888
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,624
Even I think I'm a pretty cool lady.

889
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,417
I didn't cry at all.

890
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,503
I was trying so hard to hold back my tears

891
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:06,921
that my eyeballs almost burst.

892
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:11,050
Girl, we told you that you don't
need to act tough in front of us.

893
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,802
I'm telling you the truth.

894
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:15,429
All right, then.
Then shall we go on a trip together?

895
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,640
I'd love that!
Where do you girls want to go?

896
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,266
You know you must respect
your elders, right?

897
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,268
You girls have to respect
my opinion no matter what.

898
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,813
-Then we can't go away.
-Says who?

899
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:25,398
You just belittled seniors. Come here.

900
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,608
Hey, calm down.

901
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,816
Were you really going to turn me in?

902
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,401
This is out of line. Stop, please.

903
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,862
All those seniors will die
because of a punk like you.

904
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:14,905
Have you seen Mr. Lee?

905
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,993
-Lee Jun...
-You've seen him?

906
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,661
Mr. Lee has been kidnapped?

907
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,663
We're the only ones who can save Mr. Lee

908
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,290
and the seniors
who are going on the picnic.

909
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,792
We need a perfect plan
to make sure no one gets hurt.

910
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,378
Jun-ha.

911
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:31,839
That's not Mr. Lee.

912
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:32,923
Hye-ja.

913
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:33,883
Jun-ha.

914
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:34,925
Jun-ha.

915
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,636
Jun-ha!

916
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:40,056
