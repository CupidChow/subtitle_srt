1
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,109
PRINCE YEONG-SU TV, NO FOOD,
NO BATHROOM, NO EDITING

2
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,945
A 48-HOUR SLEEPING SHOW!

3
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,115
"CHAOS" HAS ENTERED THE ROOM

4
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,326
WHAT KIND OF ROOM IS THIS?

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,456
CAN'T YOU SEE HIM SLEEPING?
IT'S A SLEEPING ROOM

6
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,169
LOL

7
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,378
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ME

8
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,546
LET'S DO AN ADULT SHOW

9
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,340
IF THE ADMINISTRATOR SEES THIS,
HE'S BANNED FOR GOOD

10
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,387
WHO IS THAT?

11
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,181
PLEASE WAKE HIM UP

12
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,391
TEACH HIM SOME PROFESSIONAL SKILLS
AND SEND HIM TO A FACTORY!

13
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,729
I'LL GIVE YOU 100 CANDIES
IF YOU WAKE HIM UP

14
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,732
He doesn't even pitch in a penny
for the electricity bill.

15
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,193
He should turn off the computer at least.

16
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,905
OH MY GOSH! SHE LOOKS LIKE A GHOST

17
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,198
IT'S AN OLD LADY

18
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,158
THAT GRANDMA JUST SITTING THERE
IS MORE INTERESTING

19
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,035
He's broadcasting something.

20
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,373
"A 48-hour Sleeping Show"?

21
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,918
What is a Sleeping Show?

22
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,753
A SHOW WHERE YOU DO NOTHING BUT SLEEP

23
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,296
LYING DOWN AND EARNING CANDIES FOR FREE

24
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,756
IT'S SUCH A COMFORTABLE WORLD

25
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,382
A show where you do nothing but sleep?

26
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,259
Why would you watch that?

27
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,387
LOL

28
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:42,352
LADY, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,603
Me?

30
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,396
How old am I?

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,315
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S FROM THE STONE AGE

32
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,776
YOU SHOULD TREAT ELDERS WITH MORE RESPECT

33
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,528
STOP PRETENDING TO BE NICE

34
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,071
I'm 25 years old.

35
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,781
MY GOODNESS

36
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,367
Hello. My name is Kim Hye-ja.

37
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,536
I turned 25 this year.

38
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,996
Although you won't believe it.

39
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,351
I am an ordinary 25-year-old woman
living in Korea.

40
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,189
Hey, Kim Hye-ja!

41
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,359
Except for my name, which is
a bit old-fashioned for this era.

42
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,032
I told you not to call my name
out loud in public.

43
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,784
Kim Hye-ja! Kim Hye-ja!

44
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,578
Shut it.

45
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,291
It's cold.

46
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,334
I'm hungry.

47
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,170
Where's Mom and the seafood?
Did she get on a boat or what?

48
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,050
Idiot.

49
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:56,968
Why?

50
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,595
That's not food. It's plastic.

51
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,346
What? It's edible. It's a bamboo leaf.

52
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,931
It's so obvious that it's plastic.

53
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,933
You've never even seen a bamboo leaf.

54
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,811
This isn't from Korea.

55
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,771
I can smell some Chinese spices.

56
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,107
It's from China. The Shanxi area.

57
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,358
You're so lame.

58
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,528
This is why pandas eat this.

59
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,155
Do you know xylitol?

60
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,365
Xylitol is made from birch trees.

61
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,950
This feels refreshing in my mouth.

62
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,368
It feels like I'm brushing my teeth.

63
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,912
Idiot.

64
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,458
Are you saying that's a real bamboo leaf?

65
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,918
I'm telling you, it is.

66
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,389
You've been fooled by him for 25 years.

67
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,557
Do you still believe Yeong-su?

68
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,267
-Darn it!
-Spit it out.

69
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,063
Dad.

70
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,981
Gosh, I almost swallowed it.

71
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,066
You have trust issues.

72
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,109
Still, you've gotten better
compared to before.

73
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,819
You used to believe anything he said.

74
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,447
You put a mothball in your mouth,
thinking it was mint candy.

75
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,783
Seriously. I spit it back out
after three seconds

76
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,285
but couldn't taste anything
for three days because of that jerk.

77
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,913
Hey. Don't call your older brother a jerk.

78
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,123
Don't you want to be a news anchor?
Watch your mouth.

79
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,918
-Whatever.
-Who is a news anchor?

80
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,087
I'm not a news anchor.

81
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,256
I just wish I could become

82
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,632
a news anchor.

83
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,510
-She's not yet.
-She'll become one soon.

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,558
Hey. I told you not to sit
next to the window.

85
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,768
You'll get freckles.

86
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,270
Sit where the sun can't reach you.

87
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,354
She's right.

88
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,364
Whether it's an actress,
news anchor, or a singer.

89
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,741
For all jobs
where TV appearances are essential,

90
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,202
I heard the entire family has to help out.

91
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,998
You know we can't even afford
to send you to a skincare clinic.

92
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,082
Don't say that.

93
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,835
Instead, you make a facial treatment
using cucumbers for me every day,

94
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,213
and Dad makes me a hair treatment
with whisked egg whites every night.

95
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,590
This is why I was born as your daughter.

96
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,432
I heard you'll be unlucky
until this year. Always be careful.

97
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,601
-Okay.
-Mom.

98
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,688
You never treated me like this
when I failed the entrance exam.

99
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,315
Am I just imagining it?

100
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,025
-Yes, you are.
-I see.

101
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,903
You slept more than a newborn would
when you had to study.

102
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,822
Could you have treated yourself well?

103
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,991
A newborn has hopes and dreams at least.

104
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,202
Hopes and dreams? I have them too.

105
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,997
My dream is...

106
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,208
eating grilled pork.

107
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,339
I guess that was too ambitious.

108
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,967
Yes,

109
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,887
this is just another ordinary day
with my family.

110
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,014
Mom, I'm going for a walk.

111
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,517
Make sure you put on a hat.

112
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,069
This beach has a special place
in my heart.

113
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,071
Was it when I was five?

114
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,990
I found this watch right here.

115
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,162
Get a taste of this, Hye-ja!

116
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,666
Stop!

117
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,503
Stop it now. Mom! I told you to stop!

118
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,922
Stop it now. Mom!

119
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,192
What just happened?

120
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,612
Get a taste of this, Hye-ja!

121
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,284
Mom!

122
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,634
Get a taste of this, Hye-ja!

123
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,720
Stop!

124
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,142
Stop!

125
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,948
Get a taste of this, Hye-ja!

126
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,162
The watch I stumbled upon on this beach.

127
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,998
enabled me to turn back time.

128
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,959
What? What's the problem?

129
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,463
Doesn't everyone stumble upon
such a watch on the beach?

130
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,972
Anyway, upon finding the magical watch,

131
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,266
I got so excited as if
I had acquired almighty powers.

132
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,561
Even though I was only a little girl,

133
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,647
-I had so many regrets.
-It hurts.

134
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,565
To sleep five more minutes
in the morning...

135
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,819
CLASS 1, 2ND GRADE, NAME: KIM HYE-JA

136
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,239
To get a higher score on a quiz.

137
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,579
ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION, NAME: KIM HYE-JA

138
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,582
After turning the crown on
the special watch so many times...

139
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,001
Hey! Who's the boss here?

140
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,378
-Hye-ja.
-Hye-ja.

141
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,552
I had to pay for turning back time
so many times.

142
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,722
The more I turn back time,
the faster my time flies by.

143
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,432
She looks old enough
to be in middle school.

144
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,810
DATE OF BIRTH: OCTOBER 25, 1994, AGE: 10

145
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,062
Your daughter looks very mature.

146
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,730
My parents tried not to show

147
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,358
how worried they were
about me growing up so fast,

148
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,069
but they kept sighing more and more.

149
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,532
Hence, I decided not to get
the watch's help anymore.

150
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,412
But around the time when I started
looking the same age as my peers,

151
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,289
I became torn again.

152
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,293
I realized none of the characters
with special powers

153
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,337
in superhero movies or cartoons
lives a normal life.

154
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,550
What if this ability was bestowed
upon me so that I can save mankind?

155
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,552
What if I actually
didn't stumble upon the watch?

156
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:58,180
Perhaps it chose me out of
all the human beings on this planet.

157
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,225
So that I can become the hero
that saves mankind.

158
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,020
I thought I could be a scientist,

159
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,813
but I quickly realized
I wasn't cut out for it

160
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,064
when I gave up on math.

161
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,652
As for becoming a hero to save mankind,

162
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,448
realizing how lazy and weak I am

163
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,326
put an end to my unrealistic dream.

164
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,120
However, life always unfolds

165
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,456
as it was meant to.

166
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,583
Hey, Hye-ja. Where are you going?

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,168
What?

168
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,419
Hey, this is her.

169
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,379
The one we talked about the other day.
The phone call.

170
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,548
Your sister with a pretty voice?

171
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,092
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,553
-Be quiet.
-What? Don't act all coy.

173
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,513
You sound like
the TBC news anchor, Jang Eun-ju.

174
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,142
Anchor Jang Eun-ju is my ideal type.

175
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,854
Anchor Jang Eun-ju is my ideal type.

176
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,022
That's right.

177
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,983
Because I fall in love easily,
just like that on a whim,

178
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,985
I decided to become

179
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,112
a news anchor, which has
nothing to do with a hero.

180
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,280
Let's go.

181
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,537
This is an announcement.

182
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,831
The winner of the piglet

183
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,502
at the recent track meet lost the piglet.

184
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,798
If you've seen it, please contact
the registrar's office immediately.

185
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:18,344
HBS' Kim Hye-ja
will continue to do her best.

186
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,929
Thank you.

187
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,059
By the way, does an anchor
really have to do these things?

188
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,144
Just think of it as an experience.

189
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:35,277
"Tofu and oysters make
great drink accompaniments.

190
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,447
Soju and..." Darn it.

191
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,867
Goodness, this is useless.

192
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,370
It's all useless.

193
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,249
I wish I was born in the Stone Age.

194
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,751
I could do nothing besides eating,
sleeping, and breathing,

195
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,711
and no one would judge me
for being jobless.

196
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,713
How are you going to
earn a living, Hye-ja?

197
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,008
Hye-ja.

198
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,010
Hye-ja! Kim Hye-ja!

199
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,680
-Kim Hye-ja!
-What?

200
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,475
Oh, no. My gosh.
Can you come here for a second?

201
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,394
Gosh, my goodness.

202
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,356
-Hey, what's going on?
-"Don't worry, you idiot."

203
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,108
-What?
-Hey, turn on the light.

204
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,526
It's gotten slightly dark.

205
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,695
Hey, you can reach the light switch
without even getting up.

206
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,072
-Are you that lazy to do that?
-This book is brand new.

207
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,782
If I take my hands off,
the pages will flip.

208
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,159
That will totally ruin the momentum.

209
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,870
-"You idiot."
-Gosh.

210
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,331
-Hye-ja, Kim Hye-ja!
-What now?

211
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,624
Do you have some time today?

212
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,335
Why? Why do you ask?

213
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,546
If you have some time,
do something about your face.

214
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,381
Be considerate of those who live with you.

215
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,511
Hey! Defense, defense!

216
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,013
Well done!

217
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,225
That little...

218
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,358
Mom, is there no water at the salon again?

219
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,444
I don't know what's happening.
The pressure is bad again.

220
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,113
Customers keep coming in. It'll take
forever to wash my hands there.

221
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,574
I told you to wear gloves
when you touch hair dye.

222
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,284
That's why the skin
on your fingers is peeling.

223
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,120
I don't have time
to put on and take off gloves.

224
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,207
I have to color and cut hair.
Then I have to do a perm.

225
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,877
You're swamped, right?
Shall I give you a hand?

226
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,378
It's okay. Just do what you have to do.

227
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,841
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

228
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,134
-Gosh, stop it.
-What?

229
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,928
Come on.

230
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,262
Why didn't you do that?

231
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,764
I don't know.

232
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,017
Who knew that would happen?

233
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,061
-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

234
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,354
-My gosh.
-Hello.

235
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,564
I'll take care of this.

236
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,400
My gosh, even Hye-ja is an expert now.

237
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,277
She knows exactly what to do.

238
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,531
Since she was little, she's been
watching what her mom does.

239
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,451
We'll be happy if Hye-ja
keeps assisting her mom here.

240
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,204
No, she'll become a news anchor.

241
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,039
When she becomes a news anchor,

242
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,500
I'll sell this salon and just travel.

243
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,543
Gosh, I'm sick of this.

244
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,961
News anchor?

245
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,004
So she'll be on the news?

246
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,716
Oh, my. If Hye-ja becomes a news anchor,

247
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,969
she'll make her entire family proud,

248
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,971
and even all her neighbors
will be so proud of her.

249
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,598
I should shake her hand
before she becomes famous.

250
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,353
Well, I'm just preparing
for the test, that's all.

251
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,528
HOJUNG UNIVERSITY
BROADCASTING CLUB REUNION

252
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,366
Microphone check, one, two.

253
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,496
All right, some of you
haven't paid the fee yet.

254
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,915
-Lee Nam-gyu and Eun Ji-su.
-Hey.

255
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,626
Do you think you still manage
our finances or what?

256
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,378
And you, Park Gwang-su.

257
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,381
Please pay before
I get drunk and bite you,

258
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,801
I'll pay. I will.

259
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,969
It's just a bit delayed.

260
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,179
Look at you. I thought you became
a successful salesman.

261
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,973
Why haven't you paid the fee yet?

262
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,641
"Successful"?

263
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,061
Speaking of which,

264
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,482
classmates are supposed to
help each other out, right?

265
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,984
Please sign up.

266
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,403
You haven't been listening?

267
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,571
I have no job.

268
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,656
I obviously can't afford insurance.

269
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,575
-Oh, Seo-yeon is here.
-She came?

270
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,952
She's a TBC news anchor.

271
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,377
I'm sorry I'm late.

272
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,421
Don't worry.

273
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,882
Seo-yeon, sit here.

274
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,092
Gosh, why are you so heavy?

275
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,469
Thank you.

276
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,015
-Hi.
-Hi.

277
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,059
Hye-ja, have you been well?

278
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,102
-Yes.
-I'm sorry I'm late.

279
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,813
Hyeon-jong was advising me
on tomorrow's news program.

280
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,024
-I see.
-Anchor Kim Hyeon-jong?

281
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,150
Are you close to him?

282
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,860
I'm a newcomer.

283
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,863
He advises others as well.

284
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,115
You totally look like a news anchor
already.

285
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,743
No way. This is only my first year.

286
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,870
I can barely find my way
around the broadcasting station.

287
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,247
It's incredible.
You became a TBC news anchor.

288
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,834
Isn't she the first club member
who got into TBC

289
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,336
in six years?

290
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,380
Is that right?

291
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,387
Hye-ja, did you apply for TBC this year?

292
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,473
I meant to look for your application,

293
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,351
but I've been so busy
meeting different people.

294
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,769
It's okay.

295
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,522
I didn't even apply, so don't worry.

296
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,315
I've completely given up.

297
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,652
Then why are you trying to become
a reporter,

298
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,278
going around cities,
getting stung by a wasp,

299
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,280
and getting swollen up
after eating lacquered chicken?

300
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,865
You haven't given up, am I wrong?

301
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,118
You... Stop it.

302
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,036
Hye-ja, do you remember?

303
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,415
In my freshman year,
you corrected my pronunciation.

304
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,751
You said I had trouble with the S sound,

305
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,629
and made me repeat the sentence,
"She sells seashells," many times.

306
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,340
"She sells seashells."

307
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,260
I guess I still haven't nailed it.

308
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,387
Really? Hye-ja did that?

309
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,473
To the future TBC news anchor?

310
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,641
Exactly.

311
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,976
I must have been out of my mind.

312
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,269
I didn't know my place.

313
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,480
By the way, from Seo-yeon to Jang-ho,

314
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,817
I'm glad many of our club members
are doing well.

315
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,986
I heard Jang-ho is back in Korea.

316
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,903
Really?

317
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,322
He was visiting the director
of the broadcasting station.

318
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,201
He really seems to live his life
to the fullest.

319
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,328
While working as a TBC news anchor,

320
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,456
he saw a photo of a refugee camp,

321
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,000
quit his job right away,
and became a war correspondent.

322
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,877
You didn't ask him to come today?

323
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,004
He said he's going to a family gathering.

324
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,798
But he promised to stop by at next
week's workshop in Ganghwa Island.

325
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,593
You'll be there too, right?

326
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,470
-Me?
-I think I heard

327
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,473
you had a crush on him a long time ago.

328
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,477
I wasn't the only one
who had a crush on him.

329
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,272
But you even told him you liked him,

330
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,440
if I heard correctly.

331
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,115
Yes, I told him I liked him!

332
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,203
I didn't exactly get turned down, though.

333
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,247
I was just ignored.

334
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,210
I don't care about Kwon Jang-ho
or anyone else anymore.

335
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,505
I don't need anyone!

336
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,597
Gosh.

337
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,684
Who are you?

338
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,897
What...

339
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,484
Why didn't you make any sound?

340
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,237
I didn't want to embarrass you.

341
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,532
Are you a pervert or what?

342
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,702
Watching other people from a dark place.

343
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,749
I came here first.

344
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:50,003
I would have stood up and left,
but that would have humiliated you.

345
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,756
So I decided to stay here until you leave.

346
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,551
What kind of pervert would think that?

347
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:00,055
Still, if you noticed
someone was coming here...

348
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,061
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

349
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,988
Is he homeless?

350
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,281
HELP-WANTED

351
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,991
Oh, I don't think he is.

352
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,453
Gosh, that pervert.

353
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,498
He better not show up in front of me.

354
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,418
He didn't exactly look like a pervert.

355
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,172
Hey. What makes you think so?

356
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,424
He was hiding alone in the park at night

357
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,467
and watching you. So which part exactly?

358
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,219
It's just my gut feeling.

359
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,055
Sorry. The night shift came late.

360
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,600
Why do you carry a guitar around
when you can't even play it?

361
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,352
Don't be like that. She's a musician.

362
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,397
It just expired.

363
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,067
Thank you. You're so smart.

364
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,903
Your part-time job isn't what matters.

365
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,654
You said you'd settle things
with your agency.

366
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,072
Will they renew your contract?

367
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,157
It's already been renewed.

368
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,658
-Really?
-For how much?

369
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,952
"How much"? They didn't say how much.

370
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,579
-What about your debut?
-My debut?

371
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,539
They said I can debut if I want to.

372
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,708
It's their job to debut you.

373
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,419
So what were the terms?

374
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,924
I can use the practice room
as much as I want.

375
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,009
I can come and go as I want,

376
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,053
debut as I want,

377
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,847
and decide the duration
of the contract as I want to.

378
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,224
So what can you not do as you want?

379
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,353
They just don't want me
to tell anyone I belong to them.

380
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,314
What should we do?

381
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,482
What should we do with you?

382
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,901
You guys wanted my contract to be renewed.

383
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,027
Fine, good job.

384
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,529
By the way, Hye-ja, where were you?

385
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,657
She went to a broadcasting club gathering.

386
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,534
Jang-ho is back in Korea.

387
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,036
Who...

388
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,080
The person you drank Kaoliang for?

389
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,166
Guys, this is not the right place.

390
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,543
-Right?
-Let's go.

391
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,587
BANQUET

392
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,217
When he said he was going to be
a war correspondent,

393
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,136
I thought he was lying to turn me down.

394
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,471
It just didn't make sense.

395
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,848
Why would a news anchor suddenly
become a war correspondent?

396
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,768
But he had many reasons to turn you down.

397
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,228
You're not going to deny it, are you?

398
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,772
You know you were partly responsible
for me asking him out, don't you?

399
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,191
What are you talking about?
You said you had to get drunk

400
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,151
and asked for strong liquor yourself.

401
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,196
Right. You mixed Kaoliang wine with beer

402
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,990
and gulped it down.

403
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,919
Jang-ho.

404
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,005
Why didn't you guys stop me?

405
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,967
Do you know what bothers me the most?

406
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,012
The next day, I remembered everything.

407
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,889
But he acted as if nothing had happened.

408
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,309
He was a nice guy to the end.

409
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,145
You want to see him, don't you?

410
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,440
Just once, no more.

411
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,525
Forget it. If he sees you again,

412
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,110
he'll only remember the time you threw up.

413
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,445
I guess you're right.

414
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,740
But I heard all guys have
positive feelings towards

415
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,158
girls who asked them out.

416
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,784
-Is that right?
-Do you think that's right?

417
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,329
If that's right, he would've gone
out with you even if you threw up.

418
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,874
That sounds so romantic.

419
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,043
Isn't that true love?

420
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,210
You're right.

421
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,379
I'm sure there were reasons
why he didn't go out with me.

422
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,424
Right. I shouldn't go.

423
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,800
I won't go.

424
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,219
It'd be too humiliating.

425
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,893
That dropped on the floor earlier.

426
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,481
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

427
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,860
Have a seat.

428
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,111
Where is Hye-ja?

429
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,404
I don't know.

430
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,199
Something must be bothering her.
She is still asleep drunk.

431
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,325
My goodness.

432
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,369
Do I have to look after
a grown-up son all day?

433
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,498
Hye-ja, come out and eat.

434
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,959
Leave her alone. She should
take better care of herself.

435
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,461
She drinks too much.

436
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,509
What should we have for dinner today?

437
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,052
We have no food at home.

438
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,972
Mother, why don't I go buy some pork?

439
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,725
Should I make some sujebi?
With perilla seeds.

440
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,060
That sounds great.

441
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,562
Perilla seed sujebi loaded with
vitamin C and iron sure sounds good.

442
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,731
But for a balanced intake
of protein and saturated fat,

443
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,274
why don't we have pork?

444
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,692
You little punk.

445
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,153
If you want pork, sell your mom.

446
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,989
I wish I could.

447
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,199
What?

448
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,700
I'm just joking.

449
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,079
I just want some pork.

450
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,873
This is my last warning.

451
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,292
I don't want to hear you
talk about pork again.

452
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,087
Okay.

453
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,429
What is it?

454
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,306
Is the soup too bland?

455
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,142
Does it need more salt?

456
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,938
You're neither buying me any pork

457
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,649
nor letting me cry.

458
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:08,488
BLOOD CENTER

459
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,242
SAVE LIVES BY DONATING BLOOD

460
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,035
MOVE TICKET FOR EVERY DONOR

461
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,962
I don't normally accept movie tickets.

462
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,423
I only accepted them
because we're neighbors.

463
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,799
Sir.

464
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,259
No bones.

465
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,927
I don't want any bones.

466
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,762
There are no bones.

467
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,306
Gosh, I have no energy.

468
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,768
Hey, here.

469
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,312
-Thanks.
-Are you sick?

470
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,897
You look pale.

471
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,732
I'm okay.

472
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,655
Goodbye.

473
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,850
This tastes perfect.

474
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,939
Where have you been all day?

475
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,108
-What is that?
-Don't talk to me.

476
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,653
I feel dizzy.

477
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,700
Please help me up. Come on.

478
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,037
What's wrong with you?

479
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,749
-Where's Mom?
-She's working.

480
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,225
Did you sell that movie ticket
after donating blood?

481
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,560
-You'll get in big trouble.
-Wait.

482
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,438
Hey. Didn't you just hear something?

483
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,732
If you're that worried,
just go grill it outside.

484
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,900
Are you stupid?

485
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,861
If I meet someone I know, I have to share.

486
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,864
I don't want to.
I'm going to eat all alone.

487
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,159
Do you think you won't get caught
if you grill that at home?

488
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,080
That's the difference between you and me.

489
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,667
Look at this. Ta-da!

490
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,919
Hey, come here and help me up.

491
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,719
This is the only time
you can leave this room.

492
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,390
Hey. If you tell Mom,
I'm going to kill you.

493
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,100
I won't, since you're trying way too hard.

494
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,727
Thanks.

495
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,438
All right then. No one will know.

496
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,999
THE LOWER FLOOR IS A MULTIPURPOSE COMPLEX

497
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,379
Look at that.

498
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,883
Did that old lady give you
bracken instead of money?

499
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,136
She should at least change the types
of vegetables.

500
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,596
She always gives you bracken.

501
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,058
If they brought me vegetables
based on your taste,

502
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,018
they wouldn't even feel sorry
in the first place.

503
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,687
There's no one who brings me
these types of vegetables

504
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,481
to my beauty salon
and doesn't feel sorry to me.

505
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,983
It's not like they're brazen,
they're just broke.

506
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,277
Being broke is not a sin.

507
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,863
That's true.

508
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,616
I'm finished now.

509
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,618
-You can have all the rest.
-I'm full too.

510
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,787
Let's eat the rest equally like this.

511
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,413
I've gained too much weight lately.

512
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,956
We can't waste this food.

513
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,129
Hey, forget it. It's better for me
to gain weight.

514
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,339
I'll eat it.

515
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,258
By the way, why is Yeong-su
so quiet today?

516
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,010
He came home with pork...

517
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,971
He came home, and he's probably
in his room.

518
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,224
Get him a simple snack.

519
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,434
If he doesn't eat at that age,
he'll get sick.

520
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,103
Okay.

521
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,914
Hey. Are you enjoying it?

522
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,625
You even locked the door to eat alone?

523
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,460
Did you take kimchi with you?

524
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,381
Goodness. He's too busy eating
to hear anything.

525
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,932
Hey, Yeong-su.

526
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,976
Is the neighbor grilling pork?

527
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,019
-It smells.
-Yeong-su!

528
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,813
-What?
-What?

529
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,649
This door won't open.

530
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,027
-How much tape did he put on here?
-What tape?

531
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,488
Wait. What's wrong with this door?

532
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,867
Hey, Yeong-su. Yeong-su!

533
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,995
You idiot! Open this door now!

534
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,246
Yeong-su!

535
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,165
Yeong-su!

536
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,709
-Yeong-su.
-Oh, my gosh!

537
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,920
-Yeong-su!
-Yeong-su!

538
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,297
Oh, gosh.

539
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,631
-What do we do?
-Yeong-su!

540
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,008
-Yeong-su!
-Yeong-su!

541
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,676
Oh, no...

542
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,722
He temporarily suffocated
due to lack of oxygen.

543
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,727
What?

544
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,729
What did you say?

545
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,902
What did he say?

546
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,031
He asked you to flip the pork
so it doesn't get burned.

547
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,202
Sorry?

548
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,832
-Honey.
-No, Mom.

549
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,083
-Mom.
-Get him out of here.

550
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,335
-Hurry up and go!
-Mom.

551
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,170
-Honey.
-Mom, no.

552
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,130
-Mom.
-Let go of me!

553
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,007
-Hey! Stop!
-Honey!

554
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,802
-Honey, come back!
-Mom, no!

555
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,598
Gosh. Yeong-su died?

556
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,350
What do you mean?

557
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,727
He didn't die. He wanted to die,

558
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,896
so he lit coal inside his room.

559
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,649
The ambulance was here,
and it was a total frenzy.

560
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,108
Is it because he was stressed?

561
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,152
Gosh, that's so tragic.

562
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,113
Still, he was very fortunate to survive.

563
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,908
I heard they smelled the meat
burning from his room.

564
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,494
-I hope he wasn't burnt badly.
-I know.

565
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,412
-They talk too much.
-Gosh.

566
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,123
They just make up fake stories.

567
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,085
-Hyeon-ju, it's a relief, isn't it?
-What is?

568
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,629
Yeong-su was your first love.

569
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,340
Hey, watch that mouth of yours.
Hyeon-ju, wait.

570
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,009
It's all right. We all do

571
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,470
crazy things like that once in our lives.

572
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,763
Don't get angry.

573
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,014
You brat.

574
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,642
Hey, Sang-eun.

575
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,395
I'll tell you
one last time, so listen carefully.

576
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,105
Back then...

577
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,651
I didn't know he'd grow up
to be such a loser.

578
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,195
Sit down.

579
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,405
Do you know what my wish is?

580
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,158
It's to get on a time machine
and go back to when I liked him

581
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,410
and pull all my hair out.

582
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,036
Hey, we understand. Calm down.

583
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,913
I'll pull out all his hair for you.

584
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,792
Why? Isn't it so courageous
to express how you feel?

585
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,002
-You...
-Hey, don't.

586
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,004
By the way, what about you?

587
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,756
Aren't you going to go meet
that Jang-ho guy?

588
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,383
He said he was coming
to the staff training.

589
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,011
Shouldn't you keep participating
in events like that?

590
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,849
Why? Is it because of that elephant
in the field girl or something?

591
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,350
I said she's a deer in the forest.

592
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,977
What on earth is an elephant in the field?

593
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,146
Still, what a bummer.

594
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,733
You said Jang-ho lives abroad.

595
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,985
You don't even know
when he will come back.

596
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,405
No. I won't be swayed anymore.

597
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,949
I have to live my life.
Whether it's for work, or for men.

598
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,244
-Still, I think you should--
-Forget it!

599
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,663
Although you may feel that way,
but I don't care at all.

600
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,040
So stop it. I'm not going.

601
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,251
I won't live a weak-willed life anymore.

602
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,296
I'll say goodbye to him for good.

603
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,852
I'm just going to see him once
and go back.

604
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,312
I'm really going to leave.

605
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,282
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

606
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,579
Hello. What brings you here
so early in the morning?

607
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,539
This is some radish water kimchi.

608
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,292
Radish water kimchi is the best
for curing gas poisoning.

609
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,836
This has been fermented
for more than three years.

610
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,840
Once he takes a whiff of this,
he'll be totally cured.

611
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,636
-It's not gas poisoning...
-I heard it was coal.

612
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,390
-That's not it. He grilled meat--
-Mr. Kim.

613
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,102
In the old days, they said
the eldest son comes from the sky.

614
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,105
That means he's a very precious person.

615
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,565
I'm not saying this because

616
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,236
I lost my eldest son
during the January–Fourth Retreat.

617
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,529
I see.

618
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,489
You should listen to us, Mr. Kim.

619
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,952
Okay.

620
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,961
Where... Where is Hye-ja?

621
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,463
She went out early to some school retreat.

622
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,216
Dad.

623
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,593
Can you please take me outside?

624
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,679
What?

625
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,194
The lady who lives in the house
with that blue door

626
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,113
brought this for you.

627
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,910
Eat it all.

628
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,329
Do not leave a single drop.

629
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:03,958
Okay.

630
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,427
Gosh.

631
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,388
Eating radish water kimchi
makes me crave ribs.

632
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,817
Honey, I'll be outside.

633
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,613
Don't come home early.

634
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,198
Dad...

635
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,162
Dad, Dad.

636
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,664
No. It's too much. Mom, please...

637
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,841
Look at them having such a great time.

638
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,639
Thank goodness I have you.

639
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,476
I was so worried,
thinking that I'd be the only oldie.

640
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,228
I know, right?

641
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,396
Thank goodness I have you with me.

642
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,523
Right?

643
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,067
What about your kids though?

644
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,902
Why do you think I came here?

645
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,988
I know the younger ones
are uncomfortable around me,

646
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,075
but this is the only
legitimate excuse I have

647
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,035
to enjoy some alone time.

648
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,455
I respect for you.
Raising kids must be so hard.

649
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,832
It sure is.

650
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,418
The real oldie is here.

651
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,422
-Hello.
-Hello.

652
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,049
I heard you work
as a war correspondent now.

653
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,801
Did you work in construction
in the Middle East?

654
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,969
You're so tanned.

655
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,096
Hey, I was even more tanned.

656
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,557
I'm sorry I couldn't go to your wedding.

657
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,142
I was covering one of the civil wars.

658
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,477
Have you been well?

659
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,104
Yes.

660
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,689
Isn't that Lee Jun-ha
of Hanguk University?

661
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,149
What's he doing here?

662
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,525
Hey, come here.

663
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,945
-This is Lee Jun-ha.
-Yes, I know him.

664
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,197
He's already famous
in the broadcasting industry.

665
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,201
I heard every broadcasting company
wants to hire him as an anchor.

666
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,830
Right, but he wants to be a reporter.
Like me.

667
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,207
I know I wasn't invited. I'm sorry.

668
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,960
Don't be. Handsome guys
are always welcome.

669
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,671
I'm Jang-ho's huge fan.

670
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,174
I pestered him to make time
to meet me when he returns.

671
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,926
I invited him.

672
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,346
Everyone here will work in the industry,
so it'll be good to know each other.

673
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,390
This is my friend, Kang Ji-yeon.

674
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,394
And this is my junior,

675
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,645
Kim Hye-ja.

676
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,272
She wants to be a news anchor too.

677
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:33,941
Hello.

678
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,277
Yes, hello.

679
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,240
Well, can I call you by your first name?

680
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,201
Or shall I address you politely?

681
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,456
I'm TBC news anchor, Jang Seo-yeon.

682
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,918
Hello.

683
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,131
Elephant in the field.

684
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,815
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

685
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,909
Congratulations on your wedding.

686
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,246
Right, thanks.

687
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,207
My wife unexpectedly got a job offer
from the UN,

688
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,876
so we rushed and had a small
ceremony with just our families.

689
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,796
-What about you?
-Sorry?

690
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,258
I'm single.

691
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,344
-You suggested it.
-I know.

692
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,889
Drink up.

693
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,725
Jang-ho, I'll get going.

694
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,769
Why? We haven't had a chance to catch up.

695
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,062
Stay for just one more drink.

696
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,982
Just one more drink, okay?

697
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,358
-Have a seat.
-Sit here.

698
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,117
Then will you go straight to Angola?

699
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,952
Yes, I have to.

700
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,954
Is that where you and your wife live?

701
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,295
We live in South Africa now,

702
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,713
so it's not that far.

703
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,840
I have to go to Angola to cover a story.

704
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,051
As you probably know, the civil war
is still going on there.

705
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,015
Right, the civil war is still going on.

706
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,059
Yes, I saw it on the news.

707
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,271
I saw all the tanks and guns.

708
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,118
Since you're saying you have to
get going, I should let you go.

709
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,911
Let me know when you pass the test.

710
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,371
-I'll be off, then.
-Okay.

711
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,956
-Go back inside.
-All right.

712
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,173
I guess you're leaving.

713
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,550
Yes, I have to take care of something.

714
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,968
I see.

715
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,180
Goodbye, then.

716
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,224
Wait.

717
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,118
Do you really want to be a news anchor?

718
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,454
Sorry?

719
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,998
Why do you want to be a news anchor?

720
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,921
To inform the public of the truth and...

721
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,672
Reporters can do that too.

722
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,635
But reporters are...

723
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,928
What? Reporters

724
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,513
aren't cool?

725
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,766
So you want to be a news anchor

726
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:54,850
because it looks cool?

727
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,685
I feel

728
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:00,231
as if I'm at an interview
for a news anchor position.

729
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,904
Then have you ever been out on the field?

730
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,865
-What?
-Have you ever been on the field?

731
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,119
I'm not talking about what you can
learn from the answer sheets.

732
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,956
Have you been out on the field
to write the story you'll read?

733
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,292
Have you ever experienced
how intense things can get?

734
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,629
Why are you asking me these questions?

735
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,217
I want to know what kind of effort
you're making to be a news anchor.

736
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,345
Well, I don't think,

737
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,014
I'm obligated

738
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,144
to answer these questions you're asking.

739
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,105
Of course, you don't have to
answer my questions.

740
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:45,693
But you should be able to answer
these questions for yourself.

741
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,198
I'm talking about the qualifications
you need to pass the exam.

742
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,326
Jang-ho said you're his junior,

743
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,538
whom he's especially fond of.

744
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,965
Stop crying already.

745
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,019
Oh, boy.

746
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,521
BEAUTY SALON

747
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,649
My gosh.

748
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,194
Why are you here so early?

749
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,279
I haven't even had breakfast yet.

750
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,239
You can do my hair
after you eat your breakfast.

751
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,825
Okay, I'll quickly have
some rice with soup.

752
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,118
-Wait here, okay?
-All right.

753
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,955
Did you skip breakfast again?

754
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,958
Gosh, don't worry. My stomach has shrunk,

755
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,711
so I never get hungry
even if I don't eat anything.

756
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,131
Do you want to join me?

757
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,717
There are no side dishes as I didn't
go grocery shopping yesterday.

758
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,887
Water and kimchi are all I need.

759
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,390
Even though my mother-in-law
hated me so much,

760
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,185
she said she liked the fact
that I'm not a picky eater.

761
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,269
I'm serious.

762
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,562
Let's go in.

763
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,315
-Hey, you're back.
-You're getting in just now?

764
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,734
Did you stay up all night? My gosh.

765
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,945
Will she get married soon or what?

766
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,864
You can watch TV.

767
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,661
Can I come in?

768
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,829
I'm going to sleep.

769
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,045
Has everyone who came to the reunion

770
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,631
already established a successful career?

771
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,551
You didn't know that before the reunion?

772
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,846
This world is full of people who are
a lot more competent than you.

773
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,723
Will you cry every single time
you encounter them?

774
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,142
Starving yourself and lying in bed
won't solve anything.

775
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,186
It won't solve any of your problems.

776
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,731
What happened?

777
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,444
Do you know the difference between
being competent and living a good life?

778
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,531
Even if you're incompetent,
just get in there

779
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,324
and tell the world, "I'm here.

780
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,952
I want to give hope to the likes of me."

781
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,745
That is how you live a truly good life.

782
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,583
As for competence,
you must be born with it,

783
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,043
but you can live a good life
if you work at it.

784
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,601
Come out in a bit. Let's have breakfast.

785
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,835
What can I do for you today?

786
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,086
She wants her hair dyed.

787
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,759
Just the roots?

788
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,062
Hi.

789
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,190
We have a demonstration today.
Are you sending someone?

790
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,610
Well... We have a lot of customers
on the weekends.

791
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,445
You can't say that.

792
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,656
We're demonstrating for our livelihood.

793
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,783
I closed my shop too.

794
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,452
My goodness. Your shop is closed

795
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,579
every weekend anyway.

796
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,957
Mom, I've mixed the dye.

797
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,793
Let me go and demonstrate.

798
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,546
Fine. I'll be there
when I'm done with this customer.

799
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,007
We'd prefer Hye-ja, though.

800
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,093
We have enough old people
with shrieking voices.

801
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,887
A young lady with a pretty voice
would be much better.

802
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,555
Still, I can't let her.

803
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,350
Don't worry. I want some fresh air.

804
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,312
Well... Let's go.

805
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,068
We say no to senior care facilities!

806
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,112
We oppose building a nursing home!

807
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,322
-We oppose!
-We oppose!

808
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,492
No construction without
Jagok-dong residents' consent!

809
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,160
Stop immediately!

810
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,371
-Stop!
-Stop!

811
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,874
Ma'am, you can lean on me.

812
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,376
-Hold on to my arm.
-Thanks.

813
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,795
Hye-ja, what are you doing? Continue.

814
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,963
Okay.

815
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,966
Who is the nursing home for?

816
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,094
Government compensate for
decreasing house prices!

817
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,388
-Compensate!
-Compensate!

818
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,014
Wait. What's going on?

819
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,766
What is he doing here?

820
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,853
Is he here for a news story? For practice?

821
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,358
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but can you move over a bit?

822
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,776
Stay here. I'll be right back.

823
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,069
Sorry.

824
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,324
Hello.

825
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,372
What?

826
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,209
If you're here for a news story,
you can go ahead.

827
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,465
What? This doesn't count

828
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,634
as a field you talked about?

829
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,846
Then again,
for a promising reporter like you,

830
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,558
a field must be where the history changes.

831
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,812
But you know what? For these people,

832
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,065
this is as important as the things
that change the history.

833
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,401
These old ladies?

834
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,905
Yes, the facilities might be
meant for them,

835
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:26,366
but falling house prices hurt them
more than bad health.

836
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,036
That's why they demonstrate
in the cold despite the criticism.

837
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,914
With the house prices falling,

838
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,752
they'll have no money left
for their funeral.

839
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,379
Fine.

840
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,715
What you said the other day...

841
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,301
There was nothing wrong about it.

842
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,720
It was all true.

843
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,139
Because it was true,

844
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,267
it hurt me more.

845
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:58,065
You reminded me of something
I'd been feeling all along.

846
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,110
You made me resent myself.

847
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,615
Is that what you wanted?

848
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,785
Hey, did you eat?

849
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,079
Ma'am, you must be surprised.

850
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,122
We'll eat a bit later.

851
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,041
See? You scared her.

852
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,376
Please leave now.

853
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,379
Jun-ha, did you eat?

854
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,339
She's asking if you ate.

855
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,715
I ate, Grandma.

856
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,133
He ate, ma'am.

857
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,763
He is my grandson.

858
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,224
-Lee Jun-ha.
-What?

859
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,067
Let's go.

860
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:55,414
Government compensate for
decreasing house prices!

861
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,042
-Compensate!
-Hye-ja, what are you doing?

862
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,627
WE OPPOSE BUILDING A NURSING HOME

863
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,795
Okay.

864
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,343
We say no to senior care facilities!

865
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,013
We oppose building a nursing home!

866
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,348
-We oppose!
-We oppose!

867
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,602
Goodness. Having a young lady with us

868
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,563
cheered everyone up.
Please come next week too.

869
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,814
Sure, I will.

870
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,691
I didn't know we were neighbors.

871
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,277
See you around.

872
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,949
Bye, ma'am.

873
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,209
Well... That lady.

874
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,961
Has she always lived around here?

875
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,005
Oh, her?

876
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,132
I think they moved here
a couple of months ago.

877
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,675
She lives alone with her grandson.

878
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,017
I would have stood up and left,
but that would humiliate you.

879
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,187
So I decided to stay. What kind
of pervert would think that?

880
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,074
I knew it. I did think he sounded

881
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:15,327
familiarly logical and pretentious.

882
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,330
How did we run into each other
right there?

883
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,667
You have to pay first.

884
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,836
You startled me.

885
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,923
Why are you here?

886
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,009
Where is Sang-eun?

887
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,763
She was supposed to work this
afternoon, but she couldn't make it.

888
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,640
Her agency landed her
a performance or something.

889
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,600
You work here?

890
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,895
I know the manager here,
so I sometimes fill in at night.

891
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,111
I'll pay.

892
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,864
I apologize for lecturing you
about being on the field.

893
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,534
Earlier when you were talking to me,

894
00:49:56,743 --> 00:50:00,163
I thought you sounded logical and neutral.

895
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,833
And just the right amount
of emotional appeal at the climax.

896
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,627
It would have made a stunning news story.

897
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,715
You're still judging, though.

898
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,341
The thing is,

899
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,886
I'm a bit angry

900
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,972
at the TBC news anchor.

901
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,223
You mean Jang Seo-yeon?

902
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,102
She's always been like that.

903
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,895
She was always pretentious...

904
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,316
So how much is it?

905
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,612
It's on me. As an apology.

906
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,951
That's not really necessary.

907
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,079
I'll take this too.

908
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,084
This...

909
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,378
Sorry.

910
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,046
Oh, you're here.

911
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,889
-That's so romantic.
-Lower your voice.

912
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:03,268
He must have lectured you
because he was interested in you.

913
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,145
That's so romantic. My gosh.

914
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,231
You're going too far.
We only met recently.

915
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,817
It doesn't always take a long time
to fall for someone.

916
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,903
It's not like that.

917
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,581
I've filled the shelves in the back.
I'll get going now.

918
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:26,750
Have a nice day.

919
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,461
Had a nice day.

920
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,175
"Had a nice day"?

921
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,679
Did I just say that?

922
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,229
Hello.

923
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,396
Hi.

924
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,274
Why are you outside? It's cold.

925
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,236
The sikhye is ready. You like it, right?

926
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,781
-I'll get going.
-Okay. Bye.

927
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,909
The girl earlier...

928
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,830
I mean the girl with big eyes
like those of a cow's.

929
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,289
Oh, what about her?

930
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,709
She is the daughter of the hair salon
down the street.

931
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,045
Apparently, she is getting married soon.

932
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,673
I see.

933
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,385
I was hoping you'd go out with her.

934
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,679
What a disappointment.

935
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,223
Why would you say that? Let's go in.

936
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,976
-Go in. Hurry up.
-All right.

937
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,770
There's no telling what will happen
between a guy and a girl.

938
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,480
Sang-eun is right in that.

939
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,859
Also, if he really had no feelings
towards me,

940
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,569
he didn't have to see me again.

941
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,905
But he apologized
and even bought me coffee.

942
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:43,285
That means he wants to
get on better terms with me.

943
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,287
Don't you think so?

944
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,455
There's something going on, right?

945
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,836
Hey. Don't you think
there's something going on?

946
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,588
BEAUTY SALON

947
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,840
Yes. I think I know the place.

948
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,800
Okay. Thank you.

949
00:52:59,009 --> 00:52:59,885
I'll see you there.

950
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,637
I don't know. It stopped
working properly long ago.

951
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,055
And now it's completely out of order.

952
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,183
-The whole thing needs replacing.
-What?

953
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,520
The bottom part is broken.
It can't hold up the thing anymore.

954
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,480
That would cost too much.

955
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,234
Everyone in the family just spends
money. No one makes any.

956
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,112
How much would it cost?

957
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,282
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

958
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,827
Oh, my. Hye-ja, you look so pretty.

959
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,162
Are you going on a date?

960
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,789
It'll be cold in the evening.
Put on more clothes.

961
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,125
Women should keep their lower body warm.

962
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,628
Kids these days just won't listen.

963
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,672
They'll understand
when they grow old and sick.

964
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,007
Okay, ma'am.

965
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,759
Goodbye.

966
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,605
Up there.

967
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:57,192
Is there a broadcasting station
at a place like this too?

968
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,485
Broadcasting station?

969
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,624
By dubbing work, did you mean...

970
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,209
Yes. An erotic movie.

971
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,710
Don't be too shocked.

972
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,128
All voice actors do this.

973
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,922
Just think of it as a part-time job.

974
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,885
I heard you wanted to apply
for a news anchor.

975
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,553
But you didn't submit an application
anywhere.

976
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,347
How will you make money then?

977
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,890
I've experienced

978
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,685
exactly what you're going through
right now too.

979
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,770
Yes, you have a nice voice.

980
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,272
But it's not nice enough to be
a news anchor.

981
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,149
You know that too, right?

982
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,194
I know you won't give up,
but that's the truth.

983
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,531
I know. I understand you can be shocked.

984
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,993
But still, instead of recording
strange announcements,

985
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,828
this is way more profitable.

986
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,086
Let's begin.

987
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,755
Get ready, start.

988
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,098
Hold on.

989
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,144
Miss. You have to start as soon as
the scene starts.

990
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,147
Okay. I'm sorry.

991
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,773
I'm sorry.

992
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,026
Let's try it again.

993
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,079
Is that all you've got?

994
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,543
I feel so awkward doing this.

995
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,045
-Hey, Ms. Kim?
-Honey.

996
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,964
Excuse me?

997
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:44,799
Excuse me?

998
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,635
-Yes?
-Ms. Kim.

999
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,304
You're doing a good job,

1000
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,225
but can't you do it more naturally?
Naturally.

1001
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,645
Naturally?

1002
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,732
I'm sorry. It could be tough for her
since she doesn't have

1003
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,317
-much experience.
-What do you mean?

1004
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,653
I used to be so trashy!

1005
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,322
I have a bunch of experience.

1006
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,424
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON

1007
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,302
Gosh.

1008
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,263
I guess you weren't that busy today.

1009
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,182
Mondays are always like this.

1010
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,309
Hye-ja's not here.

1011
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,438
Well, she even likes cold red bean buns.

1012
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,315
I can never fool you.

1013
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,027
Hye-ja didn't come home yet?

1014
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,696
She said that her senior is going to
introduce her to some job.

1015
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,698
She went out excited.
I don't know when she'll come.

1016
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,408
I hope it goes well.

1017
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,202
Then it will be a perfect
birthday gift for you.

1018
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:56,913
Come on, let's not jump to conclusions.

1019
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,586
-Dad.
-You're here.

1020
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,296
Where's Mom?

1021
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,507
How did your work go?

1022
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,050
It went well, of course.

1023
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,927
Ta-da!

1024
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,095
What is this?

1025
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,222
Oh, my. Is this money?

1026
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,807
Did you work today?

1027
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,309
I told you. Ji-yeon introduced
me to a job.

1028
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,728
You should use this for yourself.

1029
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,689
That shampoo sink is broken.

1030
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,065
It isn't much,

1031
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,651
but I'd feel better if I can pitch in.

1032
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,114
I never imagined receiving money
from my child.

1033
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,951
-Are you happy?
-Of course I am.

1034
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,996
Oh, gosh. You did a great job, Hye-ja.

1035
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,209
Okay, Dad.

1036
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,086
Next time I make money,
it will be all yours.

1037
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,296
Okay?

1038
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,047
Eat this.

1039
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,299
What is it?

1040
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,176
Red bean buns!

1041
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,518
I'm the one who always brings her stuff,

1042
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,104
but you always take the credit.

1043
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,773
She promised she'd make money
and buy me a new taxi.

1044
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,861
Whether she keeps her promise
or not, I'm so proud of her.

1045
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,947
She is our daughter so she knows
how hard we work.

1046
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,993
I can't use this money.

1047
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,871
It's like our daughter's first paycheck.

1048
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:22,957
I can't use this.

1049
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,882
Okay. I'll have some udon

1050
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,802
and a half bottle of soju,
and forget everything.

1051
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:17,971
Then I'll go to sleep.

1052
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,640
MIDNIGHT SNACK BAR

1053
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,144
Sir, I'll have a soju and a udon.

1054
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,942
I didn't mean to...

1055
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,073
Sir, I won't need the soju.

1056
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,123
That was...

1057
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,846
not what I wanted...

1058
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,319
Sir. Give me another bottle of soju.

1059
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,320
Yes.

1060
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,487
One more bottle.

1061
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,955
The guy who wants to be a reporter?

1062
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,041
What brings you to our neighborhood?

1063
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,295
We already knew we live
in the same neighborhood.

1064
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,799
Oh, that's right. How stupid of me.

1065
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,301
You're a resident in this area.

1066
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,303
I see.

1067
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:46,476
Although you're not rich, I thought
you were from a nice family.

1068
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,853
But you're filthy broke like me.

1069
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,522
But it's strange.

1070
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,941
Broke people usually recognize each other.

1071
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,653
It's because I'm even more broke than you.

1072
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,196
There's a class between broke people.

1073
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,114
Come on, don't be silly.

1074
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,909
You may think our beauty salon
belongs to my family,

1075
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,161
but it belongs to the bank.
We owe them a debt.

1076
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,246
And it's not a small amount.

1077
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,290
It's serious. It's "debt" in English.

1078
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:10,833
The "B" is a silent syllable.

1079
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,127
Is this a battle to see
who is more pitiful?

1080
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,129
I'm confident I can beat anyone.

1081
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,258
My mom's middle finger
on her right hand is bent

1082
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,968
because she's held the scissors
for so long.

1083
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,055
My grandma doesn't have
any fingerprints left

1084
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,807
because she has worked so much.

1085
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:33,022
I'm talking about my mom.
Why bring your grandma into this?

1086
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,692
What should I do then?
I don't have a mom or a dad.

1087
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,902
My mom ran away when I was young,
and my dad

1088
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,406
is someone I wish who doesn't
exist in this world.

1089
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,081
Sir, give us another bottle of soju.

1090
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,126
I lost.

1091
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,338
-Here.
-Thank you.

1092
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:00,883
Wait!

1093
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,218
Give it to me.

1094
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,146
Here.

1095
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,943
So after I grew up,

1096
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,197
I've never been able to relax.

1097
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,952
I did everything to earn money.

1098
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,913
Even though I should be preparing
for the exam now,

1099
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,542
I still take on construction jobs
and even work in other cities.

1100
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,180
My story is too depressing
and boring, right?

1101
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:55,813
But I must say, it sounds like
you've been doing your very best.

1102
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:00,943
I have no confidence,

1103
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,739
and I don't even know what to do.

1104
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,533
To tell you the truth,

1105
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,536
except for a few times at the beginning,

1106
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,206
I've never even sent my resume
to broadcasting stations.

1107
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,337
Failing a few interviews

1108
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,757
gave me a reality check.

1109
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,968
Even during the interviews,
the interviewers

1110
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:29,180
did ask me some questions,
but I could tell

1111
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,601
whether or not they were asking them
just to be polite.

1112
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,104
For strong candidates,
all interviewers, right off the bat,

1113
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:39,857
smile at them.

1114
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,402
What they say doesn't even matter.

1115
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:48,157
But even I don't think I qualify

1116
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,244
as a strong candidate.

1117
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,457
I'm a little lame.

1118
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,713
But at the same time, it's so hard.

1119
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,424
to come to terms with it
and just accept it.

1120
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,637
Why? It's because...

1121
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,724
I care about myself a great deal.

1122
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,813
I really want myself to do well,

1123
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,860
but this girl is a little... She's lame.

1124
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:35,162
Now, I certainly know
that I'm not cut out for it,

1125
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,791
but I don't have the courage
to give it all up.

1126
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,336
If I give this up,
I'll need a different goal.

1127
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,089
But I'm so scared that I might
never achieve that goal.

1128
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,887
Gosh, had I known I'd end up like this,

1129
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,140
I would've never decided
to become a news anchor

1130
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,894
and just worked hard
like you've been doing.

1131
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:03,566
Then I would've at least
earned some money.

1132
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,779
Then my parents
wouldn't have had to work so hard.

1133
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,366
Do you regret your decision?

1134
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:17,246
Yes. I really regret

1135
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,042
deciding to become a news anchor.

1136
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,337
If I never set that goal for myself,

1137
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,006
I think I'd be much happier now.

1138
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,760
I want to go back to that point in time.

1139
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:33,721
I want to go back in time
and tell myself to give up on that dream.

1140
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,348
I really want to do that.

1141
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,727
I, too, would love to go back in time.

1142
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:44,899
What if you could?

1143
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,736
If you could actually turn back time,

1144
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:51,781
what would you do?

1145
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,744
I won't go to my grandma.

1146
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,208
I'd rather live at an orphanage.

1147
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,378
I won't live with my grandma.

1148
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,924
I'd never let her take me in
and suffer that misery again.

1149
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,902
Gosh.

1150
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,447
That's heart-wrenching.

1151
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:40,663
-Yes, don't let her suffer again.
-Here.

1152
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,751
Let's go home.

1153
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:47,795
All right.

1154
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,256
This isn't an easy decision for me,

1155
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,591
but I'll grant you an opportunity
to change things.

1156
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,260
What opportunity?

1157
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:58,597
How did you know I brought this today?

1158
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:02,893
The opportunity to turn back time.

1159
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,068
My gosh.

1160
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:14,947
It'd be so nice if it were true.

1161
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,490
It is true.

1162
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,868
It's possible.

1163
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:21,162
I mean, I can't make it happen,

1164
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,248
-but this watch can.
-Sure.

1165
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,459
-Do you really want to do it?
-Yes, I really do.

1166
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,252
Do you really want it?

1167
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,047
-Show me. Go ahead.
-You're serious, right?

1168
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,674
Don't regret later.

1169
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,135
Once it's done, there's no going back.

1170
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,511
Okay, show me.

1171
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:00,993
SPECIAL THANKS TO HYUN-WOO, KIM KI-RI

1172
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:14,965
Thank you

1173
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,134
for your offer to turn back time for me.

1174
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,303
Let's try to be more generous,
talk casually to each other.

1175
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,972
Considering what we went through,
we should be talking casually.

1176
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,350
That's how love begins.

1177
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,311
He was hit by a truck as he was
making a left at an intersection.

1178
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,855
Please...

1179
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,986
Ma'am, what is your name?

1180
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,154
I'm Kim Hye-ja.

1181
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:40,908
Mom and Dad, you still can't tell
that I'm your daughter?

1182
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,993
This is the only way.

1183
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,371
Dad, mom. I'm sorry.

1184
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,124
