00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,560
Hye-ja, get over here.

6
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,062
We're late. Let's go in.

7
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,563
I'm going already.

8
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,482
Just wait.

9
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,238
You wait for me too.

10
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,957
-Hurt himself?
-He hurt himself?

11
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,375
No.

12
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,128
He was about to, but I stopped him.

13
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,089
He must have untold issues.

14
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,300
It's so romantic.

15
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:33,927
Really?

16
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,262
I think there's a special connection
between you and him.

17
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,348
You suddenly met by chance
during a protest.

18
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,432
It's like a movie.

19
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,435
Right? I also think we
were destined to meet.

20
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,437
Where are we going, by the way?

21
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,356
I'm going to meet my destiny.

22
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,191
-What about us?
-We should part ways here.

23
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,317
It's my first date today.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,860
-See you.
-Hey!

25
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,986
Hye-ja!

00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,265
Officer, how much longer
does she have to stand here?

30
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,976
Why did she jaywalk to begin with?

31
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,396
I totally ruined our first date.

32
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,439
It's okay. This makes our date
more memorable.

33
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,902
Hey, you. Don't stand there.
Wait over there.

34
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,324
-Bye.
-What?

OBEY PEDESTRIAN SAFETY RULES

36
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,040
How could you jaywalk right in front
of a police officer? Get in there.

37
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,547
Why did you do that?

38
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,716
Because this is our first date.

39
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,475
What?

40
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,269
What's the matter?

41
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,688
Did we do something wrong?

42
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,232
No, don't mind me.

43
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,538
-There's not a single soul here.
-I know, right?

44
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,084
We can do whatever we want here.
No one will ever find out.

45
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,120
You had something on your cheek.

46
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,622
Let's go.

47
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,214
What was that about? Might as well
rub my dimple until it's gone.

48
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,345
Come here.

49
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,607
I can't hate him.

50
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,029
I have no choice but to follow that smile.

51
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,059
DOCTOR KIM SANG-HYEON

52
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,993
Hey, so what happened?
You didn't get to kiss him, again?

53
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,996
He held my hand on our first date,

54
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,831
so I was worried
that we were moving too fast,

55
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,666
but he's done nothing else for months now.

56
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,919
Any healthy man would want to hold
his lady after holding her hand.

57
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,463
After that, he'd want to kiss her, right?

58
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,882
There's just no progress with him.

59
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,217
-I like how pure hearted he is.
-Whatever.

60
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,219
I don't like guys who are
all about the physical stuff.

61
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,764
-Until when must I wait though?
-Hey, just be patient.

62
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,390
I'm sure things will progress eventually.

63
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,559
I'm just anxious.

64
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,103
He's such a good catch, you know.

65
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,440
Seo-yeon, that girl, has been
outright hitting on him

66
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,108
since she became a news anchor.

67
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,610
I also heard that there are

68
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,654
so many ladies who want to set up
their daughters with Jun-ha.

69
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,156
How can I not be anxious?

70
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,241
Then just ask him to marry you.

71
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,912
Hey, women got married before even
meeting their husbands in the 60s,

72
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,121
but what era are we in now?

73
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,916
The liberal era has begun. This is 1970.

74
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,960
I should at least kiss the guy
before I marry him, don't you think?

75
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,423
I'm sorry, but it doesn't sound like
it'll happen this year.

76
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,969
Lee Jun-ha, I'll make you kiss me.

77
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,638
Brace yourself.

78
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,607
I'm sorry. I'm quite late, aren't I?

79
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,192
What shall we do today?

80
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,735
Let's go for some good food.

81
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,320
Sure, what do you want to eat?

82
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,073
I have a craving for something.

83
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,285
Webfoot octopus.

84
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,455
Webfoot octopus? Out of the blue?

85
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,919
Webfoot octopus.

86
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,923
Where can we go to eat webfoot octopus?

87
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,885
Chungmu.

88
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,555
Chungmu?

89
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,558
Chungmu in South Gyeongsang,
which takes ten hours from here?

90
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,603
Chungmu.

91
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,607
-Are you feeling sick?
-No.

92
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,319
I'm feeling totally fine.

93
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,989
To go to Chungmu, even if we leave now...

94
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,450
Forget it.

95
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,286
Let's just go for some tteokbokki.

96
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,788
My lips are twitching.

97
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,000
Hey, you said
you're craving webfoot octopus.

98
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,424
I heard the film, East of Eden,
will be in theaters next week.

99
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,886
Seriously?
I've really wanted to see that film.

100
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,053
Let's watch it next week.

101
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,518
You'll catch a cold.

102
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,359
It's now.

103
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,373
Let's go.

104
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,505
What is wrong with him?

105
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,066
It's now.

106
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,508
Follow me.

107
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,178
-Let's go into the woods.
-Why?

108
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,180
I want to enjoy the clean air
to the fullest.

109
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,141
-It's a little dark.
-Which means the air will be clean.

110
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,185
I need to take you
to a secluded spot to try...

111
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,659
What kind of crazy jerk pooped here?

112
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,161
I shall sew your bottom hole shut.

113
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,955
You piece of...

114
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,386
Hey, do you girls need
an extra set of lips by any chance?

115
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,350
I can't even get a kiss.
You girls can take my lips.

116
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,394
Hey, do you want a bowl of this?

117
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,396
Dongchimi cools you down
like nothing else does.

118
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,524
Girls, get up. Let's go.

119
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,276
-Where?
-Behind the mill

120
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,236
up the street,
there's a famous fortune-teller.

121
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,321
Why do you want to go there?

122
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,282
As a mere human, I can't figure out
how to resolve this problem.

123
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,119
I shall go there and get
the best date for kissing him.

124
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,581
-The best date for kissing him?
-That's right.

125
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,458
I'll even get a talisman. Girls, get up.

126
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,084
Come on!

127
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,635
Hello.

128
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,638
We can sit here, right?

129
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,518
What brings you here?

130
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,021
Oh, well...

131
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,068
I have a boyfriend,

132
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,614
but he hasn't kissed me yet.

133
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,785
When do you think he'll kiss me?

134
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,632
Tomorrow.

135
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,217
Tomorrow?

136
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,928
It's the perfect day to kiss.

137
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,471
-My gosh!
-Hey!

138
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,972
Are you sure?

139
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,142
Oh, my. Hey, what should I do?

140
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,435
I'm already so nervous.

141
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,313
What should I wear tomorrow?

142
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,108
Thank you.

143
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,568
Oh, dear.

144
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,988
What's wrong?

145
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,616
Gosh, it's nothing.

146
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,953
It's not like you won't do it
if I try to stop you.

147
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,288
It's just your fate.

148
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,334
-Do you want a reading too?
-No.

149
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,503
You're the one who needs fortune-telling.

150
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,587
Why?

151
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,214
Are you

152
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,509
interested in becoming a nun or a monk?

153
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,471
-Not really.
-You have a monk's head.

154
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,140
I'm not interested.

155
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,686
That's the only way to get rid of it.

156
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,104
Get rid of what?

157
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,189
You'll bitterly regret

158
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,151
three times in your life.

159
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,488
Fine. Just raise it.

160
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,116
-Raise what?
-Just raise it.

161
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,869
Are you a singer or an actress?

162
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,953
Oh, my.

163
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,371
How did you know...

164
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,248
You definitely look like an entertainer.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,545
I'm training to become a singer.

166
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,049
Then you should have been famous by now.

167
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,219
What could be getting in your way?

168
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,474
It's completely blocked up.

169
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,641
"Blocked up"?

170
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,187
I am actually constipated.

171
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,521
What's your name?

172
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,648
It's Yoon Sang-eun.

173
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,985
"Yoon Sang-eun."

174
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,905
YSE

175
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,201
Your name is to blame.

176
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,370
Your name is the problem. This is no name

177
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,539
for an entertainer.

178
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,501
As soon as you change your name,
you'll become a star.

179
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,668
-Do it.
-What...

180
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,004
What should be my name then?

181
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,299
Let me see.

182
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,511
YB

183
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,014
YBH

184
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,683
"Bok" for luck,

185
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,394
and "Hee" for joy.

186
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,022
"Bok-hee".

187
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,106
(YOON BOK-HEE)

188
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,733
"Bok-hee"?

189
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,987
"Yoon Bok-hee"?

190
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,125
Are you walking me home?

191
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,502
Yes.

192
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,339
Is that it?

193
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,674
What?

194
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:04,969
I have time.

195
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,554
It's curfew soon.

196
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,972
Your parents will be worried.

197
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,683
I'll be kissed today, my foot!

198
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,270
Let's go home before we get in trouble.

199
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,521
"Trouble"?

200
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,606
You're the trouble.

201
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,568
Fine. Let's go home.

202
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,248
Over here. Get them!

203
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,958
Stop there!

204
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,233
Look how boring your lips are.

205
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,153
Your lips have no feelings.

206
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,489
They completely lack narrative.

207
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,282
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

208
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,284
"Narrative," my foot.

209
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,412
What did you exactly do? Lip-wrestle?

210
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,082
What do you guys know about kissing?

211
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,334
Shame on you.

212
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,587
Look at you, Hye-ja.

213
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,423
Now that your dream came true,
you have nothing to worry anymore.

214
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,549
That's right.

215
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,054
After the kiss comes, next will be
the proposal and the wedding.

216
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,683
Are you sure you can get away with this?

217
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,643
What do you mean? Oh, this?

218
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,982
I'll just tell them I fell.

219
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,318
How on earth could you
land on your lips, though?

220
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,696
Right. And my lips will stay swollen
for some time.

221
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,282
I can't believe Jun-ha.

222
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,119
He is so enthusiastic
in everything he does.

223
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,455
He is way too overzealous.

224
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,042
He's overzealous, and you're crazy, right?

225
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,129
Can I crash at your place for a few days?

226
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,048
Anyway, if we kiss any more than this,

227
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,678
I'll end up looking like a pelican, right?
Goodness.

228
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,263
Now that I think of it,

229
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,557
that fortune-teller was pretty accurate.

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,684
Why? Did she get anything else right?

231
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,689
Ta-da. My debut album.

232
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,442
-Sang-eun!
-Sang-eun!

233
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,152
I'm not Sang-eun anymore.

234
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,237
Look at this. I'm Yoon Bok-hee.

235
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,447
-That's right!
-She's Bok-hee.

236
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,115
-She's Bok-hee.
-Yoon Bok-hee.

237
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,491
-This is amazing!
-Thanks, guys.

238
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,035
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

239
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,963
Mother, your friends are here.

240
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,381
What?

241
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,928
-Hye-ja.
-Hyeon-ju.

242
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,180
Hyeon-ju.

243
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,390
Oh, my.

244
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,102
Sang-eun.

245
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,688
-I'm Bok-hee.
-That's right.

246
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,440
-Bok-hee.
-I'm Bok-hee.

247
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,115
-Have a seat.
-Are you okay?

248
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,450
-I'm okay.
-Good.

249
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,036
You guys must be busy.
How did you make the time to come?

250
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,537
No matter how busy we are,

251
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,248
we still want to see you, Hye-ja.

252
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,502
Hey. I wasn't sure what you wanted to eat,

253
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,963
so I brought your favorite
stir-fried seafood and some other stuff.

254
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,964
Can you eat it?

255
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,509
The food here is pretty good too.

256
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,469
You didn't have to. By the way,

257
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,388
you're still so pretty, Bok-hee.

258
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,349
You're still gorgeous.

259
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,519
You're the prettiest one among us.

260
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,154
Are you Yoon Bok-hee, by any chance?

261
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,490
-I am.
-Oh, my.

262
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,868
Didn't I tell you she is my friend?

263
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,162
I never believed you.

264
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,164
But now I see it's true.

265
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,334
Can I get your autograph?

266
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,295
-Of course.
-My youngest daughter loves you.

267
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,298
Give her your autograph.
We take classes together.

268
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,508
Okay.

269
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,260
-Give me a second.
-Okay.

270
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,179
I'll go get a pen and a piece of paper.

271
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,973
It's okay. I have them.

272
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,641
-You do?
-Yes.

273
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,476
You had them there?

274
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,771
Here. Here's a pen.

275
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,273
Here.

276
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,234
-Cha Eun-suk.
-"Eun-suk"?

277
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,777
That's my daughter's name.

278
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,987
Okay.

279
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,655
CHA EUN-SUK
YOON BOK-HEE

280
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,781
Here you go.

281
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,992
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

282
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,577
I got one too.

283
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,288
Here you go.

284
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,290
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

285
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,293
HYOJA NURSING HOSPITAL

286
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,502
Ppoppi, look at this.

287
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,087
Thank you.

288
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,007
Ppoppi, we have her autograph.
I'm so happy.

289
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,342
Do you want to go for a walk?

290
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,556
I want your autograph too,

291
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,433
but I can't see.

292
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,352
You can't? Hold on a second.

293
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,397
Stay like that. Just a second.

294
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,152
Good.

295
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,406
-Are you happy now?
-Thank you.

296
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,116
-Thank you.
-That's great.

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,701
Let's go.

298
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,412
Is there anyone else left?

299
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,414
I think you're all done now.

300
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,125
-Gosh.
-Oh, boy.

301
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,421
I feel so proud to have
such a famous friend like you.

302
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,715
-Don't mention it.
-Great job.

303
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,051
By the way, Bok-hee must be hungry.

304
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,677
Let's eat what we brought...

305
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,095
-Hello, there.
-My gosh.

306
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,389
They are must be your friends.

307
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:26,975
Hello.

308
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,980
I'll see you later in my office then.

309
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,443
Oh, my. Goodness.

310
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,321
My heart almost dropped there
for a second.

311
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,073
He's a doctor who works here.

312
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,367
Doesn't he resemble him so much?

313
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,536
No, Hye-ja. That's not just a resemblance.

314
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,456
I thought Jun-ha came back alive
or something.

315
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,500
When Hye-ja got married

316
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,669
No, when Dae-sang was born,

317
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,754
-that's just what he looked like.
-Right.

318
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,881
Whenever I look at him,

319
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,510
I get startled as well.

320
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:07,140
I understand. My gosh, Hye-ja.

321
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,352
It must remind you so much
of the old times.

322
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,606
Of course it does.

323
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,317
What's wrong this time?

324
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,819
Were you tortured or something?

325
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,238
He's not proposing to me!

326
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,284
Darn it.

327
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,706
As of today, it's been one year
since we first kissed.

328
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,417
How could someone be so slow
and lack creativity?

329
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,503
All he does is kiss me all the time.
Darn him.

330
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,006
Is it a proposal this time?

331
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,301
What if I get tired of waiting and
just marry another guy?

332
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,927
Is he taking me for granted?

333
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,595
I feel no tension at all
in our relationship.

334
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,306
Should I try create the tension a bit?

335
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,392
You should keep waiting as long
as your lips can bear it.

336
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,311
He'll propose one day.

337
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,230
-When is that?
-Well...

338
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,606
What? On my 60th birthday?

339
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,610
For a man like him who doesn't
know how to learn on his own,

340
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,612
there's no other way but to
make him learn by rote.

341
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,616
Starting today, I'll begin my
operation to make him propose to me.

342
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,537
How could you repeat
the same routine all the time

343
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,581
with just a different objective?

344
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,583
How will you make him propose to you?

345
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,128
Kissing and proposing are

346
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,297
all about mood.

347
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,841
If I just set the right mood,
he'll have no choice but to do it.

348
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,596
In order to set that mood, I will
go on an overnight trip with him.

349
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,515
-Your parents will never allow it.
-Why not?

350
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,725
I'm going on a trip with you.

351
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,143
-Who? Me?
-Yes.

352
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,228
Come over and tell
my parents we're going on a trip.

353
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,354
You want me to lie?

354
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,065
Why? Can't you do that for a friend?

355
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,734
I'm afraid I'll have a daughter
like you one day.

356
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,820
-With Yeong-su?
-You brat. That's ridiculous.

357
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,707
Okay.

358
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,628
Hello there, everyone.

359
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,130
I'm the operator, Kim Yeong-su.

360
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,548
I'll hand the mike over to you.

361
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,344
All copy. Are you really Kim Yeong-su?

362
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:11,014
It's an honor. I've heard so much
about you from other operators.

363
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,517
Copy.

364
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,478
Have rumors about me spread already?

365
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,733
Copy. You're a star to
amateur operators like us.

366
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,362
-Copy.
-Mom, it's true.

367
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,156
I'm going on an overnight trip
with Hyeon-ju.

368
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,451
We must be having some
temporary static. I'm sorry.

369
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,828
Please wait.

370
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,412
Seriously...

371
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,623
A trip?

372
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,375
What's wrong with your lips?

373
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,588
I ate something hot. I burned my lips.

374
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,714
It hurts.

375
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,302
Anyway, Mom. I'll be going with Hyeon-ju.

376
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,762
Why would you be worried?

377
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,890
Why wouldn't I be when two feisty
girls like yourselves are going on a trip?

378
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,394
There's no need to be worried
at all. I'm your daughter.

379
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,730
Hyeon-ju and I won't cause any
trouble at all and come back.

380
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,608
Don't you trust me, Mom?

381
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,194
Two girls going on a trip?
In such a terrifying world?

382
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,613
-An overnight trip? Never.
-Hey!

383
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,699
Mom, you should never trust her.

384
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,492
She told you to trust her before

385
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,744
and pocketed all that money
you gave her to buy books.

386
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,164
-If she hadn't pocketed that money,
-Hey, stop it!

387
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,833
-That's not true!
-we wouldn't be this broke.

388
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,793
-Mom, listen.
-Get out now!

389
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,920
-Mom, no.
-Mom, don't listen to him.

390
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,882
That's not true. He pocketed
more money than me.

391
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,717
At the sound of the boat horn,

392
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,928
Fifteen-thousand birds living in
Heungnam dock

393
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,015
all flew up to the sky at once.

394
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,230
As they watched the ship sail further,

395
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,567
people exchanged their last goodbyes.

396
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,197
"Please come again. Take care."

397
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,659
The merchants didn't miss this opportunity

398
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,246
to grill squid on top of a bonfire.

399
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,211
Do you think they can see that
through the radio? You idiot.

400
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,129
It's not just a radio, it's a ham radio.

401
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,547
I told you to be quiet.

402
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,674
Don't say a word.

403
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,680
Thank you for today's communication.

404
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,183
Thank you for your final comment.

405
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,311
That will be final. Thank you.

406
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,440
-You should leave.
-I almost persuaded Mom,

407
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,566
and you ruined it.

408
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,692
Go persuade her again then.

409
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,194
Do you think that's possible?

410
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,654
There is a way.

411
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,992
What do I have to do?

412
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,202
Do you want to go on a trip?

413
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,704
Do you really want to go
on that overnight trip?

414
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,248
Yes.

415
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,584
Then tell her you're bringing me with you.

416
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,544
What? That's absurd.

417
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,755
Then you'll never get to go.

418
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,507
-How could I...
-Hey.

419
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,802
I'm busy too. I don't want to go either.

420
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,221
I'm just offering since
you want to go so much.

421
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,266
Mom will be reassured and
allow it if I tag along.

422
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,686
-Don't you want to go?
-I do.

423
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,276
Where is it?

424
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,281
Look at him all excited.

425
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,284
Don't you worry. I got him covered.

426
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,704
Hey. Just take him to a cliff
somewhere and push him.

427
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,664
-Can I really push him?
-Yes, just do it.

428
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,001
MR. CHOI'S INN

429
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,972
-I'll do it.
-No! Don't touch it.

430
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,515
Do you think it's easy to light a fire?

431
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,226
Lighting a fire is no easy task at all.

432
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,644
Did you learn about the Neolithic era?

433
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,189
Back then, only the village chiefs
handled the fire. Do you know why?

434
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,651
Since it was difficult.

435
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,780
-You don't know anything.
-The fire is getting weak.

436
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,325
Hey, no! I told you not to touch it.

437
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,369
No fire has ever gone out in front of me.

438
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,163
It went out already.

439
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,084
Maybe it's because we're in
a different neighborhood.

440
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,170
I need time to adapt.

441
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,504
-Hold on.
-I'll try it.

442
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,257
Right, good. Now is the timing
to add more firewood.

443
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,344
Let's have a talk.

444
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,512
No, I'm busy right now.

445
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,473
I have something to tell you!

446
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,184
I'm lighting a fire right now.
You can just tell me here.

447
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,230
Would I be asking if it was
something that simple?

448
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,486
Please excuse me for a while.

449
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,820
Okay.

450
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,530
Where?

451
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,121
By the way, Hye-ja is by
that stream over there.

452
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,300
What are you doing here alone?

453
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,470
What? It's just pretty down here.

454
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,430
It is pretty.

455
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,603
I want to build a pretty house
and live here later on.

456
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,272
That sounds nice.

457
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,108
Right?

458
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,277
The kids can play in the water,
and my husband and I

459
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,699
can watch them happily.

460
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,456
How many kids shall I have?

461
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,500
I'm not sure.

462
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,170
-It might feel lonely with one kid.
-Of course it will.

463
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,090
I'll have at least three kids.

464
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,678
Then what should I do first?

465
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,222
Should I build a house? No...

466
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,307
Should I buy some land? No.

467
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,768
I should get married first.

468
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,023
In order to get married, there is
something that needs to be done...

469
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,615
Look, look.

470
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,707
Aren't I so good at skipping stones?

471
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,544
I'll make it across this stream this time.

472
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,385
Hye-ja.

473
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,430
You should try it too.

474
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,348
-Forget it.
-Go on.

475
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,895
Don't throw it like that.

476
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,146
Here. Try again.

477
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,487
Goodness. You really stink at this.

478
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,620
Here, try again.

479
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,300
What?

480
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,761
Are you attached to that pebble or what?

481
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,304
It was a ring.

482
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,643
-A ring?
-I wanted to propose to you today.

483
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,102
What?

484
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,655
You should've just given it to me.
Why did you hand it to me then?

485
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,574
I couldn't just give it to you.
I had to make it special, you know.

486
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,535
I wanted to surprise you.

487
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,206
Did it fall around here?

488
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,208
I don't know.

489
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,627
You can't even get the timing right.

490
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,590
When did you decide to propose to me?

491
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,884
A few months ago.

492
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,719
I've been waiting for the right moment.

493
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,681
Why didn't you propose to me
when you made up your mind?

494
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,020
Have you been waiting for a long time?

495
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,190
You're not completely clueless after all,

496
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,778
but you only take hints
that you want to take!

497
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,788
I found it.

498
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,873
Where? Where is it?

499
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,337
It's beautiful.

500
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,673
Did it get scratched up?

501
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,341
No, it looks fine.

502
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,852
You see,

503
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,189
I can't take hints,

504
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,774
and I don't have a lot.

505
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,236
What I lack outnumbers what I have.

506
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,488
But if you're okay with that,

507
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,618
would you marry me?

508
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,426
It looks beautiful on you.

509
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,488
What is this?

510
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,198
I bought it to propose to you.

511
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,535
I brought it, thinking that I should
propose to you if you don't.

512
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,833
Well...

513
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,752
you haven't given me your answer.

514
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,468
Would you marry me?

515
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,515
Yes.

516
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,409
Hey, what's wrong? What happened?

517
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,618
Hye-ja, what's wrong?

518
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,245
Jun-ha

519
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,622
proposed to me!

520
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,752
By the way, what happened to your faces?

521
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,590
Hey.

522
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,135
Shall we go back and finish
our conversation?

523
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,428
Okay, Yeong-su.

524
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,513
Keep doing what you're doing.

525
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,848
Okay?

526
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,231
You piece of...

527
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,529
When?

528
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,449
When we went on that trip together.

529
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,659
You guys had time to do that?

530
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,787
You don't need a lot of time
to get pregnant.

531
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,332
Hey.

532
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,709
Are you okay?

533
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,382
What is wrong with you?
Are you pregnant or what?

534
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,552
Sorry, I get nauseated easily.

535
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,890
I'm sorry. I thought you'd get married
before me.

536
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,518
Well, there's no set order.

537
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,145
That's right.

538
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,189
Since I'm your older brother,
it'd be better for me

539
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,565
to get married first anyway.

540
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,318
I'll buy Jun-ha a new suit.

541
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,404
We can't even afford to buy your suit.

542
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,531
That being said,

543
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,909
can you buy me a suit--

544
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,410
You can't, right?

545
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,584
RAMI PHOTO STUDIO

546
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:53,591
WEDDING, BIRTHDAYS,
ID CARD AND PASSPORT PHOTOS

547
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,613
HYOJA NURSING HOSPITAL

548
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,657
Will her condition keep getting worse?

549
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,370
It won't get better.

550
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,748
So the medication doesn't work?

551
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,583
It simply

552
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,878
slows down the progression, that's all.

553
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,467
Then there's probably no reason
for her to stay here.

554
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,220
Well, both you and your wife work,
so it'll be hard

555
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,806
for you to look after her
all day and night.

556
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,642
Also, if the symptoms of delirium
suddenly worsen like last time,

557
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,811
an unexpected accident may occur.

558
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,523
We'll keep an eye on her too,

559
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,608
but make sure she doesn't
go down to the basement.

560
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,653
The basement?

561
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,747
Ma'am.

562
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,296
Ma'am.

563
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,048
Ma'am.

564
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,136
Doctor.

565
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,345
What are you doing here?

566
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,598
Please go back to your room.

567
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,498
What are you doing?

568
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,501
I don't need to stay
in this expensive private room.

569
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,171
I asked to be moved
to a ward for six people.

570
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,757
Just stay here.

571
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,344
Private rooms
aren't even covered by insurance.

572
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,304
Money is one thing,

573
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,057
and I also get bored here
because I'm always alone.

574
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,100
There's no ward that's
available now, so just stay here.

575
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,604
They said they'll move me
as soon as one become available.

576
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,528
Did you take your medication?

577
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,492
I told you to take
your medication on time.

578
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,078
Especially this one.
You must take it on time.

579
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,563
Give me that.

580
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,073
Where are you going?

581
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,159
You said my pumpkin, Min-su, is coming.

582
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,078
I want to wait for him in the lobby.

583
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,007
Ma'am. I can't find

584
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,759
any veins on your arms today,

585
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,970
so I'll give you the shot on your foot.

586
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,142
You can get it on your arm again
when you recover a little.

587
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,768
It'll sting a bit.

588
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,064
You're okay, right?

589
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,317
Good. You did a great job.

590
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,491
-Get some rest now.
-Thank you.

591
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,373
Did it hurt?

592
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,170
You're doing very well.

593
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,465
Honey, when you're finished with this,

594
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,717
let's go for a walk.

595
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,561
-Nurse Kim.
-Yes?

596
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,230
-What's the matter?
-Gosh.

597
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,233
Stop frowning in the hospital.

598
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,110
I wasn't frowning.

599
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,362
I was just looking at you.

600
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,947
Then why do I feel so bad?

601
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,950
What have you been doing?
The patients are scared of you.

602
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,410
They want someone else.

603
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,454
Try to smile.

604
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,916
I smile all the time.
I'm smiling even right now.

605
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,293
You're smiling right now?

606
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,961
-Yes.
-Then stop smiling.

607
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,631
Gosh. Smile again.

608
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,132
No, don't.

609
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,051
My goodness. You look scary.

610
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,220
It's bath time. Hurry up.

611
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,764
Some college students are
coming to help out.

612
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,307
Keep an eye on them.

613
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,475
Okay.

614
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,229
My gosh. Smile.

615
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,525
No, just don't.

616
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,415
-Hello.
-Hello.

617
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,582
Well...

618
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,920
I guess the students are not here yet.

619
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,966
Sir, let me wash you up.

620
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,217
Please take off your clothes.

621
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,219
Don't call me "sir".

622
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,347
All right. Brother, let me wash you up.

623
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,933
I'm a college student. Class of 2018.

624
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,686
You're so funny.
You should become a comedian.

625
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,397
I mean it. Look at my college jacket.

626
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,357
I never went to Harvard,

627
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,067
but I have a Harvard jacket.

628
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,902
Let me wash you up now.
Take off your clothes.

629
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,612
I'm really a college student.

630
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,615
-I can still wash you up.
-Stop taking off my clothes!

631
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,243
-I have to take these off too?
-Of course.

632
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,669
Why are you crying?

633
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,589
You're like an eraser.

634
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,135
Hyun, what are you doing here?

635
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,430
Help me.

636
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,059
I told you I'm a college student!

637
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,438
-You're really class of 2018?
-I already told you!

638
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,524
Why did you give in so easily?

639
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,109
You finish up.

640
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,236
Gosh.

641
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,699
Hello.

642
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,203
Oh, my. It's still daytime,
but so many are watching.

643
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,414
Today I'm finally at the hospital

644
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,250
to see Grandma Hye-ja.

645
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,710
Give me a second.

646
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,004
Grandma, come here.

647
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,839
ARE WE FINALLY GOING TO SEE HER?

648
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,134
-All right. Ta-da.
-Should I look here?

649
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,969
This is my grandma. What do you think?

650
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,346
Isn't she lovely?

651
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,643
She wanted to become
a news anchor when she was young.

652
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,102
She has a great voice.

653
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,395
Do you want to hear it?

654
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,397
Grandma, say that.

655
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,067
-Say what?
-You know what I mean.

656
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,153
Yes, this is it.

657
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,240
Yeong-su, come and eat!

658
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,118
What do you think?
Isn't she just adorable?

659
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,454
Grandma. Look here.

660
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,164
Everyone is saying you look beautiful.

661
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,666
Where?

662
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,252
Here. Do you see those comments coming up?

663
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,465
There's some mango juice
in the fridge. Do you want it?

664
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,967
-No.
-Do you...

665
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,261
have to continue with that?

666
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,100
Guys, see you tomorrow. Bye.

667
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,685
Grandma, say bye.

668
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,395
Bye.

669
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,149
Your grandma needs rest.

670
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,943
I'm fine.

671
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,488
You must be busy. You didn't have to come.

672
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,992
Don't worry. I missed you, so I came
here straight from the airport.

673
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,452
You go on way too many business trips.

674
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,705
Your boss is too mean.

675
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,999
You shouldn't criticize my boss.

676
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,667
Because I'm my own boss.

677
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,089
Oh, right. I have something to give you.

678
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,299
What is it?

679
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,593
Ta-da.

680
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,430
Why would you waste money
on something like this?

681
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,934
It's money.

682
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,397
Get some nice clothes for the winter.

683
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,066
Give it to your mom.

684
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:34,278
It's okay. I'll give her something else.

685
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,155
This is for you.

686
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,824
Did you eat?

687
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,036
Take him and get something to eat.

688
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,038
You didn't eat, did you?

689
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,498
If you don't eat well when you're
young, your body gets ruined.

690
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,335
All right.

691
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,046
I'll come back soon.

692
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,185
I have some work left.

693
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,436
I have to go.

694
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,189
Stop by at home sometime.

695
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,608
Your mom wants to see you.

696
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,320
I'll call her. Bye.

697
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,917
-You're adorable. Come here.
-Grandma.

698
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,544
My babies. You're adorable.

699
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,089
Your grandma must be tired.

700
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,132
She needs some rest.
Let's go have ice cream.

701
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,467
-Let's go.
-Go have some ice cream.

702
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,344
-Enjoy your ice cream.
-Let's go.

703
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,762
-We'll be right back.
-Okay.

704
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,682
Oh, my. How adorable.

705
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,897
What is it?

706
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,899
Is something bothering you?

707
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:56,902
Nothing.

708
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,238
Come on.

709
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,782
Mom, we're in deep trouble.

710
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,450
Can you help us?

711
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:09,540
Mom, you have some money left
from the house, right?

712
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,836
I started to run a shop
to support my family,

713
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,671
and I'm struggling.

714
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,881
Please help me out this once.

715
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,717
Yes. Mom, I'm in this too.

716
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,885
I put a lot of money in it.

717
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,638
If he goes bankrupt, so will I.

718
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,392
I don't have any money.

719
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,853
I sold that house
and gave you all the money

720
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,604
before I moved here.

721
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,314
I know you didn't give us everything.

722
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,484
I can't.

723
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,570
It's for Eun-suk.

724
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,781
She's my child too.

725
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,868
-Eun-suk...
-She doesn't need any money.

726
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,954
Mom, we're in some serious trouble.

727
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,582
Eun-suk needs the money
more than you two do.

728
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,501
She put you two through college

729
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,837
and sold her land for your weddings.

730
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,716
To put you two through college,

731
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,510
she had to work at factories
all those years.

732
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,514
And I couldn't give her anything
when she got married.

733
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,017
I've heard that enough.

734
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,394
I didn't ask you to do that.

735
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,731
In the end, I'll be the one who
holds memorial services for you.

736
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,318
Why can't you help me out a little?

737
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,069
We're the ones who visit you here.

738
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,530
We're the ones who do our duties.

739
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:26,533
Do you think
she doesn't want to do her duties?

740
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,412
If you have nothing else to say,
leave now. Get out.

741
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,677
Here.

742
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,688
Children are like that.

743
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,527
Children never understand their parents.

744
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,447
All they care about is money.

745
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,825
Can't they see

746
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,661
their sick mother?

747
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,457
I'd understand
if Eun-suk asked me for money.

748
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,712
No one welcomed her when she was
born because she was a girl.

749
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,465
She started working at a factory
at such an early age.

750
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,593
She put her older brothers through college

751
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,512
and even paid for their weddings.

752
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,098
When she got married,

753
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,350
she didn't take any money from me.

754
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,938
"It's okay, Mom."

755
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,690
That's what she said.

756
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,901
She's a good daughter.

757
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,529
She's so thoughtful.

758
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,366
Does she live far away?

759
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,369
I don't think I've seen her.

760
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,415
She is in the hospital.

761
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,752
Maybe she was too thoughtful.

762
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,755
She got cancer. Uterine cancer.

763
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,886
But it's an early stage, so it'll be fine.

764
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,806
The technology these days is amazing.

765
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,767
If chemotherapy,
or whatever it's called, goes well,

766
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,145
she can fully recover.

767
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,106
That's a relief.

768
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,150
Still,

769
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,820
I feel like it's all my fault.

770
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:31,783
Sometimes I wonder if this is
all because I've lived for too long.

771
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:36,455
You know that's not true.
It's not true at all.

772
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,914
Yes.

773
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,418
She called me a while ago.

774
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,670
She said her treatment went well

775
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,506
and said she'd come to visit me soon.

776
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,635
That's a relief. I'm glad to hear it.

777
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:04,733
What's that for?

778
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:06,902
Fresh kimchi.

779
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,946
The hospital food seemed bad.

780
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,951
I'm not sure if she can eat
something spicy.

781
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,454
I hope it suits Mother's taste.

782
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,624
I'll just make it less spicy.

783
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,236
HYOJA NURSING HOSPITAL

784
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,915
Eun-suk.

785
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,712
Goodness. When did you arrive?

786
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,004
My lovely daughter.

787
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,884
Why did you lose so much weight?

788
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,428
My gosh.

789
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,763
I've always been quite skinny.

790
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,807
What about you?

791
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,976
You look so thin.

792
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,602
No.

793
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,564
I eat so well at this place.

794
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,608
What about your cancer?

795
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,903
I'm all cured now. I'm okay.

796
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,115
Really? Are you really cured?

797
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,868
Did your doctor tell you
that you're cured?

798
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:41,079
Of course. That's why I came here
to see you.

799
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:45,041
Gosh. I feel so relieved.

800
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,837
Your brothers visited earlier today.

801
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,382
Do you know how much they infuriated me?

802
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,593
They wanted the money from our old house.

803
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,346
I'll never let them get their hands
on that money

804
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,432
-and leave it to you.
-Mom.

805
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,852
It's all right. Just give it to them.

806
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,105
Those words

807
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,568
still break my heart.

808
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,905
You always say that it's all right.

809
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,115
"It's all right as long as my brothers
are happy."

810
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,743
Where did that lead you?
You're the only one

811
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,286
who ended up sick.

812
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,705
Did your brothers ever pitch in any money?

813
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,750
They have no sense of shame at all.

814
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,835
Mom.

815
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,379
I'm really all right.

816
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,466
Why is that all you can say?

817
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,676
I'm not fine with it.

818
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,513
I want to give you that money.

819
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,599
I couldn't do anything for you
my whole life

820
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,603
and I still have deep regrets
inside my heart.

821
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,271
Okay?

822
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,983
Right. I have something
that I want to give you.

823
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:58,657
This is an autograph from your
favorite singer, Yoon Bok-hee.

824
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,744
These are nutritional supplements.

825
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,750
These are good for your health too,
so take them.

826
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,772
Eun-suk.

827
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,444
I'm sorry.

828
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,533
In your next life,

829
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,954
will you be born as my daughter again?

830
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,419
If that really happens,

831
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,008
since I've already experienced it once,

832
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,761
I'll be a really,

833
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,432
really...

834
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,895
good mom to you.

835
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,709
Oh, right.

836
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:37,005
Mother's feet are cold. I should
bring her some sleeping socks.

837
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,236
You're here.

838
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,698
You must be tired.

839
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,742
You can come tomorrow.

840
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,494
Did I wake you up?

841
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,958
I brought your favorite
fresh kimchi and jangjorim.

842
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,168
You have trouble eating
the food they serve here.

843
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,921
I can no longer feel what
anything tastes like.

844
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,422
Still.

845
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,426
Gosh, your feet are so cold.

846
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,471
I'm glad I brought some sleeping socks.

847
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,809
Mother, these will

848
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,186
warm up your feet.

849
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,647
Here. Now you'll feel better.

850
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,820
There you go.

851
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,746
You can stop now.

852
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,541
Your legs still feel stiff.

853
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:58,545
You always used to have
cold hands and feet.

854
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,174
You can stop now.

855
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:22,277
You've lived such a busy life.

856
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:28,199
I was so fortunate to have
a daughter-in-law like you.

857
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,660
That's not true.

858
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,455
I don't deserve such a compliment.

859
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,665
You've done enough.

860
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,668
No.

861
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,337
You've done more than enough.

862
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,507
Now, lay down your burden

863
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,593
and live your life comfortably.

864
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:55,226
How much longer do you think
I have left anyway?

865
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,649
With your financial difficulties

866
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,569
and your handicapped husband,

867
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:10,325
I knew how tough it was for you to manage.

868
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:16,539
But I was caught up with my own
issues, and pretended not to know.

869
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,463
I didn't want to blame my own child...

870
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,425
so I left you all alone...

871
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,553
when you didn't even have any family.

872
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,850
I knew how much you were
suffering and aging

873
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,562
while you worked in the corner of
that old beauty salon.

874
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,651
Yes.

875
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,570
It was all because of my greed.

876
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,118
I'm sorry.

877
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,788
It's all right, Mother.

878
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,545
From now on, just think about
your own life.

879
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,131
You deserve it.

880
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,093
Free yourself from

881
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,846
your husband and your child
and live your life.

882
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:19,811
That's the only way I can
forgive myself and leave.

883
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,187
Mother.

884
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,738
Jeong-eun.

885
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,658
Mother.

886
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,251
My sweet daughter-in-law.

887
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,212
Mother...

888
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,382
No matter what you decide to do,

889
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,719
I'll always be on your side.

890
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,681
Mother...

891
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,563
Don't cry, sweetheart.

892
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,608
Don't cry.

893
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,613
Don't cry.

894
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,231
DIVORCE AGREEMENT
LEE DAE-SANG, MOON JEONG-EUN

895
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:49,943
What's this?

896
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:53,821
You want a divorce?

897
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,371
You've put up with more than enough.

898
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,373
So?

899
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,751
You want me to ditch you and Mother
because of her Alzheimer's

900
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,212
so that I can live comfortably
all by myself?

901
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,382
While putting up with people
calling me a bad person?

902
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,553
How can you say that to someone
you've lived with all your life?

903
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,268
Then what should I do?

904
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,481
My mom is one thing,

905
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,653
but I can't even die right now.

906
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,239
You're so mean!

907
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,284
Gosh, you're such a cruel person.

908
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,415
If I had planned to leave you,

909
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,002
I wouldn't have packed up my stuff
just to unpack it

910
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,296
multiple times over the years.

911
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,174
Your heart is more messed up
than your leg is.

912
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,552
You always treated me like a stranger.

913
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:01,764
I got my hopes up only to be
disappointed over and over,

914
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,309
but I still...

915
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,646
Even just seeing your back
lying on the bed

916
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,694
teared me up every single time,
but I would've lived differently.

917
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,413
It's not just because of you.
I can't get a divorce.

918
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,167
Until Mother's final moments,

919
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,462
I'll make kimchi and side dishes
and take them to her.

920
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,548
So from now on, don't tell me what to do.

921
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,063
HAPPY BEAUTY SALON, CLOSED TODAY

922
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,372
What is this? This part is wavy,
but this side is all straight.

923
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,831
You call this a perm?

924
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:12,168
I came here to get a perm,
not to ruin my hair!

925
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,545
On top of that, my hair is all damaged.

926
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,214
You seem very angry.

927
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:20,301
I'll apply a thick coat of
reparative treatment for you.

928
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,887
I'll also see if there are
any other complimentary add-ons,

929
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,472
I can give you.

930
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,723
Please calm down.

931
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,732
Gosh, it's so cold.

932
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,818
They're already selling
Red bean buns on the streets.

933
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,279
You can have it.
I have to tidy up here first.

934
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,407
This has custard inside.

935
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,242
It doesn't have red bean paste.

936
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,453
I guess many people
dislike red beans like you do.

937
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,621
Try it.

938
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,126
Here.

939
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,097
Did I tell you?

940
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:10,435
A man asked me to trim his hair down
to five centimeters long,

941
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,562
but I cut his hair five millimeters long
by mistake.

942
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,730
Seriously?

943
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,565
You never told me that before.

944
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,068
Was it just after I opened my salon?

945
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:23,781
A man came and asked me
to trim his hair down to five centimeters,

946
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,117
but I totally forgot about it.

947
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,371
That huge, buff guy

948
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:33,291
with tanned skin

949
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,127
got teary-eyed

950
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,588
and glared at me like this.

951
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,177
But you know what?
I didn't apologize to him,

952
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,053
not even once.

953
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:50,475
I kept insisting that he said
five millimeters, not five centimeters.

954
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,019
Weren't you scared?

955
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,106
Back then,

956
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,651
money scared me the most.

957
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,071
What if he asked me
to pay him back twofold?

958
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,407
Right.

959
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,746
Mother.

960
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,707
Thank you.

961
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,768
Mother, I'm here.

962
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,522
Mother.

963
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,609
The Red bean bun place
in our neighborhood that you like.

964
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,486
They're back in business as of today.

965
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:47,490
Here, eat it before it gets cold.

966
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,665
You must be a hairstylist.

967
01:03:58,584 --> 01:03:59,669
Sorry?

968
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,673
I guess your salon is very busy.

969
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,259
It looks like you didn't even have time
to put on gloves.

970
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,681
You have to take care of your hands
before the skin gets cracked.

971
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,103
It must've hurt a lot.

972
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,189
It must sting when it touches the water.

973
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,862
Go to a pharmacy
and get ointment in a jar like this.

974
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,697
It's called Vaseline.

975
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,575
Apply a thick layer of it
all over your hand.

976
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,535
Then grab a plastic bag.

977
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,537
Wear it on your hand before you go to bed.

978
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,832
That will help.

979
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,544
Okay, I'll do that.

980
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,839
I know these things
because I used to run a hair salon myself.

981
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:49,176
Happy Beauty Salon by the
dry cleaner's at the intersection.

982
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,470
That's my salon.

983
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,645
This Red bean bun is so good.

984
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:24,503
HYOJA NURSING HOSPITAL

985
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:13,386
SPECIAL THANKS TO SON SOOK,
YOON BOK-HEE, AND HWANG JUNG-MIN

986
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:33,114
Does she have any specific memory
that may be related to that watch?

987
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:35,908
Will retrieving memories
of the watch be helpful?

988
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,619
-See you later.
-Stop making him work so hard.

989
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,247
-Where's Jun-ha?
-Jun-ha isn't back yet?

990
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,499
-"Yet"?
-I was released around dawn,

991
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:44,750
so I assumed he'd be back by now.

992
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,546
Strangely, Mom keeps reacting sensitively
to an old man's watch.

993
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:49,672
Where's that man?

994
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,258
Wait. Is he still alive?

995
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,220
