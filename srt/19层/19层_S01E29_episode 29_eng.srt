1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,950

2
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:56,682

3
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:59,626

4
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,292
Wait.

5
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:44,450
Yan Mingliang, why hasn't Gao Xuan woken up yet?

6
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,589
And my dad. What have you done to them?

7
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:52,810
 Uncle Yan, it's not too late.

8
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,610
 Let's leave together.

9
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,490
 Gao Xuan!

10
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:50,070
Y-You just left him in there?

11
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,550
How could you just watch him die?

12
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,949
 All those bastards were just watching like it was a joke.

13
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,289
 No one tried to save her.

14
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,790
Yan Mingliang.

15
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,250
He opened the door for you, why didn't you save him?

16
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,450
Why didn't you save him?

17
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,624
I'm sorry.

18
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:40,690
- I'm sorry. 
 - Go.

19
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:13,016
Gao Xuan.

20
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:44,130
Hello? I need an ambulance.

21
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,089
Officer Ye, please explain the case investigation process.

22
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,070
Half a month ago, we received public reports of citizens

23
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,750
falling into comas for unknown reasons.

24
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,390
We immediately launched an investigation.

25
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,090
We soon found out that all the victims had played 19th floor.

26
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,250
This, combined with the public reports,

27
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,950
made us suspicious of Tianji Science and Technology.

28
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,490
After investigating and gathering significant criminal evidence,

29
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,930
we arrested the criminal suspects.

30
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,189
At the same time, the Municipal Health Commission

31
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:25,449
also issued a penalty letter to the hospital involved,

32
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,869
and revoked the medical licenses of the doctors in question.

33
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:32,410
The hospital failed to detect the doctors' abuse of power,

34
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,030
and the Municipal Health Commission issued a warning to the hospital's dean.

35
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,649
At the same time, the Municipal Public Security Bureau

36
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,590
conducted appropriate legal training for all hospital staff.

37
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,870
The people being held by the suspects in this case

38
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,730
have also been freed by the police.

39
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,330
The suspected criminal acts of other related personnel

40
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,490
are still under further investigation.

41
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,849
Brother, do you think he will wake up?

42
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:59,989
Of course, he will.

43
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,409
Just looking at her makes me feel terrible.

44
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,710
- Uncle Chun. 
 - Uncle Chun.

45
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,690
- Hello, Uncle. 
 - Uncle Chun.

46
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,910
Why is everyone standing out here?

47
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,909
Uncle Chun, well… We've been here for a while.

48
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,350
Considering Chun Yu's condition right now,

49
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,410
it won't be good for her if we all rush in there.

50
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,570
Gao Xuan also needs time to rest,

51
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,709
so we all agreed to leave them alone.

52
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,069
Okay.

53
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,289
I'll convey all your good wishes.

54
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:43,729
By the way, Uncle Chun, what about the test results?

55
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,930
Will Old Gao wake up?

56
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,709
When the system self-destructed, he was trapped inside.

57
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:00,649
Let's keep thinking about this.

58
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,829
As long as there's a glimmer of hope, we can't give up.

59
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:06,989
There must be a way, Uncle Chun.

60
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,509
Uncle Chun, we will be leaving then.

61
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:12,950
Okay, thank you all.

62
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,340
Chun Yu.

63
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:03,970
This is from Nan Xiaoqin.

64
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,170
She said it's the green mandrake she has grown recently.

65
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:24,510
 The flower language of the green mandrake is endless hope.

66
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:44,709
Stay with him.

67
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,990
I have to take care of something. I'll be going.

68
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,680
Okay.

69
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:40,100
♫  I understand your sudden silences  ♫

70
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:46,449
♫  And your smiles through the tears  ♫

71
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:53,004
♫  You are like a gentle and warm breeze  ♫

72
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:59,340
♫  That has learned to recklessly accompany me in madness  ♫

73
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,528
Gao Xuan.

74
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,568
Look.

75
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,769
The sun is out.

76
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:16,833
♫  We are half awake, half asleep  ♫

77
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,156
Gao Xuan, look.

78
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:26,943
This is the green mandrake Xiaoqin sent us.

79
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:31,449
Its flower language is endless hope.

80
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,852
Gao Xuan.

81
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:48,590
♫  You understand my peculiar stubbornness  ♫

82
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,890
I'm not giving up on you.

83
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,810
♫  You say under my cold exterior is a heart like a furnace  ♫

84
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,690
Bawan, Xiaoqin, Qing You,

85
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,989
Wenya, and Brother Qiang,

86
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,430
none of us will give up on you.

87
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,280
Keep fighting.

88
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,430
Chun Yu.

89
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,130
Chun Yu, I have some good news for you.

90
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,350
There is hope for Gao Xuan.

91
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,769
During this period, thanks to Yongcheng,

92
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:56,509
we have restored part of 19th Floor.

93
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,550
We found Gao Xuan's consciousness is still inside, but he is lost.

94
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,509
He is lost in the chaotic fragments of his memory.

95
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:05,449
Only if he wakes up on his own,

96
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:08,190
we can remove his consciousness from the system.

97
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:13,390
Those he knows and cares for have a higher chance to awaken him.

98
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,530
However, it's very likely that this person's consciousness

99
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,749
may also be trapped and unable to escape.

100
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,789
Even if there's only the slightest hope,

101
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,370
I want to give it a try.

102
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,249
There may also be a side effect.

103
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,590
Even if you manage to get him out,

104
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,149
interfering consciousness factors

105
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:43,430
may cause him

106
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,490
to lose all memories of you.

107
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,944
You…

108
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,350
You mean…

109
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,410
He might forget about me?

110
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,356
Dad.

111
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:16,449
I have to save him.

112
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:19,844
Okay.

113
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,310
It might be very dangerous.

114
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,016
Be careful.

115
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:52,968
Chun Yu.

116
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,110
Chun Yu, wake up.

117
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,204
Chun Yu.

118
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:04,400
Chun Yu.

119
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:42,190
Chun Yu, there are lots of fun things over there.  Let's go.

120
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,956
Look.

121
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,250
What is this?

122
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,110
A shadow puppet.

123
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,008
Did you just hit me?

124
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,640
Run!

125
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,209
What are you two doing?

126
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,550
Chasing our NPC with props?

127
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,489
Who plays games like that?

128
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:40,250
If everyone played like you two, our place would be closed.

129
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,169
You two say something.

130
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,488
Let's go.

131
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:44,729
What…

132
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:47,850
Chun Yu, Xiao Lei, come here.

133
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,056
Look at you.

134
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,056
Your hair is a mess.

135
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,309
Dad, Mom.

136
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,150
Chun Yu, take a look.

137
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,870
Brother Xiao Lei will take you to any game you want to play.

138
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,170
- Go ahead. 
 - Brother Xiao Lei, let's go.

139
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,636
Look at them.

140
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,590
 Me and Brother Xiao Lei.

141
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,829
 My mom and dad.

142
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,129
 Brother Xiao Lei's mom and dad.

143
00:17:24,129 --> 00:17:26,810
 Everything is so beautiful.

144
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:32,429
 Even if this is a dream,

145
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:37,529
 I really hope this dream never ends.

146
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:45,280

147
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,729
Brother Xiao Lei, I want to join your Shadow Play Club.

148
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,709
Sure, you're always welcome.

149
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:21,789
Then teach me.

150
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:23,296
Wait.

151
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,629
Go behind the curtain.

152
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,130
Here comes Old Sun.

153
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,670
Let's do a backflip.

154
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,349
Let's see another one.

155
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:49,850
- Awesome. 
 - What do you think? Give it a try.

156
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,540
Here.

157
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,009
I'm Old Chun.

158
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,848
Wait, no.

159
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,430
Fine, I'm Old Chun too.

160
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,310
You are Little Chun.

161
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,869
Then, here comes Little Sun.

162
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:12,249
I am here.

163
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:15,430
Actually, Shadow Play is all about twisting.

164
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,270
Twisting is the most basic skill.

165
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,770
Look, same thing here. Hold it more loosely.

166
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,230
Then twist it like this. That's right.

167
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,610
The same goes for this side. That's right.

168
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,870
Relax. Like this.

169
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,390
Right, just like holding chopsticks.

170
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,670
Same here.

171
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,110
Gently twist it like this.

172
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,069
Gently twist this side too.

173
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,509
That's right.

174
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:36,049
You don't have to hold it so tightly. Here, try it.

175
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,890
One, two, three, go.

176
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,449
Cross over.

177
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:41,270
That's right. Hold it.

178
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,629
Right, use this hand.

179
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,610
Just like holding chopsticks.

180
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,108
What's wrong?

181
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,036
Nothing.

182
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,048
What's wrong?

183
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,050
Nothing, I'm going to the restroom.

184
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:37,344

185
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,290
 I have to save him.

186
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:49,369
 Okay.

187
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:51,210
 To prevent your mind from getting lost,

188
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,589
 we will create a small reminder program for you.

189
00:21:55,589 --> 00:22:00,990
 Is there anything especially important between you two?

190
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,109
 - An item will do. 
 - Right, an item.

191
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,290

192
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,849
What delicious meals are you planning to cook tonight?

193
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:41,769
I will cook whatever you want to eat.

194
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:45,589
I want to eat sweet and sour spare ribs,

195
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:48,910
braised pork tenderloin, and…

196
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:00,290
World of Joy.

197
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:05,190
Come and check it out.

198
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:17,484
Chun Yu, what's wrong?

199
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,609
Hello! Water Paradise! Come and check it out.

200
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,764
No, thanks.

201
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,404
Let's go.

202
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,510
What else did you say you wanted to eat?

203
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,430
I-I-I forgot.

204
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,409
What's wrong? You're acting really nervous.

205
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,970
I said I would cook for you,

206
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,190
but we ended up buying a lot of snacks.

207
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,730
That's because I don't want you to get too tired cooking.

208
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,090
I know.

209
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,630
By the way, I didn't know you liked to eat snacks.

210
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,390
Well, we weren't together before.

211
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,449
So now that we are, everything is sweeter?

212
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:09,530
I want to eat that.

213
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,670
Ice cream?

214
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,010
Gao Xuan, do you remember?

215
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,970
Every time we came here when we were little,

216
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,649
you would buy me an ice cream.

217
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,556
Who is Gao Xuan?

218
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,810
I mean… Brother Xiao Lei.

219
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,150
Wait here for a while. I'll go buy it.

220
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,160
Miss.

221
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:44,452
Gao Xuan.

222
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:11,870
I've reminded you so many times.

223
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,390
Why won't you look at the stamp?

224
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,690
Every time you tell me you'll get him out,

225
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,950
but each time you do the same thing.

226
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,169
What are you thinking?

227
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,530
Chun Yu.

228
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,510
I know how you feel about Gao Xuan.

229
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,190
That's why we have restored this system.

230
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,289
I let you go in so you can get him out,

231
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,870
so that you can both get out.

232
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,752
It's not so that…

233
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,932
Chun Yu.

234
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:48,609
I've already lost your mom.

235
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,090
I can't afford to lose you too.

236
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,250
Dad, let me in one more time.

237
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,690
This time I'll definitely get him out.

238
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,224
No way.

239
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:01,749
Your memories are already interfering with his illusions.

240
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:04,150
If this continues, it will be very dangerous.

241
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,849
You will both be trapped in there.

242
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:08,789
- Dad, please— 
 - Enough.

243
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:10,349
That's all for today.

244
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:12,870
Go back and get some rest.

245
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,090
We can talk later.

246
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,509
This house has been vacant for a long, long time.

247
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:09,990
Unexpectedly, someone finally moved in.

248
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,356
Little Yu.

249
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:21,549
I remember the little boy

250
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:25,409
who lived here when you were little.

251
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:31,250
If you've forgotten him, just let it be.

252
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,749
Don't take it to heart.

253
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,849
People are just like that.

254
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,589
No matter how close you were before,

255
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,850
if he doesn't come to find you,

256
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,190
and you don't look for him either,

257
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,889
you will slowly forget each other, won't you?

258
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:02,070
We're about to eat. Where are you going now?

259
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,844
I'm going to look for him.

260
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,090
Look at this child.

261
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:10,270
She's so wild, I can't understand her at all.

262
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,512
Dad.

263
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:30,270
This time, I'll definitely get him out. Trust me.

264
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,560
Sit.

265
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,676
Brother Xiao Lei.

266
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:30,490
Chun Yu, you're awake.

267
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:35,570
I just wanted to cook,

268
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,870
so I took a knife to chop some green onions.

269
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:43,330
You must be thirsty. I'll pour you a glass of water.

270
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,349
You saw it all, didn't you?

271
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,916
What?

272
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,010
Well…

273
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,209
At the supermarket,

274
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:01,449
that clown and the figurine.

275
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:03,250
You saw it all.

276
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,096
Just like me.

277
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,649
I'm sorry, Chun Yu.

278
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,650
I don't know why, but lately I've been seeing these crazy things.

279
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,910
I didn't know you could see them too.

280
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,270
But don't worry,

281
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,490
I think they're all illusions.

282
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:33,610
Those…

283
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,330
Those are not illusions,

284
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:43,169
but things we've been through together.

285
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:48,052
All of this

286
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,132
is the illusion.

287
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:58,549
What are you talking about?

288
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,090
How could this be an illusion?

289
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,060
Brother Xiao Lei,

290
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,789
In the real world, you're not called Zhao Lei.

291
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:16,250
You changed your name to Gao Xuan.

292
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:22,230
We were forced to enter a horror game called 19th Floor.

293
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:27,969
Our friends kept dying over and over in the game,

294
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:31,509
and they fell into a coma in reality.

295
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,549
Still, no matter what,

296
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:38,569
you've always been there by my side,

297
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:42,649
watching over me, and protecting me.

298
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:46,749
In the end, to save me,

299
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:51,150
your consciousness got trapped in this system,

300
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:57,209
and has created this perfect world.

301
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,250
Here,

302
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,789
your mom hasn't left you,

303
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:06,870
and your dad also didn't die from drinking.

304
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,209
My…

305
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:11,169
My mom is fine too.

306
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:17,169
Our two families are very happy together.

307
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:22,996
Both of us are also happy together.

308
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,944
Then, isn't it good?

309
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,490
Yes.

310
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,870
It's good.

311
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,169
Still, that's too good.

312
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:49,050
None of this is real.

313
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:54,509
If we continue like this,

314
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,209
you'll be trapped in here forever,

315
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:00,964
so will I.

316
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:06,348
Brother Xiao Lei,

317
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,576
do you still remember this?

318
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,510
 My name is Chun Yu.

319
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,208
 What's yours?

320
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:36,510
 This thing will make you smile.

321
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,404
 Run!

322
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,229
 Follow me. Hurry!

323
00:34:51,229 --> 00:34:53,249
 What's your name?

324
00:34:53,249 --> 00:34:55,092
 Gao Xuan.

325
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,609
 It looks like the world we live in,

326
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:59,809
 but it's completely different.

327
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,189
 It still hurts.

328
00:35:19,189 --> 00:35:22,670
 It will heal faster after I treat it.

329
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:26,390
 As long as you want to continue this game,

330
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,310
 I won't leave.

331
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,489
 Regardless of their decisions,

332
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,010
 I will accompany you to save Qing You.

333
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,310
 Gao Xuan.

334
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,709
 Thank you for everything you've done for me.

335
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,010
 I will definitely not forget you.

336
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:53,989
 It's okay, it's okay, don't be afraid.

337
00:35:53,989 --> 00:35:56,469
 I'm here.

338
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:03,950
 No matter what happens, I'm not giving up on you.

339
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,689
 I'll always be there for you.

340
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,030
 I'm here, your dad will be fine.

341
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,890
Chun Yu.

342
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,249
The smiling face is disappearing.

343
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:47,330
This is a reminder program my dad set up for us.

344
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:52,609
When the smiling face is completely gone,

345
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,850
we won't be able to leave ever again.

346
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,890
What are we waiting for?

347
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,549
 Even if you manage to get him out,

348
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:11,510
 interfering consciousness factors

349
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:16,469
 may cause him to lose all memories of you.

350
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,336
What's wrong, Chun Yu?

351
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:22,429
What else are you worried about?

352
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,180
Nothing.

353
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,892
Let's go.

354
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,516
Let's go.

355
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,008
Come.

356
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,044
Go ahead and press it.

357
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,630

358
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,370
What? Unwilling to leave my dream?

359
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,968
Chun Yu,

360
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:51,490
rest assured.

361
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,529
In the future, we'll be happier than we are now.

362
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,089
I promise you.

363
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,040

364
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,570

365
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:27,850

366
00:40:28,548 --> 00:40:32,044
♫  I go from running  ♫

367
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:35,468
♫  To flying  ♫

368
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:39,526
♫  Through setbacks and hardship  ♫

369
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:42,984
♫  So what?  ♫

370
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:46,668
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

371
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:50,269
♫  It shines on my face  ♫

372
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:53,912
♫  Unwilling to lose hope  ♫

373
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:57,307
♫  I only want to bloom  ♫

374
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,632
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

375
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:06,148
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

376
00:41:06,148 --> 00:41:11,443
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

377
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,196
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

378
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:21,128
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

379
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:26,512
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

380
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,301
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

381
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:32,980
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

382
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,908
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

383
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:38,432
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

384
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:41,224
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

385
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,988
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

386
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:47,768
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

387
00:41:47,768 --> 00:41:50,564
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

388
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:56,920
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

389
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:16,452
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

390
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:19,876
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫
