1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:10,030

2
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:12,952
It's me.

3
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:18,366
Why did you come in?

4
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:21,787
They… They got her.

5
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:23,747
Don't let her in here.

6
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:26,244
What should I do?

7
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,472

8
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:04,880

9
00:03:55,808 --> 00:04:01,732

10
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:04,776

11
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:08,310

12
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:13,486
 Do you believe in this world?

13
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,296
 I don't believe it.

14
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:19,707
 Since the day she left, I only believed in myself.

15
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,426
 For many people,

16
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:27,048
 entering college means a new chapter in one's life.

17
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:32,040
 But to me, everything is meaningless.

18
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,246
 As for the future, I don't have any expectations.

19
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,640

20
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,900

21
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:01,147
 Guys, good morning!

22
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:04,706
 As of today, I am a freshman.

23
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:06,586
 What?

24
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:09,156
 There's a pretty young lady over there.

25
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,707
Are you a freshman, too?

26
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,987
Could you talk about your…

27
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:21,726
It looks like that student is a little shy,

28
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:22,786
but it doesn't matter.

29
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:25,026
Please don't leave my livestream.

30
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:27,746
It's the first day of school. Come with me for registration.

31
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:30,727
Let’s explore Jianghua together!

32
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:33,007
Are you Xu Wenya?

33
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:38,047
I can't believe we're at the same school.

34
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,186
My name is Yang Bawan. I'm your fan.

35
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,387
I'm in the School of Business Administration.

36
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,040
And you…

37
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:50,147
Wh-What major are you in?

38
00:05:50,147 --> 00:05:52,367
I'm majoring in Film and Television Performance.

39
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:53,627
R-R-Right.

40
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:56,926
I-I knew it. I couldn't be in the same class as you.

41
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,860

42
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,120

43
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:13,568
Chun Yu?

44
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,267
Right, she's Chun Yu.

45
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,812
I've seen her.

46
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:25,227
No. 17 Senior High School's most ruthless student.

47
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:28,007
I didn't hang out with her in senior high school, but I know about her.

48
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:30,547
She is said to be a loner and prone to violence.

49
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:33,007
She always carries a hammer in her bag.

50
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:37,126
So I'm telling you, don't…

51
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,586
Influencers are really different.

52
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:44,296
Time management guru.

53
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,176
Chun Yu.

54
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:06,972
Chun Yu.

55
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,806
Is this that building?

56
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:18,627
I read many legends on the Internet about the abandoned old building of Jianghua College.

57
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:21,247
They said it's eerie and weird,

58
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,946
and there are many scary stories.

59
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:26,747
There are all kinds of versions.

60
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,892
Let's go.

61
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:32,544
Right, Chun Yu. I'm also majoring in Geriatric Rehabilitation.

62
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,067
I was your classmate in senior high school,

63
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,546
and I didn't expect to be in the same class as you in college.

64
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,160
Is that so?

65
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:40,128
Chun Yu.

66
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:43,147
I just asked the teacher to put us in the same dorm room.

67
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,427
You’re okay with it, right?

68
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:49,067
I just feel safe being with you.

69
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,120
Hi.

70
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,320

71
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,270
Hi.

72
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:13,346
My name is Qing You, and I'm majoring in Geriatric Rehabilitation.

73
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,007
She is Chun Yu.

74
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,107
We are in the same class.

75
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:24,627
One acts like a kind person.

76
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:26,306
The other acts like a cold person.

77
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:28,726
They're both just clowns.

78
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:36,747
 No. 17 Senior High School's most ruthless student.

79
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:39,226
 She is said to be a loner and prone to violence.

80
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:41,687
 She always carries a hammer in her bag.

81
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:49,516
Why did this dorm become a construction site?

82
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,767
Are you injured?

83
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,860
Let me help you.

84
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:01,468
No.

85
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:06,887
If I didn't break an arm or leg,

86
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:09,326
I'd be embarrassed to say I used to play sports.

87
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,187
Right.

88
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:13,806
My name is Nan Xiaoqin, and I'm majoring in Business Administration.

89
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:15,427
My name is Qing You, and I'm majoring in Geriatric Rehabilitation—

90
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:16,907
Save the self-introduction.

91
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,006
I heard all the noise you made.

92
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:20,432
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:20,432 --> 00:10:22,352
It's fine.

94
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,580

95
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:01,886
 Where is she going?

96
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,460

97
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,550

98
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:05,452
Qing You. What are you doing?

99
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:07,568
Don't go in.

100
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:10,368
Qing You.

101
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:13,244
Qing You!

102
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,380

103
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,667
 Attention, those attending the opening ceremony,

104
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,067
 please gather and board the bus now.

105
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:19,927
Mr. Huang, is there an empty seat?

106
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,826
Old Lin, you really know how to take advantage.

107
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,427
You even want to hitch a ride on the school bus to go buy groceries.

108
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,646
The cafeteria doesn't cover travel expenses.

109
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:27,267
We are going the same way.

110
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,707
Give me a little more when you serve the food.

111
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:30,327
- Don't shake your hand. 
 - Okay.

112
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,092
Take a seat in the back.

113
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,290

114
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,620

115
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:05,104
Brother Qiang, we've all left.

116
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,027
Why do we have to take a case of beer from Yang?

117
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:10,386
Nonsense.

118
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:12,727
We went to see him, and he still hasn't paid back the money.

119
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:15,227
Elder Brother doesn't want us to make the trip in vain.

120
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:17,727
You don't understand him. Right, Brother Qiang?

121
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:20,247
You're so capable, why cower?

122
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,787
You ran faster than anyone when Yang picked up a weapon.

123
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:24,787
I've never seen you run so fast in my life, really.

124
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:26,606
No, you can't say that, Hei Er.

125
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:29,086
It's a tactical retreat.

126
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:33,566
Besides, who can run faster than Brother Qiang, right?

127
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,827
I have longer legs than both of you,

128
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:39,107
so I can always stay three steps ahead of you.

129
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:40,786
And you, keep your eyes on the road.

130
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,767
Right.

131
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:48,706
When we get the money back from Old Yang, I'll get a new phone.

132
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,310

133
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,340

134
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,630

135
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,140

136
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:54,047
 Mom. Mom!

137
00:17:55,226 --> 00:17:58,120
Hey. Hey.

138
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,636
Hey.

139
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:04,487
 Mom. Mom.

140
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:09,226
 Mom. Mom!

141
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,550

142
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,100

143
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,848
Chun Yu.

144
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,536
Where is this?

145
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:56,967
Have we met somewhere before?

146
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:01,306
You are the one who boarded the bus later.

147
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:03,387
I remember now.

148
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:06,066
You are Jianghua's students.

149
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:10,587
I think we had a car accident and went to the hospital.

150
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,772
Chun Yu.

151
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:21,047
Brother.

152
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:23,188
Are we dead?

153
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:26,252
- Does it hurt? 
 - It hurts.

154
00:23:26,252 --> 00:23:28,188
Would it still hurt if you were dead?

155
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,507
That's true.

156
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:37,466
I remember we crashed into a bus.

157
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:40,907
Is this hell?

158
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:45,066
I told you we are not dead.

159
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:49,347
Even if we die, we'll only go to heaven, not to hell.

160
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:51,704
Chun Yu.

161
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:54,727
Are we dead?

162
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:58,566
Brother Qiang. There are two young girls here.

163
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:03,287
I didn't expect we would have beauties on my way to death.

164
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:14,828
Did you also have a car accident?

165
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:25,527
We were on the bus.

166
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:28,847
Brother. They are the ones who crashed into us.

167
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,390
- Don't talk nonsense.  
 - Not us.

168
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,980
I told you we're not dead.

169
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:35,167
Who is responsible for this prank?

170
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,347
What's wrong?

171
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,688
Did you bring us here to play an escape room game?

172
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,180

173
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,407
What have you done? You!

174
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:12,220
Did you do it?

175
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,306
I just pressed the button.

176
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:17,806
You have a bad habit of touching everything

177
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:19,544
It's fine.

178
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:42,346
 You are now in a desperate situation, unable to escape.

179
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:46,167
 When I take your head, then I can escape.

180
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:47,626
 Ask for the moon.

181
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:51,627
 I have limitless selves. They are eternal and infinite.

182
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:53,726
 You can't kill all of me.

183
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:58,687
 Watch me slay demons tonight and fight until dawn.

184
00:26:01,187 --> 00:26:03,827
What did I expect? Just a few tricks.

185
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:10,706
Don't scare me.

186
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:12,016
Don't scare him.

187
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:14,067
It's just a shadow puppet show.

188
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,868
It plays tricks on you.

189
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:18,068
Then who's in the back?

190
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:19,492
I'll go check the back.

191
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:21,306
Don't go.

192
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:28,636
Brother Qiang.

193
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:32,106
There's no one back there.

194
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:03,647
Why are you here?

195
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:05,467
Who exactly are you?

196
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,126
There's no time. You can't stay here.

197
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:32,668
Chun Yu.

198
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:16,747
M-Murder!

199
00:28:16,747 --> 00:28:18,764
Murder!

200
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,227
Hei Er, Hei Er.

201
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:29,547
Hei Er!

202
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:34,932
Hei Er. Hei Er.

203
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:37,966
Hei Er.

204
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:43,210
Open the door.

205
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,100
Open the door!

206
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,507
- Open the door. 
 - Open the door.

207
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,787
Qing You, this way! Qing You!

208
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:53,056
- Open the door. 
 - Chun Yu!

209
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:00,846
Go. Go.

210
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:07,544
This way.

211
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:17,976
Hei Er. Hei Er! Hei Er.

212
00:29:25,827 --> 00:29:29,148
Brother.

213
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:23,708
Qing You.

214
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,452
Qing You.

215
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:37,947
Is Hei Er really dead?

216
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,686
I think so.

217
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:46,747
Hei Er!

218
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:48,807
Shut up and keep your voice down.

219
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,546
You'll bring in all those monsters. Are you a fool?

220
00:30:51,546 --> 00:30:55,412
No way. Dead or alive, I have to get him back today.

221
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:57,867
On your way. The back hall is full of monsters.

222
00:30:57,867 --> 00:31:00,186
If you want to die, go ahead.

223
00:31:00,186 --> 00:31:04,007
If you want me to return two corpses to your grandmother, then off you go.

224
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:07,086
But I feel terrible.

225
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:09,547
Enough.

226
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:11,026
All these things are fake.

227
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:14,546
Once you wake up, there will be nothing.

228
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,647
Is this really a dream?

229
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:20,947
Everything feels real to me.

230
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:22,984
Let me ask you.

231
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:26,417
Have you ever seen these shadow puppet monsters in real life?

232
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,507
No, right?

233
00:31:27,507 --> 00:31:31,447
Maybe Hei Er is already out there, safer than us.

234
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:33,566
Really?

235
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:36,166
Aren't you looking for Hei Er?

236
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,066
Then all you have to do is keep quiet,

237
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,524
follow me, and I'll get you out.

238
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,204
Deal?

239
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,230

240
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:16,264

241
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:18,192

242
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:25,148
There are windows over there.

243
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:28,547
We can get out.

244
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:32,827
I'm afraid you'll get stuck up there.

245
00:32:35,347 --> 00:32:37,116
We'll give it a try.

246
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:39,096
All right, let's try.

247
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:40,928
Search for a tool.

248
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:45,226
Brother, this is heavy.

249
00:32:45,226 --> 00:32:46,836
This one will do.

250
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:48,356
Move.

251
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:55,256
One more time. That's too strong. I'm trying again.

252
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,088
Go for it, Brother.

253
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,576
I'll try something else.

254
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:05,864
Why doesn't this glass break?

255
00:33:08,827 --> 00:33:10,367
What kind of glass is this?

256
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:12,520
I can't even crack it.

257
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,486
Uncle Lin, why didn't Chun Yu keep up?

258
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:18,196
There are too many passages.

259
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,124
Maybe she took a wrong turn.

260
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:22,206
Then she'll be fine, won't she?

261
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:25,046
- There are so many shadow puppets, and they're all alive. 
 - Don't worry.

262
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,807
Your classmate is very smart.

263
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:29,446
I'm sure she'll find a way out.

264
00:33:29,446 --> 00:33:31,748
I think so, too.

265
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:34,187
What is this place?

266
00:33:34,187 --> 00:33:36,067
It's pretty scary.

267
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:38,746
Don't ask me. I don't know, either.

268
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:57,572
Brother. If we keep this up, will it attract those monsters?

269
00:33:57,572 --> 00:33:59,626
If you don`t know anything, shut up.

270
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:02,606
On the way here, we didn't see any…

271
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,147
This way.

272
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,460
Run!

273
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,887
Brother Qiang. Brother Qiang!

274
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:58,404
Brother Qiang, I was wrong.

275
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,330

276
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:31,090

277
