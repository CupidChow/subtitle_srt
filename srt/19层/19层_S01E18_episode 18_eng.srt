1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

2
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:56,727

3
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,771

4
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:24,251
My dear. You're finally awake.

5
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:26,708
H-How are you feeling now?

6
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:31,067
I feel much better. Grandma, how did I get back?

7
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:34,208
You scared me.

8
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,347
Last night, two young girls brought you back.

9
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:38,248
They said you were dizzy and felt sick.

10
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:42,767
You just collapsed on the bed and fainted.

11
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:46,528
Why don't you take care of yourself?

12
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:48,927
Grandma, I want to sleep a little more.

13
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:51,608
You have to eat something.

14
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:52,928
I'll come down later.

15
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:54,427
Do not forget to come down and get something to eat.

16
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:56,307
All right, then hurry up.

17
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,788
- I'll wait for you downstairs. 
 - Okay.

18
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:02,728
Lie down over there. Lie down over there.

19
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,448
Lie down.

20
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,367
 Congratulations on passing the level.

21
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,028
Open the water tank right now!

22
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,988
 Yan Mingliang, what are you trying to do?

23
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:48,928
Wait. This is going to hurt Old Gao.

24
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:00,408
 Go over there.

25
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,200
Gao Xuan.

26
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,964
Did he come out?

27
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,988
- No. 
 - Not yet.

28
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:43,900
Gao Xuan.

29
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:47,408
Gao Xuan! Gao Xuan!

30
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,688
 Congratulations, you have leveled up.

31
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:41,547
No, we can't quit. We can't quit!

32
00:05:41,547 --> 00:05:43,847
Gao Xuan! Gao Xuan!

33
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:54,164
Gao Xuan! Gao Xuan!

34
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,468
 It's me.

35
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:10,912
Gao Xuan, I'm glad you're all right.

36
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,928
Thank you, Chun Yu.

37
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,988
You saved me.

38
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:17,367
 You've saved me many times in the past.

39
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,427
 Where are you?

40
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:23,187
When I woke up, I was in the dorm.

41
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:26,307
Someone from Tianji must have brought me back.

42
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:30,188
The more they act that way, the more we cannot give up.

43
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:32,988
There's always a way to deal with them.

44
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,228
 Xiao Yu!

45
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,088
 Come take a look at this.

46
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:40,004
Grandma is calling me. I'll talk to you later.

47
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:41,460
Okay.

48
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,008
 Tianji has indeed broken their promise.

49
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:19,267
 Who are you exactly?

50
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:22,407
 Why do you help us but refuse to reveal your identity?

51
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,687
 If you want me to keep helping you,

52
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:30,567
 you cannot reveal any information that we are communicating,

53
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,728
 otherwise, my life will be at risk.

54
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:34,908
 Try again with the server unit at Microtech.

55
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:38,488
 The Pulse Unit there must be assembled before it is used.

56
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:41,248
 Microtech and Tianji have a very close connection.

57
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:43,847
 What exactly is their relationship?

58
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:51,868
 Microtech serves as technical support for Tianji.

59
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,908
 Can I tell my friends?

60
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:01,208
 Chun Yu and the others help me a lot.

61
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,800

62
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:12,404
Grandma!

63
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:15,928
You scared me.

64
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,628
It's just a skull massaging device.

65
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:20,088
Why did you react that way?

66
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:22,508
Where did you get this?

67
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:25,528
It was delivered by a courier. He just left.

68
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,308
I thought you bought this for me.

69
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,268
Don't put it on.

70
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,164
I can't put it on?

71
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,848
 Hello! Did you receive the package?

72
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:52,608
What do you want?

73
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:56,468
This new product is perfect for a skull massage.

74
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,540
It's perfect for the elderly.

75
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:01,747
Hello?

76
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,168
Xiaoqin.

77
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:11,247
 Chun Yu, my sister received a package.

78
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:17,987
They sent a mahjong table to my house. They know everything.

79
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:20,367
They know where I live, and that my dad loves to play mahjong.

80
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,748
When my dad saw the mahjong table, he insisted on trying it.

81
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:25,488
I had no choice but to smash the table with a baseball bat.

82
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:27,247
I almost got beaten by my father.

83
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:29,968
They also gave my brother a smartwatch.

84
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:32,228
I told him to throw it away immediately.

85
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:33,427
My wife also…

86
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:34,907
This is too much.

87
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:39,208
What is he trying to do by sending us these strange things?

88
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,628
Although he didn't say anything, the message is clear.

89
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:43,948
He is warning us.

90
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,788
If we do something that's out of the norm,

91
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,638
we won't be the only ones at risk,

92
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:49,747
but our families as well.

93
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,108
What should we do?

94
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,700
All we can do is keep playing the game.

95
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:02,607
Is there any way to get out of this?

96
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:03,848
Why are you only thinking about getting out?

97
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:06,500
We still have friends in there.

98
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,088
I…

99
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,948
Why is it that Yang Bawan can say it, and I cannot?

100
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,096
All right, stop arguing.

101
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,808
Xiaoqin is right. We still have friends in there.

102
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,148
Since there's no other way out,

103
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:24,668
we must find a way to complete the level and save everyone.

104
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:28,808
However, we must be more careful when we enter the game.

105
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:31,008
We need to play and survive in the game,

106
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:34,108
and in reality, we must do everything we can

107
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:36,288
to convince Tianji we're fine with things as they are.

108
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:41,368
Exactly. We must investigate in depth for solutions.

109
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:29,248
Why?

110
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:32,256
Why didn't he come out if it was so dangerous?

111
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:36,147
Director Yan, I have a theory.

112
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:39,408
Is it possible that he's no longer in the game?

113
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:44,128
What are you saying? That he's among this group of people?

114
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:50,528
From now on, keep an eye on these guys at school.

115
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes.

116
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:44,828
 Your father is also Microtech's former chief engineer.

117
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:46,787
 These two companies are closely linked.

118
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:49,967
 Don't you think it's a little…

119
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,840
Amazing.

120
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,947
Not bad.

121
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,867
Nice.

122
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,408
This is going to take some work, isn't it?

123
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:16,627
I'll try it on Nan Xiaoqin's behalf.

124
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:19,304
Wait. Can't you read?

125
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:21,568
I'll try it for Nan Xiaoqin. See if it's comfortable.

126
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:25,288
Definitely not. Only Nan Xiaoqin should feel comfortable.

127
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:28,768
She's coming. Make way.

128
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:35,924
Xiaoqin.

129
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:39,007
Look. I made it just for you.

130
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:41,188
Now it will be easy for you to stand up and sit down.

131
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,728
And look, I installed this just for you.

132
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:45,028
Your crutch will fit right in.

133
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:46,988
Come on, try it.

134
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:49,408
I think it fits your head just right.

135
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:54,928
Oh, my!

136
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:57,248
Didn't we agree to act we're fine with things as they are?

137
00:13:57,248 --> 00:13:59,847
You're not even acting with me.

138
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:06,947
What? You are dismissed.

139
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,870

140
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,568
Is it from Yang Bawan?

141
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:09,607
What is this?

142
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:45,928
What's wrong?

143
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:31,908

144
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:39,167
 Dou Dou, hello,

145
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,927
 if I may call you so.

146
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,148
 Thank you for saving me in the game.

147
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:49,148
 I hope to continue to be teammates in the real world too,

148
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:53,268
 and achieve the same level of trust as in the game.

149
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:56,988
 I am ashamed of my childish behavior,

150
00:17:56,988 --> 00:18:01,248
 that's why I don't dare say this face to face.

151
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:05,652
 Nan Xiaoqin, I want to be your friend.

152
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:08,268
 If you're willing,

153
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:13,167
 why don't we share our secrets and innermost feelings here?

154
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:17,727
 That way, even if you scold me, nobody would hear.

155
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,927
 After all, I am an influencer.

156
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:25,188
She's so cheesy, she uses a diary.

157
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,220
♫  During this long journey  ♫

158
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,890
♫  we are half awake, half asleep  ♫

159
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,380
♫  But luckily, no matter how difficult the road gets  ♫

160
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,968
 Don't you think, that in the game,

161
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:48,388
 we've been teammates through thick and thin?

162
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:51,148
 That means we're also friends!

163
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,687
 Everything's been fine lately.

164
00:18:54,687 --> 00:18:58,227
 It's just that Yang Bawan is so annoying.

165
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,030

166
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:16,568
♫  Happy birthday to you   ♫

167
00:20:16,568 --> 00:20:25,448
♫  Happy birthday to you! Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday!  ♫

168
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:31,248
♫  Happy birthday to you!  ♫

169
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:45,127
May 17th, is my birthday.

170
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:47,547
♫  Happy birthday to you!  ♫

171
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:51,407
 It was my daughter's first birthday present.

172
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:56,848
 From now on, it's all about Chun Yu.

173
00:20:56,848 --> 00:21:01,828
♫  Happy birthday to you   ♫

174
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:04,648
 Dad, happy birthday!

175
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:06,868
 From now on, you’ll write all your secrets in here,

176
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,987
 and no one will know.

177
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:13,688
 Thank you.

178
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:17,308
 You are my good daughter.

179
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:18,488
 Thank you, my wife.

180
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:20,148
 Put it away and blow out the candles.

181
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:23,808
 One, two, three.

182
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:37,827
 May 18th.

183
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:42,847
 Today, my daughter found a game box in the old cabinet.

184
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:44,108
 It was a Klotski (a sliding block puzzle).

185
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:46,388
 Dad, what is this?

186
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,747
 I explained the rules to her

187
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:51,568
 and she solved it in less than 20 seconds,

188
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:54,088
 with efficient and clear steps.

189
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:56,667
 Her talent surprised me.

190
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,588
 I didn't expect my daughter to be a genius.

191
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:03,907
I must guide her to be an outstanding person.

192
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:10,768
April 2nd. Today our family went for a picnic.

193
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:13,107
 Chun Yu insisted on playing hide-and-seek,

194
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:15,927
 which caused her to trip and fall.

195
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:18,428
 I was very worried.

196
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:38,827
 May 5th. Today I played blocks with my daughter.

197
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:41,207
  She ran into an obstacle,

198
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:44,628
 and almost gave up.

199
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:46,307
 My dear daughter,

200
00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:48,708
 you must be patient when doing things,

201
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:51,188
 and never give up.

202
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:53,908
 This is the message I want to tell Chun Yu.

203
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,388
 Maybe she already understands.

204
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:59,552
 Maybe she doesn't fully understand this yet.

205
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:02,988
 But it's okay, there's still time.

206
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:06,907
 I will be growing up with you, right by your side.

207
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:09,888
Liar.

208
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:29,987
 April 19th, Jiangning.

209
00:23:29,987 --> 00:23:32,368
 I hope this place full of memories

210
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:35,707
 could be the realization of our dreams.

211
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,948
 If I could go back in time,

212
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:41,747
 I would wish I had never made that decision.

213
00:23:41,747 --> 00:23:43,007
 Why did it have to be like this?

214
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:44,928
 Can you give me one more chance?

215
00:23:44,928 --> 00:23:47,647
 I wish I could go back to this day.

216
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:52,247
 Can I start all over again?

217
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:53,908
 I don’t think I can start again.

218
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:56,428
 There is no turning back now.

219
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,167
 Well, you're just plain crazy.

220
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:26,027
 I don't know why you're dating a cripple.

221
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:27,848
Yang Bawan is hitting someone!

222
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:29,368
- Don't you dare repeat it. 
 - So what?

223
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,968
Take a video of him!

224
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,887
He only said you don't understand Nan Xiaoqin.

225
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:37,348
Let's go. Stop filming.

226
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,367
What do you know?

227
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:53,288
If it was Dou Dou, would you even think of trying to help her?

228
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:56,888
Are you guys still here?

229
00:24:56,888 --> 00:24:58,856
Leave.

230
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,428
Yang Bawan,

231
00:25:05,428 --> 00:25:07,708
do you know why Nan Xiaoqin is angry?

232
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:11,848
You are treating her and Dou Dou differently.

233
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:15,728
When you start to treat Nan Xiaoqin normally,

234
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:18,547
then you can pursue her.

235
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:26,007
I am… I am really stupid.

236
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:28,547
What did she say?

237
00:25:28,547 --> 00:25:31,447
It's none of your business.

238
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,968
Let me tell you something.

239
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,148
Just take your stuff and go.

240
00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:53,708
Actually, this is a technical feature of programming languages, enhancing safety.

241
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:54,928
Okay, thank you, Senior Brother.

242
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,988
You're welcome.

243
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,148
- Goodbye, Senior Brother. 
 - Goodbye.

244
00:25:57,148 --> 00:25:59,728
- Goodbye, Sir. 
 - Okay, goodbye.

245
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,668
 I found someone following us.

246
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:47,127
 I think someone's watching me, too.

247
00:26:58,488 --> 00:26:59,787
 Anyway, be careful.

248
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:02,687
 Try to behave normally and do not act rashly.

249
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,468
 Okay.

250
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:07,588
 Got it.

251
00:27:07,588 --> 00:27:09,312
 Okay.

252
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:29,150

253
00:27:29,796 --> 00:27:31,620
I'm coming.

254
00:27:34,244 --> 00:27:35,868
Hello, Senior Brother.

255
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:38,064
Nian Sulan, why are you here?

256
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:41,467
Did you forget? The Dean asked you to check my thesis.

257
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:44,128
I believe so.

258
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:47,868
Can we talk inside?

259
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:50,680
Well…

260
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:54,008
I asked a lot of people to find your home address.

261
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,968
It's really hard to find.

262
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,210

263
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,870

264
00:29:22,248 --> 00:29:24,148
Are you looking for Gao Xuan?

265
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:26,948
He didn't tell me you were coming.

266
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:29,328
Don't stand there, come in.

267
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:34,948
He's in the restroom.

268
00:29:34,948 --> 00:29:37,027
He's been having stomach issues lately.

269
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:39,987
Don't you see I bought him those nutritional products?

270
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,648
Are those honey or green tea?

271
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,608
What do you mean? I bought all of them.

272
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:52,728
The sugar in honey causes overproduction of stomach acid,

273
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:54,108
which will increase the burden of the stomach.

274
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:56,408
Theophylline can irritate the stomach lining,

275
00:29:56,408 --> 00:30:00,008
causing stomachache, bloating, acid reflux and other problems.

276
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:02,808
Is that so?

277
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:06,927
Chun Yu, why are you here?

278
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:08,528
I guess I came at a bad time.

279
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:09,728
Of course not.

280
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:12,587
Senior Brother is giving me advice on my thesis.

281
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:16,328
Senior Brother, why don't you take care of Chun Yu's matter first?

282
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,172
We can talk later.

283
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:23,027
Let's go somewhere else.

284
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,084
Come in.

285
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:32,816
Come in.

286
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:36,668
We were really just discussing the thesis.

287
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,556
I know.

288
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:45,847
This is…

289
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:48,008
I found it in Chun Yiming's laptop.

290
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:50,347
Did the people from Tianji…

291
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:52,188
No one's following me.

292
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:54,867
The contents inside…

293
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:56,668
It has a password.

294
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:01,348
This shows how important I am at this time.

295
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:25,567
It's an eight-digit password.

296
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,167
Decoding may take some time.

297
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,220
 Senior Brother!

298
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,020

299
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,610

300
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,470

301
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:26,756
What's inside?

302
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,084
It failed to decode.

303
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:30,468
I'll try another software.

304
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:32,184
There is no need.

305
00:32:34,372 --> 00:32:35,868
Well…

306
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:38,808
Nian Sulan is Nian Yongcheng's daughter.

307
00:32:38,808 --> 00:32:41,048
There's really nothing between her and me.

308
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:46,768
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

309
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:48,988
In fact, these days,

310
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:53,507
I've been thinking if Uncle Chun is related to this game.

311
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:55,608
Maybe you could call him

312
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:57,847
- or send him a message. 
 - Wait.

313
00:32:57,847 --> 00:32:59,308
I haven't contacted him for a long time.

314
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:01,048
I won't contact him in the future, either.

315
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:03,048
About your mom…

316
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,780
Chun Yu,

317
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,947
some things you can't erase, like blood ties,

318
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:16,147
but other things can be erased, like the past.

319
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:19,148
There are some things you just can't get over.

320
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:24,856
Chun Yu.

321
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:30,027
- Chun Yu! 
 - Senior Brother!

322
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:34,448
What's wrong with her?

323
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,568
Is it because of me?

324
00:33:36,568 --> 00:33:38,268
Maybe I should explain it to her.

325
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:41,027
It's okay, there is no need.

326
00:33:41,027 --> 00:33:43,347
Let's get back to the thesis.

327
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:46,728
Let's talk about it some other day.

328
00:33:47,364 --> 00:33:48,952
Okay.

329
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:52,648
Senior Brother, you look tired.

330
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:56,204
Take care and rest. We can meet another day.

331
00:33:56,204 --> 00:33:57,884
Nian Sulan.

332
00:33:58,547 --> 00:33:59,888
It's not convenient to meet here.

333
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:02,427
If you want to discuss the thesis, come to my office.

334
00:34:02,427 --> 00:34:04,152
Okay.

335
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:37,388
 Hello, Chun Yu.

336
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:40,327
 Maybe I should try to decode the SD card again.

337
00:34:41,092 --> 00:34:42,848
It's not necessary.

338
00:34:47,507 --> 00:34:52,168
Some things do take time to resolve.

339
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:53,808
 I shouldn't have said that.

340
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:57,227
It's fine, really.

341
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,448
Well…

342
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:04,988
if the password is eight digits, the numbers may include a date.

343
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,160

344
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,987
 April 19th.

345
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:32,732
 A birthday?

346
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:35,047
 Yes, a birthday.

347
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:37,100

348
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:45,636
 The child is unimportant, and I am even less important, right?

349
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,020

350
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,850

351
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,000

352
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,460

353
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,830

354
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,260

355
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,580

356
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:23,490

357
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:27,932
♫  I go from running  ♫

358
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:31,556
♫  To flying  ♫

359
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:35,414
♫  Through setbacks and hardship  ♫

360
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:38,872
♫  So what?  ♫

361
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:42,656
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

362
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:46,257
♫  It shines on my face  ♫

363
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:49,800
♫  Unwilling to lose hope  ♫

364
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,295
♫  I only want to bloom  ♫

365
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:58,420
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

366
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,036
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

367
00:38:02,036 --> 00:38:07,331
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

368
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:13,184
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

369
00:38:13,184 --> 00:38:17,016
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

370
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:22,100
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

371
00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:25,289
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

372
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:28,968
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

373
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:31,796
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

374
00:38:31,796 --> 00:38:34,420
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

375
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,112
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

376
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,976
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

377
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:43,656
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

378
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:46,452
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

379
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:52,508
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

380
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:12,340
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

381
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,764
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫
