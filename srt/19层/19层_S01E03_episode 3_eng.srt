1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,110

2
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:56,644

3
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:59,684

4
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:58,265

5
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,660

6
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,550

7
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:12,628
 Is Director Liu still in the hospital?

8
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:14,489
 Are the students from yesterday's accident awake?

9
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,169
 Director Liu and I are at the hospital.

10
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:18,169
 We're here to pick up the students.

11
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,456
 There are two girls still in a coma.

12
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:33,168
Qing You.

13
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:39,264
Chun Yu. Chun Yu.

14
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:42,568
I had a nightmare.

15
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,620
It's okay.

16
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,589
It's already broad daylight.

17
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:50,688
But that nightmare was so scary.

18
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:52,949
I dreamed of a haunted building,

19
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,489
where the shadow puppets came to life and tried to kill us.

20
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:01,069
Do you remember anything odd about the building?

21
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,069
I don't know.

22
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,612
However…

23
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:09,929
However, it looked familiar.

24
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,629
 Is this the legendary building?

25
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,668
I-I remember now.

26
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:22,689
It's Building 19 on our college campus.

27
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:40,408
Don't move. I'll call the doctor.

28
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,049
Doctor! My classmate's head is bleeding.

29
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,388
Please come and take a look.

30
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:48,308
 Okay, please wait, the doctor is coming.

31
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,540

32
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:58,564
Are you looking for Chun Yu?

33
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:00,569
She is in room 303.

34
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,589
Thank you.

35
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,220
You're welcome.

36
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,380

37
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,360

38
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:04,952
Dr. Jia.

39
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:09,168
The appointment is scheduled for tomorrow,

40
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:11,949
but I've made some changes. We can examine you today.

41
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,509
Thank you, Dr. Jia.

42
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:15,368
No problem.

43
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,589
You just said

44
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:19,808
that we were both in a coma for a day due to the concussion from the car crash.

45
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:21,129
It's a mild concussion,

46
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:22,509
so it is normal to be in a coma for a day.

47
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,988
Don't be anxious.

48
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:28,468
Now, does a concussion cause two people to have the same dream?

49
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:36,352
What exactly do you mean?

50
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:41,720
Nothing.

51
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,209
You both have minor brain injuries,

52
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,829
and it's normal to experience some symptoms.

53
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,849
But do let me know if anything strange happens.

54
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,849
Don't overthink it.

55
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:01,489
Chun Yu, you said two people had the same dream.

56
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:03,460
What does that mean?

57
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,980

58
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,029
This patient died so suddenly.

59
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,169
That's right.

60
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,829
I heard he was fine last night, but he simply didn't make it.

61
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,689
 Did you also have a car accident?

62
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,668
 We were on the bus.

63
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:29,808
 - They are the ones who crashed into us. 
 - Don't talk nonsense.

64
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,768
 - Not us. 
 - I told you we're not dead.

65
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:41,049
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is turned off.

66
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,548
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is turned off.

67
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:49,188
Brother, he turned off his phone.

68
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:51,889
Wh-What should we do?

69
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,428
Did something bad happen to Hei Er?

70
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:56,629
Impossible. The three of us came in together.

71
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:59,329
If something bad happened to him, they would surely tell us.

72
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:01,429
I still feel something is wrong.

73
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:04,249
We had the same dream

74
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:05,589
and somehow Hei Er died in it.

75
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,029
Then we woke up and couldn't find him.

76
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,268
Do you think he…

77
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:16,668
What do you think happened?

78
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,428
Maybe it wasn't just a dream

79
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:21,928
but reality.

80
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,788
A‘Yong.

81
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,128
Are you saying

82
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:57,708
all the shadow puppet monsters we met were real?

83
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:02,369
What should we do, brother?

84
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:07,128
How about I get you a new brain?

85
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:12,588
Have you lost your mind in the car accident?

86
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:13,969
You only think nonsense.

87
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:16,080
Are you eating or not?

88
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,229
I've had enough of you.

89
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:23,869
You should make good use of your wise brain.

90
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:26,688
How could this possibly not be a dream?

91
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:28,788
We were on this hospital bed before,

92
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:31,449
and we still woke up on the same bed.

93
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,020
Right?

94
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:35,444
Eat your meal.

95
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,249
But Hei Er is not on the hospital bed.

96
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:45,288
No way. I have to find him.

97
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:47,072
What are you doing?

98
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:52,796
A‘Yong!

99
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:08,496
A‘Yong!

100
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,772
A‘Yong!

101
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,208
A‘Yong, that’s enough.

102
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,444
A‘Yong.

103
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,748
A‘Yong.

104
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,989
You don't even listen to me now, do you?

105
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:27,708
Please calm down.

106
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,349
Trust me. Hei Er is absolutely fine.

107
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:34,948
I think this is all a prank from start to finish, like an escape room.

108
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,109
Maybe Hei Er is also involved.

109
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:38,469
Think about it.

110
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:42,412
Hei Er used to scare us with such tricks.

111
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:45,049
- Really? 
 - Of course.

112
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:49,809
No way. Hei Er would never turn off his phone.

113
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,568
If he does, something must be wrong.

114
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:52,989
Then use your brain and think about it.

115
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:55,309
That group of people we met yesterday was strange.

116
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:59,049
Think of the girl with the poker face.

117
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:01,289
 Trade yours for mine.

118
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,309
 Fine.

119
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,749
She's a ruthless person of few words.

120
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:07,069
And that smiley boy.

121
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,549
 As expected.

122
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:13,049
He didn't panic as if he had everything under control.

123
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,612
Those people are definitely not real.

124
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,689
Stop thinking about it. Trust me, Hei Er is fine.

125
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:22,068
Go back to the ward, silly boy.

126
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,800
What's wrong with you now?

127
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,180
They are real people.

128
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,788
What should we do?

129
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:47,668
We both had the same nightmare.

130
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,400
I think...

131
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,369
this may not be a dream at all.

132
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:02,788
D-Do you mean this is all real?

133
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,189
No way.

134
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:09,788
We woke up in the hospital, not in Building 19.

135
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,668
Did…

136
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:14,568
Did someone get us out in the middle of the night?

137
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:17,588
But that doesn't make sense, Chun Yu.

138
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:21,588
Qing You, I finally found you.

139
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:22,948
Mom, why are you here?

140
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:24,429
I left to get you breakfast.

141
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,229
When I came back, the nurse said you were both awake,

142
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:30,529
but I didn't see you. I was so worried.

143
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:32,329
Wh-Why do you…

144
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:34,149
Yesterday it was fine. How did you get the wound on your head?

145
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,309
Mom, stay still.

146
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,649
It began to bleed this morning. The doctor has checked it.

147
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,976
- I'm waiting here for a CT scan. 
 - Let me see.

148
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:41,929
I'm waiting for the CT scan, Mom. Don't look.

149
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,609
It's bleeding, let me see.

150
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:44,809
Mom, don't move.

151
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:45,824
You…

152
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,649
I'm not a kid anymore.

153
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:48,869
There are others here.

154
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,029
Auntie.

155
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:53,548
Chun Yu is also awake.

156
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:55,848
Why are you alone?

157
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:58,309
Didn't the school notify your family?

158
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,309
The teacher asked me for their phone number,

159
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,389
but I didn't want them to call my grandma.

160
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,524
What about your dad?

161
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:06,688
Mom.

162
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:08,908
Why are you two alone here?

163
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:10,708
What about the other people?

164
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,428
What others people?

165
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,848
Wasn't it a two-car accident?

166
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:18,289
The nurse told me many people were hospitalized.

167
00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:34,309
 I wonder if I could take a look at your map.

168
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,349
 Hei Er wouldn't be…

169
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:46,668
Bed 12.

170
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:50,009
You're still sick. Why are you running around?

171
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:52,809
Nurse, besides Ward 03,

172
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,009
where are the other people who were involved in that car accident yesterday?

173
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,049
In…

174
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:00,729
Miss, claims should be pursued through proper channels,

175
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:02,348
so don't act recklessly.

176
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:03,740
You misunderstood me.

177
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,828
I just want to check on my classmates.

178
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:08,089
You only have one classmate on bed 11.

179
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:09,289
The others have only minor injuries.

180
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:12,009
The school sent someone to pick everyone up.

181
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,069
You'd better stay a few more days for observation.

182
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:16,229
I really can't stay any longer, Doctor.

183
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:18,109
Look at me, I'm fine, right?

184
00:15:18,109 --> 00:15:21,109
Also, school has just started the new semester...

185
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:23,489
-  It's him.  
 - The cafeteria gets several calls a day.

186
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,149
I have to go back today.

187
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,449
Please, Doctor.

188
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,989
Okay then,

189
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,929
but remember to come back for regular checkups.

190
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:34,848
Thank you.

191
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:37,536
Thank you, Doctor.

192
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:43,388
It's you.

193
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:48,769
Do we know each other?

194
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:53,009
Didn't we ride the bus together?

195
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:56,529
Then we got into the car accident.

196
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,728
So you do remember me?

197
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:01,289
Uncle, you have a good memory.

198
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:03,928
You and another girl got hurt rather badly yesterday.

199
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:07,169
I saw you both being rushed in for emergency treatment,

200
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:09,769
so I remember both of you a little better.

201
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,369
Besides the hospital and the school bus,

202
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,708
have we met anywhere else?

203
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:18,552
It seems like…

204
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:22,269
No, not really.

205
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:27,029
A call from the manager.

206
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,504
Hello.

207
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:31,428
I will be released immediately,

208
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:32,940
and I will be there tonight for sure.

209
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,592
Don't worry.

210
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:42,469
 His leg isn't hurt.

211
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,896
Bed 12, time for the IV.

212
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:53,389
Based on what you said, if everything is a dream,

213
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:56,269
your friend should be fine.

214
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,308
That makes some sense.

215
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:03,749
Wait. Are you stupid?

216
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,129
Listen, you brat.

217
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:08,669
Stop pretending.

218
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:11,469
Neither of us has ever met you.

219
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:14,089
Why should I dream of you at night?

220
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,949
You've been doing this all along.

221
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:19,068
Does my brother owe you money?

222
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:22,668
So Hei Er owes someone money?

223
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:25,169
I am the one asking a question.

224
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,304
I'm warning you.

225
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:29,669
I grew up with a reputation for being a jerk.

226
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,348
Tell me. Where is Hei Er?

227
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,628
Where exactly is he?

228
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:45,496
The mortuary.

229
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,396
Over here.

230
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,749
Are you sure you saw my younger brother, Hei Er?

231
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:10,648
Does Hei Er have a long scar on his right arm?

232
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,140

233
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,784
Over here.

234
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,160

235
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,569
What are the three of you doing?

236
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:35,492
Stay still.

237
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:37,989
I saw you come in a while ago.

238
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:40,468
Why are you sneaking around?

239
00:18:40,468 --> 00:18:41,628
You look like a bad guy.

240
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:43,728
No, we are good people.

241
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,509
I have a friend who's missing,

242
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:47,609
so we wanted to go in and take a look.

243
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,788
Is your friend missing?

244
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:50,028
Then why don't you go to the police

245
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,168
instead of coming to the mortuary?

246
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:55,669
There are too many of them.

247
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:56,789
We can't get in.

248
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:58,968
Let's think of another way.

249
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,120
Here.

250
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:11,009
Your younger brother has recovered and left the hospital.

251
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:15,668
He checked out at around 8:00 this morning.

252
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:19,900
Look at this signature.

253
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,400
- It looks like Hei Er's. 
 - Yes, it is Hei Er's.

254
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,420
The patient's hospital bills are all paid,

255
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,540
and he signed it himself.

256
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,469
As for the patient's whereabouts after leaving the hospital

257
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,169
and why his phone isn't working,

258
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,149
these are things beyond the hospital's control.

259
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:38,349
After all, he is an adult, right?

260
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,728
Right.

261
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:44,089
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me directly.

262
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:49,029
Do not wander around the hospital, especially the mortuary.

263
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,328
I hope it won't happen again.

264
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,829
- Right, it's… 
 - I'm sorry, Director Chen.

265
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:57,068
Today, we made a mistake and acted recklessly. I'm sorry.

266
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:58,909
If there's nothing else, we'll be on our way.

267
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:00,049
- Goodbye. 
 - Okay.

268
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:01,448
Let's go.

269
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:03,188
Thank you, Director Chen.

270
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:14,789
He's the one who didn't understand,

271
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:17,369
so he made it look like we both did something wrong

272
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:18,748
and ended up being reprimanded.

273
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:21,568
But I'm relieved that Hei Er is okay.

274
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:23,700
Now I won't feel guilty in front of grandma.

275
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,200
It looks like we really did dream last night.

276
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,604
Brother,

277
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,330
if you know something, don't keep it to yourself. Just say it.

278
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,800
Right?

279
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,929
Last night, it wasn't a dream.

280
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:58,509
Last night I was also in that building.

281
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:13,649
I don't know what's going on.

282
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:18,109
Find your friend Hei Er, and maybe we'll have all the answers.

283
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,220
 Hei Er!

284
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,329
 Are we dead?

285
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,600
 Is this hell?

286
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 I'm a little scared.

287
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:32,952
 Qing You!

288
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,569
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is turned off.

289
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:14,468
Nurse, hasn't the patient in bed 11 come back yet?

290
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:17,088
Isn't she your classmate? Just call her.

291
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,040
Thank you.

292
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:23,369
Where are you going?

293
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,936

294
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,429
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is turned off.

295
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,809
 Please dial again later.

296
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:48,000
 Where are you?

297
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:57,952
Chun Yu!

298
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,629
Where did you go? You didn't answer my phone calls.

299
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:04,589
My mom was in a hurry, so she left,

300
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:06,668
and then I fell asleep waiting for the CT scan.

301
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:09,509
I muted my phone, so I didn't see the messages.

302
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:10,709
A CT scan?

303
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:13,200
I didn't see you in the CT room either.

304
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,800
Dr. Jia took me into his office for a while.

305
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,640
It's getting late. You should get some rest.

306
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,749
Okay.

307
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,624
Thank you, Dr. Jia.

308
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,350
 Her roommate has a negative reaction. It's been taken care of.

309
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,870

310
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,092

311
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:06,229
Come on, hurry up. Let's drink.

312
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,780
Hey!

313
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:24,008
Brother.

314
00:24:24,008 --> 00:24:25,988
I'm still worried about Hei Er.

315
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:29,068
Do you think something bad happened to him?

316
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,529
What could happen to him?

317
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:32,829
Listen to me, A'Yong.

318
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:36,348
Let's get drunk today.

319
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:40,509
Maybe Hei Er will be here when we wake up. Right?

320
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:42,468
Come on.

321
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:44,084
Let's drink.

322
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:49,820
Come on.

323
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:56,796
Are you drinking or not?

324
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,996
If you don't drink, I will.

325
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,129
Why are you drinking?

326
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:08,609
Alcohol is not allowed in the ward.

327
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:10,709
Do you want to be kicked out?

328
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:14,648
If you want to be released, you must first recover.

329
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,404
Rest early.

330
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:40,528
Isn't this Hei Er's phone?

331
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,448
Well, A’Yong.

332
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:09,516
A’Yong.

333
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:12,369
I think you should be prepared.

334
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:16,416
Hei Er…

335
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,310
Hey.

336
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:27,164
A’Yong.

337
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,456
This wine is pretty strong.

338
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:21,148
 Why are you suddenly interested in studying the brain and dreams?

339
00:27:21,148 --> 00:27:23,329
 Last night, I had a dream.

340
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:25,089
 There were shadow puppet monsters that attacked people.

341
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:28,048
 The fight and the sensory experience were very realistic.

342
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:29,649
 And the people I met there…

343
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,129
 I can't believe I actually met them in the real world.

344
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:34,369
 I don't think it was a dream.

345
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:38,309
 Do you think we can take a group of people to another dimension

346
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,569
 with the technology we have now?

347
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:53,388
Wh-Why are you here again?

348
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,460
Well…

349
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,169
Why does this dream keep coming back?

350
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:03,509
Well… Is this still a dream?

351
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,208
Does it hurt?

352
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,956
It hurts!

353
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:14,129
Chun Yu, this can't be real, right?

354
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,088
- Hei Er. 
 - A’Yong.

355
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,329
Hei Er! Why is Hei Er missing?

356
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:22,688
So are the shadow puppet monsters.

357
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:25,729
I insist on my point of view from yesterday.

358
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:28,809
I think Hei Er might be involved.

359
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,852
I don't believe it.

360
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,569
No matter how much Hei Er likes pranks, he couldn't have gone this far.

361
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:35,709
Then let me ask you.

362
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:38,909
Did you find him after he was released from the hospital yesterday?

363
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:41,628
That's a lot of work.

364
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:43,728
It's definitely not a prank.

365
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,848
So this was all planned and orchestrated.

366
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:49,588
Hei Er may have been killed.

367
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:52,708
Brother, if they are right…

368
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,289
Don't listen to him. Listen to me.

369
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:56,328
Hei Er is definitely fine.

370
00:30:03,532 --> 00:30:07,369
Be careful. Who knows what might pop up.

371
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:18,248
This leg…

372
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:20,609
This leg was fine during the day.

373
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,488
Why is it injured now?

374
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,709
Is this really a dream?

375
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:28,649
Well, I'm leaning more toward the first option.

376
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:32,649
This place is parallel to our daytime but has its own rules.

377
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:41,148
 Please come to the pillar and pick an identity tag.

378
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,989
Why do we have tags now?

379
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:05,749
Okay then.

380
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:07,728
Let's see what tricks you can pull off.

381
00:31:07,728 --> 00:31:09,468
The character "Mo." 
  (Middle-aged character in Chinese Opera)

382
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,068
What does this mean?

383
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:17,228
Maybe getting out of here is about our identity tags.

384
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:19,108
Tell me. What do you hold in your hands?

385
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:20,148
What's yours?

386
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:21,348
I have "Sheng." 
   (Male Lead in Chinese Opera)

387
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:23,740
I have "Jing." 
   (Special Male Character in Chinese Opera)

388
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,388
Sheng, Mo, Jing.

389
00:31:26,388 --> 00:31:28,568
Maybe it is related to traditional opera.

390
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:31,209
Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, Chou.

391
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:33,728
I know it, too.

392
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,189
Chun Yu.

393
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:37,568
Why is your tag blank?

394
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:39,269
A blank tag means death.

395
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:41,688
You! What are you saying?

396
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:43,329
A’Yong, what's yours?

397
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:45,176
Mine is…

398
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:50,309
All of us answered. Why don't you tell us?

399
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,309
- Did I ask you? 
 - You!

400
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,788
Did I beg you? You volunteered.

401
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,348
No fighting. Let's discuss things peacefully.

402
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:59,988
 Your target is released in the hall.

403
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:01,989
 The game begins.

404
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:06,309
What does it mean?

405
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:07,848
Has it begun?

406
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:10,029
How? How do we get out?

407
00:32:22,728 --> 00:32:24,749
It looks like the Nian Beast 
  (Human eating beast in Chinese Mythology)

408
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:28,448
Well…

409
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:33,528
Well… Aren't all shadow puppet monsters afraid of light?

410
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:36,732
Shadow puppet monsters are afraid of light,

411
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:38,648
but the Nian beast may not be.

412
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:41,089
Light might not work on it.

413
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:44,289
Let's stay calm and see what it would do.

414
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:46,488
Be careful, you’re a skip runner.

415
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,449
It's moving.

416
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:52,948
Chun Yu, I'm scared.

417
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:13,149
This might be the singing tune of Dan role. 
   (Female Lead in Chinese Opera)

418
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,830

419
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:32,089
Open the door!

420
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:33,884
Lets try another door.

421
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:41,188
A’Yong.

422
00:34:41,188 --> 00:34:42,304
Brother Qiang.

423
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,289
The Nian beast seems to only chase after Brother Qiang.

424
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:56,952
Indeed.

425
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:05,508
Brother, why is it only chasing after you?

426
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:07,368
How would I know?

427
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:11,248
Brother, run!

428
00:35:20,992 --> 00:35:24,230
I think it broadcasts the singing tune of Dan Role.

429
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,620

430
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,510

431
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,770

432
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,028
Run, brother!

433
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:52,268
A’Yong, let's go.

434
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:55,189
Go. Switch it.

435
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:20,869
It looks like it will hunt only the player with the identity tag

436
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:22,528
that matches the tune.

437
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:25,524
Indeed.

438
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:29,948
Brother, do something.

439
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:32,288
A’Yong, hang on.

440
00:36:32,288 --> 00:36:34,388
I'll get someone to save you.

441
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:36,160
A’Yong.

442
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,348
- Brother. 
 - What are you here for?

443
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:39,569
I'm begging you. We're a team.

444
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,249
Do something to save my brother.

445
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:42,509
We're not on the same team.

446
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:44,628
Yesterday, he tried to kill me with an axe.

447
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:47,408
- Brother, save me. 
 - A’Yong.

448
00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:51,108
Yesterday I was wrong, but it has nothing to do with my brother A'Yong.

449
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:53,709
He didn't do anything wrong!

450
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,300
A’Yong.

451
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,949
Brother Qiang, save me.

452
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,289
You can just switch the tags yourself.

453
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,368
I'm begging you, brother.

454
00:37:01,368 --> 00:37:02,729
Please save my brother.

455
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:04,208
You!

456
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,680
 Looking at me.

457
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,148
It's the singing tune of the Chou role. 
   (Clown character in Chinese Opera)

458
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:14,748
It looks like the singing tune keeps changing.

459
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:16,336
Chou.

460
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:20,488
It…

461
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,529
Please save me.

462
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:25,408
It's coming. Do something.

463
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:28,709
Then promise me to work with everyone from now on.

464
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:30,769
I promise you. I'll do whatever you say.

465
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:32,408
Take this.

466
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,124
Where's Chun Yu?

467
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,889
What is Chun Yu up to now?

468
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,269
Why do you care?

469
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:56,689
Can she even open the door? Impossible.

470
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:58,749
She has her reasons. You know nothing.

471
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:00,849
There's no damn reason.

472
00:38:05,188 --> 00:38:06,872
Switch the tag!

473
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,940

474
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,780

475
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,180

476
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:54,960

477

00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:58,492
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

504
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:02,480
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

505
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,800
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

506
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:10,821
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

507
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:14,452
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

508
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:17,268
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

509
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:19,796
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

510
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:22,548
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

511
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:25,480
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

512
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,092
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

513
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:32,078
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

514
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:38,716
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫
