1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:10,030

2
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,704

3
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:59,716

4
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,289
 The alternate dimension I entered last time turned out to be a game.

5
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,390
 Today, the gaming company invited us to sign a contract,

6
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,190
 but did not explain how we entered the game without helmets.

7
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,570
 I've also checked. There's no chip in my brain.

8
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,050
 What do you think the principle could be?

9
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,869
 It must be some kind of brainwave interference.

10
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:55,610
 Are you sure there's no chip?

11
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,190
 Ιs the game you mentioned 19th Floor?

12
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,090
 How did you know about it?

13
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,996
 What else do you know?

14
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,729
 The 19th Floor game is about to begin.

15
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,672

16
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,449
 No, I have to go save Dou Dou.

17
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:46,270
Great to see you again.

18
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:52,390
Well, I-I-I am just too happy.

19
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,389
Dou Dou, listen to me. This game is very dangerous.

20
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,450
If you die in the game, you will fall into a coma in the real world,

21
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,570
so you have to walk behind me later.

22
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,270
Who told you that?

23
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:07,309
Brother Qiang told me. You all knew, didn't you?

24
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:09,148
And yet you didn't tell me.

25
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,330
I lied to him.

26
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,310
I've found Hei Er, and A'Yong will soon recover.

27
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,810
How can it be dangerous? Nonsense.

28
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,450
Wait… Why did you lie to me?

29
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,809
Why did I lie?

30
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:24,909
It's your dad's fault. He's so fierce.

31
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:27,509
Your dad hasn't repaid his debts, and he even beats me.

32
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,969
If I hadn't lied to you, would you have helped me?

33
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,930
You are going too far, lying to me like that.

34
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,930
You scared me to death.

35
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,209
And by the way, why do you always wear a mask?

36
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:49,270
Is it because you're afraid we'll recognize you?

37
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,549
You didn't lock us up last time, did you?

38
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,450
 By the way, I saw a great game recently.

39
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,650
 It was a VR game, quite well-made.

40
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,090
 You should try it sometime if you get the chance.

41
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,289
 Wearing it can make you fly. Watch out.

42
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,980

43
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,864

44
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,320

45
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,350
 Looks like the injury from last game

46
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,609
 -  didn't carry over to this one. 
 - Who is it?

47
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,570
 It's you guys again.

48
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,670
There's nothing to explain.

49
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,030
Believe it or not, I didn't lock the door.

50
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,690
Besides, this is the game world.

51
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,230
Whether I wear a mask or not is none of your business.

52
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,290
Dou Dou. Dou Dou.

53
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,310
Dou Dou, don't be angry, don't…

54
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,990
What are you saying? She saved us.

55
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,070
Why would we still doubt her? Why?

56
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,509
Why are you yelling at us?

57
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,649
Who knows what difficulties lie ahead?

58
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:19,824

59
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:49,128

60
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,440
Uncle Lin, Qing You, let's go in and take a look.

61
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,608
Let's go, Miss.

62
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,896

63
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:14,250
Let's see what tools we can use.

64
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,630
Dou Dou! Wait for me, Dou Dou!

65
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,590
Dou Dou, wait for me!

66
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,950
Why do you keep following me? Aren't you afraid I'll hurt you?

67
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,069
No, you're my hero.

68
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:57,830
It's heroine, not hero.

69
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,268
He-He… What?

70
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:02,549
Whatever, you weakling. Don't follow me.

71
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,712
You'll hold me back.

72
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:15,050
 You all can fight if you want. I'll hide and wait until you're done.

73
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:12,050
Dou Dou, may I ask you a question?

74
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,652
Speak.

75
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:15,076
Are you from our school?

76
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:16,500
No.

77
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,670
I didn't mention which school, and you already know you're not?

78
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,410
No matter which school I'm from,

79
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,269
I don't want to know you in real life.

80
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,930
Don't ask me my name. I won't tell you.

81
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,169
Uncle Lin, take this.

82
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,048
Okay.

83
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,448
Go to the second floor.

84
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,150
Go.

85
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,028
No, wait.

86
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,350
Why is he wearing my clothes?

87
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,389
They are exactly like us.

88
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,852
That seems to be—

89
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,230
They are conscious.

90
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,930
Uncle Lin, take them and go. Hurry!

91
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,329
- Follow me, Qing You! 
 - I won't go.

92
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:16,730
Go! Hurry!

93
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,152
Quick!

94
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,404
Now!

95
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,596
Run, Dou Dou.

96
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,589
Go this way. Come on.

97
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,530
Chun Yu. Chun Yu.

98
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,750
- Chun Yu, I want to help you. 
 - Chun Yu, open the door.

99
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,789
- Chun Yu. 
 - Chun Yu.

100
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,340
Go.

101
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,556
Dou Dou! Dou Dou!

102
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:24,170
Good. No one followed, right? We're safe.

103
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,410
Do you think I can't beat it?

104
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,624
No.

105
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,790
But there's another me out there helping it.

106
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,688
Just one more idiot.

107
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,424
Your safety comes first.

108
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,192
Run!

109
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,924
This way.

110
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,088
Let's go!

111
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:17,296
Go!

112
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:20,628
This way!

113
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:37,930
It's just us now, one-on-one!

114
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,870
Let's have a duel, come on!

115
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,569
Come on!

116
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,388
Are you worried about Chun Yu?

117
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:24,370
They're together, so she'll be fine. Don't worry.

118
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:30,569
Of course, I'm relieved. Now, she has someone by her side.

119
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,669
I'm no longer her best friend.

120
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,844
Are you two fighting?

121
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:44,770
No.

122
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,669
Is it because of what happened last time?

123
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,730
Actually, you might not know this,

124
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,189
but it was quite dangerous out there.

125
00:19:58,189 --> 00:20:01,169
Little Qiang and I almost lost our lives. 
 (Little Qiang refers to Brother Qiang)

126
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:08,310
Maybe Chun Yu thought it was safer for you in the coffin.

127
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,530
Couldn't she tell me before?

128
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,690
If not, she could at least explain it afterward.

129
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,830
I feel too weak, always holding her back.

130
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,510
I wanted to stay and help her,

131
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,529
I realized she doesn't need me.

132
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,410
For her, I'm only a burden.

133
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,390
 Did you know we were high school classmates?

134
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,949
 But she was always cold and ignored everyone.

135
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,590
 One minute left until the end of the exam.

136
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,389
 She's a very strange person.

137
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:59,450
 She always submitted a blank paper for every exam.

138
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:06,369
 One day I picked up her scrap paper

139
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:09,510
 and noticed that all the answers were correct,

140
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,710
which means she could easily get a perfect score.

141
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,909
Instead, she always placed last or second to last.

142
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:18,250
It was the same with the recent college entrance exam.

143
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,520
As you know,

144
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,109
Jianghua College has the lowest admission score requirement.

145
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:25,370
She scored only two points above the lowest score line.

146
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,828
I just don't understand.

147
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:31,590
I always feel she's wasting her talent.

148
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,369
As if she's trying to prove a point.

149
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,609
In my eyes, she will always remain a mystery.

150
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:44,250
You've been injured. It needs to be treated soon.

151
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,950
It's okay, just some superficial wounds.

152
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,810
Besides, they're in the game. They're not real injuries.

153
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,030
But… But you'll still feel pain.

154
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,770
It will heal faster after I treat it.

155
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,010
It's really okay. Don't worry about it.

156
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,556
Don't move.

157
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,709
Did you get hurt a lot when you were little?

158
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,160
Me?

159
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,049
I… didn't get hurt easily.

160
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:07,192
Guess what?

161
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,670
You reminded me of a childhood friend.

162
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:14,110
She loved to laugh a lot as a child

163
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,270
and she was very curious and active.

164
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,429
I remember once we were flying a kite together.

165
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:24,529
The kite string snapped, and the kite fell on a tree.

166
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,392
She was the first to rush over.

167
00:23:26,392 --> 00:23:30,010
She climbed the tree to retrieve that kite,

168
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,250
but then she fell and broke her leg.

169
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:39,690
She was brave, wasn't she? But she was very afraid of pain.

170
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,264
Aren't you afraid of pain?

171
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:47,490
This game feels quite realistic.

172
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,860
Why are you following me?

173
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,189
Are you ever going to stop?

174
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,350
Can you stop pulling me?

175
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,570
Okay, I am sorry.

176
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,890
How about this?

177
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,210
This time, I'll take the lead.

178
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,790
You watch for their weaknesses and pick the best time to strike.

179
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,244
Dou Dou! Dou Dou!

180
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:08,070
Sorry. Sorry, Dou Dou.

181
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,429
This time it wasn't intentional.

182
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,650
It's Bawan.

183
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,180
- Let's go. 
 - Quickly.

184
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,276
Let's go.

185
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:37,430
Uncle, that's how she is.

186
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,769
I really want to understand and get close to her,

187
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:45,090
but she is hard to understand and approach.

188
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:51,549
I've been wondering… What's my place in her heart?

189
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,229
Uncle, do you understand me?

190
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,116
More or less.

191
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:10,089
I still think you two need to talk more.

192
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,476
Chun Yu.

193
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,010
Run! Hurry!

194
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,810
Qing You. Qing You.

195
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,804
Brother Qiang.

196
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,496
This way.

197
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,240

198
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,390
Hurry, close the door!

199
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,849
This is the workshop where the figurines are made.

200
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:33,652
Push here.

201
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,669
Brother Qiang.

202
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:37,496
Move away.

203
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:43,150
It's really strange. Why wasn't a mission assigned this time?

204
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,090
Exactly, there are no instructions.

205
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,069
That's outrageous!

206
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:49,429
Today's setting is identical to yesterday's,

207
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:51,290
so it's the same level.

208
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,749
If entering the elevator is considered a ritual,

209
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:56,250
then we have to take the elevator again.

210
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,250
Only then we can start a new level.

211
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,909
Chun Yu, do you mean that when we first got on the elevator,

212
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:04,769
the complete mission was already assigned?

213
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:07,980
I heard them say something about making a sacrifice.

214
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,790
Complete the Deserted Village Ritual. What was the phrase before that?

215
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,144
Eliminate evil spirits.

216
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:19,089
Eliminate evil spirits. Right!

217
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:20,830
Eradicate evil spirits to complete the Deserted Village Ritual.

218
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,530
Those figurines outside are evil spirits.

219
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,410
We need to eliminate them and then make some sort of sacrifice.

220
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,352
- Then we'll pass the level. 
 - Weapons.

221
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,970
Thinking back, it suddenly becomes clear.

222
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,050
Give me one.

223
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,170
- A big one. 
 - Here.

224
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,350
Is this clear? What nonsense!

225
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,769
These figurines are so violent.

226
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:40,970
Can you eliminate them all?

227
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:00,810
What are you two doing? Come help!

228
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,084
This can't go on. Let's go.

229
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,456
What's going on?

230
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,990
- Did they leave? 
 - Qing You.

231
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:43,800
Chun Yu!

232
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:56,270
Great Devil, think of an idea! We can't hold on!

233
00:30:04,889 --> 00:30:06,544
This way.

234
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,772
This way, quickly!

235
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,410
Hurry! This way!

236
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,496
Where's Chun Yu?

237
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:02,429
Why do you still care about her?

238
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:03,690
There's only one door here.

239
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,449
Are we just going to stay here?

240
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,584
What are we going to do now?

241
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,329
Divide and conquer. Defeat them one by one.

242
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:30,809
Figures are just objects. You can break them with whistles.

243
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,550

244
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:14,440

245
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:19,120
♫  I go from running  ♫
