1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040

2
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:56,727

3
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,771

4
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,372
Brother Qiang.

5
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:06,968
Bawan.

6
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:10,024
Hey. W-W-Why are you…

7
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,684
I thought it was all over.

8
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:12,944
You're alone down here.

9
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:15,224
I came down to save you.

10
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:17,603
Brother Qiang.

11
00:03:17,603 --> 00:03:20,643
Cut the crap.

12
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:23,004
We're brothers, after all.

13
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,304
What about the others?

14
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,024
How are the others doing up there?

15
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,363
What about Dou Dou? Is Dou Dou okay?

16
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:31,784
Don't worry. They're safe up there.

17
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:34,064
All you think about is Dou Dou.

18
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:37,404
 Game: Run to the Finish Line.

19
00:03:37,404 --> 00:03:39,392

20
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:48,184
So that's the finish line?

21
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:52,444
Let's go.

22
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,823
Is this level that simple?

23
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:06,944
You are right. It's too simple.

24
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:09,964
The games before were so weird.

25
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:14,044
Maybe because we've already suffered too much.

26
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:24,604
What will happen to us if we fall?

27
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:26,864
We will die. What else?

28
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:29,123
Don't worry. I won't jump down myself.

29
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:31,180
Who knows.

30
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,584
Why does this feel wrong?

31
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:54,544
Yes, the distance to the door seems unchanged.

32
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,943
Maybe we're going too slow.

33
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:58,580
Wait.

34
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:04,604
What was this level called?

35
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:07,496
Run to the Finish Line.

36
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,633
We have to run. Is that right?

37
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,136
Then let's try running.

38
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,676
- Sure. 
 - Let's go.

39
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:19,433
Bawan, let me tell you. I've been a running pro since my childhood.

40
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,373
Brother Qiang, wait! Wait!

41
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,712
- Don't run so fast, wait for me. 
 - You are right.

42
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:26,433
- We should run together at the same pace. 
 - Okay.

43
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:45,973
Why is the door still so far away?

44
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,612
Let's not worry about it. Just run first and think later.

45
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:50,848
Fine.

46
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:54,713
The door looks unchanged.

47
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:56,432
Let's try running faster.

48
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:58,340
Speed up.

49
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:05,736
Brother Qiang.

50
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:07,424
Why do I feel the distance hasn't changed at all?

51
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:09,312
Run first and think later.

52
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:17,565
Brother Qiang, wait! Wait!

53
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:19,425
What are you doing? Keep running.

54
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:22,324
- No, wait. 
 - What?

55
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:26,105
No. Running like this is definitely wrong.

56
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:44,924
Brother Qiang. Walk a few steps forward.

57
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:48,025
Walk a few steps toward me.

58
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:49,884
Come on.

59
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:54,776
- What do you mean? 
 - Don't stop, keep going.

60
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:07,772
What do you mean?

61
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:11,900
Can you see it?

62
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:15,456
What am I looking at?

63
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:19,256
Look.

64
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:37,517
That means all we have to do

65
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:41,256
is to walk backwards.

66
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:42,932
Exactly.

67
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:49,020
Let's do it.

68
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:00,877
Brother Qiang, wait.

69
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:04,677
"Why do I still feel something's wrong with this wall?"

70
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,937
Wait.

71
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:15,876
Brother Qiang, what's wrong?

72
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:20,697
 Brother Qiang. Why do I feel the distance hasn't changed at all?

73
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:23,176
 Let's not worry. Run first and think later.

74
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:27,136
 What do you mean?

75
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:35,056
 So the real game rule is that only if one person runs backwards,

76
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:39,096
 and the other doesn't move or runs forward, can someone reach the door.

77
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:42,557
 That means only one of us can get through.

78
00:08:46,397 --> 00:08:48,056
Brother Qiang.

79
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:50,516
Brother Qiang.

80
00:08:54,496 --> 00:08:56,152
Brother Qiang.

81
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:06,076
What's wrong? What are you thinking?

82
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,737
What happened down there?

83
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:22,156
Is the game over?

84
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,056
It has been so long. Why isn't it over?

85
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:12,497
We can't just wait.

86
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:15,897
Let's see if there's a mechanism.

87
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,504
Do you think

88
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:34,052
people can change?

89
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:36,997
Are you talking about Brother Qiang?

90
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:42,897
He went down to save Bawan.

91
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,157
But in the face of life and death,

92
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:49,616
original intentions may change.

93
00:10:58,477 --> 00:11:01,457
Brother Qiang, what should we do?

94
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:13,944
Bawan.

95
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,148
What's wrong?

96
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:21,248
I know.

97
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:26,477
You ended up here because I wasted my time.

98
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,516
Brother Qiang, come on.

99
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,376
Don't mention it.

100
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:33,544
It's not your fault.

101
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,864
This time,

102
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,156
consider this my way of paying you back.

103
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:53,736
Brother Qiang. Brother Qiang.

104
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:56,716
If you keep following me, neither of us will get out.

105
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,776
Brother Qiang, trust me. We will find a way to escape together.

106
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:02,256
Brother Qiang, calm down.

107
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:05,936
Bro, if you want to run, run that way.

108
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:07,876
Let me be a hero for once.

109
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,997
Brother Qiang, listen to me.

110
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:13,057
Brother Qiang, calm down.

111
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:15,056
Back then, I did it to save Dou Dou.

112
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:17,537
I couldn't let Dou Dou get the bomb,

113
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,777
so I came down here. This has nothing to do with you.

114
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:26,756
Let me catch my breath first.

115
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:28,516
No way. I really can't run anymore.

116
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:30,237
I'm really exhausted.

117
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:32,576
Brother Qiang, I can't run anymore.

118
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,357
I really can't run anymore, Brother Qiang.

119
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:38,396
No way. Brother, I can't run anymore.

120
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:39,757
I really can't run anymore.

121
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:41,057
Let me rest for a while.

122
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:42,812
Just for a little while.

123
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:57,637
Brother Qiang, I can't do it anymore.

124
00:12:57,637 --> 00:12:58,937
Oh no, there's no time.

125
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:01,677
We can't hold on any longer. What should we do?

126
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,517
What should we do?

127
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,097
 I have already lost two brothers.

128
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:07,716
Brother Qiang, think of something. What should we do?

129
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:09,196
 I can't lose another one.

130
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:10,936
Brother Qiang.

131
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:17,128
What are you doing?

132
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,717
You brat, let me tell you.

133
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:21,236
If you follow me again, I'll kill you.

134
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,497
Wait, wait.

135
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:24,516
Brother Qiang, what's wrong with you?

136
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,840
Brother Qiang.

137
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,596
What's wrong?

138
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,560
Hey Brother!

139
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:39,816
Do me a favor when you get out.

140
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:45,796
I want you to check on A'Yong and Hei Er's grandmother, okay?

141
00:13:49,757 --> 00:13:51,612
Brother Qiang, let me tell you.

142
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:53,557
You should do this yourself.

143
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:54,917
You are my brother.

144
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,697
"Why can't you do this favor for me?"

145
00:13:56,697 --> 00:14:00,197
But… if you leave me here, you won't be my big brother.

146
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:05,156
 Brother.

147
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:08,037
 Brother.

148
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:58,328
Brother Qiang.

149
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,596
Brother Qiang, wait.

150
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:05,677
Brother Qiang.

151
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:08,037
Brother Qiang, stop!

152
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:14,437
 I, Zhang Tianqiang, have always run away.

153
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:16,956
 This time,

154
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:19,836
 I must keep running.

155
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:26,857
Brother Qiang, stop!

156
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:31,376
 Hurry up, Zhang Tianqiang. Faster.

157
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:32,677
Brother Qiang, no!

158
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:35,637
Brother Qiang, no!

159
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,937
Qiang… Brother Qiang.

160
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,476
No!

161
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:46,184
Brother Qiang. Brother Qiang.

162
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:47,924
Brother Qiang.

163
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:25,656
Bawan, come out.

164
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:55,204
It is all right now, Bawan.

165
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:58,312
It's not your fault.

166
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:03,156
N-No. Q-Q-Qiang…

167
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:05,088
Brother Qiang…

168
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:20,977

169
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:26,356
 You've passed the 19th Floor, Fun World, Part One.

170
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,976
I won't die.

171
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:28,416
I haven't helped you get Dou Dou yet.

172
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:48,996
 Bawan. Bawan.

173
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:51,320
Bawan.

174
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:57,477
Stop overthinking it. It's not your fault.

175
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,976
Now even Brother Qiang is in a coma.

176
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:14,496
When will this game ever end?

177
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,137
Bawan.

178
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:26,277
Forget it. Let him go.

179
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,617
Let's give him some alone time.

180
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:35,397
What about Xu Wenya? How should we explain it to her?

181
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:47,157
Brother Qiang is now in the hospital.

182
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:51,357
People who die in the game will fall in a coma in real life.

183
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:56,357
So to save them,

184
00:20:56,357 --> 00:21:00,537
we must enter the game and pass.

185
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:06,316
Is there a way to avoid playing?

186
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:11,796
If they ask you to sign a contract as an Experience Officer, do not sign it.

187
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:15,116
Can I get out of everything that way?

188
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:19,997
Wait.

189
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:23,876
How can reality and games be connected?

190
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:27,876
Why did this happen to me?

191
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,548
Chun Yu.

192
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:34,557
A-Are you joking?

193
00:21:34,557 --> 00:21:35,997
I know.

194
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:41,437
In the past, I was a little mean and not very nice to you,

195
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:43,536
so you might not like me.

196
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:47,757
But this is no time for jokes, okay?

197
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:52,936
Why aren't you saying anything? Say something.

198
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,156
Can you tell me the truth?

199
00:21:59,037 --> 00:22:01,277
I am telling the truth.

200
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:07,856
What should I do?

201
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:13,948
Chun Yu.

202
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:17,776
You will protect me, won't you?

203
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:24,677
I will find a way.

204
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,420

205
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,910

206
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:59,677
 Removing the chips requires a special pulse device.

207
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:02,917
 Look around Tianji Science and Technology's equipment division.

208
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:14,116
 This software can copy Tianji's key card.

209
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:21,177
Why do you know so much about 19th Floor?

210
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:23,196
Are you from Tianji?

211
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:26,004

212
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,230

213
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:54,297
You're so quiet. Are you meditating?

214
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:57,424
Hey.

215
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:03,197
Let me tell you, that guy… Qiang…

216
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:05,917
I've paid back all his money.

217
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:10,548
Don't cry.

218
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:13,888
Loser.

219
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:15,456
Yes.

220
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:17,857
I am a loser.

221
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:20,116
I am only a burden to my friends.

222
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:33,500
Take this.

223
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:40,957
Do you remember your Uncle Zhang?

224
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,884
The car accident.

225
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:52,696
That day I was supposed to drive.

226
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:55,536
He had to cover my shift

227
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,836
and run around without sleeping so he…

228
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,337
After he became paralyzed,

229
00:25:06,116 --> 00:25:08,232
for many years,

230
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:12,037
I have lived in guilt.

231
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:16,717
However, living in guilt didn't relieve me,

232
00:25:16,717 --> 00:25:18,836
nor did it help him stand up again.

233
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:23,616
Instead, it made life more difficult for both of us.

234
00:25:26,197 --> 00:25:30,817
All these years, I've been supporting his family,

235
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,197
but I know, it's wrong not to pay back the money.

236
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:37,024
There's no excuse.

237
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,680
I was wrong.

238
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,797
Also, I want to tell you,

239
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:45,936
apologizing is not a great thing,

240
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:50,857
but solving the problem you apologized for is really great.

241
00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:58,017
- No, Dad… 
 - All right.

242
00:25:58,017 --> 00:25:59,576
Son,

243
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,636
our Yang family has no cowards.

244
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,596
 Didn't you say yesterday you'd go to the hospital today to see Brother Qiang and Qing You?

245
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:24,452
 Where are you?

246
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:29,477
Dad, I'm going back to school.

247
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:31,397
Finish your food before you go. I'm almost done here.

248
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:33,797
No, no, no. I’m done, Dad. I'm late.

249
00:26:33,797 --> 00:26:35,957
Then hurry up and get out.

250
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:37,788
Now!

251
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:40,177
Hurry up.

252
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:42,496
- I'm leaving, Dad. 
 - Hurry up.

253
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:44,352
By the way, Dad.

254
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:46,976
Thank you.

255
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:48,528
Thank…

256
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:50,940
Thank you?

257
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,472
So cringy.

258
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:02,217
May I ask where is the patient who was in this room?

259
00:27:02,217 --> 00:27:05,617
He was probably transferred, I don't know. Ask the nurse.

260
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:11,317
Chun Yu, Brother Qiang is missing.

261
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:14,157
- Where did he go? 
 - I have no idea.

262
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:16,156
Qing You is gone too.

263
00:27:17,396 --> 00:27:19,177
Nurse, excuse me.

264
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:23,037
Where is Qing You of room 4 and Zhang Tianqiang of room 3?

265
00:27:23,037 --> 00:27:25,137
I'll check for you.

266
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:27,496
Qing You, Room 4.

267
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:28,997
Their physical condition is unique.

268
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:30,976
They have been transferred to the ICU.

269
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:32,197
The ICU?

270
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:33,976
W-Where is it?

271
00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:37,377
Only patients' family members are allowed to ICU.

272
00:27:37,377 --> 00:27:39,652
Are you two family members?

273
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:41,240
No.

274
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,957
We are very good friends.

275
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:44,097
Friends aren't allowed.

276
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:46,476
You must be the patient's immediate family.

277
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:48,496
It's the policy of our hospital.

278
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:51,977
Doctor, we are really their good friends. Could you...

279
00:27:51,977 --> 00:27:55,520
I'm sorry, this is not possible.

280
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,696
 I feel I've seen the person who met Dr. Jia before.

281
00:27:57,696 --> 00:27:59,277
 I just feel his physique is very familiar.

282
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:03,517
 On the back of his right hand, he had a very noticeable mole.

283
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,237
Doctor, please.

284
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:11,677
All right.

285
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:13,057
The hospital has a policy. Let's not cause any trouble.

286
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:14,257
The hospital has a policy. Let's not cause any trouble.

287
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,560
Thank you.

288
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,144
Let's go.

289
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:22,277
This is the situation right now.

290
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:24,796
I knew that Director looked off.

291
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:26,976
Maybe we should tell Old Gao now.

292
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,380
He's in class. Let's not bother him now.

293
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,897
What should we do?

294
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:33,696
Why don't we keep an eye on Director Chen for a while?

295
00:28:34,477 --> 00:28:36,977
We've kept an eye on Dr. Jia before, and it didn't work very well.

296
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:41,197
Besides, now that they've seen us, they'll be more alert.

297
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:43,537
So what do you suggest?

298
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:48,577
First, we must find the ICU.

299
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:52,617
Didn't they say we are not family and not allowed in the ICU?

300
00:29:00,636 --> 00:29:02,936
Wearing these clothes makes me nervous.

301
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:06,397
If it weren't for Brother Qiang, I would never do this.

302
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:18,180
I don't see an ICU on this.

303
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,750

304
00:29:47,757 --> 00:29:49,192
Bawan.

305
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:57,497
All four of them are here.

306
00:29:57,497 --> 00:29:59,997
What are we going to do? Chun Yu, how do we get them out?

307
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,700
Let's go.

308
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,080

309
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:00,876
I recorded a video of this place.

310
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,257
How dare you!

311
00:31:02,257 --> 00:31:04,377
Expect to be reprimanded later.

312
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:06,256
If you don't give us an explanation,

313
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:08,697
I'll upload this video to the Internet immediately.

314
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:17,336
Calm down, let's talk.

315
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,296
What should we talk about?

316
00:31:20,256 --> 00:31:22,012
Tianji.

317
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,496
That's all I know.

318
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:28,477
I'm also keeping an eye on those ICU patients,

319
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:32,657
so when I saw you enter, I followed.

320
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,177
Where is Dr. Jia now?

321
00:31:36,177 --> 00:31:37,557
I don't know, either.

322
00:31:37,557 --> 00:31:39,756
I can't reach him now.

323
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:43,657
You have to help us find the truth and save our friends.

324
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:46,456
This might be our only chance.

325
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,090

326
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,930

327
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,720

328
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,720

329
00:32:47,997 --> 00:32:49,997
 I misjudged people.

330
00:32:49,997 --> 00:32:51,437
I will help you.

331
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:54,577
Make sure you keep today's video of the ward safe.

332
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:57,837
Use the evidence as a term of exchange.

333
00:32:58,592 --> 00:33:00,396
Do you mean this one?

334
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:02,877
I'm afraid this is not enough.

335
00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:05,056
We have to think of another way.

336
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,176
I heard Xiao Jia say that Tianji has kept your agreement.

337
00:33:09,176 --> 00:33:12,177
Today's video proves that the players are unconscious,

338
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:16,896
and the agreement proves

339
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:19,457
that the players have an actual contract with us.

340
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:23,757
These two form a complete chain of evidence.

341
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,832

342
00:33:56,356 --> 00:33:58,112
Hello.

343
00:33:58,112 --> 00:33:59,856
 Hello. Old Gao, where are you?

344
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:02,016
I'm outside, what's wrong?

345
00:34:02,676 --> 00:34:04,392
I wanted to let you know we're about to take action.

346
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:07,512
Chun Yu told me not to tell you, but I felt I should anyway.

347
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,556
Action? What action?

348
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:11,776
Chun Yu and I recorded a video of Brother Qiang and the others in a coma.

349
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:12,837
Tonight, we'll find a way

350
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:13,957
 to get into Tianji

351
00:34:13,957 --> 00:34:15,157
 and recover the contract we signed.

352
00:34:15,157 --> 00:34:17,676
That way, we will have evidence of Tianji's scheme.

353
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:20,557
Then we can use it to wake up Brother Qiang and Qing You,

354
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:22,857
and allow us to quit the game.

355
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:26,237
This is a hasty action. Why didn't you discuss it with me earlier?

356
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:29,517
- Chun Yu feared you wouldn't agree, so she chose to act first. 
 - Yang Bawan!

357
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:30,877
 All right, Old Gao. I have to go.

358
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:34,196
 Don't tell Chun Yu about this. I have to go.

359
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,070

360
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,110

361
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:02,177
- What are you doing? 
 -  Let's go

362
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:03,976
What are you doing?

363
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,692
What's going on?

364
00:35:17,196 --> 00:35:19,197
Their security control is so strict.

365
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:22,756
It's okay. Let's wait until tonight.

366
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:27,057
Will you climb through a window or crawl through an air duct?

367
00:35:27,057 --> 00:35:29,236
We're not filming a movie.

368
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:35,097
What should we do? This place doesn't even have a back door.

369
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,916
What the hell? They spend all their money on security…

370
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,876
What's wrong?

371
00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:08,797
What are you going to do to me?

372
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:10,620
Rest assured.

373
00:36:11,496 --> 00:36:13,956
We won't do anything to you.

374
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:17,916
You just need to rest here for a while.

375
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,576
Wait.

376
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:23,197
I-I don't know anything.

377
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:25,156
Why did you kidnap me?

378
00:36:25,156 --> 00:36:28,797
What are you doing? Let me go. Let…

379
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:31,124
Where are you taking me?

380
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:34,340
Get ready to greet and play with them.

381
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,856
Yes.

382
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:46,756
This is the latest Tianji Science and Technology VR equipment.

383
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:48,957
How thrilling!

384
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,608
Manager,

385
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:52,517
I would like to ask a question.

386
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:54,636
Will friends who order during my livestream today

387
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:55,840
receive a discount?

388
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,360
What?

389
00:36:59,357 --> 00:37:00,912
Yes.

390
00:37:01,837 --> 00:37:03,817
20% discount.

391
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:05,897
Oh, my. Friends, did you hear that?

392
00:37:05,897 --> 00:37:08,517
Those who order during my livestream today will get 20% discount.

393
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,836
That's what the manager said.

394
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:13,376
It is now or never.

395
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:19,316
By the way, Manager, may I ask a question?

396
00:37:19,316 --> 00:37:22,137
Besides the Product Experience Center,

397
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:26,436
are there any other interesting places in the building you can show us?

398
00:37:26,436 --> 00:37:29,056
Yes, this way, please.

399
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,756
Fix my make-up.

400
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:39,464
Stop filming for now.

401
00:37:55,477 --> 00:37:57,308
Water.

402
00:37:58,397 --> 00:38:00,420
I want water.

403
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,596
President Yan, they're here. Just as you ordered.

404
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:20,377
- Keep an eye on them. 
 -  Yes.

405
00:38:21,016 --> 00:38:23,237
Chun Yu, you can't get away from me.

406
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:27,180
Everything you do is under my control.

407
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,000

408
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:41,050

409
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:45,503
