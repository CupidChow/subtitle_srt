1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040

2
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:56,644

3
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:59,688

4
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,830

5
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:32,773
 Maybe getting out of here is related to the identity tags we have.

6
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:35,200
 This might be the singing tune of Dan role.

7
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,476
 I have “Sheng.”

8
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:38,200
 I have “Jing.”

9
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:42,512
Brother, why is it only chasing you?

10
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:55,873
Please, save me! It's coming.

11
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:58,793
Then promise to work with everyone from now on.

12
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:00,573
I promise you. I will do whatever you say.

13
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:02,200
Take this.

14
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:13,572
Where is Chun Yu?

15
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,253
What is Chun Yu doing?

16
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:24,220
Switch.

17
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,310

18
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,170

19
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,576
Chun Yu.

20
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:41,332
A'Yong.

21
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:43,193
- Brother Qiang, the Nian beast is gone. 
 - A'Yong.

22
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:44,472
- Are you okay? 
 - We've been saved.

23
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:46,472
- We've been saved. 
 - You scared me.

24
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:47,872
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

25
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:48,953
We all survived.

26
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:51,332
So the tag is not just something that would get us killed,

27
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,152
but also the key to the door.

28
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:54,953
There are still many uncertainties.

29
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:56,420
Let's get out first.

30
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,408
Right.

31
00:04:57,408 --> 00:04:58,532
- Okay. 
 - Come on, let's go.

32
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,184
Go, go, go.

33
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:18,192
Let me tell you. We were really in great danger just now.

34
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:22,333
Nearly all of us could be eaten alive by that monster.

35
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,353
We owe this to Chun Yu.

36
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:26,133
She's the one who opened the door and saved us.

37
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,313
I don't agree.

38
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:30,953
If that boy hadn't told us to switch tags,

39
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:32,552
she wouldn't get the chance to open the door.

40
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:36,073
But all that would have been in vain if we hadn't opened the door.

41
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:40,333
It took the teamwork of all of us and his guidance.

42
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,073
Otherwise, she couldn't have done it on her own.

43
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,173
You are hacking logic.

44
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:44,873
You don't reason with me.

45
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:46,384
Okay, stop arguing.

46
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:50,293
It's their tacit cooperation that got us through.

47
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:52,553
Both of them are excellent. And they are our saviors.

48
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:53,773
That's right, Brother.

49
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,644
What's your name?

50
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:02,236
Gao Xuan.

51
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,892
Okay.

52
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:07,233
Then from today on, we'll be brothers through ups and downs.

53
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,313
After we get out, tell me if you need my help.

54
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:13,032
All right. I hope you'll still remember.

55
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:14,593
What?

56
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:15,973
That's the kind of guy he is. He won't remember.

57
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:18,073
You can also come to me.

58
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,772
I, Zhang Tianqiang, always keep my word.

59
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:22,793
- Right, A'Yong? 
 - Yes.

60
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:24,336
Let's go.

61
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:40,133
Well, what is this?

62
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,613
Why are we back?

63
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:44,513
Chun Yu. This is exactly the same.

64
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:47,152
No way, A'Yong. Let's get back, let's go.

65
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,480
Well…

66
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,070

67
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,373
This time the position of the door has changed.

68
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:01,073
Looks like the game has to continue.

69
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:03,213
Based on the rule that Chun Yu just discovered,

70
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:05,233
each singing tune corresponds to the position of a door.

71
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,912
First, we need to find out which tune corresponds to each door,

72
00:07:07,912 --> 00:07:10,073
and then take our positions according to our identity tags.

73
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:11,692
Do you understand?

74
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,996
Let's go.

75
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:14,573
Go, go, go, hurry up.

76
00:07:14,573 --> 00:07:16,413
Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, and Chou, a total of five roles.

77
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:17,973
The blank tag should be a safe tag.

78
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:20,160
This is yours. You take it.

79
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,140

80
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:27,613
Why can't I have this blank tag?

81
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,272
Qiang.

82
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:32,060
Teamwork.

83
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:43,533
Why did you lie to me during the day?

84
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,892
I thought this was a dream.

85
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:48,192
Think about it.

86
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:50,513
I had just met a young girl,

87
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,713
and said I dreamed of her at night.

88
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,833
Is that appropriate?

89
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,900
Let's switch.

90
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,208
Chun Yu.

91
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,900

92
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,670

93
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,604
This is…

94
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,053
It's the singing tune of the Mo role.

95
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:26,800
The Mo door is here.

96
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,410

97
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:31,452
Be careful.

98
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,096
It's the Sheng role.

99
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:09,973
Brother, Sheng is here. Sheng is here.

100
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:12,472
Hurry up! Put this back!

101
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:17,788
Brother Qiang.

102
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,410

103
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:02,933
I wonder if you noticed how agile and vigorous I was.

104
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,953
I am the God who finds doors tonight.

105
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:06,416
Right.

106
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,373
Yes. The God of Doors, right?

107
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:14,713
But to be honest, I can't just brag about myself.

108
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:18,513
I think we all had perfect teamwork today.

109
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:20,733
We'll all be out of here soon.

110
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,732
That's right, Brother Qiang. You're really great.

111
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:24,673
- You've found the error. 
 - Chun Yu.

112
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:26,456
What's wrong?

113
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:30,292
If I'm right,

114
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:35,373
when we open the door, it should lead to a new cycle.

115
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:38,184
What do you mean?

116
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,612
An infinite loop?

117
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:45,393
We've gone through two of Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, Chou

118
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:47,496
and there will be more.

119
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:49,592
Does it relate to the number of doors opened?

120
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:52,553
I guess we have to go through a whole cycle of Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, and Chou

121
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:55,033
before new information appears.

122
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:58,393
That means we have to go three more times.

123
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:03,928
It's okay, everyone.

124
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:06,032
We've all figured out how it works.

125
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,793
We can face whatever comes our way.

126
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,172
Besides, our teamwork is getting better and better.

127
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:14,693
As Chun Yu just analyzed, we still have three left, Dan, Jing, and Mo.

128
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,533
We'll make it out of here.

129
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:19,573
Yes, Gao Xuan is right.

130
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:21,653
We can definitely do it. Go for it!

131
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:23,313
- Go for it! 
 - Go for it!

132
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:24,972
Let's go, I'm here.

133
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:26,848
Go, go.

134
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:38,453
 The position of the door changes each time.

135
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,333
 We have to find the location of the door

136
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,012
 that matches the tags before the Nian beast appears.

137
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:46,413
 We can't be certain yet if the singing tunes that appeared will be repeated, .

138
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:49,732
 so we have to work together to succeed.

139
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,130

140
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,020

141
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,540

142
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,360

143
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:07,236
It's the singing tune of the Jing role.

144
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:08,488
It's the Jing door.

145
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,112
Qing You.

146
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,630

147
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,233
It's the singing tune of the Dan role.

148
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,792
A'Yong.

149
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,356
Okay.

150
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,800

151
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:06,168
Nice.

152
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,690

153
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,270

154
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:22,392
It's the singing tune of the Mo role.

155
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:24,056
Chun Yu.

156
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,120

157
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:40,152
Hurry up.

158
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,932
Brother, this really works.

159
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:45,952
Yes, but it's just a bit tiring.

160
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:50,332
As long as we get out and find Hei Er, it will all be worth it.

161
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:52,124
It's the fifth time.

162
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:56,733
That means all roles have been played.

163
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:59,892
That means we'll get out soon.

164
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,724
Maybe.

165
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:05,572
So what are we waiting for? Let's make it fast.

166
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:07,313
When we get out, I'll take you to eat delicious food.

167
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,448
I'll treat.

168
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,612
Iron pot stew.

169
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:11,313
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

170
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:16,153
We will get out…

171
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:27,292
I see it. This is…

172
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:30,292
This is just an endless cycle.

173
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,720
I'm done.

174
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,973
I'm done. I'm done.

175
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:39,633
We keep running like this.

176
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,453
Our stamina is limited.

177
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:43,993
I'll be exhausted to death.

178
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:47,353
No way, I need to rest for a while.

179
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:58,968
So what? Do we give up?

180
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:03,172
Everyone, Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, Chou. We've completed five rounds.

181
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:04,433
We've found the pattern.

182
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,572
If there's new information,

183
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:09,913
maybe this time we can do it.

184
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:11,672
Hold on a bit longer

185
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:14,092
and believe in ourselves.

186
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,772
Maybe we can make it.

187
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:17,432
Come on!

188
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:25,572
Brother, let's go.

189
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,530

190
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:31,372
You go ahead, my door is here.

191
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:38,113
Just hang in there.

192
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,620

193
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:43,288
Uncle.

194
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:45,916
Well…

195
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:51,712
I see you haven't moved much in the last few rounds.

196
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:54,993
How about we switch this round?

197
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:58,233
Let me catch my breath. Just for one round.

198
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,832
Mine is here this time.

199
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:03,348
It's very close.

200
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:05,853
Can we just switch for one round?

201
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:07,380
Well…

202
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,073
Just once.

203
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,708
Okay.

204
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,273
Thank you, Uncle.

205
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,470

206
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:29,632
I'm in position. How's everybody doing?

207
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,390

208
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,320

209
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,712
Uncle, what's the situation?

210
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,268
Did you switch tags?

211
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:47,632
- Well… 
 - It's nothing, I've switched with Uncle.

212
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,813
I'm so tired, I just want to catch my breath.

213
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:10,253
Very strange.

214
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,752
Why didn't the broadcast sound this time?

215
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,233
The broadcast hasn't sounded yet.

216
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,292
Which tag should we insert?

217
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,140

218
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:47,253
Brother Qiang, run! This time it's chasing the blank tag.

219
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,016
The blank one?

220
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:55,932
Why is it always me?

221
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:58,872
Run, run, be careful.

222
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,792
Everyone. We insert the tags simultaneously.

223
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,692
Let's see if it works.

224
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:14,773
No response.

225
00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:17,032
It doesn't work.

226
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:21,572
Somebody save me!

227
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,164
Qing You.

228
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,752
Brother Qiang.

229
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:45,932
Give me the tag.

230
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:12,632
A'Yong.

231
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:16,212
A'Yong.

232
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:19,796
A'Yong.

233
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:30,836
A'Yong.

234
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,072
A'Yong.

235
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,288
A'Yong.

236
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:50,136
Brother.

237
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:53,512
Switch!

238
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:21,276
Brother.

239
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,952
Brother Qiang, switch the tags.

240
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:39,412
Hurry, switch the tags.

241
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,332
Brother.

242
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,592
Okay.

243
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,420
Brother.

244
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:13,872
Save me.

245
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,600

246
00:22:55,993 --> 00:22:57,728
Chun Yu.

247
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,970

248
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,040

249
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,420

250
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,890

251
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:45,992
Chun Yu.

252
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,933
Be careful. The danger is not yet over.

253
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,953
What's wrong with the tag?

254
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:07,093
The tag will automatically return to the person who has none.

255
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:09,793
We just took advantage of that.

256
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,000
 Congratulations on successfully passing.

257
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:42,613
 Congratulations on successfully passing.

258
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:52,132
Give me back my A'Yong. Give him back to me.

259
00:25:52,132 --> 00:25:54,893
Give him back to me.

260
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:49,493
 There are already some mature companies researching AI domestically.

261
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:53,012
 Brain-Computer Interfacing technology is even leading the world.

262
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:56,132
 What you mentioned may be possible.

263
00:27:58,073 --> 00:27:59,676
 Understood.

264
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,868
Chun Yu.

265
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,532
Are we…

266
00:28:25,532 --> 00:28:26,973
 A'Yong. A'Yong.

267
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:29,493
 Anyone? Is anyone there?

268
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:31,792
 A'Yong. A'Yong.

269
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:35,804
A'Yong. Don't scare me. What's wrong with you?

270
00:28:35,804 --> 00:28:38,713
A'Yong, anyone? Help!

271
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:40,073
A'Yong.

272
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:41,472
A'Yong, don't scare me.

273
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:43,773
Don't scare me. Don't scare me.

274
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:45,613
A'Yong.

275
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:47,224
Nurse!

276
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:49,692
What's the matter?

277
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:51,352
Hurry.

278
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:53,613
I can't wake him up.

279
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,452
- Bed 13 is in a coma. First Aid. 
 - First aid?

280
00:28:57,452 --> 00:29:00,492
Make way, please make way. Ready for First Aid.

281
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,344
Doctor.

282
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:09,732
Prepare for defibrillation.

283
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,640

284
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:22,828
Get away from the bed.

285
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,700

286
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:46,812
Why is it taking so long?

287
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,240
 Give me the tag.

288
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,232
 Brother, save me.

289
00:29:55,772 --> 00:30:00,400
Chun Yu. Do you think A'Yong will wake up?

290
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:03,192
I don't know.

291
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:10,472
Well, maybe A'Yong was trapped in the haunted building,

292
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:12,773
and that's why he's like this.

293
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:14,932
What?

294
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:17,313
Are you out of your mind? That was just a dream.

295
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:19,572
What's the use of shouting at her?

296
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:21,653
Why don't you think about what to do when you have time?

297
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,872
Mind your own business.

298
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:31,612
Doctor.

299
00:30:33,153 --> 00:30:35,733
H-How is he?

300
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,313
The patient is currently in a coma.

301
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:39,253
Preliminary diagnosis is alcohol poisoning.

302
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:41,713
We've taken the necessary measures.

303
00:30:41,713 --> 00:30:44,792
If this works effectively, he could be conscious today.

304
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:48,893
However, if his condition worsens, we'll move him to the ICU.

305
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:50,792
Alcohol poisoning is not that bad.

306
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:51,973
Doctor.

307
00:30:51,973 --> 00:30:54,312
Are you sure it's alcohol poisoning?

308
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:55,612
What is the amount?

309
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:57,533
Alcohol poisoning varies from person to person.

310
00:30:57,533 --> 00:31:00,633
It depends on the amount and type of alcohol consumed,

311
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:03,052
blood alcohol concentration,

312
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:05,892
and the level of personal tolerance.

313
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:08,744
 Are you drinking or not?

314
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:10,488
 Come on.

315
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:12,953
Are you the doctor, or is he the doctor?

316
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:15,953
Don't talk nonsense if you don't know anything.

317
00:31:15,953 --> 00:31:19,388
Doctor. We're fine here. Thank you.

318
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:21,348
Thank you.

319
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:37,153
If he does have alcohol poisoning,

320
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:40,333
how could he possibly join us in the haunted building?

321
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:43,353
That's why I told you he drank too much.

322
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:45,573
Who says you can't dream if you drink too much?

323
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:48,072
But yesterday you said it wasn't a dream.

324
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,912
Why did you say that today?

325
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:54,740
Brother Qiang. Where exactly is Hei Er?

326
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:05,832
How would I know? He checked himself out of the hospital.

327
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:10,168
That brat, I wonder where he went. He left his own brother behind.

328
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:11,533
Has he really checked out of the hospital?

329
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:12,753
That's what the doctors said.

330
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:14,593
You should ask the doctor, why are you asking me?

331
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:17,332
- I… 
 - Last night we were in the haunted building.

332
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:19,473
Now, your two good brothers,

333
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:22,213
one is missing, and one is in a coma.

334
00:32:22,213 --> 00:32:25,853
You heard the last broadcast last night.

335
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:32,292
 Congratulations on successfully passing.

336
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,893
This is definitely more than just a dream.

337
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,744
Chun Yu. This is all so weird.

338
00:32:44,744 --> 00:32:46,713
Maybe we should call the police.

339
00:32:46,713 --> 00:32:50,993
Yes, it's so weird. Let's call the police.

340
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:53,953
- Wait. 
 - Why?

341
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:55,973
Now we are not certain

342
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,853
if the haunted building is related to what happened to A'Yong and Hei Er.

343
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,940
We have no evidence.

344
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,633
What do we tell the police?

345
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:07,412
Say we fell asleep last night and entered a strange room,

346
00:33:07,412 --> 00:33:11,332
where shadow puppets all came to life and tried to kill us?

347
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:16,192
Then the police will think the three of us are crazy.

348
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:22,933
 Hey, Chun Yu.

349
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:24,713
 I'm the student council president, Nian Sulan.

350
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:26,313
 The school asked me to pick you up.

351
00:33:26,313 --> 00:33:27,733
 You should pack your bags and come downstairs.

352
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:29,300
All right.

353
00:33:31,332 --> 00:33:33,668
Okay, then, you should get back.

354
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:37,412
If A'Yong wakes up, I'll tell you right away.

355
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:43,713
Just keep looking for Hei Er.

356
00:33:43,713 --> 00:33:47,532
When we find him, maybe we'll have the all the answers.

357
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:51,872
Why did you say the exact same thing like that guy?

358
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,960
Who?

359
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,368
Gao Xuan. He told me the same thing yesterday.

360
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:06,428
Senior Sister.

361
00:34:09,973 --> 00:34:12,313
Are you here to pick us up?

362
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:16,233
I'm not used to the school bus, so I had my driver pick you up.

363
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:18,033
The car is a bit small.

364
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:19,752
Don't let it bother you, Junior Sister.

365
00:34:19,752 --> 00:34:21,573
Small?

366
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:23,900
Get in the car.

367
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:47,193
 Miss Nian.

368
00:34:47,193 --> 00:34:48,473
Senior Gao Xuan.

369
00:34:48,473 --> 00:34:50,592
 I want to make a 3D model of the school,

370
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:52,773
 and I still need the blueprints for Building 19.

371
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:56,213
 Could you please submit my application to Director Liu?

372
00:34:56,213 --> 00:34:58,212
Sure, Senior.

373
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,333
Senior Sister.

374
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,233
There is a senior in our school named Gao Xuan, right?

375
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,532
Yes.

376
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:06,953
Senior Gao Xuan.

377
00:35:06,953 --> 00:35:08,773
He is a graduate student at the University of Science and Technology,

378
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,952
and now works part-time as a substitute teacher at our school.

379
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:15,093
However, he should only be here for one semester.

380
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,813
A substitute teacher?

381
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:18,913
Yes.

382
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:22,473
But I guess his main occupation is still being a student.

383
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:24,513
He's actually two years older than you.

384
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,013
He skipped grades to attend college.

385
00:35:26,013 --> 00:35:29,313
He's also a rising star in the tech world in recent years.

386
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:31,160
Do you know him?

387
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:35,132
No, just asking.

388
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,613
Right. I'm different.

389
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:43,073
He's my graduation thesis advisor.

390
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,580

391
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:59,430

392
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:04,032
♫  I go from running  ♫

393
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:07,456
