1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,950

2
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:56,759

3
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,703

4
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:16,172
This agreement is just a disclaimer clause,

5
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,813
but I am willing to negotiate with you.

6
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:22,852
I didn't expect that you guys

7
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,553
would pull off such a move.

8
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:27,753
This is the first time I've been in such a passive situation.

9
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:29,913
I am really impressed.

10
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:33,713
Speak up, what are your demands?

11
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:36,653
It is simple. Please let Qing You and the others regain their consciousness,

12
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:39,433
and let us quit the game.

13
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:42,432
To be honest, I don't like being threatened,

14
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:43,452
but since things have come to this,

15
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:47,073
It seems I don't need you to keep playing the game.

16
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,513
Are you really the CEO of Tianji?

17
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:57,973
You don't have to believe me.

18
00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:00,853
The choice is in your hands.

19
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,172
 Why should we believe you?

20
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,912
 You don't have to believe me.

21
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:09,592
 The choice is in your hands.

22
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,733
Let me introduce myself. I am Yan Mingliang,

23
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,492
the founder of Tianji Science and Technology.

24
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:19,693
Why would you disguise yourself as a regular employee?

25
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:23,113
There are some things I prefer to do in person.

26
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:27,213
And I am used to observing experiment subjects up close.

27
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:31,372
Experiment subjects? Are you treating us like guinea pigs?

28
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:34,733
Every scientific experiment marks human civilization's progress.

29
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,293
From this point of view,

30
00:03:37,293 --> 00:03:40,533
I prefer to call you

31
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,536
pioneers.

32
00:03:43,212 --> 00:03:45,692
You've left these people half dead.

33
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,912
What kind of progress is that?

34
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:49,133
Progress comes at a cost.

35
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,973
Those are real lives.

36
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:54,132
I don't see the point of your experiment.

37
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:59,512
Don't you think the game I created is truly fascinating?

38
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:01,913
It's thrilling and dangerous.

39
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:05,913
Everyone can experience a completely different life.

40
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,093
As long as you enter my game,

41
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:12,432
you can explore a magical new world.

42
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:14,972
This is a timeless masterpiece.

43
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:18,152
A game for the brave.

44
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:22,436
This is the brand-new world I want to create.

45
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:25,893
Everyone starts at the same starting line.

46
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:30,948
Only the brave and clever deserve to own more.

47
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:32,412
That's really misleading.

48
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:33,993
We're not here to argue with you.

49
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:37,573
No one has the right to decide the fate of others.

50
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,573
You fail to see the significance of the experiment.

51
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,312
That's not surprising.

52
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:44,673
Not everyone has the patience to wait for tomorrow.

53
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:47,933
The truth is always in the hands of the few.

54
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:49,092
Fine.

55
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:51,513
As long as these toxic motivational quotes make you happy.

56
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:55,152
We just want to quit the game and wake our friends in coma.

57
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,013
Okay.

58
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,573
Come back in two days to remove the chips.

59
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:01,412
At the same time, I'll release their consciousness.

60
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,332
I didn't expect everything could be fixed so easily.

61
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:18,352
Yan Mingliang is not as horrible as you think.

62
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,652
It seems the agreement and video were useful after all.

63
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,164
Hello.

64
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:25,688
Hello.

65
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:30,588
I want to ask if you still play an NPC in the haunted house level?

66
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:32,176
What?

67
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:35,552
Every time a new player joins the game,

68
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,573
you would enter the game at the haunted house level,

69
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:40,013
and play the first victim, right?

70
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:44,953
That may have happened while I was working in R&amp;D.

71
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:46,353
I can't remember clearly anymore.

72
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,173
I have forgotten a lot recently because of my illness.

73
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:51,452
I no longer handle R&amp;D department issues.

74
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:09,173
Great, free at last.

75
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:13,513
The feeling of freedom is simply wonderful.

76
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:16,173
I still think it went a little too smoothly.

77
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,333
Old Gao, you're good in every way.

78
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,513
You're just too careful.

79
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,313
What's to fear when we have the evidence?

80
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:25,513
Okay, you two can go back.

81
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:27,113
Chun Yu and I have something to do.

82
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:28,432
Okay.

83
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:31,412
What do you two have to do?

84
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,952
It’s none of your business.

85
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:37,953
Okay, okay.

86
00:06:37,953 --> 00:06:40,073
Then I'll be off. Have a good chat, and good luck.

87
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:41,552
Bye-bye.

88
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:47,232
What's the matter?

89
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,792
You heard me. I just mentioned it.

90
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,813
I went to Microtech today to sign a contract,

91
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,933
and saw Yan Mingliang in President Nian's group photo.

92
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:55,672
This indicates a very close relationship.

93
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:57,093
In addition, Microtech's research areas

94
00:06:57,093 --> 00:07:00,232
include computing and brain-computer interfacing technology.

95
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:01,793
That is to say,

96
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:04,373
the two companies' businesses are quite close.

97
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:05,312
That's right.

98
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,273
This indicates that they are connected to each other.

99
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:11,553
Your father is also Microtech's former chief engineer.

100
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:15,833
These two companies are closely linked.

101
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,400
Don't you think it's a little...?

102
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,312
Let's go.

103
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:21,216
Where to?

104
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,264
Chun Yiming's dormitory.

105
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:41,472
President Yan, will you really remove their chips when it is time?

106
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:47,872
Didn't you say there were new issues with the system upgrade?

107
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:49,852
Yes.

108
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:55,072
The data of those players…

109
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:03,252
Besides, we should also change the style of play.

110
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:07,133
 Fighting and killing isn't very interesting.

111
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,768

112
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:27,872
So this is how you sneaked into Tianji, isn't it?

113
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:43,232
Is this the dormitory Microtech prepared for your dad?

114
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:50,912
Chun Yu, has anyone been in this room?

115
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:56,033
Maybe it's just untidy.

116
00:08:57,472 --> 00:09:00,752
Well, let's look for clues first.

117
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,313
 Where exactly are you?

118
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:30,372
Let's go.

119
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:31,753
We can't find anything here.

120
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:33,408
We'll think of something else.

121
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:35,096
Let's go.

122
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:57,793
That's you when you were a child?

123
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:59,653
You used to smile more than you do now.

124
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,968
Take it with you.

125
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:29,360
What?

126
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,972
- Live streaming to find a job? 
 - Yes.

127
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:33,773
Don't be that nervous.

128
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:36,053
It's not as formal as you imagine.

129
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,733
It's just an opportunity for 3rd-year interns to show themselves.

130
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:44,113
My senior sisters, as you know,

131
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:48,932
livestreaming is a fierce competition now.

132
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:53,913
People will unfollow if the content isn't as engaging as others.

133
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,153
We're all from the same college.

134
00:10:58,153 --> 00:11:00,233
You won't even help with this small favor.

135
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:04,112
Wenya, I took you in when you first came to college.

136
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,953
Since then, I've always taken good care of you.

137
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:09,953
Can you do me this favor?

138
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:16,473
Well, how about this?

139
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:19,333
If you can find a topic related to gourmet food,

140
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,672
you will have my full cooperation.

141
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,164
Okay.

142
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,212
We'll think about it.

143
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,772
Well, I have to start the livestreaming.

144
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,936
I need to go.

145
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:47,152
Why is she so conceited?

146
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:48,532
You have a good temper.

147
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,333
You were the one who accepted the mission.

148
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,752
You know, everybody is waiting.

149
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:55,972
How are we going to explain it to them?

150
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,340

151
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,473
Nan Xiaoqin, is that really necessary?

152
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:13,313
Is eating my only talent?

153
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:16,852
That's what I'm guarding against. A shameless foodie.

154
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:19,893
Here, I bought it for you.

155
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:22,140
Is it poisoned?

156
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:23,972
Come on.

157
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:25,696
Don't refuse what's free.

158
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,432
I need to ask you for a favor.

159
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:42,436
I knew this couldn't be a good thing.

160
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:46,513
It's all thanks to you, for what happened last time.

161
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:48,492
You're the only one who can help me with this.

162
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:50,628
Is this about Dou Dou again?

163
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:51,953
Nan Xiaoqin, what did I say?

164
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:53,713
You are my train of thought.

165
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,416
To the point!

166
00:12:57,892 --> 00:12:59,453
That game I told you about the other day,

167
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:01,412
I won't be playing it anymore.

168
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:03,493
Did you find a way to quit the game?

169
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,440
How do you know?

170
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,712
I-I guessed it.

171
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:09,592
Didn't you just say I was your "train of thought"?

172
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:11,232
That game is very dangerous.

173
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:13,732
It's a good thing you're not playing anymore.

174
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:15,773
That's true.

175
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:18,032
But if I don't play that game, I…

176
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:20,192
You won't be able to see Dou Dou anymore.

177
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:25,953
But compared to whether I see her or not,

178
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:29,213
But compared to seeing her, I worry more if she knows the dangers of the game.

179
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:31,773
I want to take her with me and quit the game,

180
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:34,752
but I don't know who she is in real life.

181
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:37,753
Then you should look for her in reality.

182
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:40,772
It is easy to say, but how could I find her in a vast sea of people?

183
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:43,472
In that game,

184
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:48,093
is there a big difference between your image there and real life?

185
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:52,673
In reality, I look exactly like I do in-game.

186
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:54,932
Chun Yu and Gao Xuan are the same.

187
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:57,013
Chun Yu and Gao Xuan are also playing?

188
00:13:57,013 --> 00:14:00,272
I think there's a good chance Dou Dou is from our college.

189
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,112
You are right.

190
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:05,953
Xu Wenya, Qing You and many others are also our classmates.

191
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:08,233
Then that's simple.

192
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:11,072
Last time, you said Dou Dou had a good figure,

193
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:13,413
was physically strong, and knew martial arts.

194
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,812
An average individual does not meet this standard.

195
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:18,853
It's likely that only the girls from the sports department…

196
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,673
Where are you going?

197
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,013
Nan Xiaoqin, you're not my "train of thought".

198
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:26,093
You are my brain.

199
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:27,713
Come on. These are all yours.

200
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:29,568
Take your time to eat.

201
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,233
Sir, do you know Dou Dou?

202
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:50,852
- Nice shot! 
 - Dou Dou.

203
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:52,472
Do you know Dou Dou?

204
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:56,333
- Miss, do you know Dou Dou? 
 - No, I don't.

205
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,844
Sorry about that.

206
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:01,356
Dou Dou.

207
00:15:01,356 --> 00:15:03,164
Do you know Dou Dou?

208
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:05,264
Miss.

209
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,880
Dou Dou. Do you know…

210
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:20,013
Xu Wenya doesn't want to do it. How can you blame me?

211
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,353
All right, I have things to do. Let's talk later.

212
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,420

213
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:27,544
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

214
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,513
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

215
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,444
It got really damaged.

216
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,816
Forget it. Never mind, I didn't feel like taking the call anyway.

217
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:37,753
No, no, it won't do. I must. I must compensate you.

218
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:42,900
It was really damaged. I will probably have to pay ¥500.

219
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:47,676
¥800?

220
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,112
Let me call from your phone.

221
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,433
Call my cellphone to see if the phone still works.

222
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:57,652
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

223
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,140

224
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,720

225
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:09,768

226
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,512
 My brother, what's up again?

227
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:26,392
Aren't you the famous internet celebrity Xu Wenya?

228
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,580

229
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:45,732

230
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,810

231
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,593
 Let's meet and talk.

232
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,740
 Okay.

233
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,640
What's going on?

234
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,204
It's nothing.

235
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:39,273
Meet me for what? I don't want to see you.

236
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,180
You did your best.

237
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,413
Dou Dou will be very touched.

238
00:17:57,413 --> 00:18:02,013
Nan Xiaoqin, stop making fun of me.

239
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:06,993
She will definitely know. You have to believe me.

240
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:16,332
I know very well that you're trying to comfort me,

241
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:18,293
but for some reason,

242
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,092
I feel what you're saying is true.

243
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:33,044
Cellphone.

244
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,976
It's my younger sister.

245
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,793
 Sister Qin, this is a guitar piece I've just learned.

246
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:45,493

You are Dou Dou!

259
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:47,204
You are Dou Dou!

260
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:48,728
Do you regret it?

261
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:49,713
No, no, no!

262
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:52,053
You never expected Dou Dou would be handicapped.

263
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:54,733
Why didn't you tell me you were Dou Dou?

264
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:57,413
Well, do Chun Yu and the others all know who you are?

265
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:58,733
Do you know about the chip?

266
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,768
Isn't that just nonsense?

267
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:05,513
Well, will you remove the chip?

268
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:09,513
If I remove it, where would you go to find your goddess?

269
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:10,833
No, no, no!

270
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,013
Dou Dou! Dou Dou! I-I-I didn't mean that.

271
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,813
Well, you…

272
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,612
A handicap! A handicap is also quite good.

273
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:21,313
No, no, no!

274
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:23,712
There is no need for words, I understand.

275
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:26,613
Dou Dou! Dou Dou! Take it easy.

276
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:28,652
Dou Dou! Dou Dou! I didn't mean that.

277
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:30,264
Dou Dou!

278
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:56,544
You are here.

279
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:58,400
What's the matter?

280
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:02,588
I am still thinking about removing the chip.

281
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:05,072
Yan Mingliang agreed a little too easily.

282
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:07,832
So you're worried that Yan Mingliang is planning something?

283
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:11,913
Yes, besides, removing the chip from our bodies…

284
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:14,153
Wenya, it is not what you think. I didn't mean to.

285
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:15,264
Xu Wenya?

286
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:17,133
Wenya, let me explain, Wenya!

287
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,572
Don't follow me anymore!

288
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,813
Do you know how hard I have been working?

289
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,064
It's all your fault.

290
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:25,273
What's the situation?

291
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:27,612
Have you met an obsessed fan?

292
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:30,612
I think I know what the situation is.

293
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,230

294
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,430

295
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,640

296
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:44,213
I'm sorry. I know you like to eat fruits.

297
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:47,212
- I just passed by the fruit store. 
 - Who is going to eat these?

298
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:49,412
I don't like these.

299
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:51,320
Do you know what I like?

300
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,848
Cherries.

301
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:54,452
Musang King durian.

302
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:55,984
Don't you know?

303
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:57,913
Now I know. Next time I will surely buy them for you.

304
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:00,393
- Next time I…  
 - Don't buy me anything.

305
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:02,733
Haven't you caused me enough trouble?

306
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:05,632
Don't come to see me anymore!

307
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:25,232
Without me,

308
00:22:26,052 --> 00:22:28,192
you could have a better life. Is that right?

309
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:38,053
Her brother doesn't seem to be in good shape.

310
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:39,713
Let's follow him and see.

311
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:41,296
Okay.

312
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:49,232
 Xu Wenwu, do you think this company is owned by your family?

313
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,784
 You begged and pleaded to transfer you here

314
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:52,372
 and now you want to move again?

315
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:56,493
 Being near someone I care about causes her a lot of trouble.

316
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:57,633
 Don't follow me anymore!

317
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,073
 I don't want to see you again. Get lost!

318
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,312
 Don't come to see me anymore!

319
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:08,888
What are you doing?

320
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,812
Calm down! It's not worth it.

321
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:11,853
What?

322
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:14,473
If there's a problem, we can talk about it. Come over to me.

323
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:16,352
Who are you guys?

324
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:18,204
I don't know you.

325
00:23:18,204 --> 00:23:19,960
Come over here.

326
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:28,112
- Let go. 
 - I won't let go.

327
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:29,393
I didn't want to die.

328
00:23:29,393 --> 00:23:31,593
I didn't want to jump off the building.

329
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:37,552
You…

330
00:23:37,552 --> 00:23:39,952
I just wanted to come up and shout to vent.

331
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,192
Who the hell are you two?

332
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,672
Are you really okay?

333
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:11,036
What could possibly be wrong?

334
00:24:11,036 --> 00:24:13,453
Don't we still have to live our lives the same way?

335
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:18,073
Please apologize to Wenya for me.

336
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:21,273
No matter what happens, you two are siblings.

337
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:23,952
I don't care. As long as she's okay.

338
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:25,524
Besides,

339
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:30,152
someone has to protect her, right?

340
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,148
Well, I really don't understand Xu Wenya.

341
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,092
I'm quite envious of her.

342
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:45,972
What do you envy her for?

343
00:24:45,972 --> 00:24:48,192
Are you envious that she's an influencer?

344
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:50,904
You're right.

345
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,012
Well,

346
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:56,013
are you leaving?

347
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:58,873
Something fell down, and I have to look for it.

348
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:15,613
Where did it fall?

349
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,472
It fell down when I was fighting with her brother on the roof.

350
00:25:18,472 --> 00:25:20,312
It should be around here.

351
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,252
See! You said you wanted to help others,

352
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:25,216
and you've become a joke yourself.

353
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:28,213
Thanks for your useless help.

354
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:32,968
What is it?

355
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:36,173
It's just a wooden smiley face stamp.

356
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:44,540
Don't you remember?

357
00:25:49,024 --> 00:25:50,712
No.

358
00:25:57,733 --> 00:26:00,513
Someone gave it to me when I was a child.

359
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:02,612
It also happened on the rooftop.

360
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:06,692
It was a childhood gift,

361
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:09,033
and you've kept it with you all these years?

362
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:13,752
After all, that experience is unforgettable.

363
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:18,873
Then hurry up and search.

364
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:28,632
If we can't find it, forget it. Let's go.

365
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:49,332
 Chun Yu, I'm leaving.

366
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,652
 Are you going on a trip?

367
00:27:51,652 --> 00:27:54,313
 I'm moving to my mom's new place.

368
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:59,073
 Will you still come to visit me often?

369
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:02,064
 It's going to be in another city.

370
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:03,964
 It's very far.

371
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,013
 Okay, goodbye.

372
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,496
 Let's go, Xiao Lei.

373
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:21,390
♫  And your smiles through the tears  ♫

374
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,096
Brother!

375
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:27,133
 Brother, please don't go.

376
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:30,360
 Just stay here, I don't want you to leave.

377
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,030
♫  That has learned to recklessly accompany me in madness  ♫

378
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:48,013
 Chun Yu, I promise. I will definitely come back.

379
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,010
♫  We are half awake, half asleep  ♫

380
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:55,113
 You can't lie to me.

381
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:57,088
 I will do as I say.

382
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,450
♫  But luckily, no matter how difficult the road gets

383
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:11,110
♫  You understand my peculiar stubbornness  ♫

384
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,992
 Tianji has agreed to help us remove the chips.

385
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:32,852
 Will all of us be awakened after removing the chip?

386
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,220
 The human brain is too complex.

387
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,173
 Anything could happen.

388
00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:52,033
 Remember, do not easily trust Tianji.

389
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,870

390
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,140

391
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:19,920
Begin.

392
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,236
He's moving, he's moving!

393
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,112
Brother Qiang is responding!

394
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:12,612
What are you doing?

395
00:31:12,612 --> 00:31:14,428
You all saw it.

396
00:31:15,052 --> 00:31:18,173
The Consciousness Reversal Device can awaken your friends,

397
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:20,413
but after all, this is a trade.

398
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:30,213
All right, go ahead. Do the surgery first.

399
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:32,113
After the surgery, I expect everything to be normal.

400
00:31:32,113 --> 00:31:35,373
You will keep your promise and we will delete them.

401
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:37,316
Let's begin.

402
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:39,096
Take them inside.

403
00:31:39,852 --> 00:31:41,464
Wait a moment.

404
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:46,253
Chun Yu, come with me.

405
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:54,552
Do you have any concerns?

406
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:56,833
I just cannot believe

407
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,973
that Yan Mingliang would let us quit the game so easily.

408
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:03,724
Besides, remember the person we met here two days ago?

409
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:05,453
Don't you think he was acting weird?

410
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:10,093
 I want to ask if you still play an NPC in the haunted house level?

411
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:12,493
 I can't remember clearly anymore.

412
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:14,032
 I've been transferred to the procurement department recently.

413
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,852
 I no longer handle R&amp;D department issues.

414
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:18,593
Yes.

415
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:22,993
It seems he has forgotten everything about the game.

416
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,624
In case…

417
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:30,244
I mean what if he lost all his memories

418
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:32,632
because he removed the chip?

419
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:36,448
What do we do then?

420
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:45,733
But we have no choice at the moment.

421
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:54,552
Chun Yu,

422
00:32:55,612 --> 00:32:58,052
actually, the most important thing is this.

423
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:02,353
I don't want to forget what happened during this time,

424
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:08,912
especially the bits and pieces with you.

425
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:11,273
Even if it's just a minute or a second,

426
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:13,372
I don't want to forget it.

427
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,784
 Brother Xiao Lei, what book are you reading?

428
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:08,173
 The Magical Password.

429
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:11,393
 A Password? Can you teach me?

430
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:18,173
 - Come here! 
 - Dad!

431
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:19,733
 - Don't hit me anymore. 
 -  Did you run?

432
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:21,652
 Dad, I know I was wrong!

433
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:22,753
 - Did you run? 
 - Dad.

434
00:34:22,753 --> 00:34:24,213
 You brought this on yourself.

435
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:25,472
 You're ungrateful! Get lost!

436
00:34:25,472 --> 00:34:27,364
 Don't come back anymore!

437
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:32,316
 Brother!

438
00:34:42,032 --> 00:34:43,972
 It's time for dinner.

439
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:04,113
 Chun Yu, what's wrong with you?

440
00:35:04,113 --> 00:35:05,693
 Lu Bei has lost her memory.

441
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:09,333
 She even forgot her best friend, Sherry.

442
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:14,290
 I won't forget.

443
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:21,413
 I won't forget.

444
00:36:02,753 --> 00:36:06,404
Brother Xiao Lei, hello there.

445
00:36:08,096 --> 00:36:09,952
You found it?

446
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:13,213
So, rest assured.

447
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,093
With it around,

448
00:36:15,893 --> 00:36:18,132
I will definitely not forget you.

449
00:36:52,452 --> 00:36:56,608
This time, when you close your eyes you won't have nightmares.

450
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:57,993
Based on what you're saying,

451
00:36:57,993 --> 00:37:01,193
after we finish, we'll celebrate for three days and nights!

452
00:37:01,193 --> 00:37:03,833
I don't have time to celebrate for three days and nights.

453
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,812
There's a very important person who's waiting for me to fight.

454
00:37:06,812 --> 00:37:08,172
Once I've recovered,

455
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:12,213
the first thing is to find a boyfriend who won't despise me.

456
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:15,532
I'm the one. I wouldn't despise you.

457
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:17,472
That's none of your business.

458
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:24,152
I just think it's enough to live well with my wife and children.

459
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:26,144
How about you, Chun Yu?

460
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:55,272
We are about to start.

461
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:02,132
Come on, come on.

462
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:06,833
Qing You, A'Yong, Brother Qiang, Hei Er, no need to thank us.

463
00:38:45,732 --> 00:38:48,713
 Welcome to Big World Part 2.

 Joyful Circus.
