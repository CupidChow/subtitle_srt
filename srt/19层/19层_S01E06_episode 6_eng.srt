1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,010

2
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:56,708

3
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,072

4
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:02,228

5
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,950
So everything here is a game.

6
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,576

7
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:30,770
 Welcome to 19th Floor.

8
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:36,490
 Mission: Eliminate evil spirits to complete the Deserted Village Ritual.

9
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,704
You are here.

10
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,609
The piece of cloth you just mentioned. Is it something special?

11
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,769
Do you remember when we first entered the haunted building hall?

12
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,469
After the opera play, before Hei Er was killed,

13
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:49,029
wasn't there a person killed by the shadow puppet monster in one blow?

14
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,530
I was in the hallway at the time,

15
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,890
so I didn't see the person you mentioned.

16
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,030
His outfit matches the material and color of the piece of cloth you took.

17
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,829
And earlier, I saw him once at Building 19.

18
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,929
So you're saying that piece of cloth might be part of his clothes.

19
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:06,450
He could be another player.

20
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,929
He might know a few secrets.

21
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,532
Chun Yu!

22
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,230
Chun Yu, I just received a message,

23
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,970
that the game is about to start,

24
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,789
and then I came here.

25
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,544
19th Floor?

26
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,844
Did you get it too?

27
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,890
Looks like the game is about to start.

28
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,224
Let's go.

29
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,489
Chun Yu, I'm scared.

30
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,930
Can we get out of here?

31
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,204
Let's go.

32
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:55,290
If this is a game, how did we get here?

33
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,409
We entered the game after we received the text message.

34
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,469
Maybe it has something to do with the phones.

35
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:00,789
That makes sense.

36
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:03,990
Maybe they're transmitting a special radio signal via our phones

37
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,810
that affects our brains.

38
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,150
A signal transmittion.

39
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,709
Then our brain should have a receiver to pick up signals.

40
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,130
Like a microchip.

41
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,730
What are you guys talking about?

42
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,529
Maybe they’ve implanted a microchip in our brains,

43
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,910
so we could enter the game.

44
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,969
Microchips?

45
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:26,570
So when did we get the implant?

46
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,244
At the hospital?

47
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,770
Although I went to the hospital, I wasn't hospitalized.

48
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,390
They didn't get the chance.

49
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,490
Then maybe it was implanted during something we all experienced.

50
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,089
Did you do something unusual lately?

51
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,529
- The VR headset? 
 - The VR headset?

52
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,469
Did you wear that too? Was it at the school gate?

53
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,930
On the day of the opening ceremony,

54
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,050
I tried on a VR headset at the technology booth.

55
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,790
Did you try it too?

56
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,349
 This is…

57
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:58,752
 This is the latest VR headset.

58
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:01,149
 Impressive, right? You can use it to play games.

59
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:05,980
Did you think of something?

60
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,430
I'm expecting someone. If he shows up,

61
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,929
it would prove that it’s related to that headset.

62
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:16,290
Chun Yu, you didn't return to the dorm at night. Where did you go?

63
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,276
I went to his house.

64
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,852
His house?

65
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:24,764
Someone's coming.

66
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,704
- Uncle Lin.

67
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:29,936
- Uncle Lin. 
 - Hello there.

68
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:31,409
Uncle Lin.

69
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,289
Uncle Lin, is your leg fine now?

70
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,530
It feels fine now that I'm here.

71
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,610
Looks like the injury from last game didn't carry over to this one.

72
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,096
Who is it?

73
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:47,028
Brother Qiang.

74
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,056
It's you guys again.

75
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,389
Is your friend doing better now?

76
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:00,290
 Save me!

77
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,109
 Boss, there is also the guy who fell into a coma due to the game.

78
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,730
A’Yong, well…

79
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,170
The doctor said he's fine. Two days of rest in the hospital will be enough.

80
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,160
Devil Chun Yu!

81
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,989
So many of you play this game.

82
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,516
- Even Senior Brother Gao is here? 
 - Who are you?

83
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:35,730
I'm Yang Bawan!

84
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,470
Well, since so many of you are playing, why don't you get your gear?

85
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,869
Are you a team now?

86
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:50,490
Senior Brother, listen to me. I'm very good at playing games.

87
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,890
I'm experienced and an expert.

88
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,070
Now all you need is a leader.

89
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,370
Let me join you. I will definitely carry everyone.

90
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,870
Did you put on that headset?

91
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,770
Yes, I got here the moment I put it on.

92
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,489
Look! This game is too realistic.

93
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:03,228
It's you.

94
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,730
This game isn't that simple.

95
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,712
It's your first time here. Try not to wander and stay close to us.

96
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:12,170
That's right. We should listen to Brother Xuan.

97
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,470
You want my gear, don't you?

98
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,070
Here, take it. We can share them.

99
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,464
Idiot.

100
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,910
You want to play the game with no gear and no damage, right?

101
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,190
Come on, I'll join you.

102
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,252
Let's go.

103
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,410
Let me lead the way. I've already run through this map.

104
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,729
I'm familiar with this place. Let's go.

105
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,009
The show is about to start, everyone.

106
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,289
Senior Gao, let me tell you, it's just a game.

107
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:07,529
I've played a lot of games.

108
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,669
I'll take the lead. It'll be an easy win.

109
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:12,956

110
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,889
Games nowadays invest a lot of money and effort.

111
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:29,510
Look how realistic this is.

112
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:38,836
Don't touch!

113
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,169
Don't touch anything.

114
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,169
Let me warn you, this is no ordinary game.

115
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,849
Don't be so nervous. I'm an experienced player.

116
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,610
Everyone, let's look around.

117
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,189
If you find anything unusual, please let me know.

118
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:58,968
Be careful.

119
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,436
I said no touching.

120
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:05,252
You're coming with me.

121
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:07,990
Senior Gao, listen to me. I'm very experienced with this.

122
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,920
X-Xuan.

123
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,710
We can be a team. I've got your back.

124
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,344
Wait, wait.

125
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:20,150
Brother, we agreed to split up and look around. You go check over there.

126
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,750
It's none of your business. Go away.

127
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,056
Chun Yu, come here!

128
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,568
Go ahead and take a look.

129
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,452
Senior Brother.

130
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,450
Why is this palm print the same size as mine?

131
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,228
What's going on?

132
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,049
Six people, seven palm prints.

133
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,250
Are there other players?

134
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,870
Let's find the palm print that matches ours. Maybe we can find some clues.

135
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,189
Clues?

136
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:34,410
What if you activate a trigger?

137
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,390
If we don't try, we can't get to the next level.

138
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,809
Brother, just try it. It's just a game.

139
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,836
This one is mine.

140
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,096
Brother Qiang.

141
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,889
Brother, press it.

142
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:32,430
Nothing.

143
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,549
You did it too fast.

144
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:36,830
It doesn't count.

145
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,050
Didn't I press it? I did.

146
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,169
Press it a little longer.

147
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:41,776
Be careful!

148
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,420

149
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,120
Hello?

150
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:27,569
This special effect is nicely made.

151
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,090
What are you up to now?

152
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,356
Senior Brother, don't be so nervous.

153
00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:35,650
Isn't she just a Non-Player Character  (NPC) ? She can't literally eat me, can she?

154
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,730
The game is activated.

155
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,710
Please choose a person to get in the coffin.

156
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,190
Please choose who will get in the coffin before the incense burns out.

157
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,970
The game begins.

158
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,892

159
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:01,930
Wait a minute. She didn't explain why we have to choose a person to get in the coffin.

160
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,890
What's in the coffin? What if I don't choose?

161
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,169
Someone will die. What else could possibly happen?

162
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,669
I suggest you listen to me.

163
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:26,169
I think this incense burns very fast,

164
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:27,969
so let's not waste any time.

165
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,910
I say we vote for one person by raising our hands.

166
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,050
I know you have a lot of misconceptions about me right now,

167
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,370
but I must tell you I've been fierce all my life.

168
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,050
I've always been fighting, at least a thousand times.

169
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,930
The best option for the team is to leave me out.

170
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,569
We should choose the weakest one to get in that coffin.

171
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,212
That makes sense, doesn't it?

172
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:04,609
Chun Yu, you know I'm afraid of the dark.

173
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:07,170
Please don't make me get in.

174
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,330
Wait. Then you can't choose me.

175
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,650
I grew up being beaten by my dad, so I'm very tough.

176
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,910
You need someone to take hits for you, right?

177
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,449
So, Senior Brother, Chun Yu,

178
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:22,730
Chun Yu's classmate, and the cafeteria supervisor.

179
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,090
You can call me Mr. Lin.

180
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,650
Mr. Lin, classmates, please don't choose me.

181
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,069
 Oh no! They are all from the same school.

182
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,730
 They will definitely choose me to get in the coffin.

183
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,950
Look at the incense. Let's not waste time.

184
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:42,950
Right now, it's a little spooky out there.

185
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,490
It's probably safer to be in there.

186
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,188
You should keep the strong one out here to help you.

187
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:50,749
We should choose the weakest one now.

188
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,110
I think it makes sense.

189
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,949
The weakest person here…

190
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,429
Hurry up, let's not delay.

191
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,189
The incense will burn out. Let's choose one!

192
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:20,909
Chun Yu, do you agree?

193
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,372
Qing You!

194
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:56,730
 Time is up. The game begins.

195
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,390
 Mission: Eliminate the evil spirits.

196
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,670
Chun Yu, why did you lock me inside?

197
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:10,169
 Qing You, your friends don't want you anymore.

198
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,689
 You were left behind.

199
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:17,329
 Your best friend, Chun Yu, doesn't want you.

200
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,810
 Stay here and keep me company.

201
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,770
Let me out! Let me out!

202
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,770
That's it? Speak clearly.

203
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,550
What evil spirits?

204
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,650
Senior Brother, what is that? Is that the evil spirit?

205
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,510
Be careful. Dodge it!

206
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:58,310
 Qing You, Qing You.

207
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,890
 Let me out! Is anybody here?

208
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,390
 They're all the same. They just bully you.

209
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,430
 No one cares about your feelings.

210
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,549
 Just like Chun Yu. She doesn't care if you live or die.

211
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,208
 Let me out.

212
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:27,649
 Let me out! Chun Yu, let me out!

213
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:30,649
Let me out!

214
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:47,448
Uncle Lin.

215
00:20:58,276 --> 00:21:00,630
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

216
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,809
- Uncle Lin, are you all right? 
 - I'm okay.

217
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:32,390
So this thing's weakness is the head.

218
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,710
This evil spirit doesn't seem very powerful.

219
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,609
I feel I could take another one down.

220
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,250
What did you say?

221
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:28,772
Attack the head!

222
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:48,792

223
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:08,050

224
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:22,129
Thank you, pretty girl.

225
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:24,890
Just a small favor, don't mention it.

226
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,330
My name is Yang Bawan.

227
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,584
What's your name?

228
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,760
Dou Dou.

229
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:47,450
The first and last names are both "Dou." That's a nice name.

230
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,649
Let me out!

231
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,810
Let me out!

232
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:11,329
Let me out!

233
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:14,410
Chun Yu, you know I'm afraid of the dark.

234
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:19,010
Why did you lock me in here? Chun Yu!

235
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:46,730
 The evil spirits have been eliminated.  Level up.

236
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:53,404
I'm sorry.

237
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:58,510
I'll get you a glass of water.

238
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,870
Yesterday's boiled water is unhealthy.

239
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:39,750
Drink this fresh one instead.

240
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,404
Thank you.

241
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:47,448
   .

242
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:58,149
 Congratulations on surviving over 20 hours on the 19th Floor.

243
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,030
 Tianji Science and Technology sincerely invites you

244
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,630
 to attend the 19th Floor Trial Play Signing Event

245
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,350
 at 188 East Tianhe Road.

246
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,196
Do you want to go?

247
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:19,049
However, this could be a trap.

248
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,250
If we don't go, we'll never know the truth.

249
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,796
I'll go with you.

250
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,009
She didn't come back last night?

251
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,910
Why don't you call her? Find out where she is.

252
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,204

253
00:28:09,664 --> 00:28:10,689
There is no need.

254
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:15,690
Why don't you let me sleep in on weekends?

255
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,200

256
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,144
 My name is Dou Dou.

257
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,028
 Bawan.

258
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,469
I might be in love.

259
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:50,170
Are you still asleep? A'yong, it's broad daylight.

260
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,264
Would you like some milk?

261
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:14,410
Would you like some large bananas, your favorite?

262
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,970
You're not pretending.

263
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:43,310
Brother, are you... Is it about the game?

264
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:48,150
Promise me that you will get well soon.

265
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,130
Do you hear me? I don't have a lot of money now,

266
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,790
but I'll pay your medical bills no matter what.

267
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,530
Trust me.

268
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,650
 Congratulations on surviving over 20 hours on the 19th Floor.

269
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,450
 Tianji Science and Technology sincerely invites you

270
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,189
 to attend the 19th Floor Trial Play Signing Event

271
00:32:12,189 --> 00:32:15,390
 at 188 East Tianhe Road.

272
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,010
Here you are, and I haven't dealt with you yet.

273
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:29,409
Brother, I'll take care of your medical bills.

274
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:32,364

275
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,904
Chun Yu.

276
00:32:44,836 --> 00:32:46,310

277
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,050
The test report is clear. There are no chips or anything like that.

278
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,230

279
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,029
So how did we enter the game?

280
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:59,469
I can't think of any other possibilities for now.

281
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:03,889
Maybe we can find something at the signing event.

282
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,949
Qing You.

283
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:08,489
Our results are the same.

284
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,336
Dr. Jia.

285
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:12,152
Isn't that your friend?

286
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:15,029
L-Let's go outside and talk.

287
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:32,129
You depend on your classmate Chun Yu.

288
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:40,569
Chun Yu is also strong, brave,

289
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:45,089
and always protects and makes me feel safe.

290
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,904
So I really depend on her.

291
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:55,836
Do you know why Chun Yu is close to that guy?

292
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,070
Maybe this guy is strong as well.

293
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,149
Instead of holding them back, they can benefit from each other.

294
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,110
 Gao Xuan, switch the tag!

295
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,510
 The tag will automatically return to the person who has none.

296
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,890
 We just took advantage of that.

297
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,790
That is why a strong person is willing to unite with another strong person.

298
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,150
 The weakest person here…

299
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,316
 Chun Yu, why did you lock me inside? Let me out!

300
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:30,090
So you mean I should become stronger,

301
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,370
instead of holding her back?

302
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,550

303
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:58,570

304
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:03,088
♫  I go from running  ♫

00:36:57,636 --> 00:37:02,032
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

331
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:05,820
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

332
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,940
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

333
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:14,161
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

334
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:17,892
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

335
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:20,708
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

336
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,236
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

337
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:25,888
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

338
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,920
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

339
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,532
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

340
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:35,418
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

341
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:41,756
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫
