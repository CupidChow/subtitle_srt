00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Team Credit

2
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:56,708

3
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,752

4
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,524
What should we do, Chun Yu?

5
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:15,535
I'm begging you. Please don't come near me. I'm begging you.

6
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:18,872
Brother Qiang.

7
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:47,915
- Run! 
 - Run!

8
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:50,735
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

9
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:00,784
- This way. 
 - The area is blocked.

10
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:03,515
Hurry up. Move!

11
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,144
Open it.

12
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,155
No!

13
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,136
Get up now! Quickly!

14
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:22,195
Follow me. Hurry!

15
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:23,668
Okay.

16
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:27,035
Move!

17
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:28,860
Brother Qiang.

18
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:03,834
Hey, buddy. You seem to know this place.

19
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:06,915
I came here before you. Of course, I know this place better than you.

20
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,595
I wonder if you've noticed

21
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:11,874
the half map on the first floor back wall.

22
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:15,095
How can you use it if there is only one half?

23
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:19,454
That half of the map is the structure of this building.

24
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:22,155
So did you prepare those cabinets in advance?

25
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:23,696
What if I didn't?

26
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,400
This way.

27
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,080

28
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:30,712
Come in.

29
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:32,276
A'Yong, come in.

30
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:33,955
Hurry up!

31
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,815
Close the door. Close it.

32
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,896
Chun Yu, what is this place?

33
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:51,155
Why is it so scary?

34
00:04:55,415 --> 00:05:00,435
 I think we had a car accident and went to the hospital.

35
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:06,154
What kind of place do you think this is?

36
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:17,915
I've actually been thinking about this, too.

37
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:19,794
I think there are two possibilities.

38
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:23,072
First, this is not the real world.

39
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,955
You are right. That's what Brother Qiang said, too.

40
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,794
Excuse me.

41
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,014
What do you mean, it's not the real world?

42
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,674
It's another dimension or a parallel universe.

43
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:36,535
It looks like the world we live in, but it's completely different.

44
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:37,555
Just think about it.

45
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:41,594
Those shadow puppet monsters don't exist in real life.

46
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:44,454
Exactly. That's what Brother Qiang said.

47
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:46,214
That's too bizarre.

48
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:47,594
I don't believe it.

49
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:49,314
What about the second possibility?

50
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:52,314
Second, this is still the real world,

51
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:54,334
and this could be a prank.

52
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,934
Those puppet monsters could be controlled by a special device,

53
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:59,395
a magic trick, or a deception.

54
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,175
That's what Hei Er usually likes.

55
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:03,695
He follows several bloggers who do magic tricks.

56
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:07,455
Maybe your friend Hei Er is part of this.

57
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:10,154
So you mean Hei Er is actually fine,

58
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:11,714
and he's just trying to scare us?

59
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:12,635
Maybe.

60
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:14,300
No way.

61
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,674
I saw him. He is really dead.

62
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:22,835
Hei Er wouldn't be…

63
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:25,554
Don't listen to her.

64
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,955
Trust me. Hei Er is definitely fine.

65
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:31,935
Whether it's the real world or another dimension,

66
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,134
the question is how did we get here?

67
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:37,775
We were hospitalized after a car accident.

68
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:39,576
What about you?

69
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,495
I wasn't in the hospital.

70
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:47,595
I was in my dorm.

71
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,514
What were you doing before you came here?

72
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:55,495
I was asleep and found myself here when I woke up.

73
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,694
That's highly suspicious.

74
00:06:57,694 --> 00:07:01,515
If you say this is a prank, I don't think it's Hei Er who's playing tricks.

75
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:03,464
It's you.

76
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:21,495
What's this?

77
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:23,424
Let's take a look.

78
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,880
Six bags.

79
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,794
There are six of us.

80
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:48,394
Do you remember how the elevator button number was also "19"?

81
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:51,134
If this is the real world,

82
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:54,995
then this must be organized and planned.

83
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:57,415
This "19" could be a code name for a group.

84
00:07:57,415 --> 00:08:01,075
They led us here while we were asleep and organized a…

85
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:03,204
A Battle Royale?

86
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:09,755
Are there cameras watching us?

87
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,435
There seem to be no cameras.

88
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:14,895
First, let's see what's inside.

89
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,155
Right. Six bags, one per person.

90
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,580

91
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,634
Chun Yu, mine seems useless.

92
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,854
Mine doesn't seem useful either.

93
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:14,554
- Brother, the map. 
 - Take it for now.

94
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:21,195
Everyone, all the items in our bags should be useful.

95
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:25,114
So we have to work together to escape.

96
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,384
Right.

97
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:29,194
I think you're right.

98
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:32,694
We're a team now. We have to help each other

99
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:35,136
and share resources, right?

100
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:36,624
Of course.

101
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:39,328
What do you think?

102
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:44,772
Sure.

103
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:46,716
I wonder...

104
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,654
if I could take a look at your map.

105
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:51,156
Sure.

106
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,900
Trade yours for mine.

107
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,488
Fine.

108
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:02,054
But I have two things here.

109
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:04,100
How about this? You pick one.

110
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll put them behind my back, one in each hand.

111
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,400
You choose yourself.

112
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,200
Fair enough, right?

113
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,392
Yes.

114
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,715
Chun Yu, beware of his tricks.

115
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:15,030
All right.

116
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,410
Then go ahead.

117
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:21,076
Left or right?

118
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:22,664
Take your pick.

119
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
Left.

120
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,696
Take out the map.

121
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,890

122
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:57,810
You definitely switched hands.

123
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,930

124
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,334
Chun Yu.

125
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:29,275
What should we do? They've taken the map.

126
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:31,434
How do we get out?

127
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:38,235
So you've figured out how light works?

128
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:39,615
 Shadow puppet monsters are afraid of light?

129
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,900
What does he mean by that?

130
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,635
I think Chun Yu must have known that he would make that switch.

131
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:00,975
No matter which hand she chose, he would always keep the axe.

132
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,700
So you figured out how light works against those shadow puppet monsters,

133
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,015
didn't you?

134
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:07,935
But he took our map.

135
00:13:07,935 --> 00:13:09,915
Does it help to know that the light works against the Shadow Puppet monsters?

136
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,390
We still can't get out of here.

137
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,870
This half of the map fits perfectly with the half in the hall.

138
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,895
I think Chun Yu must have already memorized it, so she traded it with him.

139
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,634
Really?

140
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:38,974
This is the complete map.

141
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:42,015
All the exits are closed.

142
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,264
Maybe there is no exit.

143
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:48,794
What are the places A and B?

144
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,034
Power Control Room.

145
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:54,275
They can turn on all the lights of the building.

146
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:57,795
This would immobilize all shadow puppet monsters.

147
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,476
Good idea.

148
00:14:00,515 --> 00:14:02,814
You have a flashlight and I have a candle.

149
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:04,754
Let's split up.

150
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:06,375
I'll go to A, and you'll go to B.

151
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,024
Okay.

152
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:15,355
Chun Yu, I'll join you.

153
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,875
It may not be practical if there are many people.

154
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,495
It's safer to stay here. How about this?

155
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:20,484
We'll go together.

156
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:28,075
Chun Yu, be careful.

157
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,550
Take this with you

158
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:34,512
Let's go.

159
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:42,015
I still don't understand it.

160
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,095
What kind of glass is this?

161
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,535
Even an axe can't break it.

162
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,075
Brother. Wh-Wh-What should we do now?

163
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:06,834
We still can't get out of here.

164
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,530

165
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:19,300
Say this word for me.

166
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,600
- Say it. 
 - Exit.

167
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:26,895
- Wh-What does this mean? 
 - What?

168
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,835
I think it means it's blocked.

169
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,794
T-Then what should we do?

170
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:37,835
Don't worry. I'll take another look.

171
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,294
Qing You.

172
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:23,515
Uncle.

173
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:26,114
They've been gone so long. Why haven't we heard from them?

174
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:28,352
They haven't come back.

175
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,100
They left less than five minutes ago.

176
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,335
Don't worry, girl.

177
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:34,114
But I'm worried about Chun Yu.

178
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:37,534
Don't worry. She has a candle.

179
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,300
Right.

180
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:49,135
Did Chun Yu come back?

181
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,354
Chun Yu.

182
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:58,634
Chun Yu, is that you?

183
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,272
Chun Yu.

184
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,175
Say something.

185
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:12,120
Chun Yu.

186
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:24,552
Matches.

187
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:33,700
Girl. Matches, matches!

188
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,254
Lad, did you find the Power Control Room?

189
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:10,974
Not yet, Uncle.

190
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,435
I just saw a shadow puppet coming your way,

191
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:15,800
so I came to check on you.

192
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,614
I'm glad you came,

193
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,774
or else, the girl and I would be in danger.

194
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,135
On my way here,

195
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,095
I just saw the shadow puppets on the wall come to life.

196
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,700
This is dangerous.

197
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,995
What about Chun Yu?

198
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:39,794
Chun Yu will be fine, won't she?

199
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:40,935
I hope so.

200
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:42,300
 Don't! Don't chase me.

201
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,600
Help!

202
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,400
Help!

203
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,595
- Go, go, go! 
 - Brother.

204
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,794
Look at that shadow puppet monster.

205
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:15,324
Brother.

206
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:19,275
So we'll just go to the Power Control Room, turn on the switch,

207
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:21,874
and all these lights will come on, right?

208
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,215
When the lights are on,

209
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,074
all those shadow puppet monsters will turn into shadow puppets,

210
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:29,415
and then we could escape, right?

211
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,435
We could get out of here.

212
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:34,820
You two have weapons and a map. You can fight your way out.

213
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,755
Don't follow us.

214
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:38,664
No, there are five of us now. We're a team.

215
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:40,714
We need to focus on teamwork.

216
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:43,824
Why don't you talk about teamwork when you're stealing our things?

217
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,395
They may not accept us.

218
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,494
We have to figure it out on our own.

219
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:56,354
Should we go then?

220
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:58,895
Go? Where?

221
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:00,414
Go die?

222
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:03,035
Get the flashlight, you idiot.

223
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:07,795
Wouldn't that be unfair to them?

224
00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:10,935
Do you want to be a bad guy or a corpse?

225
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:13,432
Listen.

226
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:15,994
You go deal with that brat,

227
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:18,135
and I'll snatch his flashlight.

228
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,335
Then it's all over.

229
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:34,572
- Back off. 
 - Watch out for the axe.

230
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:37,414
Give me that thing. Give it to me.

231
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:39,794
Brother Qiang, why didn't you do anything?

232
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:41,392
I did.

233
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,175
Only against a different target.

234
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:46,812
Back off.

235
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:54,600
Come on, Brother. Let's make a deal.

236
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,148
All right.

237
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,615
I'll count down from three. We let go at the same time.

238
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:00,895
All I want is your flashlight. I don't need him.

239
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:02,384
Give it to me.

240
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:05,016
- Don't move. 
 - Don't move.

241
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:07,254
I can give you the flashlight,

242
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:09,615
but you have to give up the axe.

243
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:11,554
Fine.

244
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:13,554
Give me the flashlight, and I'll give you the axe.

245
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:15,355
I'll count down from three.

246
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:17,255
We'll throw the items at each other at the same time.

247
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:19,020
How's that?

248
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,460
Okay.

249
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:27,675
Three.

250
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:29,364
Two.

251
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:32,180
One.

252
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,295
As expected.

253
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:37,594
Brother, you don't keep your word, either.

254
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:40,235
Then don't blame me…

255
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,140
- Don't move. 
 - I'll do it.

256
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,344
I'll do it.

257
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:46,172
Give it to me.

258
00:22:58,432 --> 00:23:00,152
Brother.

259
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:06,035
Axe, axe.

260
00:23:10,752 --> 00:23:12,776
Brother. Brother.

261
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:14,112
A'Yong.

262
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:15,700
Brother.

263
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:19,475
How about we make a deal?

264
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:21,104
The flashlight.

265
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:24,236
Give it to me.

266
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:27,412
Brother.

267
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:33,114
I'm sorry, Brother.

268
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:34,035
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:36,935
Brother, Brother!

270
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,314
Are you okay?

271
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:49,215
Is so-called brotherhood just about using one other?

272
00:23:49,215 --> 00:23:52,814
With such a friend, he also has no choice.

273
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:56,355
Hey, take care of yourself.

274
00:23:57,314 --> 00:23:59,634
Uncle, this way.

275
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:27,434
Ghost!

276
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,212
Shut up. Keep your voice down.

277
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:33,028
Brother. Why did you come back?

278
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:35,074
Nonsense. Of course, I would come back.

279
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:38,135
Do you think I, Zhang Tianqiang, would betray a friend?

280
00:24:38,715 --> 00:24:39,744
Let's go.

281
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,874
I knew it.

282
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:43,268
Brother.

283
00:24:43,268 --> 00:24:45,995
Don't hug me, it's hot.

284
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,592
See?

285
00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:52,435
That was a brave and strategic move.

286
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:54,136
We got the flashlight.

287
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:56,014
I will lead you out now.

288
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,760
Okay.

289
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,955
Don't worry.

290
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:03,494
I won't let you die, even at the cost of my life.

291
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:05,240
Let's go.

292
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:29,014
- Matches. 
 - Matches.

293
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,052
Chun Yu.

294
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:27,960
It's you.

295
00:26:35,935 --> 00:26:37,614
The number of shadow puppet monsters will only increase.

296
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:39,615
Let's go to the Power Control Room.

297
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:42,172
Let's go.

298
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:13,552
Brother, why do we keep going in circles?

299
00:27:13,552 --> 00:27:17,015
Do you even know the location of the Power Control Room?

300
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:19,815
Why do we have to look for the Power Control Room?

301
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:22,494
Shouldn't we turn on the building lights?

302
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:24,214
What if I find the way out?

303
00:27:24,214 --> 00:27:25,695
We could just get out of here.

304
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:28,095
But all the exits on the map are blocked.

305
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:30,234
The map just showed that,

306
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,196
but what if the map is lying?

307
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:34,008
Right.

308
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,290

309
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:45,995
Power Distribution Center.

310
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:52,784
Let's go.

311
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:05,455
Why are there so many power switches?

312
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,394
It's okay. Let's turn them on one by one.

313
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,488
Let's go.

314
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,712
I found it.

315
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,276
I found it.

316
00:28:42,715 --> 00:28:44,814
Okay, okay.

317
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,995
We found the Power Distribution Center.

318
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:53,695
After we get out of here, I'll take you for a foot massage.

319
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:56,015
Okay, but Brother…

320
00:28:56,015 --> 00:28:58,815
T-The flashlight is running out of power.

321
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,954
No worries.

322
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:08,455
In a moment, I will turn on all the lights here.

323
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,004
Okay.

324
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:26,275
What if the last one still doesn't work?

325
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,315
Why aren't the lights on?

326
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:38,634
This means the switch for the lights could be in another Power Control Room.

327
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:52,016
Close the door. Close the door.

328
00:29:57,554 --> 00:30:00,004
Don't worry. I am here.

329
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:02,635
- Don't panic. 
 - Okay.

330
00:30:05,316 --> 00:30:06,936
Brother.

331
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:17,774
Grab something.

332
00:30:58,895 --> 00:31:00,135
Chun Yu.

333
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:03,254
The candle is burning out. What should we do?

334
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:05,834
We can't keep it this way.

335
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:12,235
Is there another Power Control Room?

336
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,575
Chun Yu.

337
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:17,015
Is the real switch in another Power Control Room?

338
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:24,015
Brother.

339
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,375
Brother. Hurry, hurry.

340
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:30,280
I found it. I found it.

341
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,024
I'll do it.

342
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:39,894
As long as we have hope in our hearts,

343
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:46,535
we will surely see the light.

344
00:31:53,314 --> 00:31:54,496
The fan.

345
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,355
Block the draft!

346
00:31:57,955 --> 00:32:01,275
What is this place? Is it trying to kill us?

347
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:04,395
I get it. It's Brother Qiang.

348
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:07,435
They must have gone to another Power Control Room and turned on the switch.

349
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:09,974
What good is that, Chun Yu? Only the fan is on.

350
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:11,755
That's very useful.

351
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:13,974
Suppose they have the fan switch.

352
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,914
This means the light switch may still be here.

353
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:18,915
Let's search carefully.

354
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:21,464
Let's go.

355
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:24,594
We can't let it extinguish.

356
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:45,124

357
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:48,224
I found it!

358
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:54,114
It still doesn't work.

359
00:32:56,794 --> 00:32:57,955
There's no fuse.

360
00:32:57,955 --> 00:33:00,615
It doesn't have to be a fuse. It could be a metal wire.

361
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:02,694
Anything works as long as it connects the circuit. I'll look around.

362
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:04,176
Okay.

363
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,174
The forces of darkness are too strong,

364
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:17,094
and we are too weak.

365
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:26,354
They are here, brother! They are coming.

366
00:33:26,354 --> 00:33:27,575
Help, Brother!

367
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:30,144
- Hurry! 
 - Get the light. Stay away!

368
00:33:30,144 --> 00:33:32,268
The shadow puppet monsters are coming.

369
00:33:35,335 --> 00:33:38,515
Stay away. Stay away.

370
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:41,815
The candle is about to go out.

371
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:43,694
Uncle Lin, get the matches from my pocket.

372
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:46,594
- Matches! 
 - Hold on!

373
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,835
- Matches! 
 - Hurry up!

374
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:10,536
I found it!

375
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:13,314
Look! This is it.

376
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:18,675
Go away!

377
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:44,428
Hurry up!

378
00:34:54,114 --> 00:34:56,296
You do this, and I'll go.

379
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,580

380
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,630

381
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:30,500

382
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:35,072
♫  I go from running  ♫

383
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:38,496
♫  To flying  ♫

384
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:42,554
♫  Through setbacks and hardship  ♫

385
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:46,012
♫  So what?  ♫

386
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:49,696
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

387
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:53,297
♫  It shines on my face  ♫

388
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:56,940
♫  Unwilling to lose hope  ♫

389
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,235
♫  I only want to bloom  ♫

390
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:05,460
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

391
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,040
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

392
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,190
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

393
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:20,024
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

394
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:24,056
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

395
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:29,140
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

396
00:39:30,388 --> 00:39:32,329
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

397
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:36,108
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

398
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,836
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

399
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:41,460
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

400
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,052
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

401
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:47,016
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

402
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:50,796
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

403
00:39:50,796 --> 00:39:53,492
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

404
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:59,848
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

405
00:40:15,092 --> 00:40:19,380
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫
