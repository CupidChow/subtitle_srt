1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,010

2
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:56,708

3
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,648

4
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:03,808

5
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:07,586
 Let the game begin.

6
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:13,786
Then… Who will go first?

7
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:19,887
Let me try it for you.

8
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:33,027
 Player confirmed. Nian Sulan, here are the questions.

9
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:38,366
 Do you tend to feel superior to others?

10
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,646
Not so much,

11
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:43,967
but honestly, I'm from a wealthy family.

12
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:47,566
I have good grades, and I'm the student council president,

13
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:51,187
so I do feel superior to an extent.

14
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:52,992
I admit it.

15
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,696
 Verifying…

16
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:02,106
 That is the truth.

17
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,467
 Question two.

18
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,647
Another one?

19
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:15,006
 I noticed the person you hate the most is here.

20
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:18,107
 Please say their name.

21
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:32,706
I only see my dear juniors,

22
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:34,607
the senior I respect,

23
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:37,646
and a kind uncle here.

24
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,887
I do not hate anyone here.

25
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,366
 Really? Are you sure?

26
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,466
Of course.

27
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:50,047
 This is your final warning. Liars will be severely punished.

28
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:54,827
Senior Sister, in this game, you have to tell the truth.

29
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:58,027
Nian Sulan, this game is much more dangerous than you think.

30
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:59,307
Think twice before you answer.

31
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,407
Yes, don't lie.

32
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,086
Players who die in the game fall into a coma in real life.

33
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:07,147
Who says I'm lying? If you want me to quit, just say so.

34
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,967
Don't make things up to scare me.

35
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,147
 Verifying…

36
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:19,426
 That is a lie.

37
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,227
On what grounds? I didn't lie.

38
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,127
What a lousy game. So boring.

39
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:34,727
This project wouldn't pass brainstorming at my dad's company.

40
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,620
 Yay!

41
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,512
Senior Sister?

42
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:05,747
Yan Mingliang, you're going too far.

43
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,607
 Who's Yan Mingliang?

44
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,436
Stop pretending.

45
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,607
 My identity is not your concern.

46
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:14,750
 Just focus on the game.

47
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,500
 Continue.

48
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:22,486
 - Chun Yu! 
 - Chun Yu! 
 - Chun Yu!

49
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:24,947
Chun Yu, let us talk first.

50
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,386
 Players confirmed. Chun Yu. Lin Yongfu.

51
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:31,326
- Old Gao. 
 - How is this already confirmed?

52
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:34,287
 All other players, please stay back.

53
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:40,966
Chun Yu, Uncle Lin, be very careful.

54
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:49,986
 Question one. Have you lost your most beloved person?

55
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:01,076
Yes.

56
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:03,627
Yes.

57
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:07,487
 Verifying… That is the truth.

58
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:14,087
 Question two. Were you involved in this person's death?

59
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:19,026
 Mom…

60
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:26,167
 Mom…

61
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,627
 Please answer.

62
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:35,306
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

63
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:38,987
 Verifying… That is the truth.

64
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:47,167
 Question three. Who do you hate the most?

65
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:53,267
 Yes, your affairs are important. Your child isn't important.

66
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:56,727
 I'm even less important to you, right?

67
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,067
 Who do you hate? Such a simple question.

68
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:06,187
 It's not so hard. Please answer truthfully.

69
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:14,026
C-Chun Yu, Uncle Lin, hurry up. Say it.

70
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,807
Yes, Chun Yu, why are you hesitating?

71
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:18,147
Answer the question.

72
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:24,216
 Countdown. Three.

73
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:26,807
 Two.

74
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:28,307
Chun Yu!

75
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:30,647
 One! Your time is up!

76
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:32,576
- Chun Yu. 
 - Uncle Lin.

77
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,027
- Chun Yu. 
 - Chun Yu.

78
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:36,072
Uncle Lin.

79
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:39,466
What did you do to them?

80
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:43,466
 They refused to answer and had to be punished.

81
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:59,847
Never mind, Chun Yu. Forget about that question.

82
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,672
Are you okay, Uncle Lin?

83
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:06,727
I'm fine. I have arthritis, anyway.

84
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:10,206
Now it is painful from the fall. It's like fighting fire with fire.

85
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:12,346
Here. Let me help you.

86
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:18,827
How does it feel?

87
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:21,067
It's okay.

88
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,647
Let's go.

89
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:25,768
Let me help you.

90
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:41,867
What is that? It's glowing.

91
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,727
It may contain phosphorus.

92
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,552
Let's go to the left.

93
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:08,527
 Those two players entered the maze of tunnels.

94
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,147
Are they all right?

95
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:13,586
 In order to level up, they must escape from the tunnels.

96
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,627
 All other players, continue the game.

97
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,566
Will we get lost?

98
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:41,007
All the passages look similar.

99
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,327
The wind blows this way.

100
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,126
The exit is probably this way.

101
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,904
Okay.

102
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,368
It made such a fuss and threw us down here.

103
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:58,287
I thought there would be some terrifying traps,

104
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:00,424
but there's nothing.

105
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:03,912
What's wrong, Chun Yu?

106
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:08,287
Uncle Lin, I think you were right to be worried.

107
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:10,786
This should be some kind of punishment.

108
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:12,527
We didn't answer the question,

109
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,307
which means we didn't follow the rules.

110
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,660
However, the game continues.

111
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,000
There must be more to it.

112
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:53,227
What happened? Are you okay?

113
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:03,096
Let's go! Hurry!

114
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:16,240
 Player confirmed. Gao Xuan.

115
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,640
 Here are the questions.

116
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,206
 Ever since you entered the game,

117
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:24,187
 you've been keeping secrets.

118
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:27,347
 You know a lot about how 19th Floor works,

119
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:32,127
 but you're keeping it a secret. Yes or no?

120
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,376
Yes.

121
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:55,086
 Verifying… That is the truth.

122
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,787
 Next, it's Xu Wenya's turn.

123
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:01,686
He's free after only one question?

124
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:14,747
Why didn't you tell us about it?

125
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:26,387
 Question one. Are you a selfish person?

126
00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:34,832
Yes.

127
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,826
 Verifying… That is the truth.

128
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:42,907
 Question two. Let's say there are only two ways to escape.

129
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:47,167
 Would you let everyone else die, or die yourself?

130
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:51,906
 Would you choose for all the others to die? Yes or no?

131
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:01,947
- No… 
  - Final warning.

132
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,746
 Liars will be severely punished.

133
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,506
Why would I let them die?

134
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,607
We've been through so much together

135
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:22,207
and we've become real teammates.

136
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:25,866
Be it in the game or reality,

137
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:29,087
- they've been helping… 
  - Countdown.

138
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:33,686
 Three.

139
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:35,527
I-I don't know!

140
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,927
 Two.

141
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:40,906
 One.

142
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:43,107
Yes! Yes!

143
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:46,027
 "Yes" what? Make it clear.

144
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:51,640
If…

145
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,700
I had to decide,

146
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:01,627
whether to let everyone else die or die myself,

147
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,228
I would choose

148
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,896
to let them die.

149
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:21,186
 Verifying… That is the truth.

150
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:33,686
 Dou Dou, it's your turn.

151
00:14:54,786 --> 00:15:00,007
 Question one. Do you think Yang Bawan is a coward?

152
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:03,567
 Yes or no?

153
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,984
Yes.

154
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:20,606
 Verifying… That is the truth.

155
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,227
 Question two.

156
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:25,866
 Can you accept Yang Bawan as your boyfriend?

157
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:29,267
 Yes or no?

158
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:45,306
 Answer me!

159
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:55,706
Wait. Let me answer the third one.

160
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,887
 Countdown.

161
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,832
 Three.

162
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,248
 Two.

163
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,116
Wait.

164
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,367
This question is a trap.

165
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,606
Xiaoqin, ignore him.

166
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,424
Save all your questions for me.

167
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:22,767
When it's my turn, I won't answer any of them.

168
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:27,486
 I'm warning you. You will be punished for that.

169
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,287
Then just punish me.

170
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:33,047
Your questions are nothing but nonsense.

171
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:34,427
I am a coward. So what?

172
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,687
Everybody knows that.

173
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,587
But I can be brave for my friends.

174
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:40,486
Secondly, why does it matter if she can accept me?

175
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:44,106
What matters is that I like her, and that is enough.

176
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:48,907
Have you ever been loved in your life?

177
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,087
Do you even know what love is?

178
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:52,667
Let me guess what's next.

179
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:55,587
Will you ask if she can let me die to survive?

180
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:59,027
You only dare hide behind a screen and ask stupid questions.

181
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:03,087
What else can you do besides cause trouble?

182
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:15,427
Hurry up.

183
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,427
Chun Yu, your hand.

184
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:39,046
Chun Yu, give…  Give me your hand.

185
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:40,860
Hold on tight.

186
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:52,116
That was close.

187
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:56,807
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

188
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:03,656
You're bleeding.

189
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:05,386
It's okay. Let's go.

190
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:06,900
Don't move.

191
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,460
Bear with it.

192
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:25,852
Come on.

193
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:29,406
Let me help you up. Slowly.

194
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:42,207
Keep walking. Don't look at it.

195
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:52,647
Sometimes we need to acknowledge a wound

196
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:56,767
and wrap it up to feel better.

197
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:04,166
 Have you lost your most beloved person?

198
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,867
Thank you, Uncle Lin.

199
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:11,467
What for? You've always helped me.

200
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:15,306
And Xiao Gao. He is a good guy,

201
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:18,586
smart, upright, and kind.

202
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:21,367
He's a few years older than all of you, and your senior.

203
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:25,686
Sometimes he ignores you when he cares about everyone else,

204
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:30,806
but I see clearly that you are most important to him.

205
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:35,866
All couples fight at times.

206
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:38,927
These misunderstandings can be easily resolved.

207
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,567
Just talk things through. Chun Yu.

208
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:46,847
It is still bleeding. Should we rest for a while?

209
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:49,446
It's fine, Uncle Lin.

210
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:53,707
Let's find the exit before I pass out, or we'll be in trouble.

211
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:55,707
Fine, let's go.

212
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:01,966
Don't fall asleep.

213
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:04,167
If you do, it will be bothersome.

214
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,546
Let me tell you about me.

215
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:08,947
Take it as a fun conversation.

216
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:16,886
We are a family of three.

217
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:21,146
I also have a daughter about your age.

218
00:20:21,146 --> 00:20:24,407
When she was a child, she used to cling to me.

219
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:30,947
We were poor back then, but we were so happy.

220
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:34,007
I think that's the definition of happiness.

221
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:40,526
I am sorry, but I think Old Gao did all that for a reason.

222
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:42,407
Also, I believe in Wenya.

223
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,246
We are all the same.

224
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,327
We all have our own lives,

225
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:51,087
and now we're living for someone else.

226
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:57,667
Do you even get it?

227
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:01,786
Xiaoqin, trust me. Don't answer his questions.

228
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:09,526
From now on, no one will answer your questions.

229
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:14,640
Bawan is right.

230
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,566
I won't answer any of your questions.

231
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:19,906
Me neither.

232
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:23,490
 Fine, since you chose the hard way,

233
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,960
 then don't blame me.

234
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:35,626
Those lights on the door are lie detectors, right?

235
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:38,820
 Of course.

236
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:43,386
These lights cannot tell if we lie.

237
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,516
Am I right?

238
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:49,246
 Excuse me. The rules say I get to ask the questions.

239
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:50,946
 Not you.

240
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:54,407
Fine, let's repeat the rules.

241
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:56,446
"Answer the questions."

242
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:59,887
"Liars will be severely punished."

243
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:03,167
But you didn't specify who would ask questions.

244
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,847
You asked us some questions.

245
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:07,707
We can ask you questions, too.

246
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:12,686
Please answer truthfully.

247
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:16,286
These lights cannot tell if we lie.

248
00:22:16,286 --> 00:22:19,726
Yes or no?

249
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:21,707
 No.

250
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,306
You're lying.

251
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:25,286
 Who are you to say so?

252
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:29,567
All your questions were about our inner demons,

253
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:32,367
But those were "yes" or "no" questions.

254
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:36,246
Human emotions are complicated. Nothing is clear.

255
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:38,206
You kept pressuring us.

256
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:42,007
In that case, we couldn't have told the truth.

257
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:45,707
 - You cannot prove it.  
 - Of course, I can.

258
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:50,546
For example, Xu Wenya said that if she had to decide

259
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:54,246
whether to let everyone else die or die herself

260
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:56,626
she would sacrifice us.

261
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,147
But she wouldn't do that.

262
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:02,926
 She admitted it.

263
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:05,726
Are you sure?

264
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:09,366
 Can you accept Yang Bawan as your boyfriend?

265
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:12,766
 Yes or no?

266
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,066
 Wait. Let me answer the third one.

267
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:23,087
At the moment, Wenya wanted to take Xiaoqin's place.

268
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:27,467
She knew she was at risk, but she still defended her.

269
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:30,666
What does that mean? She doesn't want us to die.

270
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:36,346
Her reaction proved the lights were wrong.

271
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:43,927
You lied, so you should be punished.

272
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:47,707
It's a simple punishment. Let Chun Yu and…

273
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:50,227
 Fine, congratulations. You passed.

274
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:52,826
 Please wait behind the door.

275
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:02,446
He still won't let Chun Yu free. He gave us a different result.

276
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:05,947
Will Chun Yu and Uncle Lin be alright?

277
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:08,887
They'll be fine. Let's go.

278
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:10,516
Let's go.

279
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:21,026
Chun Yu, the exit is straight ahead.

280
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,266
Chun Yu, hang in there.

281
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:28,000
Hang in there.

282
00:24:33,647 --> 00:24:36,686
Hang in there.

283
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,356
Hang in…

284
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:48,446
Chun Yu, sit here.

285
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:53,427
Chun Yu, you can't fall asleep.

286
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:56,587
Wake up. You said you would get me out.

287
00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:59,007
Chun Yu, you can't let me die here.

288
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:01,127
Chun Yu, wake up.

289
00:26:49,056 --> 00:26:51,867
You're all here. I don't know what happened.

290
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:53,787
T-The door opened by itself.

291
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:56,227
Uncle Lin, where is Chun Yu?

292
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:01,844
Chun Yu.

293
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:27,826
Thank you for bringing Sulan here.

294
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,484
You're welcome, President Nian.

295
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,907
I was just passing by.

296
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:43,087
President Nian, you have the right to know the truth.

297
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:50,047
Your daughter didn't fall into a coma by accident.

298
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,987
It was caused by a game.

299
00:27:54,686 --> 00:27:56,672
What are you trying to say?

300
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:01,826
I believe you are familiar with 19th Floor.

301
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:14,066
Let me get to the point.

302
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:17,766
I know your company produces a special part

303
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:20,707
for a piece of pulse device

304
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:25,246
that can remove Tianji chips from the players' brains.

305
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:28,006
President Nian, Yan Mingliang won't stop.

306
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,206
Give me some parts.

307
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:34,486
I promise I will save your daughter.

308
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,960
Little Gao.

309
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:48,767
I don't know what game or device you're talking about.

310
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:53,007
I just want to be with my daughter peacefully.

311
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:04,444
I'm sure you want her to wake up as soon as possible.

312
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,566
Now, you're our only hope.

313
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:10,070
Please think about it.

314
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,160
See you next time.

315
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:29,167
Another one down.

316
00:29:30,006 --> 00:29:32,646
When is it going to end?

317
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:35,880
It's all my fault.

318
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:41,046
I should have warned her.

319
00:29:42,206 --> 00:29:45,386
If she had known how dangerous the game was,

320
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:48,320
she wouldn't have lied.

321
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,988
She would be fine.

322
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:54,227
It all happened too fast.

323
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,927
We didn't have time to stop her.

324
00:29:56,927 --> 00:30:01,010
Besides, the rules did not state what would happen to liars.

325
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,600
It's not your fault.

326
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,966
Yes, Wenya. That game is sick.

327
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:09,427
Don't… Don't be so harsh on yourself.

328
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:13,887
No, I shouldn't have told her about the helmet.

329
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:16,946
Then she wouldn't have entered the game.

330
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:19,707
I got her into this.

331
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:35,607
Come on, Xu Wenya, think about it.

332
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:38,446
Nian Sulan didn't enter the game because of you.

333
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:40,707
It was her own choice.

334
00:30:40,707 --> 00:30:42,367
We're all adults.

335
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:46,646
She made a choice and had to face the consequences.

336
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,747
- But… 
 - No "buts."

337
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,087
And stop crying.

338
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:54,986
Tears won't solve anything.

339
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:59,087
The most important thing is that we carry on.

340
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:01,807
Only if we finish the game, can we save Nian Sulan,

341
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:05,167
Brother Qiang, Qing You, and the others.

342
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:08,886
Do you understand? Pull yourself together.

343
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,776
Do you have classes later?

344
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:30,467
Yes, an elective. Appreciation of Classical Film.

345
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:36,087
Then go to class. We can discuss this later.

346
00:31:54,686 --> 00:31:56,408
See you.

347
00:32:06,346 --> 00:32:09,826
Let's go. We're going to be late too.

348
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:12,527
Bawan, wait.

349
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:22,346
Were you waiting for me outside the dorm?

350
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:27,346
I… Yes, I was waiting to go to class with you.

351
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:31,707
I know what you want to say,

352
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:34,386
and I know what you are thinking.

353
00:32:35,106 --> 00:32:38,446
Bawan, our friends are still in danger.

354
00:32:38,446 --> 00:32:41,487
There are so many challenges ahead.

355
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:45,267
I'm really not in the mood for that kind of talk.

356
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:52,927
Thank God. I thought you were going to reject me.

357
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:56,486
All right, I totally get it.

358
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:59,327
Then for now,

359
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:04,047
let's save our time and energy for the important things.

360
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:08,387
All right, I'll do as you say.

361
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,327

362
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:26,767
- This one? 
 - Uncle, I want a pancake.

363
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,367
- Okay. 
 - And two buns.

364
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:29,907
Two buns… Here.

365
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,244
And a deep-fried dough stick.

366
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,246
Here.

367
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:35,006
- Thank you, Uncle. 
 - All right.

368
00:33:35,006 --> 00:33:36,228
What would you like?

369
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:38,286
- A pancake. 
 - A pancake.

370
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:40,947
- One bun. 
 - One bun.

371
00:33:40,947 --> 00:33:42,966
- And one deep-fried dough stick. 
 - A deep-fried dough stick.

372
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:46,467
 Don't move. Chun Yu, don't fall asleep.

373
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:49,327
 If you fall asleep, it will be troublesome.

374
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:55,856
- Okay. 
 - Thanks.

375
00:33:55,856 --> 00:33:58,300
- Uncle Lin. 
 - What would you like?

376
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,627
Two vegetable buns. One bowl of soy milk.

377
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:05,807
By the way, Uncle Lin, thanks for opening the door last night.

378
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,646
Otherwise, we wouldn't have escaped.

379
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,167
That door wasn't closed to begin with.

380
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:12,246
I just pushed it open.

381
00:34:13,027 --> 00:34:17,447
This student, what would you like?

382
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:21,652
Here.

383
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:37,246
 I'm fine. I have arthritis, anyway.

384
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:41,427
 Now it is painful from the fall. It's like fighting fire with fire.

385
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,106
It's okay.

386
00:34:53,106 --> 00:34:55,146
I'm sorry. I wasn't careful.

387
00:34:55,146 --> 00:34:57,356
Let me do it.

388
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,620

389
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,556

390
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:26,646
Student, what are you doing?

391
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:31,107
I-I'm looking for the bathroom.

392
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:34,286
It's over there. That's the kitchen.

393
00:35:36,507 --> 00:35:39,527
I'm sorry, I got confused.

394
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:43,527
Were you trying to steal food?

395
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:29,876

396
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:55,126
 President Nian, you can't enter now.

397
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,488
Don't stop me.

398
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:57,912
President Nian…

399
00:37:01,526 --> 00:37:04,847
Yongcheng, what brings you here?

400
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,966
Let my daughter go.

401
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:12,727
Yongcheng, calm down. Let's talk.

402
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:14,267
What's there to talk about?

403
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:17,687
Let my daughter go today, or…

404
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,887
Or what?

405
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:53,406
 Why would a cook in a canteen need such a fancy PC?

406
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,088

407
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:04,787
You want to destroy "19th Floor"?

408
00:38:05,946 --> 00:38:08,886
Did I ask your daughter to enter the game?

409
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:12,286
Don't you know the rules?

410
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:20,220
Yongcheng.

411
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:28,867
The game is controlled by the rules.

412
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:32,324
I can't break the rules for one person.

413
00:38:32,324 --> 00:38:33,307
But my daughter…

414
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:36,126
She's only in a coma for now.

415
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:40,947
I will awaken her. Give me some time.

416
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:46,264
Okay?

417
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,680

418
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:20,936

419
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,300

420
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:49,010

421
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:53,932
♫  I go from running  ♫

422
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:57,456
