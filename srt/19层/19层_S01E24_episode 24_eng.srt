1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,980

2
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:56,727

3
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,671

4
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:35,224
 Hurry up.

5
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:54,654
 Please leave the room. I need to talk to Engineer Chun alone.

6
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:56,724
 Go.

7
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:13,694
 What are you doing?

8
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,814
 Didn't I cancel the test?

9
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:18,895
 Don't you realize this is very dangerous?

10
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,595
 Xiao Chun, listen.

11
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:25,834
 He gave many sound reasons, but I couldn't hear any of them.

12
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:28,015
 No matter what happens,

13
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:32,915
 he cannot endanger the player's safety.

14
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:37,075
 We had a big fight and ended up on bad terms,

15
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:41,708
 but I never expected he would betray me

16
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,054
 and kick me off the project.

17
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:50,484
 I had to leave the place I had fought for a decade.

18
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:55,454
 I was reluctant and unwilling to leave,

19
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:59,614
 but the moment I walked out the door,

20
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,694
 I saw a picture of my daughter.

21
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:08,435
 I created "Future Microworld" for Chun Yu.

22
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,835
 Now I can't finish it,

23
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:18,335
 and lost valuable time that I could have spent with my daughter.

24
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:21,074
 I'm really not a good father.

25
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:22,868
 Chun Yu!

26
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:24,775
 Which college do you want to apply for?

27
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:25,995
 I haven't decided yet.

28
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:28,514
 Tell me first once you've decided.

29
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,232
 Brother Chun!

30
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,595
 Brother Chun!

31
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:43,635
 Do you know Tianji Science and Technology company

32
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:46,395
 is going to release a game called "19th Floor"?

33
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:48,135
 I've studied its design closely.

34
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:51,014
 It's almost identical to our "Future Microworld."

35
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:53,875
 Did you research this company's background?

36
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:58,575
 Yes. This company is new with a mysterious background,

37
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:03,975
 but I suspect the person behind it is someone we know well.

38
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:06,612
 Yan Mingliang.

39
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:10,755
 As far as I know, they've already done small-scale tests.

40
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,655
 No way. We have to stop him.

41
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,835
 - Then I'll come with you. 
 - No.

42
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:19,034
 You should stay out of this.

43
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:21,124
 Wait to hear from me.

44
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:27,234
 I went to Tianji Science and Technology,

45
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:30,374
 and asked to see their boss.

46
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:34,592
 I already knew he had to be Yan Mingliang

47
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:37,614
 and I still hoped I could talk him out of it,

48
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:42,015
 but they wouldn't even let me in the front door.

49
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:47,528
  I instantly realized Yan Mingliang would never stop.

50
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:52,694
 Once this game is launched, it would hurt a lot of people.

51
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:57,135
 I should stop him before he becomes a threat to society.

52
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,500

53
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:15,334
 I snuck in, hiding in their supplier's van

54
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,600

55
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,635
 and found the location of the host server,

56
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:39,395
 but I couldn't get in because it was heavily guarded.

57
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:44,575
 I could only access the system via a feeder port.

58
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:15,795
 Wasn't there a tower here?

59
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,874
 Why is it a building now?

60
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:22,554
 I even designed a program for myself,

61
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:27,048
 so no one could ever remove me from the game.

62
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:31,615
 That way, I could stay and find the secret door.

63
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:36,014
 I originally created this secret door to control the game.

64
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:40,515
 I could use this as a breakthrough to plant a Trojan virus,

65
00:07:40,515 --> 00:07:43,375
 which would destroy the entire system.

66
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:48,775
 Unexpectedly, Yan Mingliang had made a lot of changes

67
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:51,394
 so I could no longer find the secret door.

68
00:07:57,314 --> 00:08:03,935
 To find it, I had to pass through all the levels of the game.

69
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,490

70
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:14,795
 Xiao Li realized I was missing, and came to Tianji to look for me.

71
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,875
 It's me.

72
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:37,664
 How did you get in?

73
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:41,734
 That day you went to see Yan Mingliang and then disappeared,

74
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:45,074
 I thought something must have happened to you.

75
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:47,315
 That's why I found a way to get to Tianji.

76
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:51,580
 I stole their headset and hacked into their system.

77
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:57,134
 Your identity must have been exposed.

78
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:58,955
 It was an emergency. I had to do it.

79
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,564
 Also,

80
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:05,774
 your daughter Chun Yu is in danger.

81
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:11,135
 They did something to her.

82
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:15,775
 Don't let her in here.

83
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:18,155
 Then what should I do?

84
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:47,035
 President Yan, it seems we have to switch to Plan B.

85
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,836
 Take action.

86
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,260
 Yes.

87
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:06,034
 The gaming experience made Xiao Li mentally unstable.

88
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:09,374
 Later, Tianji removed the chip from his brain

89
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:11,835
 and although his mind was back to normal,

90
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:15,375
 his memory got damaged and forgot everything about the game.

91
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,076
 Find Chun Yu.

92
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,804
 I must find Chun Yu.

93
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,768
 I need to find Chun Yu.

94
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,484
 I can't let her come in.

95
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:25,484
 Find Chun Yu. Find Chun Yu.

96
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,104

97
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:38,614
 Welcome to experience the latest virtual reality technology from Tianji Science and Technology.

98
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,320
 Xiao Wang, help her put it on.

99
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,255
 Here.

100
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:45,775
 Tianji arranged an event at the school gate, targeting Chun Yu.

101
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:49,594
 Anyone else involved is just collateral damage.

102
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:52,435
 If Chun Yu hadn't put on the headset at that time,

103
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:55,435
  Yan Mingliang would have taken other measures.

104
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:37,374
 I was hiding in the dark when I saw Chun Yu enter the system.

105
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:42,012
 I knew he had already done something to her,

106
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:08,095
 but I also knew Yan Mingliang did all this just to lure me out.

107
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:36,595
 To prevent Yan Mingliang from finding me

108
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:39,134
 and keep Chun Yu safe,

109
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,615
 I couldn't make any hasty move.

110
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:58,735
 This patient has severe brain damage.

111
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:02,708
 I doubt he will ever wake up again.

112
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:06,894
 Engineer Lin, who had suffered severe brain damage

113
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:09,454
 and was nearly unconscious,

114
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:11,894
 also entered the elevator.

115
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,675
 He leaned against the elevator and didn't move.

116
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:16,474
 It was at this moment,

117
00:14:16,474 --> 00:14:21,415
 Engineer Chun's consciousness and Old Lin's chip were connected.

118
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:49,915
 Activate the 19th Floor.

119
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:51,336
 Okay.

120
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:59,455
 That night was the first time the game was activated.

121
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:01,574
 Yan Mingliang had planned to use Chun Yu

122
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:04,435
 to lure out Uncle Chun who was also in the game,

123
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:07,154
 but the car accident sent everyone to the hospital.

124
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:09,975
 Yan Mingliang took the opportunity to activate the 19th Floor.

125
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:14,395
 Brother Qiang, Hei Er and A'Yong, also hospitalized because of the car accident

126
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:19,074
 were implanted with chips and sent into the game.

127
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,496
 Chun Yu.

128
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:30,015
 Chun Yu, where is this?

129
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,515
 So during this period,

130
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:07,754
Chun Yu's father's consciousness was trapped in Uncle Lin's mind?

131
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:10,300
Exactly.

132
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:16,656
Uncle Chun knew Yan Mingliang would be watching closely,

133
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:21,574
so he couldn't reveal his identity and pretended to be Old Lin.

134
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:27,332
Meanwhile, he had been quietly protecting Chun Yu in the game.

135
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,995
I still think it's unbelievable.

136
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:34,954
If Uncle Lin said so,

137
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:38,415
how can you prove he didn't lie?

138
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,188
I trust him,

139
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,355
not just because he is Uncle Chun,

140
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:46,755
but also because he is Mazzolini.

141
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,895
Who is Mazzolini?

142
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:55,495
Mazzolini is a senior I met three years ago while working on VR technology.

143
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:59,515
He has great insight into all types of technology and is very influential on the Forum.

144
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,775
When I first came to the 19th floor,

145
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:04,895
I left him a message and told him about my experiences.

146
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:10,124
He answered that he knew about the 19th Floor.

147
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:15,654
Then, he gradually told me more about the game.

148
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:18,295
I also wondered how he knew all that,

149
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:22,028
But he said he couldn't explain why.

150
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:25,104
It wasn't until I questioned him when Qing You fell into a coma,

151
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:27,574
that he finally told me the basic architecture of the 19th floor

152
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:29,874
is the game "Future Microworld."

153
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:34,035
He had been involved in its development and production,

154
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:39,936
but he was fired from the team for objecting to the game.

155
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:46,155
Wait! Why didn't you tell us sooner,

156
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:48,394
about this Mazzolini?

157
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:52,568
I actually asked him if I could tell you about him,

158
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:54,528
but he refused.

159
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:00,835
Once his identity was exposed, our safety would be at risk.

160
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,615
I had never met him,

161
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,755
so I didn't tell anyone about him.

162
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:09,135
Well, you never even met him in person,

163
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:13,454
so you can only prove that he is Uncle Lin,

164
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:18,115
but you cannot prove that he is Chun Yu's father.

165
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:24,036
I can prove it.

166
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:35,375
Hello, I am Nian Yongcheng, Nian Sulan's father.

167
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:40,276
I can prove that Old Lin is Chun Yiming.

168
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:44,354
He met me yesterday afternoon

169
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,215
and told me everything he had been through recently.

170
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:52,215
We also discussed the details of our previous collaboration.

171
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,275
Those are things that only he and I know,

172
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,855
so he could not deceive me.

173
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:02,155
By the way, Chun Yu,

174
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:06,994
last night, Uncle Chun helped me assemble the pulse device.

175
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:12,115
President Nian helped us remove the chips, including yours.

176
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:18,294
Now we're all safe. We won't be forced back to the 19th floor.

177
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:25,668
I've heard that your Microtech has close ties with Yan Mingliang.

178
00:19:25,668 --> 00:19:27,656
Is that so?

179
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:33,495
Actually, Microtech is his company.

180
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:36,734
I'm just a figurehead.

181
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:38,934
Why are you helping us?

182
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:44,775
It's the reason Yiming came to see me yesterday.

183
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:51,220
My daughter Sulan's consciousness is also trapped in the game.

184
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,894
Yan Mingliang has lost his mind. He wouldn't let her go.

185
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,654
So I made a deal with Yiming.

186
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,595
I will help you remove the chips,

187
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:02,955
and he will enter the game to save my daughter.

188
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:05,995
Where is he now?

189
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:08,954
Everyone who dies in the game

190
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,774
would be trapped in a level called Ultimate Space,

191
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:16,495
where they can eat and sleep just like in the real world.

192
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:19,474
Many people would get trapped in there and never get out.

193
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:25,034
What if he can't save them…

194
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:32,934
If there is only one person who can escape from there,

195
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:38,014
it would be him.

196
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,672
By the way, Chun Yu,

197
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:54,835
this is the game record I downloaded from Tianji's database.

198
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:56,955
It contains some footage of Old Lin,

199
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:01,575
your father.

200
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,715
You can check it out.

201
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:16,352
What about Uncle Lin?

202
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:22,454
At the moment, Uncle Lin is still in a coma.

203
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:30,004
Uncle Lin's brain was heavily damaged due to the car accident.

204
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:32,774
He should have been unconscious.

205
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:34,016
During this period,

206
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:36,514
your father's consciousness has been connected to his chip,

207
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:39,114
allowing him to act like a normal person.

208
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:44,894
Once disconnected, he'll be back to his former condition.

209
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:51,388
However, it's quite amazing.

210
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:52,635
During this time,

211
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:57,335
your father's activities had a very positive effect on his brain.

212
00:21:57,335 --> 00:21:59,275
According to the doctor's diagnosis,

213
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:03,075
Old Lin's brain should be silent and rigid,

214
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:05,815
but he is showing signs of stimulation.

215
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:11,034
One can even say that he might recover soon.

216
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:15,814
Your father's consciousness has been trapped in the Ultimate Space.

217
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:21,034
Yesterday, when Uncle Chun shared these stories, he added one last thing.

218
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:23,632
He said,

219
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,794
whether he is Old Lin,

220
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:29,964
Mazzolini, or Chun Yiming,

221
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:33,235
no matter who he is,

222
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:35,454
No matter when, no matter where,

223
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,675
he has only one thought,

224
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:41,255
that is to protect his daughter.

225
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,974
 Have we met somewhere before?

226
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,135
 What's this?

227
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:10,835
 It doesn't have to be a fuse. It could be a metal wire.

228
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:12,835
 Anything works as long as it connects the circuit.

229
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:29,635
 It's really strange. Why wasn't a mission assigned this time?

230
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:30,995
 Exactly, there are no instructions.

231
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:32,974
 That's outrageous!

232
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:41,348
 Chun Yu, let's try one more time.

233
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:45,055
 A father would do anything for his daughter.

234
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:49,014
 Just hang in there.

235
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:51,414
 The person I hate the most is this man,

236
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:55,575
 who is my father, Chun Yiming.

237
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:58,415
 I can't undo the past,

238
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:04,534
 but I hope you will live a good life.

239
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:06,580
 Dad.

240
00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:56,135
I'm sorry.

241
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:58,424
I'm sorry.

242
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:23,175
Why isn't she here yet?

243
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:24,635
She's here.

244
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:26,354
Chun Yu, come over.

245
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:32,260
Why are you here?

246
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,975
We came here for the class.

247
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:35,572
Yes.

248
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:37,368
What is this class?

249
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:43,475
What is this class?

250
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,915
Didn't you check the schedule?

251
00:25:45,915 --> 00:25:49,554
I only checked the classroom number. I didn't notice the course.

252
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:54,174
So, you're not here for the class?

253
00:25:56,715 --> 00:26:00,074
We just came to keep you company.

254
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:03,675
I'm fine, don't worry.

255
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:08,715
Really?

256
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,188
You may leave.

257
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:17,655
We're already here. Just let us stay a while.

258
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:19,855
Besides, we have nothing to do anyway.

259
00:26:19,855 --> 00:26:21,934
We'll just stay and kill time.

260
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,672
Just stay and kill time?

261
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:25,234
My class isn't something you use to kill time.

262
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,635
Professor.

263
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:29,834
Don't they look unfamiliar?

264
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:32,814
If you're not from this class, then what are you doing here?

265
00:26:32,814 --> 00:26:34,755
You don't even have your books.

266
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:36,774
- Are you looking for trouble? 
 - No, no, no.

267
00:26:36,774 --> 00:26:39,754
No, professor… We're in the wrong classroom.

268
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:42,155
We're leaving.

269
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,755
Let's leave.

270
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:54,884
We're leaving.

271
00:27:04,794 --> 00:27:07,154
Everyone, let's begin.

272
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:11,514
Xiao Gao, you're late.

273
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:16,595
Senior Brother, I think Chun Yu is doing just fine.

274
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:17,715
We are leaving.

275
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:18,956
Okay.

276
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:25,415
Data shows that our country's population aged sixty and above

277
00:27:25,415 --> 00:27:31,295
is 264.02 million people, constituting 18.7%.

278
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:33,695
Compared to the previous year,

279
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:37,935
this proportion has increased by 5.44%.

280
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:42,315
The degree of aging continues to increase,

281
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:46,715
that's why educating the elderly is very important

282
00:27:46,715 --> 00:27:48,875
to actively cope with the aging population,

283
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:53,134
achieve education modernization and build a learning society.

284
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,548
Chun Yu.

285
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:58,140
Chun Yu!

286
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:06,195
Forget it, let's call it a day.

287
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:30,168
Chun Yu.

288
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,354
What a coincidence! I've just finished a class next door.

289
00:28:36,354 --> 00:28:38,540
Let's go eat together.

290
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:42,708
Let's go.

291
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:02,155
Chun Yu, did you come here to eat?

292
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:09,014
 But I hope you will live a good life.

293
00:29:10,594 --> 00:29:12,095
Could you hurry up?

294
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:13,720
I'm sorry.

295
00:29:14,475 --> 00:29:16,575
What would you like to eat?

296
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:18,428
What would you like to eat?

297
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:21,988
Chun Yu.

298
00:29:21,988 --> 00:29:24,915
Could you pack these four for me?

299
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:27,575
Please hurry up.

300
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:29,240
Thank you.

301
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,096
Chun Yu!

302
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,464
Take it.

303
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:53,375
Thank you, Gao Xuan.

304
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:55,195
It's okay.

305
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:58,275
If you need anything, feel free to contact me.

306
00:29:58,275 --> 00:30:00,128
I'm going upstairs.

307
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,050

308
00:30:13,392 --> 00:30:15,255
- Hello. 
   - Hello, senior brother.

309
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:17,195
 I'm Chen Xiaoming from the programming group.

310
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:19,815
 I've created a small program, but encountered some problems.

311
00:30:19,815 --> 00:30:21,474
 I wonder if you could check it for me.

312
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:23,654
Okay, I'm on my way.

313
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:57,792
Are you going to eat it here?

314
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:07,448
Chun Yu.

315
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:12,615
Whether in the game or in real life,

316
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:15,695
if you need my help, just say it.

317
00:31:21,888 --> 00:31:23,644
I know.

318
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,200

319
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:39,775
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

320
00:31:45,715 --> 00:31:47,352
I'm leaving.

321
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,416
President Yan, the obstacle has now been eliminated.

322
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,255
I wonder if the 19th Floor can be fully launched?

323
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:45,848
Okay.

324
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:54,914
Old Chun,

325
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:59,674
this is where you belong.

326
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:02,214
Why are you doing this?

327
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:12,335
Yet this face looks familiar.

328
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,250

329
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:31,160

330
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:35,744
♫  I go from running  ♫

331
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,168
♫  To flying  ♫

332
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:43,126
♫  Through setbacks and hardship  ♫

333
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:46,584
♫  So what?  ♫

334
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:50,268
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

335
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:53,969
♫  It shines on my face  ♫

336
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:57,612
♫  Unwilling to lose hope  ♫

337
00:33:57,612 --> 00:34:00,907
♫  I only want to bloom  ♫

338
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,332
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

339
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:09,748
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

340
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:15,243
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

341
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,896
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

342
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:24,728
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

343
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:29,912
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

344
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,001
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

345
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:36,680
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

346
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,508
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

347
00:34:39,508 --> 00:34:42,132
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

348
00:34:42,132 --> 00:34:44,824
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

349
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,688
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

350
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:51,368
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

351
00:34:51,368 --> 00:34:54,264
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

352
00:34:54,264 --> 00:35:00,520
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

353
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:20,152
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫
