1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:10,070

2
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,764

3
00:01:56,764 --> 00:01:59,808

4
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:46,164
Chun Yu.

5
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:19,838
I'll meet you at your dorm tomorrow morning at eight.

6
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:22,758
No. I need to sleep until at least nine in the morning,

7
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:24,399
otherwise, I'll be tired all day.

8
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,692
Did you forget?

9
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:30,439
I know. I must go to the hospital at 8:30 for physical therapy.

10
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,618
How could I forget? I was just kidding.

11
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:35,899
Right, how could you forget such an important thing?

12
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,652
Gao Xuan?

13
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,328
You're finally back!

14
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:46,258
I'm sorry, may I ask who you are?

15
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,172
Senior Brother.

16
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:25,598
Don't you remember me at all?

17
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,659
I joined the game at World of Joy level.

18
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:34,478
What about my brother? The delivery guy.

19
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,412
You helped him.

20
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:38,539
I'll show you his photo.

21
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,738
Look! That's him.

22
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,704
Think about it.

23
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:46,988
Do you remember?

24
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:58,299
Actually, it was Uncle Chun who told me about the game.

25
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,459
Maybe my consciousness was damaged in the system,

26
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:05,279
resulting in the loss of all memories from that time.

27
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,920
I am sorry.

28
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,179
What about Qing You? She's been in the game from the start.

29
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,619
Did you forget her?

30
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,632
I am sorry.

31
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:29,099
It doesn't matter if you remember me or not,

32
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,859
but how could you forget Chun Yu?

33
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:33,438
She's done so much for you.

34
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:36,119
Qing You, well…

35
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,159
You can't say that. Right?

36
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:42,159
You two team up as experts.No one owes anything to anyone.

37
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,858
- But they were a couple… 
 - Qing You.

38
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,304
Well…

39
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,439
I must go to the hospital for physical therapy. Bawan, let's go.

40
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,818
- Isn't it at 1:30 in the afternoon? 
  - Let's go.

41
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,239
Qing You, we are going to be late for our class.

42
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,259
- Come on. 
 - Chun Yu.

43
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,979
We're late, it's time for class. Hurry up, let's go.

44
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,198
Hurry up, let's go.

45
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:11,419
Let's go.

46
00:06:20,818 --> 00:06:23,398
Chun Yu, they said…

47
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,492
Let's go back.

48
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,399
Bawan wants to see me. I'm going downstairs.

49
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:15,119
My parcel is here. I'll go too.

50
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,258
Let's go together.

51
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,360
Chun Yu.

52
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:32,478
It's not Gao Xuan's fault that he lost his memory.

53
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,979
I shouldn't have said that about him.

54
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:39,038
It's okay. I know you're worried about me.

55
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,938
I am worried about you,

56
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:43,078
but I want to say,

57
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:46,879
you've always been the toughest, the strongest among us.

58
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,218
I saw what happened to you and Gao Xuan,

59
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:52,618
and I sincerely wish you both the best.

60
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:56,059
You can't just give up.

61
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,959
If you need any help, just tell us.

62
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,839
Chun Yu.

63
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,639
Got it, thank you.

64
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:08,479
So…

65
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,578
Just let things take their course.

66
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,740

67
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:41,899
I almost forgot the password.

68
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,480
 Zero, four, one, nine.

69
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:05,659
I wonder how their conversation went.

70
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,359
I hope Chun Yu will be fine.

71
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:17,080
Chun Yu, are you going for a run?

72
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,180

73
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,940
Hello, Mom.

74
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,099
 I'm still the same,

75
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,739
 but you're all alone. No one takes care of you.

76
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:12,718
 Are you taking care of yourself?

77
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,239
Of course.

78
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,538
 Recently, life and studies have been going smoothly.

79
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:19,144
 You don't need to worry.

80
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:24,798
Besides life and studies…

81
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:30,319
Right, you mentioned a special feeling in your heart. What is it?

82
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,344
 Tell me about it.

83
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:33,518
What special feeling?

84
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:35,838
 You mentioned it yourself on your last phone call.

85
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:38,158
 Are you that careless when you talk to me on the phone?

86
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:39,679
 Did you forget what you said.

87
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,379
Is that special feeling in your heart for a girl?

88
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:50,068
 Chun Yu.

89
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:07,698
 All right, I'll stop teasing you.

90
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:09,819
 Look. Your face is all red.

91
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,259
 Hope to hear some good news from you next time.

92
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:15,358
Okay, I have to go.

93
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:34,198
Hello. Is this Yang Bawan?

94
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:36,216
I am Gao Xuan.

95
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:41,039
Chun Yu interfered when Qing You was about to speak.

96
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,118
Can you tell me what it was that she didn't finish?

97
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,259
Did you decide?

98
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,739
Just give me a second.

99
00:13:23,698 --> 00:13:25,592
 Did you decide?

100
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:28,618
 Just give me a second.

101
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,779
Cannon five, advances four.

102
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:50,680
Knight three, advances five.

103
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:02,918
What should be my next step, brother?

104
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,684
As you wish.

105
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:45,312
 My name is Chun Yu, what's yours?

106
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:46,992
 My…

107
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:49,752
 My name is Zhao Lei.

108
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,718
Be careful.

109
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:25,368
Come on.

110
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:48,918
Didn't I get on the school bus?

111
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,816
When?

112
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:53,719
 Mr. Huang, is there any empty seat?

113
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:58,939
Did I have a car accident?

114
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:02,539
Sir, you recovered from the accident long ago,

115
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:06,138
but then you participated in a game called 19th Floor,

116
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,479
and fell into a coma again.

117
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:10,018
Then you came to our hospital.

118
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:12,940
A game?

119
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:16,079
19th Floor?

120
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,444
Yes.

121
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:22,019
Why can't I remember any of this?

122
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:26,718
Maybe the car accident caused a side effect.

123
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:29,318
You should go home and get some rest.

124
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:33,019
Sometimes the memories come back later.

125
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,108
Hi.

126
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:25,938
What did you put there?

127
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:27,818
Yang Bawan put it on me.

128
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:30,598
He said it could relieve brain overload.

129
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,599
 What did you put on Gao Xuan?

130
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,058
 This is all for you.

131
00:17:43,218 --> 00:17:46,099
 It's an ancient secret recipe my dad had someone find.

132
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,418
 It can help to recover memory.

133
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:54,919
Gao Xuan, get up.

134
00:17:56,218 --> 00:17:57,944
What's the matter?

135
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,439
This is just some trick.

136
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,299
It's useless. I'll remove it for you.

137
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:02,592
Okay.

138
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,979
 I know I've lost important memories,

139
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:36,899
 especially the experience I had with you guys in the game.

140
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:43,939
 But the memories about you didn't start with the game.

141
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,859
 Chun Yu.

142
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:58,538
 I will always protect you as I did when I was a child.

143
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,964
Take a look.

144
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:09,498
What?

145
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:10,819
Bawan.

146
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:13,939
I heard you gave a folk remedy to Gao Xuan.

147
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:15,399
Don't mention it again.

148
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:17,658
If Chun Yu hears about it, she'll beat me up.

149
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,999
You deserve it.

150
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,959
You've been tormenting Gao Xuan.

151
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,659
I did it out of kindness.

152
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:24,359
It would be great if he regains his memory.

153
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:27,279
Think about it. He even forgot me, his best teammate.

154
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,578
I am so upset.

155
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:31,219
You are the worst teammate ever.

156
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,819
What's the big day today? Such a feast.

157
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:36,798
It's nothing Old Gao. Just a gathering.

158
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,179
Enjoy. If it's not enough, I'll add more.

159
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,732
Okay.

160
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:45,338
It'd be very nice if you'd invite us to a proper restaurant.

161
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:49,352
Old Lin?

162
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:52,788
Uncle Lin.

163
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:56,279
Uncle Lin, why didn't you tell us about your return?

164
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:01,579
Do we know each other?

165
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,258
We played 19th Floor together. Don't you remember it?

166
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:12,832
19th Floor?

167
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:15,418
Yes, I-I've heard about it from the doctor.

168
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:17,959
I did play after the car accident,

169
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,958
but then I fell into a coma again.

170
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:25,199
So I don't remember anything about that time.

171
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,718
Uncle Lin's primary consciousness at that time was my father's.

172
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:30,220
So…

173
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:33,458
Uncle Lin.

174
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,419
No matter what happens, we are still teammates.

175
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,738
We are the best of teammates.

176
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,078
Enjoy your food. I'll get back to work.

177
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,136
Go ahead.

178
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:19,058
Go ahead, eat.

179
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,439
Come on, let's eat.

180
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,619
Best of teammates?

181
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,820

182
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:02,659
 Hello.

183
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:05,039
 How's it going, buddies? Were you scared?

184
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,239
 Well, sorry about that.

185
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:08,559
 The three of us opened an escape room.

186
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,979
 It officially opens Saturday at 1 p.m.

187
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:15,138
 Hope you guys find the time to come to our escape room.

188
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:17,498
 Please come, brother.

189
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:19,839
 It's all the same, no difference.

190
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,619
 Anyway, you should all be there.

191
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:24,379
 - See you then. 
 - Don't forget to show up.

192
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:27,179
 - See you then. 
 - Remember to come by.

193
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,968

194
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:34,264
Are you going?

195
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:37,179
What else can Brother Qiang do? I can just imagine it.

196
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:38,699
That's right, I don't believe it.

197
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,299
If he could create an escape room, I could fly airplanes.

198
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:42,499
Brother Qiang is so unreliable.

199
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:44,859
I want to call him Stupid Qiang.

200
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,380
Do you like Brother Qiang?

201
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:50,778
Is that right?

202
00:22:50,778 --> 00:22:51,919
Why did you call him Stupid Qiang?

203
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,390
Don't talk nonsense, Bawan.

204
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,800

205
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,799
I almost forgot, my grandma's medical check-up this afternoon.

206
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,638
I have to go to the hospital now. You guys eat.

207
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:01,579
- I'll go with you. 
 - Okay.

208
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:02,899
Bye.

209
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:04,956
- We are leaving. 
 - Go.

210
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:11,538
Qing You.

211
00:23:11,538 --> 00:23:15,559
Is Chun Yu okay about Gao Xuan losing his memory?

212
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:18,559
I think so.

213
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,879
It's a shame, though.

214
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:21,280
Wait.

215
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:25,759
I just had an idea.

216
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:35,770

217
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,390
Why is it so dark?

218
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:48,818
You are right. Brother Qiang's shop isn't working.

219
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:54,999
Maybe this game should be played in the dark.

220
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,864
Am I right?

221
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:59,059
Here's a candle and matches.

222
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:01,298
A candle and matches?

223
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,219
There is a candle.

224
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:06,028
A candle?

225
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:13,260
It's lit.

226
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,080
What's this?

227
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:26,978
Old Gao, come and see this. Is this a clue?

228
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:29,399
Go and take a look.

229
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:31,228
I'll go check.

230
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:40,756
What is this?

231
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:43,139
What is this thing?

232
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:47,718
T-This is… a shadow puppet.

233
00:24:49,258 --> 00:24:51,088
A shadow puppet?

234
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:56,678
What a creepy shadow puppet.

235
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,759
It does look weird.

236
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:10,339
What are you doing?

237
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:12,619
Just speak up.

238
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:15,019
Wait, what is this?

239
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,164
What is this?

240
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:27,598
- What's going on? 
 - What's happening?

241
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:30,978
Do the game rules imply

242
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:34,398
that these lights can be used against these monsters?

243
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:36,758
Is that so?

244
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:38,278
That's right.

245
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:39,888
Is that right?

246
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:44,459
Well, look.

247
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,619
There's also a flashlight.

248
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,038
Hurry, Old Gao.

249
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:54,159
They are rising.

250
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,728
Well…

251
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,016
You're good.

252
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,948
You're pretty smart.

253
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:32,736
Did you remember anything?

254
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,379
Did you?

255
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:38,298
Is that right?

256
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:39,799
Did you remember anything?

257
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:40,859
Hurry up.

258
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:42,908
Did you remember anything?

259
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,492
Did you?

260
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,780
I…

261
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:09,744
I…

262
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:12,612
All right.

263
00:27:12,612 --> 00:27:14,739
I know you mean well,

264
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:16,404
but…

265
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,064
Wait.

266
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:37,258
Are you three doing the right thing?

267
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:41,799
No, the shadow puppets…

268
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,398
The shadow puppets... I wasn't there.

269
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:46,218
I was there. You are different from the rehearsal.

270
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:47,158
- Let's go. 
 - We did nothing wrong.

271
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:47,859
Right?

272
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:51,678
Right. That's not how they rehearsed it.

273
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,219
What's not right?

274
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,288
They're quite cute.

275
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:47,559
Brother Qiang, your escape room has a long way to go.

276
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,358
There is still a lot of room for improvement.

277
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:52,198
First, you three need to improve your performance.

278
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:54,199
The movement design is too sloppy.

279
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,052
Exactly.

280
00:28:58,139 --> 00:28:59,599
All right, go on.

281
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,699
If you keep talking this way, no one's getting lunch.

282
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,919
No, no, no, Brother Qiang.

283
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,499
Personally, I think your escape room is perfect.

284
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:08,439
I can hardly find any flaws.

285
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,559
You're absolutely right.

286
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,158
Our Mirror Escape Room is the best.

287
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:13,859
It truly stands above all other escape rooms nearby.

288
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:16,258
What did you say?

289
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,978
Brother Qiang, what is this?

290
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:29,099
Did you also prepare for a show?

291
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:36,498
I don't know them.

292
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:38,978
Why are they here?

293
00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:43,218
We are from every other escape room in the area!

294
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:46,258
Do you want to beat us?

295
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:49,258
- Come on. 
 - Come on.

296
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:51,479
What do you want?

297
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,478
I've warned you already.

298
00:29:53,478 --> 00:29:56,219
There are too many escape rooms,

299
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:57,819
so you shouldn't open another one.

300
00:29:57,819 --> 00:29:59,558
Why didn't you listen?

301
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:01,279
Why should I listen to you?

302
00:30:02,498 --> 00:30:04,559
Besides, everyone runs a shop with their own skills.

303
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,978
What's wrong with that?

304
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:09,772
He is right. Brother Qiang, I support you.

305
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:10,979
What are we waiting for, Brother Xiao Zhuang?

306
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:12,218
Let's do it!

307
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:14,519
I said not to use my real name.

308
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,899
Sorry, sorry.

309
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,419
Duke, let's do it.

310
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:20,680
Let's go.

311
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:27,316
Old Gao, what should we do?

312
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,798
What else? Let's go all out.

313
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:36,396
Let's go all out.

314

315

 No problem.

320
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:57,698
 Divide and conquer.

321
00:30:57,698 --> 00:30:59,099
 Defeat them one by one.

322
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:01,659
 Everyone. We insert the tags simultaneously. Let's see if it works.

323
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,310
 - Yes! 
 - Yes!

324
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,438
 No.

325
00:31:08,438 --> 00:31:11,039
 There must be a way for everyone to pass.

326
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,678
 Follow me. Hurry!

327
00:31:13,678 --> 00:31:15,219
 Brother, what's your name?

328
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:16,516

 Brother, you don't keep your word either.

 Teamwork.

 Qing You is not a weakling.

 This can be very dangerous. Be careful.

00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:30,339
 Recently, the city police solved a major criminal case.

361
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:33,839
 The suspect, President Yan, founder of a large tech company,

362
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,839
 exploited a system vulnerability in a VR game,

363
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,638
 forcing many players to enter the game.

364
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:41,919
 As a result, a lot of users fell into a coma upon failure.

365
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,358
 After extensive investigation,

366
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:46,819
 the police found all relevant evidence of President Yan's criminal group

367
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:48,639
 and quickly carried out the arrest operation.

368
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:51,198
 As of now, the game has been removed completely

369
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:54,939
 and all VR headsets and related devices have been confiscated.
