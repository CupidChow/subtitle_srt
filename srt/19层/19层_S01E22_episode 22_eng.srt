1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

2
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:56,727

3
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,671

4
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,180
 This is a work ahead of its time, a perfect virtual reality,

5
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,941
 yet extremely real.

6
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:13,241
 It offers thrills beyond limits.

7
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,940
 A free world like no other.

8
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,964
 This is the 19th Floor.

9
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:28,860
 It is an infinite-style game with countless exciting levels.

10
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,740
 All players play under the same rules,

11
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,381
 and it's quite fair and free.

12
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:39,581
 Colleagues, our 19th Floor

13
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:43,060
 will certainly make history.

14
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:46,201
Before those who make history,

15
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,661
those who are ordinary

16
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:52,521
only serve as a backdrop on the road to their success.

17
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:58,412
So on your path to success,

18
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,820
my mom and I are just backdrops, right?

19
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,141
Let me ask you.

20
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:10,724
Do you remember when we were in Bei'an,

21
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,800
and you had returned home from work?

22
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:18,884
My mom had cooked your favorite black chicken soup

23
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,200
and you brought her a bouquet of flowers.

24
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:28,780
I'm sorry. Maybe it has been too long,

25
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,541
I don't quite remember.

26
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,256
That's fine.

27
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,161
I remember.

28
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:39,960
It was the day,

29
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,520
you told me about your contract signing.

30
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,001
It was also the day you told us we had to move.

31
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,201
You also said

32
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,801
that what matters most is for our family to be together.

33
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:58,900
At that moment, I could really see the joy in your eyes.

34
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,860
I actually thought

35
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,821
you were excited about our family's future.

36
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:11,461
You were only excited about your future without us, weren't you?

37
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,940
Chun Yu, you are still young.

38
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,801
There are some things you don't understand.

39
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:19,601
Have you no guilt at all about my mother's death?

40
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:22,041
It's all in the past. Let's not mention it again.

41
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,041
But I can't get over it.

42
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,261
Don't dwell on the past.

43
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,421
You are Chun Yiming's daughter.

44
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,661
You're not like ordinary people.

45
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:36,601
I worked so hard to get you into the game,

46
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:39,421
hoping you will be the first to finish it

47
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:42,701
and become the first hero of the new world.

48
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:46,040
It is only then that you will truly understand me.

49
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,180
It is the only way you can continue what I have started.

50
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,021
Chun Yiming,

51
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:54,960
you're crazy. Can't you see that?

52
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,300
I don't want to hear all that nonsense.

53
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm not interested at all in your great success.

54
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,088
I will never become someone like you.

55
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:12,920
The time has come.

56
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,601
Your friends have already entered.

57
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:18,940
All you can do now is continue.

58
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,321
W-Why are you doing this to me?

59
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:37,972
Chun Yu.

60
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,140
What…

61
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,201
What is wrong with you?

62
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,260
You really don't know?

63
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,580
What…

64
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,461
What should I know?

65
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,281
Who is Mazzolini?

66
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:52,200
What are you doing with him?

67
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,100
Just say it.

68
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:03,601
Chun Yu, I…

69
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:05,248
Chun Yu.

70
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,680
I'll go check on her.

71
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:19,880
What's going on with you two?

72
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,164
Chun Yu.

73
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:40,936
Is your leg feeling better?

74
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:43,920
It's fine, I just need to rest.

75
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,481
What exactly happened between you and Gao Xuan?

76
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,560
It has nothing to do with him.

77
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,312
Then with what?

78
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:09,121
Uncle Lin.

79
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,560
Let me ask you a question.

80
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,140
Well,

81
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:20,461
would you abandon your daughter for your own sake?

82
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,401
Before I had a daughter, m-maybe I would.

83
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,320
But now,

84
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:32,761
I work away from home. I rarely go back.

85
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:35,021
In my daughter's opinion,

86
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,661
I'm just trying to earn and save money.

87
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:44,541
Actually, everything I do is for her.

88
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,076
Forget it.

89
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,201
Things are different.

90
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:53,260
In reality, it's all the same.

91
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,520
A father would do anything for his daughter.

92
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:05,420
Maybe this father is just not good at communicating,

93
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,341
while the daughter might misunderstand the father

94
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,561
for some reason.

95
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,480
I don't think there's any misunderstanding.

96
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,001
On the contrary, the more I get to know him, the more…

97
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,132
Old Gao, let me tell you.

98
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:35,961
Getting along with others sometimes requires space.

99
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:38,500
You have to learn to compromise.

100
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,801
What? Don't talk nonsense if you don't know the situation.

101
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm just showing concern.

102
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:52,740
 Chun Yu. What's wrong, Chun Yu?

103
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,592
 Chun Yu.

104
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,852
 Chun Yu.

105
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:01,156
 Chun Yu.

106
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:02,712
Where are they?

107
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:05,481
You are right. It sounds like they are close by,

108
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,761
but we didn't see anyone when we got here.

109
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,508
 Chun Yu.

110
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,328
Over there.

111
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,220
 Chun Yu.

112
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,536
 Chun Yu. What's wrong, Chun Yu?

113
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:21,492
- Chun Yu. 
  - Chun Yu.

114
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,228
 Chun Yu.

115
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:24,641
 What's wrong, Chun Yu?

116
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:26,132
 Chun Yu.

117
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:28,372
 Chun Yu.

118
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:33,968
Something's wrong.

119
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,032
Oh, no!

120
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,801
It's been a long time. Why haven't they caught up?

121
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:51,561
Let's go back and take a look.

122
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:56,781
Let me help you.

123
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,661
It's okay.

124
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:00,476
I'll help you.

125
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,161
Old Gao, what is this all about?

126
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:17,240
What else? The game is about to start.

127
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,900
But… how can it start in this darkness?

128
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,780
Maybe this is a game that should be played in the dark.

129
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:30,861
Well…

130
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:34,920
We've been in here for a long time and nothing's happened.

131
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:44,444
Where are they?

132
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,701
Maybe they are over there.

133
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:47,881
Let's go over.

134
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,464
Come on.

135
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Old Gao, what is this all about?

136
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,861
Use your brilliant mind and think!

137
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,541
Maybe they're waiting…

138
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,581
For what?

139
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:23,280
For a chance to start.

140
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,672
The game has started.

141
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:15,380
Bawan!

142
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,172
Xiaoqin!

143
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,920
Wenya!

144
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:29,041
What's the matter, Old Gao?

145
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,341
Does this mirror look strange to you?

146
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:32,561
This is a one-way mirror.

147
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,461
There should be another room on the other side.

148
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,501
They can't see or hear us.

149
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:44,421
Well… We can't see the other side,

150
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,321
but they should able to see us.

151
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:48,241
Is this like the monitor room in the detention center

152
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:50,600
where they interrogate prisoners?

153
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,424
Exactly.

154
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:54,428
But who could be on the other side?

155
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:56,661
Isn't it obvious? It must be Yan Mingliang.

156
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:57,781
Not necessarily.

157
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,741
He's usually outside the system, monitoring us.

158
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:01,220
There's no need for him to come in.

159
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,961
Not really. A pervert like him might just enjoy being here.

160
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:10,456
Uncle Lin.

161
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,444
Is that poison gas?

162
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,172
I don't think so.

163
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,480
What's going on?

164
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,901
Why do I feel a little cold?

165
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,261
You are right.

166
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,520
Is that the air conditioning unit?

167
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,740

168
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:45,180
Is this a thermometer?

169
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:03,500
- It's the air conditioning unit. 
 - Their room seems to be cooling down.

170
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:05,044
No response.

171
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:11,840
Oh, no. No way, this…

172
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,880
This is way too cold.

173
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,760
No way, this… This is a little too cold.

174
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,321
We must find a way to save them.

175
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,984
Uncle Lin.

176
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:35,360
Xiaoqin, maybe if I hold you in my arms,

177
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
It'll make us warmer.

178
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,328
Bawan.

179
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,961
If this is a game, all spaces in the game are for players.

180
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:54,260
Aren't we the only players in this game?

181
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:01,661
Are you saying that across the room are Chun Yu and Old Lin?

182
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:13,240
 Chun Yu.

183
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,801
 Chun Yu. Uncle Lin.

184
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:19,500
 Guys figure out a way to get us out of here.

185
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,361
 Chun Yu, can you see us?

186
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,100
 If you can see us, turn off the air-conditioning.

187
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,741
It's too cold in here.

188
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:31,581
Don't worry. I'll come and save you.

189
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,321
 It's no use.

190
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:35,841
 They can't hear you.

191
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:43,160
Who exactly are you?

192
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:13,020
Senior, is something wrong?

193
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:18,001
If those two are across and don't respond to us,

194
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:21,300
it's possible their situation is even worse than ours.

195
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,421
Let them go.

196
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:33,961
Aim at me.

197
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,820
You're right.

198
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,700
This level is aimed at you.

199
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,841
There's only one way to pass the level and save them.

200
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,600
What way?

201
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,156
It's simple.

202
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:50,681
Just finish what you didn't finish in the previous round.

203
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,860
Tell me who you hate the most.

204
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,320
Is it that simple?

205
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,400
Yes, it couldn't be any simpler.

206
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,320
Come on, tell me.

207
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,490

208
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,208
Bawan.

209
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,188
Are you okay?

210
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,920
Chun Yu will come to save us, right?

211
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,808
Yes, I suppose.

212
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,624
Xiaoqin,

213
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,121
I have something to tell you.

214
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,084
Shut up.

215
00:18:10,084 --> 00:18:11,900
Don't say anything now.

216
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,601
You can say it later.

217
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:15,284
I…

218
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:18,160
I'm afraid

219
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,280
there won't be another chance later.

220
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,008
No way.

221
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:27,336
Chun Yu will definitely save us.

222
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,084
Right?

223
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,060
She definitely will.

224
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,861
Tell me.

225
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,921
Who has been bothering you?

226
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,020
Who has caused you psychological trauma?

227
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,161
Who did you treat well, but he didn't treat you well in return?

228
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,801
Who did you love, but he hurt you instead?

229
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:55,860
Who do you hate most?

230
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,461
Isn't this a simple question?

231
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:01,000
Why don't you answer?

232
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:25,400
Why do you insist on making us tell you who we hate?

233
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,101
Is it really that important?

234
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:29,060
Of course.

235
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,081
Rules come first here.

236
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:35,300
You have to go through the process.

237
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,401
Since we're the ones breaking the rules, just punish us.

238
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,461
Don't talk nonsense.

239
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:43,028
I have no choice.

240
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:45,381
This is the rule.

241
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,341
Stop stalling.

242
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:53,161
If you continue, they really won't make it.

243
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,920
No, there is no way.

244
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,141
The rules don't really matter to you, right?

245
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:01,921
What exactly is your purpose?

246
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:04,341
What do you really want?

247
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:11,961
I have done all this for you.

248
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:14,621
Is that right? Did you?

249
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:16,521
Chun Yu, don't listen to him.

250
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:18,541
Of course, I did it for you.

251
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,961
For you need to get rid of all of these.

252
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:25,601
Hate and love, none of it matters.

253
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:30,401
Above all, you must be the best you can be.

254
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:31,716
Chun Yu.

255
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:34,840
Why are you wasting your talent?

256
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,300
What is the point of getting back at me in this way?

257
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,701
What's so important about your mother’s death?

258
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:45,200
Isn't it just that I was busy and missed your birthday party?

259
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,220
Why can't you get over it?

260
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,800
Let me tell you.

261
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,440
Love, hate, happiness, and joy are nothing.

262
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,140
You must get rid of them,

263
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,741
and only then will you be able to free yourself.

264
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:07,460
This is the only way to pass the 19th floor.

265
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,541
This is the only way to live a good life.

266
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,301
I've suffered a lot to understand these truths.

267
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:22,080
I just want to make sure you don't get on the wrong path.

268
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,160
Chun Yu, why don't you understand?

269
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,690

270
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,728
In your heart,

271
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,320
you are the most important,

272
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,720
and no one else matters, right?

273
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,101
Isn't that just nonsense?

274
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:03,080
What is more important than yourself?

275
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,401
What about your friends?

276
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:06,721
What about your family?

277
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:08,761
What about those who treat you well and love you?

278
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,180
Aren't they important?

279
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,581
Chun Yu, he is not you—

280
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,536
Do you have any idea

281
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:16,841
what happened

282
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:20,001
the day of the accident?

283
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:21,880
 Why did you break your promise?

284
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,761
 Didn't you promise you would come no matter what?

285
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,520
 Yes, your affairs are important.

286
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,601
 Your child isn't important.

287
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:32,521
 I'm even less important to you, right?

288
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,380

289
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:52,901
 Mom, where are we going?

290
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:56,901
 Mom, don't cry.

291
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:59,120
 Are we going home?

292
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,116
 Chun Yu.

293
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:06,540
 I'm sorry.

294
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,800
 It was all my fault.

295
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:13,800
 Your dad is too busy.

296
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,201
 There must be a reason he missed your birthday party.

297
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,101
 Don't blame him.

298
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:26,744
 Your dad is the best dad in the world.

299
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:30,604
 He loves you, and loves me too.

300
00:23:30,604 --> 00:23:35,480
 He is the most important member of our family.

301
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,208
 I know.

302
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,401
 Let's go home.

303
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:00,060
Do you understand?

304
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:03,541
The last thing she said to me was…

305
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,108
Chun Yu,

306
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,941
you're all your dad has right now.

307
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:11,321
You have to love him.

308
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,441
She defended you until the last minute

309
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:18,161
and thought of you.

310
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:21,241
Why did you treat her like that?

311
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:25,380
She loved you so much and gave you everything.

312
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,528
What about you?

313
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:30,661
Does she mean something to you?

314
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:37,432
Okay.

315
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:42,160
Now I can give you an answer.

316
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,220
In this world,

317
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,420
there is someone

318
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:56,421
a father related to me by blood,

319
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,340
but I'd rather

320
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,621
he never showed up.

321
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,572
I hate him.

322
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:24,761
The person I hate the most is this man,

323
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:28,284
who is my father,

324
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,944
Chun Yiming.

325
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,260
Okay.

326
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:38,656
What about you?

327
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,320
Who do you hate the most?

328
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,481
The person I hate the most…

329
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:49,476
The person I hate the most

330
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,681
is me.

331
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,068
Me…

332
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:13,692
They made it.

333
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,301
Chun Yu made it.

334
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:25,601
 Congratulations, you've passed.

335
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,912
Let her go.

336
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,901
Chun Yu.

337
00:28:57,781 --> 00:28:59,784
Are you okay?

338
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,812
What do you want?

339
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:07,461
I'm sorry about what happened some time ago,

340
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:08,816
but I can't help it.

341
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:11,681
The world Mr. Chun wants to create is also my dream.

342
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:15,921
I invested a lot of money, energy, and time into it.

343
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,100
I would give anything.

344
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,081
I know you are against it,

345
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:23,884
but if you try to understand him, you will agree with him.

346
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:28,060
I'm sorry, I can't understand or agree.

347
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,280
What exactly do you want?

348
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:35,001
Chun Yu, don't you understand yet?

349
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:38,960
We must work together to complete a great project.

350
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,936
We need your help.

351
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,040
I won't help you.

352
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,841
 Chun Yu, where are you?

353
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,481
 No way.

354
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:02,820
 I have to say it today. Just let me say it.

355
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:05,348
 Okay.

356
00:31:05,348 --> 00:31:07,228
 Then go ahead.

357
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:11,424
 Xiaoqin.

358
00:31:11,424 --> 00:31:13,376
 Actually…

359
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,800
 I…

360
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,860
 I…

361
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,801
 What was I going to say?

362
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,892
 I forgot it.

363
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,164
 Yang Bawan!

364
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:40,600
Even in my dream, you're still so timid.

365
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:30,061
You did this teaming with Yang Bawan, right?

366
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,241
Oh, my!

367
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:44,241
I can't hide anything from my Goddess Qin.

368
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:47,512
However, I am not teaming with him.

369
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:52,160
At best, I am just helping him.

370
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,480
During yesterday's break…

371
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,044
 Yang Bawan.

372
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,561
 I'll talk to you when she's gone.

373
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,281
Yang Bawan called me out to the hallway.

374
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:04,820
 You both seem strange today.

375
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,541
 What happened?

376
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:08,001
 Nothing.

377
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:10,201
 Tell me now. I can help you.

378
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:12,341
He kept begging me.

379
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,340
 Did you know Xiaoqin grows green mandrake?

380
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,401
 I didn't know.

381
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:20,221
 That thing has never sprouted.

382
00:33:20,221 --> 00:33:21,961
 Then how does she know it's green?

383
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:23,880
 Don't interrupt me.

384
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,801
 She kept saying once it sprouted, everything would be fine.

385
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:30,300
 But then yesterday,

386
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,701
 I saw her pour a pot of boiling water over that flower pot.

387
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:39,801
Unexpectedly, at nearly 22:50 before lights out,

388
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:43,380
I received a text message.

389
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,341
 Wenya, come here.

390
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:48,580
 - What's wrong? 
 - Do me a favor.

391
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,468
 What is it?

392
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,240
 You are pretty good.

393
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:03,056
 Thank you.

394
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:04,612
 You're welcome.

395
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:50,261
That is all there is.

396
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:53,240
I had no choice.

397
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,601
Don't blame me.

398
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,080
You had no choice?

399
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,901
I fear you helped him plan the whole thing, didn't you?

400
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,161
I didn't.

401
00:35:02,161 --> 00:35:04,320
It was all his idea.

402
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,081
You know what, Xiaoqin?

403
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:09,300
Yesterday, Yang Bawan visited many flower, bird and fish markets,

404
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,520
as well as dozens of plant stores, to finally find one.

405
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,160
Really?

406
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:17,604
Really.

407
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:20,861
If I lie, I'm a puppy dog.

408
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,301
This isn't a green mandrake at all,

409
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:32,500
but an ordinary green plant.

410
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,800

411
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,080

412
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:46,180
 She has seen the flower pot,

413
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,661
 but she said it wasn't a green mandrake, it was an ordinary plant.

414
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:53,300
Oh, no. It was my fault.

415
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,621
I was too careless.

416
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,716
 What should I do?

417
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,761
 I don't know, either.

418
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:05,181
 Help me. Is there any remedy?

419
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:06,261
 Yes.

420
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:07,301
 Tell me.

421
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:10,400
 Just wait to be doomed.

422
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,980
Oh, no! I'm doomed.

423
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:20,116
Yang Bawan!

424
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:25,740
Hi Xiaoqin.

425
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,761
I-I-I… have classes in the morning.

426
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:31,821
I'm late. I have to go now.

427
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Xiaoqin.

428
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,220
I really had no idea, it is not a green mandrake.

429
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,661
I-I'll get you another one, okay?

430
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,901
It doesn't matter.

431
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,160
What's important is

432
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,200
the seed of hope has sprouted in my heart.

433
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,168
Are you saying…

434
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:21,008
Great.

435
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,601
Xiaoqin, would you like to sit down?

436
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:28,041
I'll buy you whatever you want to eat, okay? Come on.

437
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,440
Why isn't Uncle Lin here?

438
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,821
I asked this morning.

439
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:41,921
The lady next door said he took the day off. He won't be in today.

440
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:45,100
Chun Yu isn't at the dorm, either.

441
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,901
Were Chun Yu and Uncle Lin affected by the game?

442
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,300
You are right.

443
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,321
Don't you feel the game was a little different this time?

444
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:00,441
What's different about it?

445
00:38:01,024 --> 00:38:02,980
I don't know.

446
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,361
I always feel it's digging into our deepest secrets.

447
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:59,621
Let's have a good talk for the child's sake.

448
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,370

449
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:22,510
