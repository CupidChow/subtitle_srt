1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,990

2
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:56,740

3
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,780

4
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:12,226
Chun Yu, is this Gao Xuan Senior Sister spoke of the same one we met in the haunted building?

5
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:13,980
I don't know,

6
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:17,627
but if he really is a substitute teacher at our school,

7
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:20,226
why didn't he tell us in the haunted building?

8
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:23,887
I find him suspicious.

9
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:39,626
Chun Yu, I'm not feeling well. Let's go.

10
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:43,186
If you're not feeling well, you should go back. I have something to do.

11
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,910

12
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,848

13
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:30,127
The modeling dimensions are incorrect.

14
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:35,687
The internal structure isn't built according to this.

15
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:38,907
You've been following me all along. Is there something you want to tell me?

16
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:45,506
S-Senior, this is the blueprint of Building 19 as you requested.

17
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,164
Thank you.

18
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:50,026
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

19
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,668
Senior.

20
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:54,428
What is it?

21
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:59,207
I'm hosting the orientation party tonight, and I'm a little nervous.

22
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:01,506
The party must include audience interaction.

23
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:05,726
If possible, can you help me with the script?

24
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:10,987
What are you looking for?

25
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:15,287
N-Nothing. T-The orientation party will be very lively.

26
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:18,266
There will be many students to help you with your script.

27
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:21,227
Don't forget to come and join us tonight.

28
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:22,286
Okay.

29
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:23,486
- I'll be waiting for you then. 
 - Okay.

30
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:26,188
- See you tonight. 
 - Okay, thank you.

31
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:40,808

32
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:54,068
Have you been discharged?

33
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:56,507
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

34
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:58,228
Much better.

35
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,647
What's this?

36
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:07,107
A delivery, I suppose. Don't you remember what you bought?

37
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:18,946
Are you going out?

38
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:22,486
Aren't you going to the orientation party tonight?

39
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:29,407
What? Do you think I can't have fun with an injured leg?

40
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,847
I'm sorry, Xiaoqin. I-I didn't mean that.

41
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:38,652
I'm sorry.

42
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:41,607
It's okay. It's normal for you to think that way.

43
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,547
My injury is only temporary,

44
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:45,287
so I have no psychological shadow at all.

45
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,286
Just relax.

46
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:51,567
I would have forgotten the orientation party if you hadn't mentioned it.

47
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,720

48
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:29,432
Devil.

49
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:54,346
Chun Yu, what a coincidence! A-Are you here to eat too?

50
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:57,544
- You can go before me. 
 - No need.

51
00:09:57,544 --> 00:09:58,967
I-It's okay, don't be polite.

52
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,447
I went to the senior high school next to yours. We're like neighbors.

53
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,146
Come on.

54
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,906
That's right. M-My name is Yang Bawan.

55
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,746
Your childhood friend whom you've been beating since childhood,

56
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:12,227
Liu Wa, is also my childhood friend.

57
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:19,887
Even the greatest devil can't resist the temptation of beauty.

58
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,592
What did you say?

59
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:28,747
I-I said that dish looks pretty tasty.

60
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:30,328
That's right.

61
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:31,886
This is…

62
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:33,287
This is the latest VR headset.

63
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,386
Impressive, right? You can use it to play games.

64
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,686
I'm telling you, they are doing a promotion, so this stuff is free.

65
00:10:37,686 --> 00:10:39,646
As long as you can pass their test…

66
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,646
 Attention, those attending the opening ceremony,

67
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:43,307
 please assemble and board the bus immediately.

68
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:46,907
 We welcome you to experience the latest Virtual Reality technology of Tianji Science and Technology.

69
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:49,200

70
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:58,146
A test? What test?

71
00:10:58,146 --> 00:11:00,706
Hey, what do you want to eat?

72
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:12,186
I'll take this, and this. That's it.

73
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,746
- Would you like some rice? 
 - Yes.

74
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,240
Okay.

75
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,336
Thanks.

76
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:30,027
Come on, what do you want to eat?

77
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:32,447
Sir, I-I want this one too.

78
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:36,532
This one?

79
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:42,067
W-W-Wait, you were doing fine before.

80
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,907
Why is your hand shaking now?

81
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:47,187
W-Well, it's an old problem. Sometimes it's better and sometimes it's worse.

82
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:49,866
Here, I'll give you some more rice.

83
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,230

84
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:10,227
 I'm hosting the orientation party tonight.

85
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:12,887
 Don't forget to come and join us tonight.

86
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:14,448
 Okay.

87
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,156

88
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:32,732
Chun Yu.

89
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:39,667
Why are you here, Chun-Yu?

90
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,787
- I've been waiting for you in the dorm. 
 - Come on, let's take a seat.

91
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,527
Senior, you're here.

92
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:46,307
By the way, how's your script preparation?

93
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,766
- All is well. 
 - That's good.

94
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,466
Chun Yu, is he…

95
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:55,587
Then take a seat.

96
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,112
Okay.

97
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,107
- There are many students. Don't be nervous. 
 - Okay.

98
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:03,046
All right, I'll get going.

99
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:14,756
♪  The sun sets and will rise again tomorrow morning  ♪

100
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:20,807
Chun Yu, is he really a teacher at our school?

101
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,207
Then why did he keep it a secret?

102
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:29,446
Besides, that building is identical to Building 19 of our school.

103
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:33,644
It's such a coincidence he's also a teacher at our school.

104
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:38,176

 Bravo.

108
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:00,448
What a coincidence.

109
00:14:10,026 --> 00:14:15,927
Next, please enjoy freshman representative Xu Wenya's solo dance.

110
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:18,000
You…

111
00:14:20,187 --> 00:14:21,547
I'm sorry, I-I…

112
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:24,427
Here you go. Take the tissue.

113
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:31,307
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

114
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,847
Brother, here's a bottle of water. I'm sorry.

115
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,107
What did you say?

116
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,026
So you're a girl.

117
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,327
Hello, I'm Yang Bawan. I'm majoring in Business Administration.

118
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:52,687
W-What's your major?

119
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,524
Boring.

120
00:14:57,526 --> 00:14:59,587
Yes, it's quite boring.

121
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:02,346
I mean, you're boring.

122
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:06,886
Actually, I'm a pretty interesting person.

123
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:13,266
Then watch the show.

124
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:34,047
 Nan Xiaoqin, can you get up and fence again or not?

125
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:50,707
- Let me help you. 
 - Go away, don't touch me.

126
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:53,600
No, I…

127
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:57,926
Brother, are you leaving or not? You're blocking the view.

128
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,947
No, I am sorry.

129
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:03,087
I-I-I'm going.

130
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,592
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

131
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,740
 Great!

132
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,020
Your dancing is so cool!

133
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:49,767
Chun Yu, where are you going?

134
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,580
The restroom.

135
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,960

136
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:17,232

137
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:58,546
Why are you following me?

138
00:17:59,427 --> 00:18:00,947
I-I wasn't.

139
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,506
I'm also on my way back to the dorm. Same direction.

140
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:06,567
Is the male dorm here too?

141
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:11,027
By the way, I saw a great game recently.

142
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:13,687
It was a VR game, quite well-made.

143
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:16,866
You should try it sometime if you get the chance.

144
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:20,506
Wearing it can make you fly. Watch out.

145
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,567
Can I add your WeChat account?

146
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:30,187
It's okay, I will get better.

147
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,987
 I saw a great game recently.

148
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:48,387
 It was a VR game. Wearing it can make you fly.

149
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,080

150
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:08,170
Mimi, Mimi.

151
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,560
Mimi.

152
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,980
Mimi.

153
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:24,906
Mimi, here you are.

154
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:32,866
Come on, eat up.

155
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:43,926
Mimi, do you have any friends?

156
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,206
I have a very good friend,

157
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:53,707
but I feel she's drifting away from me.

158
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:18,108
I'm leaving.

159
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:26,267
Dr. Jia, why are you here?

160
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:28,127
You left your student ID at the hospital.

161
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:31,446
I thought I'd stop by the school and return it to you.

162
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:33,306

163
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:34,647
I hope I didn't scare you.

164
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:37,727
I saw you playing with the cat, so I didn't want to disturb you.

165
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:42,504
No, no. Thank you for bringing it all this way.

166
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:46,807
Not at all. I haven't been back in a while,

167
00:22:46,807 --> 00:22:49,527
so I wanted to come back and reminisce.

168
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:51,947
Did you also graduate from this school?

169
00:22:53,227 --> 00:22:56,387
It's embarrassing to say this, but I only studied here for six months.

170
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:58,606
Then I dropped out and went to medical school.

171
00:22:58,606 --> 00:23:00,346
Amazing.

172
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:04,346
That means you're kind of our senior.

173
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:09,006
By the way, how do you feel?

174
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:11,327
What about the girl who was with you?

175
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:23,106
What's up? Aren't you two very good friends?

176
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:39,300
0419.

177
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:57,047
You're already here. Don't you want to go in?

178
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:04,008
Don't you dare to?

179
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:28,608
Make yourself at home.

180
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:14,926
The pot hasn't boiled yet. Have some cold water to drink.

181
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:25,912
Drink it.

182
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,580
I'm not thirsty.

183
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:44,127
You seem to be a little fired up, so I added a little salt.

184
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:47,172
What did you think it was?

185
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:49,960
Do you drink salt water?

186
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:52,447
I didn't like it much when I was little,

187
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:56,727
but I was always forced to drink it, so I gradually got used to it.

188
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,384
Let's get to the point.

189
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:04,166
Okay, I'll tell you whatever I know.

190
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:09,107
You lured me here on purpose.

191
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:15,827
I'm sure you'd like to discuss what happened the last few nights.

192
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:22,366
Why did you measure the dimensions of Building 19?

193
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:27,027
I think you must have noticed it too.

194
00:26:27,027 --> 00:26:31,707
The haunted building we entered the last two nights is actually Building 19.

195
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:35,806
I carefully observed the structure and size of the haunted building's interior,

196
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:40,487
 and measured the size of a few rooms with my feet.

197
00:26:42,826 --> 00:26:49,206
 If the real building matches the structure and size of that in our dreams,

198
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:53,566
and we went there due to some special force,

199
00:26:57,427 --> 00:27:00,987
then we would have definitely left some traces.

200
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:08,486
If it is just the exterior that's identical,

201
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:10,867
but the interior is totally different…

202
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:19,647
No one can change an internal structure and restore it overnight.

203
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:23,286
If that's the case,

204
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:28,667
then the haunted building we entered doesn't really exist.

205
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:35,886
Or we didn't even go there at all.

206
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:39,432
What were the measurement results?

207
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:42,420
They were completely different.

208
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,567
So you don't know what it is.

209
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,387
Then how did you enter?

210
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:58,367
I fell asleep and dreamed like you.

211
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:01,727
Or I thought I was dreaming.

212
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:05,747
You're not like us.

213
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:09,307
We entered due to a coma caused by a car accident,

214
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:11,392
but you didn't.

215
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,652
Indeed.

216
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:19,767
But I also don't know why.

217
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:32,446
A'Yong, I am here to visit you.

218
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,276
Are you still sleeping?

219
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:41,967
If you don't wake up, Hei Er and I will get foot massages without you.

220
00:28:44,987 --> 00:28:46,647
Speaking of Hei Er,

221
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:50,306
his own brother is in the hospital, and he doesn't even visit.

222
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:53,506
I'll give him a call and scold him.

223
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,846
Isn't this Hei Er's phone?

224
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:11,867
Hei Er told us the other day that he's getting a new phone.

225
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:14,406
He bought a new one,

226
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:17,026
and left the old one here in the hospital.

227
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:22,007
Yes, that must be it.

228
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:31,247
A'Yong, I've asked the doctor,

229
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:34,607
and he said you're fine, so you must be fine.

230
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,966
Is that right?

231
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:39,247
Besides, we three brothers have seen it all,

232
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:45,887
so this time you have to make it.

233
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:49,007
Don't you give up, do you hear me?

234
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:09,587
Director Chen. Yes.

235
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:13,106
Rest assured.

236
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,612

237
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:06,446
 Vital signs are normal, but there are no signs of awakening yet.

238
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:10,586
Emergency medical records indicate alcohol poisoning,

239
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:14,127
but his blood alcohol level isn't high.

240
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,686
 Considering the other symptoms…

241
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:21,288
Doctor, I don't think his coma is due to alcohol poisoning.

242
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:24,706
 Should we do some other tests?

243
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:26,992
Not required for now.

244
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:29,307
Remember to check on the patient in Bed 27.

245
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:30,996
Okay.

246
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:44,586
 Boss, there is also the guy who fell into a coma due to the game.

247
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:47,887
 The hospital is already suspicious.

248
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,767
 Should we transfer this person out immediately as well?

249
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:56,807
All right, I got it.

250
00:32:10,686 --> 00:32:15,167
 So A'Yong's coma is actually caused by a game.

251
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:19,606
 A Game? C-Coma?

252
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:38,912

253
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,396

254
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:08,856
Here you are.

255
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,424
Now I feel embarrassed.

256
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:17,627
These are the little things I usually work on.

257
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:51,092

258
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:00,820
Is there anything else you want to know?

259
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,406
- One more thing. 
 - Go ahead.

260
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:09,246
What did you take from Building 19 this afternoon?

261
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:13,247
I knew you were hiding out there,

262
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:18,787
so I picked up a random piece of cloth to get your attention.

263
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,376
What's the matter, Chun Yu?

264
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:54,107
 The 19th Floor game is about to begin.

265
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:57,616

266
00:34:58,626 --> 00:35:01,606
So this is all a game.

267
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:06,096

268
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:09,400

269
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:18,908

270
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,544

271
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,476

272
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,610

273
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:40,560

274
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:45,104
