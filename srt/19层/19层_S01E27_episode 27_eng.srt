1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040

2
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,744

3
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:59,688

4
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,671
 Something happened in the control room.

5
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,631
 Everybody, assemble in the control room.

6
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:27,272

7
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,730
Open the door!

8
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,520
Open the door!

9
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,792
Hei Er!

10
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,440
Brother Qiang!

11
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,151
Who let us out?

12
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:35,740
Gao Xuan.

13
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,811
It's Gao Xuan. He came to save us.

14
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:40,771
- Everyone is here to save us. 
 - It seems so.

15
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:42,011
In the canteen.

16
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:46,611
Yes, Bawan told me he's here to save us.

17
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,336
Bawan?

18
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:51,651
A brother I just met.

19
00:03:51,651 --> 00:03:54,190
He will be your brother too.

20
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,710
I thought it was all fake,

21
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,772
I didn't expect it to be real.

22
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,090
Why isn't A'Yong coming out?

23
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,576
A'Yong.

24
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,908
A'Yong.

25
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:19,636
A'Yong.

26
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,772
A'Yong.

27
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:24,168
A'Yong.

28
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,428
A'Yong, let's go.

29
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:28,550
Let's go, A'Yong.

30
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,990
It's all fake. It's all fake.

31
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,451
A'Yong.

32
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:41,190
Look at me, come on. Look at me.

33
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,930
I'm Brother Qiang.

34
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,496
Hei Er.

35
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,090
Look at us, A'Yong.

36
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,211
A'Yong.

37
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:52,664
It's all fake. It's all fake.

38
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:54,720
I know.

39
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,791
You've been here for too long.

40
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,791
You don't believe anything that's happening right now.

41
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,071
Come on, look at me.

42
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:03,191
- A'Yong, think. 
 -  It's all fake.

43
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:06,032
Just now in the canteen, think about it.

44
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,231
That is right. Did you see that?

45
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:09,411
Gao Xuan, Chun Yu and the others are here.

46
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:10,571
They are here to save us.

47
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,471
The gate is open now.

48
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:15,750
- Let's go. We're safe now. 
 - All of you get lost!

49
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,050
I'm not leaving.

50
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,310
- A'Yong. 
 - Get lost.

51
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,511
A'Yong.

52
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:21,031
Get lost!

53
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:25,771
- All of you get lost! 
 - It's all over, A'Yong.

54
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,164
Does it hurt?

55
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:35,591
It hurts.

56
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:37,131
How can you feel the pain if it's fake?

57
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:38,870
A'Yong, let's go.

58
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,250
We're really here to save you.

59
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,940
Brother Qiang.

60
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,668
That's right.

61
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,276
Hei Er.

62
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,011
W-Why did you leave me?

63
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:10,931
I risked my life to save you.

64
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:13,491
Why did you leave me?

65
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,871
I've been listening to you since I was young.

66
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:18,911
I've given you everything delicious and fun to play with,

67
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,191
because I know you're my brother.

68
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:24,491
You would cover and protect me.

69
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:28,571
- Why did you abandon me? 
 - A'Yong.

70
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,391
Why did you abandon me?

71
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,011
A'Yong, it's all over now.

72
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:34,231
It's all over now.

73
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:36,950
I didn't do it in purpose.

74
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,371
Everything happened so fast,

75
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:44,310
I just couldn't react in time.

76
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:49,691
The three of us…

77
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:52,310
The three of us grew up together.

78
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,291
If I'd known that's true, I would have come to save you.

79
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,870
I would risk my life to protect you,

80
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,290
but I failed.

81
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:04,272
Brother.

82
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:08,751
Brother. Brother.

83
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,792
Brother.

84
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,131
I failed to protect you.

85
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:17,771
Hit me.

86
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,970
- Brother. 
 - You should hit me.

87
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,251
- You should hit me.

88
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:27,476
Brother Qiang.

89
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:38,728
Xiaoqin.

90
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,730
Old Gao has succeeded.

91
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,131
Are you okay?

92
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:44,070
Why were you hitting the wall?

93
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,231
Are you two okay?

94
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,151
- Qing You. 
 - Qing You.

95
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:03,210
Are you okay?

96
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,290
Are you better now?

97
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,340
You are all here.

98
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,170
Where's Chun Yu?

99
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,370
She was sent to the dungeon.

100
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:32,211
We should go to save Chun Yu.

101
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,096
We'll all go together.

102
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,492
 What are you doing?

103
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,496
Brother.

104
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,088
 Get back.

105
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,108
 Get back.

106
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,231
 We need two more men in the control room.

107
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:14,192
 Get ready to break down the door.

108
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,588
The control room?

109
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:19,920
Gao Xuan is in danger.

110
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,571
You two wait here.

111
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:24,030
Brother.

112
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,471
It is Brother Xuan who has saved us in the past,

113
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:29,050
and now it's time for us to save him.

114
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,191
Brother Qiang, enough of this nonsense!

115
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:33,996
We'll go wherever you go.

116
00:10:33,996 --> 00:10:36,551
Are you going to save Gao Xuan?

117
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:39,610
Then I'm coming too.

118
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,150
He is my senior brother.

119
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,984
I have to save him.

120
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,771
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go.

121
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,432
Xiaoqin, what's wrong?

122
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,610
We'll distract the guards and buy Gao Xuan some time.

123
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,044
Okay.

124
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,272
Brothers,

125
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,032
do you need a hand?

126
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,256
Stop right there.

127
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,910
Those prison guards over there look fierce.

128
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,691
I-I-Is this going to work?

129
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:21,871
What's wrong?

130
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:23,868
They might not leave.

131
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:27,870
 The people from Block B have escaped their cells.

132
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,011
 I'll go check it out.

133
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:30,891
 Don't move. Watch the dungeon.

134
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:32,360
 Copy that.

135
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:37,870
W-What do we do now?

136
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,650
We'll think of another way.

137
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,910
We can't just fight them head on, can we?

138
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,164
Qing You!

139
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:15,790
- How do I open this? 
 - They have cards on them.

140
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,212
Chun Yu.

141
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,932
Uncle Chun.

142
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:38,471
Chun Yu. Where are we going?

143
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:40,070
Let's go find Gao Xuan first.

144
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,071
President Nian will help us open the gate.

145
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:45,830
If we find the secret door, we can destroy this harmful system.

146
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,491
We're running out of time. Let's get out of here.

147
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,132
Let's go.

148
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:52,071
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

149
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,352
Brother Qiang!

150
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:03,990
- Over here. 
 -  Okay, this way.

151
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,691
Hurry up! Go!

152
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:12,272
This way, hurry up!

153
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:17,891
- Brother Qiang. 
 - Bawan.

154
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:19,251
Uncle Chun.

155
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,350
The gate is right ahead, follow me.

156
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,490
Let's go.

157
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,316
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

158
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,111
We're finally united.

159
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:51,971
A successful escape, Brother Qiang.

160
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,950
Uncle Chun, this access control system is a little complicated.

161
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,390
Uncle Chun, what is this?

162
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,211
A decoder.

163
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:28,371
It must be from Yongcheng.

164
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:30,371
Why all this trouble?

165
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:32,371
Can't we just open it?

166
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:35,316
This is something

167
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,451
he doesn't even know how to do.

168
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,471
Let's buy Uncle Chun some time.

169
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:32,851
No problem.

170
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,872
Let's go for it.

171
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:37,884
Let's go for it.

172
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,744
Go!

173
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:45,411
♫  I go from running  ♫

174
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:48,835
♫  To flying  ♫

175
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,793
♫  Through setbacks and hardship  ♫

176
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:56,251
♫  So what?  ♫

177
00:17:56,251 --> 00:18:00,035
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

178
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:03,636
♫  It shines on my face  ♫

179
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:07,179
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

180
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:10,574
♫  Unwilling to lose hope  ♫

181
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:15,999
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

182
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:19,415
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

183
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:24,910
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

184
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:30,563
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

185
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:34,395
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

186
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:39,879
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

187
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:42,574
Xiaoqin!

188
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:46,353
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

189
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:49,081
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

190
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,705
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

191
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:54,297
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

192
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:57,461
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

193
00:18:57,461 --> 00:19:01,041
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

194
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,937
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

195
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:09,340
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

196
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:12,130
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

197
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,910
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

198
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,706
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

199
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:25,562
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

200
00:21:14,031 --> 00:21:15,828
Chun Yu.

201
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,651
- Chun Yu.  
 - Chun Yu, you're finally here.

202
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,371
Are you hungry? Eat something.

203
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,690
Xiaoqin, well… Let's have a toast.

204
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,248
Sure.

205
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,411
May the two of us be together forever.

206
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:44,291
Cross-toasting.

207
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,091
- No, no, no. 
 - Cross-toasting

208
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:48,630
D-Don't make a fuss.

209
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,711
Cross-toasting is embarrassing with so many people here.

210
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,651
Just do it.

211
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:03,071
Sweet.

212
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,871
Let's make one toast.

213
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:08,851
Here, friendship forever.

214
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,531
Come on, I'll start first.

215
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:56,311
- Hurry up, come on. 
 - All right, all right.

216
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:57,796
Are you in such a hurry to lose?

217
00:22:57,796 --> 00:22:59,816
Take it easy.

218
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:01,371
Come on, let's do it, come on.

219
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:02,511
Your turn.

220
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,331
- Come on. 
 - You go first.

221
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:06,690
- Go! 
 - Six.

222
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,590
- Pass. 
 - Come on.

223
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,260
Dad.

224
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:13,432
This is Xiaoqin.

225
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,930
As my daughter-in-law, you must be good at playing Mahjong.

226
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,491
Uncle, I don't know how.

227
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:24,991
Didn't I teach you yesterday?

228
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:27,810
- I don't know how to play. 
 -  Roll the dice.

229
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,851
Play this one.

230
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,871
Don't panic, keep it up.

231
00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:43,531
Pong!

232
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:45,408
Eight Character.

233
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,891
Hold on!

234
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:48,350
Eight Character.

235
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,168
Did I win?

236
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:55,408
I won.

237
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,648
You know it.

238
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:04,451
East wind.

239
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:05,951
Draw a tile.

240
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:07,451
Push the tiles forward.

241
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:09,511
- Eight Character. 
 - Hold on.

242
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,271
I won again.

243
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:13,071
You do know how to play.

244
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:15,411
Come on, one last round.

245
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:20,491
It's far from winning.

246
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:24,111
Xiaoqin, y-you go easy on my dad.

247
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:26,404
What?

248
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:28,710
Nothing, your turn.

249
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:31,216
Eight Character.

250
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,770
Don't…

251
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,250
I won! Self-drawn win.

252
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,511
I'm done playing. Here, take it all.

253
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,370
Dad, dad!

254
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,091
Wait! Dad, play a bit more.

255
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:46,751
No. I'm not playing.

256
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,331
- Wait, dad. 
 - Go away, I'm not playing.

257
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:51,311
- Dad. 
 - I…

258
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:52,471
Look, he's getting agitated.

259
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:53,851
Exactly.

260
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:55,831
Xiaoqin, Xiaoqin!

261
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:57,890
Take it easy, Xiaoqin.

262
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,351
Xiaoqin, don't be angry.

263
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:01,351
Listen to me, let me explain.

264
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:02,391
Go away.

265
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:04,731
No, Xiaoqin! My dad didn't mean it.

266
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:07,511
You can't blame him.

267
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:09,911
Fine, I don't blame him. Let me ask you.

268
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:13,231
Why didn't you speak up for me just now?

269
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:14,910
Well…

270
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,311
Yang Bawan.

271
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:18,471
I don't think we're right for each other.

272
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:22,190
I think we're perfect for each other.

273
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,351
For example,

274
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:24,951
let's talk about our favorite drinks.

275
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:28,331
I like Sprite, and you only like Coke.

276
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:29,931
They are both sodas.

277
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:32,991
I like to watch thrillers. You only like to watch romances.

278
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,891
I love spicy food, but you don't eat spicy food.

279
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,410
Xiaoqin, look.

280
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,271
We have different hobbies, but we can still be in love.

281
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:43,011
Isn't that called harmonization?

282
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:44,290
What?

283
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,611
We don't have anything in common.

284
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,110
We don't match at all.

285
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:58,920
I see.

286
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:09,591
Yes, I think we are a bad match.  So let's break up.

287
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:13,050
- I didn't mean… 
 - Nan Xiaoqin, let me tell you.

288
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,671
Don't you think you are quite self-righteous

289
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:17,190
and self-centered?

290
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,771
What's wrong with enjoying a different drink?

291
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:21,291
Why must you watch thrillers, but not romances with me?

292
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:24,711
Why do you have to eat so spicy when I like to eat light?

293
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,631
Being so serious about playing mahjong.

294
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:29,231
I told you my dad is hot-tempered.

295
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:32,190
He is bound to get angry if you win so many times.

296
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,904
This is also my fault.

297
00:26:33,904 --> 00:26:36,250
Fine, let's break up.

298
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,128
I've had enough.

299
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:42,791
All right then, let's break up.

300
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:14,871
You said we would be together forever.

301
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:16,690
It's only been a few days.

302
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,990
A man can never be trusted.

303
00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:31,868

304
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,271
- You let go. 
 - You let go.

305
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:41,290
You let go! These are my potatoes!

306
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,011
Chun Yu, come and take a look.

307
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,411
I'm here. What's wrong, Dad?

308
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:47,291
Can potatoes be eaten after sprouting?

309
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,831
I told her to throw them away. Am I mistaken?

310
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:51,231
Rubbish.

311
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:52,591
These potatoes are fine.

312
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:56,311
We've been eating them for years and it's fine. Right, Chun Yu?

313
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:59,111
Dad, stop it and leave grandma alone.

314
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,811
This is science. I can't leave her alone!

315
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:02,031
Nonsense!

316
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:03,611
My experience is science!

317
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:05,691
- Okay, grandma. 
 - Will you let go or not?

318
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:08,931
Will you let go or not?

319
00:28:09,851 --> 00:28:12,271
Old lady, are you crazy?

320
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:15,011
I have to throw them away today!

321
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,751
Get out of here! Get out of here!

322
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,671
Get out of here!

323
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:32,851
I'm leaving!

324
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:34,391
Hello, Xiaoqin.

325
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:36,171
Chun Yu, I'd like to talk to you.

326
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:37,231
 Get out of here!

327
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:39,910
 I'll talk to you later.

328
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,151
 All right, grandma, all right.

329
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:56,971
My potatoes.

330
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:58,290
- Here. 
 - My potatoes.

331
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,351
It's all right, grandma.

332
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,351
I'm going to check.

333
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:05,724
Grandma, it's all right.

334
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:11,311
Dad, Dad.

335
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:12,980
Dad.

336
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,231
Don't try to convince me.

337
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:16,011
I'm definitely not going back there.

338
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:17,530
But…

339
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,271
Don't speak up for your grandma.

340
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:24,691
You know what I have done for her all this time.

341
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:26,336
But she…

342
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,751
Forget it.

343
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:32,431
Your grandma and I could never get along.

344
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:35,571
I won't come here again!

345
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,071
We…

346
00:29:41,971 --> 00:29:44,190
might meet sometime.

347
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:46,948
Dad!

348
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:55,951
 You should be honest with me.

349
00:29:55,951 --> 00:29:57,671
 I didn't lie to you.

350
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,871
 Fly out of here if you can.

351
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:02,931
 You are a liar, and won't admit it. You big liar!

352
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:05,070
 I am not a liar. I didn't mean to.

353
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,191
 You did it on purpose.

354
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,250
 Listen to me, I didn't mean to…

355
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,470
- What else is there to explain? 
 - You're simply a liar.

356
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,711
Chun Yu, come save me. They're going to hit me.

357
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,276
Brother Qiang.

358
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,531
Who's going to hit you?

359
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:18,151
You just have to pay us back!

360
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,770
You want me to pay you back, but you locked me up!

361
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,730
Each of you holds a weapon in your hand.

362
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,131
If you don't pay us back today, then don't blame us.

363
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:27,251
Uncle Chen, don't worry.

364
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:28,411
Everyone, don't worry.

365
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,251
This is my friend. What's going on?

366
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,510
Chun Yu, you'd better stay out of this.

367
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,811
This person is a big liar.

368
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,010
A few days ago,

369
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,231
he tricked the elderly in our community

370
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:41,010
with the promise of exchanging old appliances for new ones.

371
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,511
As a result, he collected a lot of money,

372
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:45,530
but we haven't seen any appliance.

373
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,871
- Yes, exactly. 
 - Everything is gone.

374
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:48,591
You liar, return my money.

375
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:49,811
Is it true, Brother Qiang?

376
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:52,630
I never meant to lie to anyone.

377
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,851
That project was negotiated by Hei Er and A'Yong.

378
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:58,071
They knew a reliable boss who was a distant relative.

379
00:30:58,071 --> 00:31:00,051
Then the day before yesterday, they went to inspect the goods.

380
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:01,290
There was no problem.

381
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,891
Today when I took them to the warehouse to pick up the goods,

382
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:07,690
the entire supply was gone.

383
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,416
That guy also disappeared.

384
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:13,231
Hei Er and A'Yong are also nowhere to be found.

385
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,696
Check this out.

386
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:17,150

387
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,190

388
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,291

389
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,220

390
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,591
Their phones are all off.

391
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:28,770
I can't get through.

392
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:35,891
I made a mistake in the past,

393
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:39,150
but I've also been punished,

394
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,371
and I did get them both out.

395
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:48,551
Why does our friendship end up being used for profit?

396
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:51,610
I've known them both for over a decade.

397
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,110
Over a decade!

398
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,510
Everyone, it's my fault.

399
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,390
I've lost the goods and the money,

400
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,251
so I'll just pay you with my life.

401
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:14,032
Come on.

402
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,290
No, no, no. Don't do this.

403
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,251
We don't need your life.

404
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:20,411
Brother Qiang, wait for me at Uncle Chen's place.

405
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:22,291
- I'll go find Gao Xuan. We'll come up with a solution. 
 - No.

406
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:24,570
D-Don't worry about it. Trust me.

407
00:32:25,971 --> 00:32:27,768
Let's go.

408
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:29,611
Let's go.

409
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:30,711
- Sorry for the trouble. 
 - What a mess.

410
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:32,050
Chun Yu.

411
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,644
Go.

412
00:32:57,751 --> 00:32:59,276
Brother.

413
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:01,512
Brother.

414
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:10,000
Wenya.

415
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,300
Chun Yu.

416
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,950
What should I do?

417
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,771
It's all my fault.

418
00:33:16,771 --> 00:33:19,191
I shouldn't have signed up for socialite training classes.

419
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:22,171
I shouldn't have borrowed money from my brother.

420
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:25,991
Then he wouldn't work overtime and end up in a car accident.

421
00:33:25,991 --> 00:33:28,088
Who's coming with me?

422
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:30,411
- I am. 
 - Hurry up.

423
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,870

424
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,659

425
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,470
Hello, Uncle Chen.

426
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,750
 Is this Chun Yu?

427
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,231
 Your grandma has had an accident.

428
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,751
 Hurry to the Guangming Hospital.

429
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,671
Dad.

430
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:30,470
- Chun Yu. 
 - How's my grandma?

431
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,910
They are trying to save her.

432
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,520
Okay.

433
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,024
The doctor said,

434
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:44,630
it might not look good.

435
00:34:45,371 --> 00:34:47,690
You should be prepared.

436
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:00,690
Chun Yu, are you okay?

437
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,350
Didn't you say… Didn't you say we would start over?

438
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,831
Didn't you say we were supposed…

439
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:10,351
to live happily together?

440
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:12,431
Why did you have to upset her?

441
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:15,891
Can't you just let her be?

442
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,200
I'm sorry.

443
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:29,359

444
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,270
 I'm truly sorry. We've done our best.

445
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,400

446
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:46,430
