1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:10,020

2
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:56,727

3
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,771

4
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:03,947
We are ready to start.

5
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,547
Come on, come on.

6
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:15,516
Qing You, A'Yong, Brother Qiang, Hei Er, don't thank us too much.

7
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,196

8
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:51,060

9
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,000

10
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:11,807
 Welcome to the World of Joy.

11
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:13,766
What is this?

12
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:14,867
Get these off.

13
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,506
W-What's going on here?

14
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,087
Don't worry. Don't worry.

15
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,607
It's no use, Chun Yu. It can't be opened at all.

16
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:25,568
We've been tricked.

17
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:28,408
Where is Gao Xuan?

18
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,206
I-I don't know.

19
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:36,788
 Everyone, the game isn't over yet.

20
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:40,727
 Welcome to the World of Joy Part 2

21
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:43,546
 Joyful Circus

22
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:46,207
So you don't care at all

23
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,066
about any agreements or so-called evidence, do you?

24
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:51,227
Chun Yu, don't forget it is just an NPC.

25
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:52,946
I know you are monitoring us.

26
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:57,267
"What? You only dare to do it, but not to admit it?"

27
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,826
 You are right.

28
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:14,407
 If that's the case, why did you stage this act so carefully?

29
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,847
Actually, it was you who broke in that day.

30
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:26,627
When Gao Xuan broke into the equipment room,

31
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,467
he in fact damaged our system,

32
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:35,907
causing the server and your chips to disconnect.

33
00:05:35,907 --> 00:05:39,567
All of your player data was lost,

34
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:41,047
and I was very worried about it.

35
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:45,972
Who knew you would come to me on your own to make a deal?

36
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:50,207
 So I just went with the flow.

37
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,227
Now everything is fine.

38
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:01,287
All data has been recovered.

39
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:03,566
 You bastard, you deceived us!

40
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,368
 You are simply despicable.

41
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:08,368
 Where is Gao Xuan? What exactly have you done to him?

42
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,476
Rest assured.

43
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:14,847
Now that he is in the game, he must play by the rules.

44
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,587
I wouldn't hurt him carelessly.

45
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:18,987
 Where exactly is he?

46
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:21,684
I will keep you in suspense for a little while.

47
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:23,687
You'll find out in a moment.

48
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,787
 I don't want to play this damned game anymore.

49
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:29,587
 Let me out. Let me out.

50
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,824
That won't do.

51
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,027
As a human being, I have two flaws.

52
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,067
The first is obsessive-compulsive disorder  (OCD) .

53
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,507
It bothers me to see things left unfinished.

54
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:41,966
Second, I hate being threatened by others.

55
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:47,826
But I really like people who follow the rules of the game.

56
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:52,707
As long as you pass the level, everyone can be saved.

57
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:55,846
 If there are no problems,

58
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:59,686
I will now announce the game rules.

59
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,607
Your voice is really unpleasant.

60
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:03,406
 You can silence me.

61
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,726
At the same time, the chainsaw will silence Xu Wenya.

62
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:16,027
 Or you can accept my voice,

63
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,926
 and listen carefully to find out how you can save her.

64
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:21,264
What should we do?

65
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:24,286
 Do you see the two bicycles?

66
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,348
Don't worry.

67
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,847
 When the game starts, the chainsaw will continue to descend.

68
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:35,067
 When the speed of the bicycles exceeds 30 km/hour,

69
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,947
 the chainsaw will stop descending and begin to ascend.

70
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:42,027
 The faster the speed, the higher the chainsaw rises.

71
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:44,047
 When the chainsaw rises to the highest point,

72
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,586
 Xu Wenya will be safe, and you will pass the level.

73
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,807
 I must remind you,

74
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:54,307
 both people must be fully in sync for the speed to be effective.

75
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:58,807
W-What is this thing in my hand?

76
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,807
That is my finishing touch.

77
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,866
 It is a bomb detonator.

78
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:07,446
 You can detonate the bomb on the bicycles at any time,

79
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:11,127
 and the chainsaw will stop descending.

80
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:18,720
Then… What about the people on the bicycles?

81
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,147
Do you think anyone can survive a bomb explosion?

82
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:24,066
You're a pervert.

83
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:25,786
Are you crazy?

84
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:29,852
 Now, please select your game players.

85
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:33,507
The other two must join a different party.

86
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,527
Is Gao Xuan over there?

87
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:39,836
Guess.

88
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:44,680
Chun Yu, go and find Old Gao.

89
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,392
I'll stay.

90
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,287
This is a game of physical endurance.

91
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:50,966
Maybe you should stay, Dou Dou.

92
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:54,447
 You two, please go to the theater.

93
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,704
Chun Yu,

94
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:05,706
d-don't go.

95
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:11,046
If you can trust me, you can trust them as well.

96
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:32,626
You just have to do one thing.

97
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:36,606
Keep your fingers away from that button.

98
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,867
 I hope you all have fun.

99
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:44,987
 Are the two riders ready?

100
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:48,567
 The game begins now.

101
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:51,647
Wenya, don't worry.

102
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:53,687
Dou Dou and I are really good at this.

103
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,352
I'm telling you…

104
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:00,366
It began to move.

105
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,468
- Come on, come on. 
 - It's moving.

106
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:20,447
Gao Xuan.

107
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:23,327
Gao Xuan, are you okay? Gao Xuan.

108
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:30,446
Chun Yu, Uncle Lin.

109
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:37,047
I know you want to save him,

110
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,867
but the game has rules.

111
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,988
 You bastard!

112
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,866
Save your lung capacity.

113
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,987
 When the game starts, the tank will be filled with water.

114
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:50,607
 I'm curious if you will save your breath for your lungs,

115
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:53,206
 or use it to yell for help.

116
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:55,466
How are you going to let him out?

117
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,146
No, no, you are mistaken.

118
00:10:58,146 --> 00:10:59,896
Instead of asking how I'm going to let him out,

119
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:03,967
 ask how you can pass the level and save him.

120
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:17,007
 You must take turns to draw out blocks.

121
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,626
 If you draw ten blocks and the block tower doesn't fall,

122
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:23,986
 the water flow will stop, and he will live.

123
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:25,427
Of course,

124
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:29,347
the block drawing speed must exceed the water flow speed.

125
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:31,347
 How many chances do we have?

126
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,496
Do as you please.

127
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:37,307
But with each collapse, the water tank will gain another inflow.

128
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:41,366
 I don't think you have much room for errors.

129
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:46,372
What an asshole.

130
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,547
Holding other people's fates in the palm of your hand.

131
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,632
You're quite happy, aren't you?

132
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:52,926
You also have the choice to do so.

133
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:58,147
 Can you feel that remote control in your hand?

134
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:04,986
Be careful. Otherwise, these two will die.

135
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:12,087
 So if he blows us up, he will survive.

136
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:16,087
This is what being in control means.

137
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,096
I am not like you.

138
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:22,347
I only hold onto what should belong to me.

139
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:27,507
Nice.

140
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:30,906
Now you've put all the pressure on other people.

141
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:33,746
 You're not so noble, either.

142
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,666
 Now you can take your places.

143
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,966
Let the game begin.

144
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:54,447
Chun Yu, Uncle Lin, don't worry about me.

145
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:57,827
Gao Xuan, do you trust me?

146
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:16,452
How could this happen?

147
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:22,006
 I forgot to mention it earlier.

148
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:23,666
 To add more excitement to the game,

149
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:27,627
 The block's number each time will decrease and reduce gradually.

150
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:29,006
The more mistakes you make,

151
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,656
 the faster it will fall.

152
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,307
 Challenging enough, isn't it?

153
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:35,467
 Don't let me down, Chun Yu.

154
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:10,232
Wait.

155
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,946
Dou Dou, come on, pedal hard!

156
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:15,147
I've been pedaling hard. It's you who's pedaling out of control.

157
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,047
Didn't he say it?

158
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:20,587
You two must be in perfect sync to produce effective speed.

159
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:21,647
You've got to be in sync.

160
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:23,167
Yes, I remember now. I remember.

161
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,088
We must stay in sync.

162
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:27,607
Let's do this. Dou Dou, listen to my beat.

163
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:29,147
Let's stay in sync, okay?

164
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:31,566
Okay, one, two, one, two.

165
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:35,267
One, two, one, two.

166
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,720
 No.

167
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,906
 I must trust them.

168
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:51,367
One, two, one, two.

169
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:54,047
Bawan, slow down the rhythm.

170
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,067
Pedal a little slower.

171
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:59,216
First, make sure you are in sync. Okay?

172
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:02,827
Yes, calm down. Take it step by step.

173
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,306
Dou Dou, let's go slower.

174
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,786
One, two.

175
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:08,247
One, two.

176
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:10,466
One, two.

177
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:11,827
One, two.

178
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,347
One, two.

179
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:14,967
One, two.

180
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,387
One, two.

181
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:18,366
One, two.

182
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:25,666
Good, just like that. Just like that.

183
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,946
One, two.

184
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,616
Then let's try to go a little faster.

185
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:32,736
- Okay. 
 - A little faster.

186
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,586
Come on! One, two, one, two.

187
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:36,570
One, two, one, two.

188
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,180

189
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:42,466
One, two.

190
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:43,987
One, two.

191
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:46,126
One, two, one, two.

192
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:48,547
Yes, yes, yes.

193
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,727
Calling out the beats is really useful.

194
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:53,086
Victory is right before our eyes.

195
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,707
Good thing I'm standing here.

196
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:58,547
If I had been over there, my legs would have been broken.

197
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:03,147
Xiaoqin, you always wear a mask.

198
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:04,646
Won't it affect your breathing?

199
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:07,726
Actually, you really don't need it now.

200
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,632
I'm Dou Dou.

201
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:11,587
Dou Dou! You are right.

202
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,427
I think the two of us have pretty good chemistry.

203
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:15,006
From now on, let's form a partnership.

204
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:18,246
We'll be called the Eight Bean Squad. 
  (TN: Eight Bean sounds like Ba-Dou)

205
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:21,907
Come on, you got this!

206
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:24,067
Victory is right before our eyes.

207
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,480
Pull this one.

208
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:13,027
We only have two left.

209
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:14,627
We can definitely succeed.

210
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:16,908
Don't be nervous.

211
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:29,387
President Yan, they are about to pass the level.

212
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:36,646
 The real game is just about to begin.

213
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,787
 Stop pretending to be calm.

214
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:58,506
 In fact, you know very well

215
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:02,366
 that you can't save the people you want to save.

216
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,386
 That was the case then.

217
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:26,600
Gao Xuan.

218
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,266
 It is still the case now.

219
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,827
 Everything is in vain.

220
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:34,607
I If I can pull out ten blocks and the tower doesn't fall,

221
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:36,847
 Mom will be fine.

222
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:54,488
 One.

223
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,104
 Two.

224
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:01,340
 Three.

225
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:04,224
 Four.

226
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,708
 Five.

227
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,480
 Six.

228
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,704
 Seven.

229
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:26,044
 Eight.

230
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:29,092
 Nine.

231
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,246
 Ten.

232
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:00,472
 Doctor,

233
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:03,704
 my wife…

234
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:07,946
 I'm sorry, we've done our best.

235
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:07,946
 First round of block tower game. Failure.

236
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,646
One, two. One, two. One, two.

237
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:28,067
Victory is right before our eyes. Come on!

238
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:31,070
One, two, one, two, one, two.

239
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,840
One, two.

240
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:42,727
 Everyone, the competition is about to begin.

241
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,727
 This is the women's foil final.

242
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:48,086
 The contestant on the right is Zhao Meijuan. Her skills are exceptional.

243
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:49,506
 She has won the national championship.

244
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:51,507
 The contestant on the left is Nan Xiaoqin,

245
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:53,987
 who comes from a fencing family.

246
00:21:53,987 --> 00:21:56,507
 Nan Xiaoqin's mother is a famous foil fencer,

247
00:21:56,507 --> 00:21:57,987
 who has won many championships.

248
00:21:57,987 --> 00:22:00,006
 Her mother is her coach now,

249
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:03,266
 so Nan Xiaoqin has truly inherited the skills.

250
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:08,687
 Good. Nan Xiaoqin just made a quick sprint.

251
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:11,187
 Beautiful! Scoring effectively one to zero.

252
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:13,147
 The contestant is very excited.

253
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:16,487
 Nan Xiaoqin rubbed her leg.

254
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,446
 There shouldn't be a problem, right?

255
00:22:18,446 --> 00:22:21,026
 Okay, both sides will continue.

256
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:23,407
 Nan Xiaoqin begins her attack again.

257
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:25,506
 Clearly, her playing style is very aggressive,

258
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:28,627
 just like her mother's.

259
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:39,127
 What happened? She suddenly fell down.

260
00:22:40,306 --> 00:22:43,806
 She has stopped and seems to be in great pain.

261
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:57,166
 Oh my! She's signaling to stop the match.

262
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:42,447
What are you doing? Focus!

263
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,526
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

264
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:48,566
Dou Dou, listen to the beat. Follow the beat.

265
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:51,066
Dou Dou, what's wrong?

266
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:56,386
My leg is useless.

267
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:57,587
What are you talking about?

268
00:23:57,587 --> 00:23:59,624
What's wrong with her?

269
00:23:59,624 --> 00:24:01,526
I can't ride anymore.

270
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:04,066
Dou Dou, look at me.

271
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:06,546
- Dou Dou. 
 - My leg is not working any more.

272
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,447
 Okay, let's try going uphill.

273
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,600
 How is it?

274
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,388
 It's fine.

275
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:51,126
 Besides fencing, what else are you interested in?

276
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:53,152
 I…

277
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:55,686
 Are you saying she can't train anymore?

278
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:59,227
 I'm just suggesting she avoids high-intensity sports .

279
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:01,586
 Daily life is not a problem.

280
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,416
 I see.

281
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:13,846
 Mom, I can do it.

282
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,580
 Mom.

283
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:42,786
The leg is useless.

284
00:25:42,786 --> 00:25:44,448
What?

285
00:25:47,227 --> 00:25:50,227
 It may sound cruel, but it's true.

286
00:25:50,227 --> 00:25:53,926
 Your leg may not recover completely.

287
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:55,426
I can't ride anymore.

288
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:58,007
My leg's not working.

289
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:00,726
W-What's wrong with your leg?

290
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:03,687
It hurts a lot.

291
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,907
My leg is about to break.

292
00:26:05,907 --> 00:26:07,727
What nonsense are you talking about?

293
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:10,306
This is in the game. In the game.

294
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:11,926
Dou Dou, what's wrong with you?

295
00:26:11,926 --> 00:26:13,660
Dou Dou.

296
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,516
I'm sorry.

297
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,007
I'm sorry, I don't want to die.

298
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:28,367
I don't want to die.

299
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:30,287
Xu Wenya, don't!

300
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:37,407
 Second round of block tower game. Failure.

301
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:45,006
Chun Yu, it's all my fault.

302
00:26:45,006 --> 00:26:48,826
The tower shook when I pulled one. You could not continue.

303
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:53,092
Uncle Lin, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

304
00:26:53,092 --> 00:26:55,406
This has nothing to do with you.

305
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,907
Chun Yu, Uncle Lin,

306
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,106
it's okay. We have time.

307
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:05,506
 The third round of block tower game begins.

308
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:44,427
Chun Yu, are you okay?

309
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:48,192
I'm fine.

310
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:44,827
 Third round of block tower game. Failure.

311
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:04,047
 Stop pretending to be calm.

312
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:06,266
 In fact, you know very well

313
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:09,586
 that you can't save the people you want to save.

314
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:12,767
 That was the case then. It is still the case now.

315
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:14,767
 Chun Yu, I am a little scared.

316
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:18,066
 I just feel safe being with you.

317
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:22,007
 Now I could finally protect you.

318
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:25,706
 As long as you want to continue this game, I won't leave.

319
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:27,280
 Thank you.

320
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,587
 Second round of block tower game. Failure.

321
00:29:30,587 --> 00:29:32,986
 Failure. Failure.

322
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:37,627
 Mom. Mom.

323
00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:39,620
Nan Xiaoqin.

324
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:48,156
Mom.

325
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:50,187
Your leg doesn't work. Does it?

326
00:29:50,187 --> 00:29:52,247
If not, just step down.

327
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:54,567
Don't waste my time.

328
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:58,246
Mom, I can do it. Look.

329
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:06,827
You've been a great disappointment for me.

330
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:09,366
I've spent so much effort to train you.

331
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:11,866
Is this the extent of your potential?

332
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:15,072
It's fine. I can still fence.

333
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:16,847
I think you should give up.

334
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:19,067
Give up.

335
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:22,706
You'll never be able to fence again.

336
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:26,547
Nan Xiaoqin, you are just a waste.

337
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,507
Right, Nan Xiaoqin, we are just waste.

338
00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:33,012
I am not. I am not.

339
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:34,387
- Nan Xiaoqin. 
 - Nan Xiaoqin.

340
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:36,007
- Nan Xiaoqin. 
 - We are just waste.

341
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:38,307
- No. 
 - Nan Xiaoqin, you are just a waste.

342
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:40,347
Right, Nan Xiaoqin, we are just waste.

343
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:42,040
No.

344
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:45,156
- Dou Dou. 
 - I am not.

345
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:46,586
I am not.

346
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:49,607
Dou Dou, wake up! Your leg is fine.

347
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:51,516
Dou Dou.

348
00:30:53,408 --> 00:30:55,487
Dou Dou. Dou Dou, wake up.

349
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,887
Dou Dou, your leg is fine.

350
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:02,107
It's too late! It's really too late.

351
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:04,096
Don't move.

352
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:06,907
Nan Xiaoqin, listen to me.

353
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:10,047
It doesn't matter if you are Dou Dou or Nan Xiaoqin.

354
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:13,647
Step out of your mask. Think about the real you.

355
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,826
The Xiaoqin I know would never give up at this time,

356
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:19,547
and would never bow down.

357
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:21,466
Besides, you are not alone.

358
00:31:21,466 --> 00:31:24,220
You have me and Wenya.

359
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,947
We are all friends, we're a team.

360
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:28,926
No one can leave anyone behind. Got it?

361
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:33,486
 Because she's braver than all of us.

362
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:36,026
 She is the most beautiful, coolest, and kindest girl

363
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:38,127
 I've seen in my life.

364
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:40,796
Okay.

365
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,467
It is the same with you. You have to trust us.

366
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,464
We are friends.

367
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:55,387
No one can leave anyone behind.

368
00:32:24,288 --> 00:32:25,812
 Chun Yu.

369
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,024
 Chun Yu.

370
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:31,828
 Chun Yu. Chun Yu.

371
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:35,506
Chun Yu, Chun Yu, listen to me.

372
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:37,980
I believe in you.

373
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,047
You can make this happen.

374
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:47,807
 Chun Yu, what's wrong with you?

375
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:53,626
 Chun Yu, I promise. I will definitely come back.

376
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:57,746
 Especially the bits and pieces with you.

377
00:32:57,746 --> 00:33:00,106
 Even if it's just a minute or a second,

378
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:02,487
 I don't want to forget it.

379
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:11,087
Chun Yu, let's try one more time.

380
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:43,606
 The game is over.

381
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:17,526
My legs really don't work.

382
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,680
Come on, get up.

383
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:32,907
It's all right now.

384
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:34,656
It's over.

385
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:46,947
Gao Xuan and the others are still inside.

386
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,606
We have one left.

387
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:11,926
It didn't fall. It didn't fall.

388
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:13,287
 Congratulations, everyone.

389
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:15,806
 Game is over.

390
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,928
Gao Xuan.

391
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:26,588
Gao Xuan.

392
00:37:27,364 --> 00:37:29,116
Gao Xuan.

393
00:37:31,987 --> 00:37:33,207
We have already won.

394
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:35,866
 Why hasn't the water in the tank receded yet?

395
00:37:35,866 --> 00:37:38,267
Are those two things related?

396
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:41,680
Gao Xuan.

397
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:47,216
Old Gao.

398
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,370

399
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:24,300
