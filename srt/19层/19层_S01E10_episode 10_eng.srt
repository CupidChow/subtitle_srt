1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,060

2
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,680

3
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,840

4
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:08,897
Have you decided?

5
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:12,029
 It may sound cruel, but it's true.

6
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:16,049
 Your leg may not recover completely.

7
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,049
If you haven't decided, shall we…

8
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,369
- I'm fine with it. 
 - Okay.

9
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:46,368

10
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:49,428

11
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:53,088

12
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:59,828
Nan Xiaoqin, what are you doing here?

13
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:03,108
I came to buy groceries

14
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,792
but I couldn't find any.

15
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:13,809
- Let me help. 
 - No need.

16
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,460
Hurry up.

17
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,469
What for? Rushing to the underworld?

18
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:39,449
What's wrong with you?

19
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:40,789
You're delaying all of us.

20
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,048
- What… 
 - That's enough.

21
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,860
Are you okay?

22
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:07,996
Thanks.

23
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:14,069
Come on, we're buddies. We got each other's backs.

24
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,728
So why are you here?

25
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,268
That was a gaming company.

26
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:22,488
They just released a game called the "19th Floor."

27
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,709
It's a super realistic game.

28
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:27,048
So shocking. So thrilling.

29
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:30,529
Do you play games?

30
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:35,369
Then you won't experience the fun of games.

31
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:37,509
Anyway, I passed their trial test

32
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,709
and they invited me to sign a contract.

33
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,584
Did you sign it?

34
00:04:44,388 --> 00:04:47,488
I asked them about the player Dou Dou

35
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:51,429
and threatened not to sign unless they told me who she was.

36
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:54,089
Did they tell you?

37
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:57,052
No.

38
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,169
So you didn't sign.

39
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:00,920
No, I signed.

40
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,848
Why?

41
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:05,988
I think they didn't tell me who she was

42
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:09,489
because she had dropped out of the game.

43
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:13,689
But I have a feeling she would definitely continue to play.

44
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,168
She is such a special girl.

45
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:19,708
So brave. So powerful.

46
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:23,128
She saved my life in the game.

47
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:29,549
I'm looking forward to seeing her in the game.

48
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:31,569
The chances are slim,

49
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:35,949
but I don't want to give up.

50
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:46,048
What a fool.

51
00:05:56,768 --> 00:06:00,004

52
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:11,789
Hello, I'm a substitute teacher here. My name is Gao Xuan.

53
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:14,889
Mr. Gao, are you here to borrow books?

54
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,429
No, here's the thing.

55
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:20,288
My student was here yesterday and lost her textbook.

56
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:23,029
I'm wondering if I can check the video surveillance

57
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,369
and see if someone else took it.

58
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,248
Okay. When did it happen?

59
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:30,808
About eight in the evening.

60
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:36,956
Okay, please pause it.

61
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:40,089
Please go back a little.

62
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,720
Okay.

63
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,880
Okay, here.

64
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:02,428
Mimi, I didn't know it would turn out so bad.

65
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:05,049
She's getting punished.

66
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:08,196
Why did you do that?

67
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,969
What are you talking about?

68
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:14,269
Senior.

69
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:16,549
You posted the video.

70
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,949
No, it wasn't me.

71
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:31,529
The first post was posted on campus at 20:01 last night,

72
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,528
and it was easy to trace the IP address.

73
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:36,868
It's the third reading room in the library.

74
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:38,649
I checked the surveillance footage.

75
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:43,428
You were the only one there at the time.

76
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:47,049
Do you know what else?

77
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,288
In the game, she was wearing these clothes...

78
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:51,949
I don't know what they're called.

79
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:53,549
- Anyway, she looked great. 
 - Excuse me.

80
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,348
Where is the guy's dorm?

81
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:58,348
It's straight ahead.

82
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,648
Xiaoqin, excuse me. I…

83
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:13,089
Buddy, it's so hard to find you. I mean, man.

84
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:15,769
Come on, man. Why did you come to my college?

85
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,500
It's scary,

86
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:19,768
and I'm desperate.

87
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:23,649
Buddy, it's urgent. Help me out.

88
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,908
Again?

89
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:28,276
Lend me some money.

90
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:29,940
Not much.

91
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:33,108
Just ¥20,000.

92
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:36,849
I'm desperate. I have to pay the hospital bill.

93
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,376
Brother Qiang, I wish I could help,

94
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:41,769
but I'm just a student. Why would I have any money?

95
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:44,276
That's true.

96
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:48,209
Why don't you talk to your dad?

97
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:51,509
Make him repay his debt. At least I'll get a bonus.

98
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:56,188
Forget it. My dad is only interested in money.

99
00:08:57,108 --> 00:09:01,989
Maybe you can take me home to search for the bank books.

100
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,828
Say something.

101
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,788
Brother Qiang, I think you should just…

102
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:17,188

103
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,408
Chun Yu, what a small world. Do me a favor.

104
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:22,796
Go away.

105
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:26,469
B-Be reasonable. You're an educated person.

106
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:29,788
Brother Qiang... I think she is in a bad mood

107
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:33,349
Bawan, help me. I mean, help A'Yong.

108
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:35,508
He's my buddy.

109
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,508
What about A'Yong?

110
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:43,609
He's in the ICU now.

111
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,108
You didn't get him transferred?

112
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,608
I wanted to,

113
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,248
but they found him a new doctor.

114
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:51,249
The previous one left after completing his studies.

115
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:54,009
A'Yong's condition worsened this morning.

116
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:58,748
Was his doctor named Jia?

117
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:03,869
Yes, Dr. Jia. I bet you've seen him before.

118
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:14,492
Yes, I posted it,

119
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:17,249
but I was only telling the truth.

120
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:22,108
She didn't care about the cat. She left.

121
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,669
Just like the way she ignored me.

122
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,049
She let someone vulnerable

123
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:38,168
who counted on her die alone.

124
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:44,456

125
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,896
Qing You.

126
00:10:56,868 --> 00:11:00,429
It's really hard to get to know people.

127
00:11:00,988 --> 00:11:05,829
What you see with your eyes may not be true.

128
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:11,300
What do you mean?

129
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:15,709
Come with me and you'll see.

130
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:34,189
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

131
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:35,749
I have a package delivery.

132
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:39,088
There is a Mr. Jia in this neighborhood?

133
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:40,889
Don't you know his exact address?

134
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,929
Call him and ask him.

135
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,669
I did call, but he didn't answer.

136
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:46,908
It's beyond my field of work.

137
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:49,069
Besides, it's a huge neighborhood.

138
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:51,048
There are a lot of Mr. Jia.

139
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,029
Look, I'm running late.

140
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,449
There will be a penalty.

141
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,228
His name is Jia Haoran.

142
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:01,690
Jia Haoran?

143
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,160
- Dr. Jia! 
 - Yes.

144
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,449
He moved out this morning.

145
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:10,269
He did? Where did he go?

146
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,708
I have no idea. Ask the sender.

147
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:22,964
Granny?

148
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:28,388
Xiao Yu, one of your schoolmates came here.

149
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:30,969
She's sitting right here on our sofa.

150
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:34,728
She gave me something to sign.

151
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,752
My schoolmate?

152
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:39,889
Yes, that's right.

153
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:45,869
Xiao Yu, did you get into trouble at school?

154
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:48,969
Not at all, Granny. I will be there soon.

155
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:55,508
Would you like some water?

156
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:15,604
Granny.

157
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,749
Hello, Tianqiang.

158
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,189
Come on in. Let me bring you some tea.

159
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:25,929
Granny, I'm here to get a few things for A'Yong.

160
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:28,729
What? Give me a few things?

161
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:32,149
I'm here to get a few things for A'Yong.

162
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:35,329
- Alright, go ahead. 
 - Okay.

163
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:37,040
- Go ahead. 
 - Be careful.

164
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,728
Alright.

165
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,268
Go ahead.

166
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:11,400

167
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:16,440
Tianqiang.

168
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,769
I brought you a cup of hot water.

169
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:25,349
Drink it if you want.

170
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,868
Sure, thanks, Granny.

171
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,169

172
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:49,289
Is she really being punished?

173
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,488
Yes, Granny. Think about it.

174
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:57,728
As college students, we should value compassion and morality.

175
00:14:57,728 --> 00:15:02,128
This time, Chun Yu made a mistake.

176
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:03,608
No, no way.

177
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:06,229
I raised this kid, I know her.

178
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:09,289
She would never do something like that.

179
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:13,149
She seems cold, but she is kindhearted.

180
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,049
You are mistaken.

181
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:18,029
I didn't start the whole thing.

182
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,328
Someone caught her on camera.

183
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:22,189
Granny, don't worry.

184
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,129
Just sign the petition.

185
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,068
We'll submit it to the administration.

186
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:29,649
Maybe they will reduce her punishment.

187
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:35,969
Xiao Yu, you are finally here.

188
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,449
- It's okay, Granny. 
 - This is bad.

189
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:38,849
I'm terrified.

190
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:41,329
Senior Sister, a word outside.

191
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:44,009
Let's talk right here in front of Granny.

192
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,888
Outside, please.

193
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:59,048
It's okay, Granny.

194
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:14,809
Chun Yu, I think you know how serious this can be.

195
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,968
You may get a formal punishment.

196
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:21,928
As your senior, I don't want that to happen.

197
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:23,669
I'm the president of the Student Union,

198
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:27,429
so I took the initiative to collect signatures for the petition

199
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,988
to reduce your punishment.

200
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,069
I hope you don't mind it.

201
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:35,488
I do mind.

202
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:40,269
Firstly, I did nothing wrong.

203
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:42,369
I don't need your help to plea for me.

204
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:47,468
Secondly, you made a fuss about it to spread the rumor.

205
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:49,388
So stop pretending.

206
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,724
Lastly,

207
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:58,248
this is my final warning.

208
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:03,788
I don't care who you are.  Now or in the future,

209
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:07,128
do not approach my family ever again.

210
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,508
Do you hear me?

211
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:30,408
Hei Er and A'Yong haven't been home or called me for days.

212
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,212
Granny.

213
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:45,968
Didn't Hei Er call you recently?

214
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:47,360
What?

215
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,729
Didn't Hei Er call you recently?

216
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:55,809
Not at all. I mean it.

217
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,600
No way.

218
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:04,348
Tianqiang.

219
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:09,428
You grew up with Hei Er and A'Yong,

220
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:12,009
and you're colleagues now.

221
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:16,248
It's good you've been together all along,

222
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:20,249
but it's time to settle down.

223
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:23,308
Look at that kid next door, Dapeng.

224
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:28,629
He's only 24, and he's married with a kid.

225
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:32,929
I don't know if I'll ever see your children.

226
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:38,468
Of course, Granny.

227
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:42,749
Rest assured. I'll keep an eye on those two.

228
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:44,169
It's not just them.

229
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,300
You should work harder, too.

230
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,860
Go for it.

231
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:53,448
I have the red envelopes ready for your weddings.

232
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:56,509
Once Hei Er and A'Yong get married,

233
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,808
I won't owe their parents anything.

234
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:08,056
Granny,

235
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,028
I need to search a little more.

236
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:14,329
Okay, go ahead.

237
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:17,869
Go.

238
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:58,168
Is that the cat?

239
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,389
What can I do for you?

240
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:06,889
Hi, excuse me.

241
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,809
Do you know this girl?

242
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,608
This girl? She brought the cat here.

243
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,568
Are you sure?

244
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:16,649
Absolutely. I spoke with her.

245
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,429
She's highly recognizable.

246
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:20,769
Shopkeeper, just a minute, please.

247
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:22,149
Okay.

248
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,549
Look around. We'll talk later.

249
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,268
Thank you.

250
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:37,069
So Chun Yu never left it there.

251
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,289

252
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:43,732
Get lost.

253
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,188
 It was quite dangerous out there.

254
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:11,209
 Maybe Chun Yu thought it was safer for you in the coffin.

255
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:24,769
Chun Yu may be different from other girls.

256
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:28,988
She's proud, aloof, and stubborn.

257
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:32,729
Most people can't see the real her,

258
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:36,648
but I think you're an exception.

259
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:40,829
I think she cares about you.

260
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,508
We all go through different stages in our lives.

261
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:51,368
We may meet new friends at each stage.

262
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,009
Besides you and me,

263
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:59,249
Chun Yu may find new friends too.

264
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:05,180
But that doesn't mean you'll be gone from her life.

265
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:09,456
As for Chun Yu,

266
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,929
no matter how it goes,

267
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:17,629
she will never forget those she cares about.

268
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:30,249
So she never abandoned me.

269
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:34,928
I knew she would be like that more than anyone else.

270
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:37,469
She did so much for me

271
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:40,048
but never said anything.

272
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:45,589
Why did I misunderstand and hurt her?

273
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:53,149
Qing You, it's not too late.

274
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:14,408
 Wenya, you're adorable.

275
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:15,569
 We will always support you.

276
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:16,508
I'm so thirsty.

277
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:18,128
 We love you.

278
00:24:18,128 --> 00:24:20,189
 Love you forever.

279
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,809
Thank you for your support.

280
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,068
I'll keep working hard.

281
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:28,249
 Where are your roommates?

282
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:30,989
In class, of course.

283
00:24:30,989 --> 00:24:33,289
 Are they easygoing?

284
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:37,349
Of course, because I'm easygoing too.

285
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:41,169
It's only been a week.

286
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:45,464
We are already… good friends.

287
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:50,648
Hello, there. Play along.

288
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:53,189
Then clean the dorm for a week.

289
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:55,008
Are you blackmailing me?

290
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:57,028
Then, I'll tell the truth.

291
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:01,208
The deal… is canceled.

292
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:05,489
Sweeties, I hate to keep you up late.

293
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:09,268
Let's call it a day. Bye, love you.

294
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:12,576
What's going on?

295
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:18,009
You can be bribed,

296
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:20,168
but someone will never play along.

297
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:22,929
I won't look for trouble.

298
00:25:27,268 --> 00:25:30,049
Today I got many viewers.

299
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:40,809
Did you go to the Students Office? Is everything okay?

300
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:43,229
Of course not.

301
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:48,168
Today I signed a petition for her.

302
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:54,668
Chun Yu, you must be grateful to our senior sister.

303
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,828
If I really did that, would the petition make any difference?

304
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:10,989
If I didn't do it, the petition only serves to spread the rumor.

305
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:15,889
What's wrong with you? I was trying to help.

306
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,189
Cat killer…

307
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:31,249
...real video.

308
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:39,849
 This is the cat mentioned in the cat-killing incident.

309
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,049
 It has been saved and treated.

310
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,749
 It's recovering well.

311
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:48,369
 Excuse me, Madam.

312
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:49,989
 Do you know this girl?

313
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:54,189
 I remember her. She rushed here with this kitty that day.

314
00:26:54,189 --> 00:26:56,449
 She found it on the highway.

315
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,289
 We treated the cat

316
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,669
 and then she paid the bill.

317
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:02,749
So she was wrongly accused.

318
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,849
Who knows what's real online?

319
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:12,049
But whoever recorded the video sounds familiar.

320
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:16,089
That sounds like Senior Gao Xuan, doesn't it?

321
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:17,648
No.

322
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:27,669
So she didn't hit that cat.

323
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:31,328

324
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:41,049
So you were wrongfully accused.

325
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,204
Isn't that obvious?

326
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:45,389
There is evidence and a witness. Can't you see that?

327
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,948
It was just a question, okay?

328
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:51,188
I want to hear from the victim.

329
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:52,889
Why are you picking on me?

330
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:56,009
Please don't say that. I'm not picking on you.

331
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,169
Yes, you are!

332
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:00,789
You criticize me whatever I do or say.

333
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:02,768
I bet you really despise me.

334
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:05,908
You're right about that. I do despise you,

335
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:08,208
but I'm not picking on you.

336
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:12,189
Nan Xiaoqin, this is too much.

337
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:15,489
Clean up the dorm room this week.

338
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:19,629
 Why? I stopped streaming.

339
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:28,252
 Let's meet.

340
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:34,680
 Okay.

341
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,000

342
00:28:47,044 --> 00:28:49,056

343
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,680
Here.

344
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:58,564
Let's go for a walk.

345
00:28:58,564 --> 00:29:00,052
Okay.

346
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:07,200

347
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,629
So Dr. Jia disappeared.

348
00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:27,808
The security guard said he moved out this morning.

349
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,089
The hospital staff said he resigned.

350
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:32,568
He's vanished into thin air.

351
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,309
That's really strange.

352
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:36,609
He disappeared just as we were looking at him.

353
00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:38,369
That says a great deal.

354
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:43,729
I bet he's done something to our checkup reports.

355
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:47,768
Maybe we do have chips implanted in us.

356
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:51,688
Otherwise we couldn't enter the game easily.

357
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:06,809
Also, I meant to ask you.

358
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:10,729
Do you find any of the players suspicious?

359
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:14,589
Qing You and Bawan are innocent.

360
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:18,549
Brother Qiang looks fierce,

361
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:22,009
but he is stupid.

362
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:27,628
I don't think he pretended when Hei Er and A'Yong died either.

363
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,849
Uncle Lin may seem timid sometimes,

364
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:34,789
but he's quite sincere.

365
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,948
He's excluded.

366
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,272
And Dou Dou.

367
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:41,509
Although she didn't reveal who she is,

368
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:44,908
she never hurt us.

369
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:50,568
You analyzed everyone but me.

370
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:54,188
Do you still suspect me?

371
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:05,600
Thank you.

372
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:14,309
I know you made the video to reveal the truth.

373
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:21,168
That video.

374
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:24,829
It's no big deal.

375
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:44,289
Excuse me, the dorm will be locked. Go on a date tomorrow.

376
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:47,128
No, we are not...

377
00:31:47,128 --> 00:31:49,688
Let's go. Sorry about that.

378
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,792
We are sorry.

379
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:56,869
It doesn't matter if you're on a date.

380
00:31:56,869 --> 00:31:59,648
Time never waits.

381
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:15,369
Well… I'm going up.

382
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:17,820
See you later.

383
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:27,908
By the way, it's your turn to answer the same question.

384
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,268
Didn't you ever suspect me?

385
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:36,009
If you were up to something,

386
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:39,708
I would have died a million times in the game.

387
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:47,148
See you later.

388
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:48,709
Okay.

389
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,116

390
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:11,849
 I've never doubted you since that moment.

391
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:14,149
 It will smile for you.

392
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:42,828
Thirty lamb skewers. A dozen beers.

393
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:43,949
- Alright. 
 - Hurry.

394
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:45,492
Okay.

395
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,028
Come on.

396
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,169
Drink up.

397
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,028
- Drink up. 
 - It's on me.

398
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:56,668
Bottoms up.

399
00:33:57,508 --> 00:33:59,329
 Let me.

400
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,288
 Wait…

401
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:05,068
 Drink up.

402
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:11,068
 I can't drink anymore .

403
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,608
Are you sipping it?

404
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:47,008
Drink as much as I do.

405
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:48,229
Let's play.

406
00:34:48,229 --> 00:34:50,908
I'm not good at your game.

407
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:53,028
Do you know this one?

408
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:55,569
Come on.

409
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:57,328
Come on.

410
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,769
Here we go.

411
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,508
Open up.

412
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:03,324
Black hole.

413
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:04,916
Drink up.

414
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,388
Here we go.

415
00:35:08,388 --> 00:35:10,204
Drink up.

416
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,840

417
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,410

418
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:58,049
 Let me see Dou Dou again!

419
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:02,189
 Players who die in the game will fall into a coma in real life.

420
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:03,369
 Don't be surprised.

421
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,589
 With the current brain-computer interface technology,

422
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:10,248
 once you're implanted with a chip, anything is possible.

423
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:17,129
Chun Yu, I'm sorry.

424
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,780

425
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:37,349
The game has been triggered.

426
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:41,788
Please select a player to enter the coffin.

427
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:49,148
Whoever enters the coffin will be the priest and perform the ritual of worship.

428
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,640

429
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:22,560
