1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,050

2
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:56,696

3
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:59,810

4
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:16,415
 Chun Yu, Chun Yu, listen to me.

5
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:19,395
 I believe in you. You can make this happen.

6
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:27,544
 Chun Yu.

7
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,576
 Let's try one more time.

8
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:41,836
President Yan, it's time to start the game.

9
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:43,348
Not yet.

10
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:46,395
The next level needs to be modified.

11
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:49,096
Then, we can get straight to the theme.

12
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:52,335
Let's take a break tonight.

13
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:54,004
Okay.

14
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,856
 Why?

15
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,176
 It could be dangerous.

16
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:30,716
 Actually, I was once a member of Microtech.

17
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:35,416
 I didn't like what they're doing, so I resigned.

18
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:44,276
 If Tianji finds out I'm helping you, I'll be in great danger.

19
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:48,976
 Got it. I will keep it a secret.

20
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:54,676
 Microtech's most important equipment should be in Equipment Section Two.

21
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:56,476
 Got it.

22
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,736
 Do you know Chun Yiming?

23
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,715
 Is he related to all these?

24
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,490

25
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,320

26
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,670
That's great.

27
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:19,856
 Last night, we did not play again.

28
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:25,848
 Yes.

29
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:37,976
Why weren't we in the game last night?

30
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:42,355
Xu Wenya! Xu Wenya!

31
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:51,055
Wake up! Hurry up!

32
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:53,116
What's the matter?

33
00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:00,896
- What? 
 - We didn't get to play again.

34
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,988
That's right.

35
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,616
Why weren't we in the game?

36
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,335
Wait. I even put on my jeans.

37
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,675
Why weren't we in the game again?

38
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,764
 Why?

39
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:23,295
 Maybe it's due to the system problem like last time.

40
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:24,776
 I don't think so.

41
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:26,656
 They've updated our data.

42
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:27,996
 Then why?

43
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:30,556
 Did they give us a day off?

44
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:34,304
 In your dreams.

45
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:40,896
 They've been following us since yesterday. It can't be that simple.

46
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:45,915
 Do they have something planned?

47
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,856
 No matter what happens,

48
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:51,296
 we'll stick to yesterday's agreement to keep everything as usual and be careful.

49
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:53,716
 - Okay. 
 - All right.

50
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,616
 Didn't we say to investigate in depth?

51
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:00,356
 Our two masters, did you find anything?

52
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:10,555
Chun Yu, did you find anything?

53
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:15,288
Nothing much.

54
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:21,295
 Chun Yu said she didn't find anything yet.

55
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:25,408
 Me neither.

56
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:36,696
Senior Brother!

57
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:41,856
What movie did Professor Zhao mention when he explained the Turing Test?

58
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:42,912
Ex Machina.

59
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:44,096
All right, I'll watch it someday.

60
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,575
There is also a biopic about Turing called "The Imitation Game."

61
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,716
It's quite good. I highly recommend it.

62
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:51,048
Chun Yu.

63
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:52,172
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,896
Chun Yu, is your class over?

65
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:58,196
The library has a new coffee shop. It's not bad.

66
00:07:58,196 --> 00:07:59,424
Do you want to go?

67
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:01,676
I still have more classes.

68
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:03,996
Which building? I'll walk you there.

69
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:07,836
No need. You should help your junior sister with her questions.

70
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,204
Wait, I answered—

71
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:13,975
I'm sorry. We'll talk later.

72
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:15,116
I have some things to do.

73
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:16,160
Okay, Senior Brother.

74
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:23,920
Chun Yu.

75
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:25,968
Chun Yu.

76
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:28,896
I'm sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

77
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,752
It's fine.

78
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,576
In the context of the new era,

79
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:45,476
the elderly's faith beliefs and learning needs are rising fast.

80
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:50,175
They are defined by uniqueness, variegation, and complexity.

81
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:52,815
We are facing a new situation,

82
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:55,235
with new requirements and new challenges.

83
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,656
The traditional way of educating the elderly

84
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:00,856
is no longer able to meet

85
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:05,676
the personalized and diverse learning higher quality demands.

86
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:09,376
We need more innovative models of education,

87
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:12,075
to begin a new education pattern for the elders

88
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:14,995
to stimulate the enthusiasm on learning,

89
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:17,016
and to expand new forms of education.

90
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,256
The result will be a change in their quality of life.

91
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:23,776
It will develop their autonomy and enrich their spiritual world,

92
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,676
helping the elderly adapt to modern society

93
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:28,795
with a rapidly changing technology

94
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,595
and give them the opportunity

95
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:31,796
 to engage in social activities

96
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:33,755
 that meet the demands of the times

97
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:39,155
 while considering their age and physical characteristics.

98
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,960

99
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,370

100
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:01,300
 Where are you?

101
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,995
Old Lin. We're going to the supermarket later.

102
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:09,515
Do you want to come along?

103
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:10,556
You guys go ahead.

104
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,796
I'm going to video call my wife and children.

105
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:18,476
All right, you're alone in the dorm anyway, just clean up a little.

106
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:21,195
They said there would be an inspection at noon.

107
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,170

108
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,740

109
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,896
Didn't you go to the supermarket?

110
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:23,135
I forgot my phone.

111
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,796
What are you sneaking around here looking at?

112
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:30,196
Old Lin, there is no need to hide. You should share good things.

113
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:31,276
Let go.

114
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:32,888
You…

115
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,920

116
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,956
You just said you would video call your wife

117
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:42,276
and now you're not answering it?

118
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,628
Wifey.

119
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:51,876
 You!

120
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,076
 Who's that mistress?

121
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:55,556
What are you talking about?

122
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:56,935
 Stop playing dumb with me.

123
00:11:56,935 --> 00:11:58,896
 Where did you spend the money in the bankbook?

124
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,235
What?

125
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:01,876
I don't have a bankbook on me.

126
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:03,195
 Our family's account bankbook!

127
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:04,535
 The card and the bankbook share one account!

128
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:07,896
 I have the bankbook, and you have the card!

129
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:10,035
 If I hadn't sent money to my daughter the day before yesterday,

130
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:12,455
 I wouldn't have known that ¥8,000 was missing.

131
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:15,836
I didn't spend this money on myself.

132
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,876
I just bought a computer.

133
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:21,495
Here, here is the receipt.

134
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:22,936
See? It's the receipt.

135
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:24,468
Do you see it?

136
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:25,876
 What do you need a computer for?

137
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,136
It's for our daughter.

138
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:32,375
I wanted to surprise her for her birthday.

139
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,315
I can prove it.

140
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:39,036
Old Lin keeps the computer hidden.

141
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:40,736
Did you hear that?

142
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:41,876
All right then.

143
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:44,116
We have to go to the supermarket.

144
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,120
I have to go.

145
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,856
Finally, I can watch movies.

146
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:51,116
Don't touch it. Just go.

147
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:54,355
Aren't you going to the supermarket? Hurry up.

148
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:11,916
President Yan, as per your instructions,

149
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,916
we have completed the new game level. It is ready to launch.

150
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,376
Make sure it's safe.

151
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:23,915
It's no fun to fight and kill.

152
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,200
Next, let's test the mind.

153
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,340

154
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,630

155
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,516
Hello, you are…

156
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,376
My husband has been missing for three days.

157
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:44,636
His name is Chen Jianzhang. He is the medical director of Guangming Hospital.

158
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:46,428
Here is my ID.

159
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:48,615
This is our relationship certificate.

160
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:52,435
He has been missing since he asked for leave two days ago.

161
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:54,255
He's not answering his phone.

162
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:56,116
He told me he was going back to his hometown,

163
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,096
but there is no record of his ticket purchase.

164
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:00,396
His relatives in his hometown didn't see him either.

165
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:02,368
Okay, please wait.

166
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:09,715
What department is your husband in?

167
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,735
Neurosurgery Department.

168
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,510

169
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:20,536
We've registered your information.

170
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:23,896
We will contact you as soon as we have news.

171
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:25,956
You can go back.

172
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:29,156
In the meantime, keep trying to contact your husband.

173
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:30,904
Thank you.

174
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,040
Guangming Hospital.

175
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,935
It's the Neurosurgery Department again.

176
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,535
I must notify Captain Ye immediately.

177
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:42,596
The hospital's relationship with Tianji is complicated.

178
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,740

179
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:08,190
- Good morning. 
 - Hello, Engineer Gao.

180
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,610

181
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,335
By the way, there's something else I'd like to ask you.

182
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:16,135
Can you send me a map of your facility?

183
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:20,336
There are so many offices, I'm afraid I'll get lost.

184
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,068
Okay.

185
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:27,808
It has been sent to your email. Please verify it.

186
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:28,855
Okay, thank you.

187
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:30,388
You're welcome.

188
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,655
 Got it. I will keep it a secret.

189
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:36,536
 Microtech's most important equipment should be in Equipment Section Two.

190
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:40,148
Good morning.

191
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,692
It's here.

192
00:15:57,568 --> 00:15:59,256
Gao Xuan?

193
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:03,335
Nian Sulan, what are you doing here?

194
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:06,355
Fate unites people.

195
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:10,276
By the way, what brings you to Building One?

196
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:14,275
The new engineer is supposed to work in Building Two.

197
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:15,424
Yes.

198
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:18,535
I just wanted to take a look at the lab.

199
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:21,156
I'm also very interested in the lab. Maybe I'll come with you.

200
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:23,172
It's okay, there's no need.

201
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:27,136
Well, if you are available…

202
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,608
Of course.

203
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,676
Great, thank you.

204
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,020

205
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:38,032
Manager Tang.

206
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:40,276
Miss Nian.

207
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,036
Come on in, welcome!

208
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,035
Come on in, please.

209
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,316
I didn't expect Miss Nian to visit us.

210
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:50,396
My dad said the lab was fun, so I wanted to check it out.

211
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:52,636
It's not really a lab.

212
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,595
It's just an equipment management center.

213
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:57,860
That's fine.

214
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,436
Please show my senior brother around.

215
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,575
Of course.

216
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:05,896
Which part of our equipment interests Engineer Gao most?

217
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:08,996
To be honest, Manager Tang, I'm interested in everything.

218
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,555
I might have to trouble you.

219
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:12,312
Not at all.

220
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,836
Well,

221
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:18,476
the mission of our Equipment Center, is basically divided into three major parts.

222
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:22,336
First is the daily management of office equipment;

223
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:25,355
Second is the management of R&amp;D equipment;

224
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,736
Third is the management of self-developed equipment.

225
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:29,988
Well, Engineer Gao,

226
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:35,036
what else would you like to know?

227
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:38,875
I'd like to know more about the self-developed equipment.

228
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,432
Well,

229
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:46,076
the self-developed equipment section is confidential.

230
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:48,076
I'm afraid I can't share that information with you.

231
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:50,016
Okay, I understand.

232
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:51,755
I do apologize.

233
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:53,155
This way, come over here.

234
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,896
All right.

235
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,610

236
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:04,116
All right, Manager Tang, please stay. We'll continue.

237
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,975
All right, Miss Nian, Engineer Gao, take care.

238
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,876
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

239
00:18:18,316 --> 00:18:22,076
 A beautiful day begins with a wonderful person beside me.

240
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:25,776
 So sweet.

241
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:28,376
 You're just jealous.

242
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,944
Nian Sulan.

243
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,215
I want to apologize for something.

244
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:42,012
What's wrong?

245
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:44,856
Today, I wanted to visit the equipment department,

246
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:47,056
but couldn't get in because I didn't have an appointment,

247
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:49,076
so I used you.

248
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:53,656
That means I'm valuable to you.

249
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:55,475
I didn't mean that.

250
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:58,855
I just wanted to say I'm not going to use you anymore.

251
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:01,476
I don't mind it.

252
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:05,656
I like Chun Yu. I'm sorry.

253
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,520

254
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,310

255
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:02,796
Sister.

256
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,535
Sister, why are you here?

257
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:19,996
Am I doing it right?

258
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:23,835
Don't you like music?

259
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,288
Xiao Xian, did she force you?

260
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:30,735
Did you slack off as soon as I left?

261
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:41,916
She is more talented than you.

262
00:20:48,796 --> 00:20:50,876
The tip of the foil must be precise.

263
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:52,816
Advance.

264
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,556
Good. The tip of the foil.

265
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:57,015
With rhythm. Good.

266
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,192
Retreat!

267
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,812
Good!

268
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:06,035
Focus on your rhythm! Rhythm!

269
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:12,136
 Rhythm. Faster. Be fierce.

270
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:13,795
 Be fierce. Right, good.

271
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:15,104
 Right.

272
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:19,155
 Persist.

273
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,908
 Rest for ten minutes.

274
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:33,456
 What are you playing?

275
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:34,796
 I am playing a video game. Do you want to play?

276
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:35,808
 Do you want to play?

277
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:39,696
 Look, this is us.

278
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:42,456
 We have to dodge them and hit them.

279
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:43,496
 Tap this, tap this.

280
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:45,116
 Tap this, and we can move.

281
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:47,096
 Tap any of the four keys.

282
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:48,336
 Look, is it moving?

283
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,775
 I'm telling you, this is really fun.

284
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,292
 Nan Xiaoqin!

285
00:21:58,624 --> 00:21:59,836
 You've had enough rest.

286
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:01,455
 Didn't you say ten minutes?

287
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,376
 You've had enough rest.

288
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:14,136
Advance! The tip of the foil.

289
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:15,592
Retreat.

290
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:18,464
Enough.

291
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:22,392
Pick up the foil.

292
00:22:22,392 --> 00:22:23,884
Continue.

293
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,615
We are not your substitutes.

294
00:22:26,615 --> 00:22:29,295
We are not here to make up for your regrets.

295
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:32,476
You chose this path yourself.

296
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,175
I just didn't want to let you down.

297
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:41,436
All these years I've never been myself. All I have is you.

298
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:44,156
I've already paid the price with my leg.

299
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:48,116
I won't let you crush another child with your dreams.

300
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:51,015
Xiao Xian, tell her.

301
00:22:51,015 --> 00:22:54,416
You want to pick up a guitar, not a foil.

302
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,560
Let's go.

303
00:23:03,072 --> 00:23:07,228
Sister. I don't want to let her down.

304
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:10,855
Mom's decision is the best one for me.

305
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:15,512
Besides, if there's something that would make Mom happy,

306
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,935
I would like to try it.

307
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:28,195
She chose this path herself.

308
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:54,950

309
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,660

310
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:11,556
This place has been untouched since your father's resignation.

311
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:14,635
The dust has thickened over the months.

312
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,550
Chun Yu.

313
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:22,376
Your father was one of the founders of the company,

314
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:27,176
so we've kept this office for him out of respect.

315
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,416
Has there been any news of him since he left?

316
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:36,616
He left suddenly, without an explanation,

317
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:39,655
but everything in this office remains the same.

318
00:24:39,655 --> 00:24:41,140
Take your time.

319
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,356
I hope you can find some clues about him.

320
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,048
Thank you.

321
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:32,675
 Chun Yu, keep a close eye on your Gao Xuan.

322
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:40,896
 The alumni groups are blowing up.

323
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:42,156
 Everyone is spreading the news,

324
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:43,816
 saying that the two of them are in love.

325
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:45,716
 You better keep an eye on your Gao Xuan.

326
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,520

327
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,980

328
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,730

329
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,530

330
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,830

331
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,540

332
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,560

333
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,260

334
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,184
Who is it?

335
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:07,452
The latest one.

336
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,336
I went a little overboard with your brother the other day.

337
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:14,240
Consider it a compensation.

338
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,984
Don't look down on it.

339
00:27:23,104 --> 00:27:24,724
Are you livestreaming?

340
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:26,932
What…

341
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:33,115
Senior Sister, what do you want?

342
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,695
Is anyone else in the dorm?

343
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:44,616
You want me to watch her for you, don't you?

344
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:51,316
If it's not too much trouble, please do.

345
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:56,315
I am sorry, but Chun Yu is my friend. I can't help you.

346
00:27:56,315 --> 00:27:58,776
No, no, no. This is just a small gift.

347
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:01,176
Or you could give me something in return.

348
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:03,016
No way. This game…

349
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,832
Game?

350
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:08,855
Is this the one Gao Xuan and Chun Yu play together?

351
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:11,956
Yes, I'm in this game too. But this game is...

352
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,676
All right, then it's settled.

353
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:15,156
You keep the perfume, and I'll take this.

354
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,656
I…

355
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:18,155
I have this headset too.

356
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,535
What's the big deal?

357
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,915
Well, I warned you.

358
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,176
Why are you so angry?

359
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:02,575
How is it? Is it a little better now?

360
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:05,476
Xiaoqin, why are you so late?

361
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:08,128
- I've been waiting for you for ages. 
 - What do you want?

362
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:17,516
Wrist guards, for you.

363
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:20,200
Yesterday I was wrong.

364
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,095
I apologize.

365
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:24,936
Please don't be mad at me, okay?

366
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,760
Forget it.

367
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:32,875
I just want to be alone.

368
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,955
I'm going back to the dorm. You can go.

369
00:29:34,955 --> 00:29:36,624
Xiaoqin.

370
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:33,090

371
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:39,976
 What's the big deal?

372
00:31:39,976 --> 00:31:42,235
 My own headset works better.

373
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:46,995
 So Gao Xuan and Chun Yu are playing this game.

374
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:11,172
Am I…

375
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:14,376
in the game?

376
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,076
 Chun Yu?

377
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:03,716
 You must have many questions.

378
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:08,028
 Only if you keep going, you will find the answers.

379
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:19,900
Chun Yu.

380
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:23,336
U-Uncle Lin.

381
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:27,055
 D-Did you see anyone else?

382
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:29,855
No, it is just me.

383
00:33:29,855 --> 00:33:33,355
Did you hear anything?

384
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:34,996
Nothing.

385
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:44,155
What is that smell?

386
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:49,395
It is so wet in here.

387
00:33:53,312 --> 00:33:55,255
Is anyone here?

388
00:33:57,216 --> 00:33:59,716
Senior Brother, are you there?

389
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:02,595
Senior Brother, Gao Xuan.

390
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:04,436
Who is it?

391
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:08,356
No, no, no.

392
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:10,535
It's me, Bawan.

393
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:13,115
Don't be so annoying.

394
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:15,616
No, I am not.

395
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:17,036
I just walked out.

396
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:19,215
Shut up!  I don't want to talk to you.

397
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,515
What place is this?

398
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:32,612
A nuclear base?

399
00:34:34,475 --> 00:34:40,236
Xiaoqin, is it possible this level's scenario is Unit 731 Black Sun?

400
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:54,556
I twisted my ankle. It hurts.

401
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:56,496
Xiaoqin, I can't walk anymore.

402
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:58,232
I've twisted my ankle.

403
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:10,776
How does it feel?

404
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,112
Are you all right?

405
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,508
Are you okay?

406
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:22,752
It hurts so bad.

407
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,956
It hurts so bad.

408
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,152
It's killing me.

409
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:28,695
It hurts so much. I'm stuck, I can't get out.

410
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:31,556
It really hurts.

411
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:32,615
It's killing me.

412
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:33,928
Does it still hurt?

413
00:35:33,928 --> 00:35:36,696
It hurts. Look, I'm sweating.

414
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,396
Then let's just cut it off.

415
00:35:39,396 --> 00:35:40,576
Don't!

416
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:41,896
Wait. I…

417
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:43,415
I got out. It's okay now.

418
00:35:43,415 --> 00:35:45,556
D-D-Don't get angry.

419
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:49,376
I… Xiaoqin, I was just kidding. Right?

420
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:56,456
Well, don't be angry.

421
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:58,875
Well…

422
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:00,896
All right.

423
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,520
Who is it?

424
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:13,096
Senior Sister?

425
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:14,435
Xu Wenya.

426
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:16,220
Wait.

427
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,776
You actually came in.

428
00:36:20,776 --> 00:36:26,175
I just want to see what's happening in your game.

429
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:32,356
All right then, let's go.

430
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:35,260
Lead the way.

431
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,268
Senior Sister. This game actually…

432
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,636
It's pretty average.

433
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,856
Whether it's the environment or the atmosphere,

434
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:51,576
it doesn't compare to the games my dad's company makes.

435
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,256
Where are the others?

436
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,824
You mean Senior Brother Gao and the others?

437
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:01,336
Don't worry. You'll see them in a minute.

438
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:02,636
I am not worried.

439
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:05,155
I just want to know who my teammates are.

440
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:07,892
Fine.

441
00:37:14,956 --> 00:37:16,796
What's that noise?

442
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:19,916
I-I don't know.

443
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:28,376
Isn't it just a game?

444
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,896
Why should you be afraid?

445
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:32,000
You are so timid.

446
00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:54,975
Xiao Gao, what are you looking at?

447
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,955
Nothing, Uncle Lin.

448
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:58,576
You are here.

449
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,456
We met at the front of the tunnel.

450
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:08,915
Are you having a fight?

451
00:38:11,676 --> 00:38:14,915
Take the initiative.

452
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,135
Okay.

453
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:20,055
Looks like they're out front. I'll go find them.

454
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,548
Chun Yu.

455
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:28,536
Is there any misunderstanding?

456
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:33,516
Yesterday I had to go to Microtech,

457
00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:35,636
and I accidentally ran into Nian Sulan.

458
00:38:35,636 --> 00:38:38,896
I had no idea she took that picture.

459
00:38:40,715 --> 00:38:42,776
We are all adults.

460
00:38:42,776 --> 00:38:44,495
You have your business and I have mine.

461
00:38:44,495 --> 00:38:46,935
Let's mind our own business.

462
00:38:46,944 --> 00:38:48,600
Chun Yu.

463
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:53,355
There's really nothing going on between me and Nian Sulan.

464
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:55,260
Don't overthink it.

465
00:38:55,936 --> 00:38:58,496
That's not what I care about.

466
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:05,956
Don't you have anything else to tell me?

467
00:39:05,956 --> 00:39:08,555
What is it?

468
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:14,232
Let's go.

469
00:39:19,036 --> 00:39:21,695
Bawan, was that you screaming just now?

470
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,936
No, I thought it was you.

471
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:25,456
Then…

472
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:28,975
Where's Xu Wenya? It's Xu Wenya.

473
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:30,808
Wenya.

474
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:36,132
Senior Brother?

475
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:38,055
Nian Sulan?

476
00:39:39,996 --> 00:39:42,635
Senior Brother, this is great. I finally saw you.

477
00:39:42,635 --> 00:39:44,396
Those monsters were so scary.

478
00:39:44,396 --> 00:39:46,155
I felt like I was about to die.

479
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:48,676
Monsters? What monsters?

480
00:39:48,676 --> 00:39:50,596
Why are you in the game?

481
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,295
I didn't get a clear look at the monsters.

482
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:56,196
As for the game…

483
00:39:58,615 --> 00:40:01,415
I heard it's a great game and you're all playing,

484
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:04,616
so I asked Wenya.

485
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:06,948
I have had this gaming helmet for a long time now.

486
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:10,872
Xu Wenya, how could you tell her about the game?

487
00:40:10,872 --> 00:40:14,215
Well, she insisted on asking.

488
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:17,335
I tried to warn her it was dangerous, but she just wouldn't listen.

489
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:20,735
That's okay. What's a game if it's not dangerous?

490
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:23,075
Besides, senior brother, you are a pro player.

491
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:26,036
I am going to rely on you.

492
00:40:27,996 --> 00:40:30,596
There are no pro players in this game.

493
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,244
You have to rely on yourself.

494
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:34,716
No problem. I can take care of myself.

495
00:40:36,256 --> 00:40:40,175
Also, all junior brothers and sisters,

496
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:41,936
are experienced players now.

497
00:40:41,936 --> 00:40:45,416
I am a beginner, so please take care of me.

498
00:40:52,356 --> 00:40:56,456
 All right, everyone is here.

499
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:08,680

500
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:13,875
 Everyone, today's game is actually quite simple.

501
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,816
 Game name: Guess Who's Lying.

502
00:41:16,816 --> 00:41:19,976
 Game rules: Questions and Answers.

503
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:23,296
 If you lie, you will be severely punished.

504
00:41:24,036 --> 00:41:26,075
A guessing game?

505
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:29,476
It sounds quite simple.

506
00:41:29,476 --> 00:41:31,636
The simpler, the more dangerous.

507
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:34,116
Haven't we suffered enough losses?

508
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,040
You're right.

509
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,356
We can't hide anyway. We just have to face it.

510
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:41,696
That's the only way.

511
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:43,715
 Let the game begin.

512
00:41:43,715 --> 00:41:48,576
 First player, please stand before the gate and answer the questions.

513
00:42:03,575 --> 00:42:07,615
Then… who will go first?

514
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:19,295
 Everyone has an opinion about me. I must turn the tide.

515
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:24,715
Let me try it for you.

516
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:34,536
 Player confirmed.

517
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:36,596
 Nian Sulan.

518
00:42:37,356 --> 00:42:40,375
 I noticed the person you hate most is in here.

519
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:43,636
 Please say their name.

520
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:59,715
Of course, I do not hate anyone here.

521
00:43:01,476 --> 00:43:03,192
 Verifying.

522
00:43:07,476 --> 00:43:09,176
 That is a lie.

523
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,620

524
00:43:51,620 --> 00:44:01,750

525
00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:06,079
♫  I go from running  ♫

526
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,503
♫  To flying  ♫

527
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:13,461
♫  Through setbacks and hardship  ♫

528
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:16,919
♫  So what?  ♫

529
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:20,703
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

530
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:24,304
♫  It shines on my face  ♫

531
00:44:24,304 --> 00:44:27,947
♫  Unwilling to lose hope  ♫

532
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:31,342
♫  I only want to bloom  ♫

533
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:36,467
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

534
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:40,083
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

535
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:45,578
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

536
00:44:46,835 --> 00:44:51,231
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

537
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:55,063
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

538
00:44:55,063 --> 00:45:00,147
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

539
00:45:01,295 --> 00:45:03,336
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

540
00:45:03,336 --> 00:45:07,015
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

541
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:09,843
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

542
00:45:09,843 --> 00:45:12,467
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

543
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:15,159
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

544
00:45:16,115 --> 00:45:18,023
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

545
00:45:18,023 --> 00:45:21,803
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

546
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:24,499
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

547
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:30,755
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

548
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:50,387
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫
