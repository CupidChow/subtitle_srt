1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,070

2
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:56,730

3
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,674

4
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:32,994
- Chun Yu. 
 - Don't come over.

5
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:37,276
What's wrong with you?

6
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:46,584
Gao Xuan.

7
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:49,596
I know

8
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:53,095
you wish for me to be the way I used to be.

9
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:56,755
I was very happy when I was little.

10
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:01,634
I know you have liked me since that time,

11
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:07,015
and I really want to live as you want me to.

12
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:11,508
During all this time,

13
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:16,495
I tried to make myself smile every day.

14
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:21,335
I wanted to be there for you,

15
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:27,675
but I can't smile anymore.

16
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,034
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,904
Wait.

18
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,435
Chun Yu.

19
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:53,172
President Yan.

20
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:57,054
Please let them go.

21
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:59,114
They're all so young.

22
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,175
Why should they suffer like this?

23
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:07,295
Who do you think you are to tell me this?

24
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:08,655
Nian Yongcheng.

25
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:10,335
You used to be Chun Yiming's assistant,

26
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,774
and I've given you the opportunity to come forward.

27
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:15,755
I gave you everything you have now.

28
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,435
Yet what have you done?

29
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,604
You've betrayed me.

30
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:26,224
President Yan.

31
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:31,314
I've always appreciated what you've done for me,

32
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:35,820
but this is something completely different.

33
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,895
- Moreover… 
 - Stop.

34
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:40,935
They brought this on themselves,

35
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:43,335
and so did you.

36
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:25,174
Chun Yu.

37
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,335
Chun Yu.

38
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:32,495
Chun Yu, I'm sorry.

39
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:34,515
It's all my fault, Chun Yu.

40
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,895
Why did you do it?

41
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:40,084
Chun Yu.

42
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:45,395
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

43
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,148
Chun Yu.

44
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:50,204
It's all my fault.

45
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:04,520
No.

46
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:09,354
This is not real. This is not real.

47
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,280
This is not real.

48
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:15,295
This is not real.

49
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:18,080
It's not real.

50
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:22,072
This is not real.

51
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:27,814
This is not real. This is not real.

52
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:29,752
This is not real.

53
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:54,544
Nian Yongcheng.

54
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,734
I'm sorry, President Yan.

55
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,975
I have to do this.

56
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:28,455
Chun Yu.

57
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:30,734
Chun Yu, wake up.

58
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:34,054
Chun Yu. Wake up.

59
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:46,412
It's all right now. It's all right now.

60
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,420
Come on.

61
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:15,215
Did we just enter the nightmare loop again?

62
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,876
It's all a dream.

63
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:21,294
It's good to wake up. It's good to wake up.

64
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:23,716
It's good to wake up.

65
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:38,772
Chun Yu.

66
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:43,075
I've been trying to change you back to the way you were,

67
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,174
but I realized I was wrong.

68
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:49,015
That dream made me realize

69
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:52,794
that it doesn't matter who you are now.

70
00:10:52,794 --> 00:10:55,148
I still love you

71
00:10:57,554 --> 00:11:00,134
and I'll always be there for you.

72
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:36,404
Uncle Chun.

73
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:46,500
Xiaoqin.

74
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,254
Let's never fight again.

75
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:22,915
President Nian may be facing a problem.

76
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:25,154
Why aren't they moving at all?

77
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:37,174
Yongcheng actually bought us some time.

78
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:40,215
This gate is now out of service.

79
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:42,654
The only way out is to find the secret door.

80
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:46,015
From there, I can create an escape route.

81
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,715
So where is this secret door?

82
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:49,374
It is right in here,

83
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:51,914
but I haven't found the exact location yet.

84
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:56,355
The only clue now is the character 'Yu' in 'Chun Yu'.

85
00:12:56,935 --> 00:13:00,755
If we find it, we'll find the secret door.

86
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:19,168
Dad.

87
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:21,728
Check this out.

88
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,675
There's another piece on the wall of my dungeon.

89
00:13:34,654 --> 00:13:37,535
Yan Mingliang took the secret door apart

90
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:40,934
when he built the Ultimate Space.

91
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:46,434
This means the character "Yu" has been divided into pieces.

92
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:50,075
This symbol is the same size as the one in my dungeon.

93
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:53,315
I guess there should be three more pieces.

94
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,060
Three pieces?

95
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:11,475
I saw a similar symbol under the control room console.

96
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,854
That should also be a part of "Yu."

97
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:24,935
Okay.

98
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:29,674
Next, we need three teams to guard the three known places.

99
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:33,995
Bawan, Xiaoqin, you two guard here.

100
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:36,395
I'll go to the control room with Qing You.

101
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:37,615
Then I'll go to the dungeon.

102
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,234
I'll go with Senior Sister.

103
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:43,454
Two more teams must search for the remaining two pieces.

104
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:44,654
All right.

105
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,095
We three brothers will be in one team.

106
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,695
We're really good at finding things.

107
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:53,135
Chun Yu, Gao Xuan, you two form one team.

108
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:54,800
Okay.

109
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:05,414
We will be in contact via walkie-talkie.

110
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:07,304
Let's spread out.

111
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:09,620
Let's go.

112
00:15:10,136 --> 00:15:11,620
Let's go.

113
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:29,275
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

114
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:31,128
Brother.

115
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:33,455
How do we search for it?

116
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:37,095
There's only one way.

117
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:50,175
Use our eyes to scan the walls,

118
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:54,434
inch by inch.

119
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:57,614
Never miss a single corner.

120
00:15:58,654 --> 00:15:59,854
Scan the walls?

121
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:01,935
Do you have a better way?

122
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:05,555
- No. 
 - Then get to work.

123
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:07,512
Oh, my!

124
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:18,334
Senior Sister, this is Chun Yu's cell.

125
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,694
Wenya, let's split up and search.

126
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:41,434
 No way.

127
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,855
 I have to explain it to Senior Sister.

128
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,275
Senior Sister.

129
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:54,475
I'm sorry, it's my fault. I let you into the game.

130
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:56,955
When you asked about the headset,

131
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:59,194
I should have told you.

132
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:01,555
If I didn't know about this headset,

133
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:04,135
I'd never come across something so exciting.

134
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:08,075
I am sorry too.

135
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:10,475
I have done something bad to you,

136
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:15,995
your brother, and Chun Yu.

137
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:18,694
But none of that matters now.

138
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:23,715
What matters is that we became friends and fought together.

139
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,874
All right, keep searching.

140
00:18:00,054 --> 00:18:02,595
Uncle Chun, is it this one?

141
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:09,175
Yes, that's the one.

142
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:12,634
 We found the symbol in the control room.

143
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,516
 We found the one in the dungeon too.

144
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:17,355
We're still searching.

145
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:18,835
We have already found clues,

146
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:21,814
and we are making steady progress here.

147
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:23,135
 Okay.

148
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,574
 Keep us informed.

149
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:28,014
Brother Qiang.

150
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:31,195
Where are the clues you mentioned?

151
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,255
Well…

152
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:34,355
Don't focus on that.

153
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:38,354
The point is we are making steady progress.

154
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:41,652
Keep searching.

155
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,975
Don't sigh. Listen to him.

156
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,894
Keep searching.

157
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:55,834
Well, what exactly does this thing look like?

158
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,695
What else does this look like?

159
00:18:57,695 --> 00:18:59,595
Like the character "Yu" in "Chun Yu."

160
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:00,975
It's not like you haven't been to school.

161
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,675
Don't you know the character "Yu"?

162
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,914
But they said it's a piece of the character "Yu."

163
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:07,794
I don't know what it looks like.

164
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:10,615
I am thinking, I may have seen it,

165
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:14,895
but missed it, thinking it's some weird symbol.

166
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,268
Hei'er.

167
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:30,076
Write the character "Yu."

168
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,980

169
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,090

170
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,880

171
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,975
Follow me.

172
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:57,800
Let's go.

173
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:10,214
Everybody's got something to do right now.

174
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:12,574
We are the only ones doing nothing.

175
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:14,815
Don't say that.

176
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:18,654
It proves the two of us are very capable.

177
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:21,595
If two cowards remained here, they would get scared to death by the zombies.

178
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,254
You really are a talker.

179
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:29,772
Come on.

180
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,495
What's wrong?

181
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:50,315
H-He moved.

182
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:17,152

183
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,996
Hurry up.

184
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:35,275
The guards have been revived.

185
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:38,014
 The guards have been revived.

186
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,634
Uncle Chun, do something.

187
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:59,175
Bawan, Xiaoqin, both of you go to the canteen

188
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:01,734
and lure the guards over there.

189
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:18,815
Chun Yu, Gao Xuan, get ready.

190
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:29,544
Over here.

191
00:23:08,107 --> 00:23:10,762

192
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,772
I've found it.

193
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:06,674
We also found the last piece in the canteen.

194
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,715
Bawan, Xiaoqin, you two stay in the canteen.

195
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:14,955
Chun Yu, Gao Xuan, hurry back to the main gate.

196
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:17,328
Let's go.

197
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:28,794
 Now I'm will count to three,

198
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:32,175
and we will press the symbol at the same time.

199
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:49,032
Three.

200
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,964
Two.

201
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:58,676
One

202
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,791

203
00:25:25,452 --> 00:25:28,452

204
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:37,060

205
00:26:35,914 --> 00:26:38,394
Chun Yiming, this bastard!

206
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:57,154
Do you think it's over?

207
00:26:58,294 --> 00:27:00,315
Not so easily.

208
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:02,520
Old Yan.

209
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,100
Stop while there's still time.

210
00:27:11,674 --> 00:27:13,574
You are right.

211
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,555
There's still time.

212
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:55,235
Uncle Chun,

213
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:57,694
where's the escape route?

214
00:27:57,694 --> 00:28:00,334
Just wait until I enter the code.

215
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,455
Okay.

216
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:33,375
Let's go.

217
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,996
Let's go.

218
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:45,375
Dad, what are you doing?

219
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:49,634
I haven't finished my own work yet.

220
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:54,655
Uncle Chun.

221
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:56,414
You've been working on this for over a decade.

222
00:28:56,414 --> 00:28:58,855
I don't want to,

223
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:00,680
but I have no choice.

224
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:04,328
What does this mean?

225
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:08,735
It's a self-destruct program.

226
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:13,595
Then we will all leave once Uncle Chun is done with it.

227
00:29:13,595 --> 00:29:17,395
You should leave in case of an accident.

228
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:20,855
Besides, staying here won't help me.

229
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:22,815
Also, President Nian is out there to help you.

230
00:29:22,815 --> 00:29:24,795
There will be no problem.

231
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:27,215
Fine, you should leave first.

232
00:29:27,855 --> 00:29:32,614
Okay, then the three of us are leaving first.

233
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:44,012
We'll meet outside.

234
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,935
We are leaving.

235
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:47,676
See you outside.

236
00:29:58,814 --> 00:30:02,454
The two of us are also leaving.

237
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:16,795
It's our turn, see you outside.

238
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,552

239
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:59,175
Oh no! Yan Mingliang is coming.

240
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:02,774
Don't worry, let's go.

241
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:19,560
Leave.

242
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,104
Let's leave.

243
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:37,355
I know you want to stay.

244
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,196
I'll stay with you.

245
00:31:41,294 --> 00:31:44,955
You ask others to leave, yet you want to stay.

246
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:48,075
I'm not others now.

247
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:16,874
Yan Mingliang will be here any minute.

248
00:32:17,814 --> 00:32:19,135
But don't worry,

249
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:22,394
I'm here, your dad will be fine.

250
00:32:41,054 --> 00:32:42,728
Chun Yu.

251
00:32:44,574 --> 00:32:46,408
You came out.

252
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:51,084
Old Nian.

253
00:32:54,294 --> 00:32:56,014
Where's Gao Xuan?

254
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:57,415
Isn't he awake yet?

255
00:32:57,415 --> 00:32:59,554
Yan Mingliang found that secret door.

256
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:03,135
Gao Xuan pushed me out, but he didn't come out yet.

257
00:33:03,135 --> 00:33:04,434
What about the others?

258
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:08,855
They all came out, except Gao Xuan and my dad.

259
00:33:25,415 --> 00:33:27,348
Old Chun,

260
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:28,875
it's a pity.

261
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,124
You are so close.

262
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:36,415
You've been working on this system for years,

263
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:38,255
I don't believe you'd destroy it.

264
00:33:38,255 --> 00:33:40,834
Just for that reason,

265
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:45,315
I don't want you to use it for your own purposes.

266
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:49,455
So you want to destroy it.

267
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:52,715
Because you already damaged it.

268
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:56,275
It was meant to be a timeless masterpiece.

269
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,375
A game that brings joy to people.

270
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,254
Νot the way it is now.

271
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:05,954
Enough with the decent speeches.

272
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:14,360
To be honest, I don't really want to destroy it.

273
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:19,495
After all, we both built it piece by piece,

274
00:34:19,495 --> 00:34:22,214
just like our very own child.

275
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:28,268
Mingliang, can you stop for a while?

276
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:32,795
Let's fix this fundamental bug,

277
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:36,675
and then you can modify it to be the 19th Floor,

278
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,895
or whatever you want.

279
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:44,275
I will help you, all right?

280
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:50,624
Old Chun,

281
00:34:54,255 --> 00:34:55,275
it's too late.

282
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:57,075
Why?

283
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:59,574
As long as you…

284
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:06,175
If Qi Qi were still here,

285
00:35:06,175 --> 00:35:11,155
she would never like to see her father like this.

286
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:17,914
But she's not here anymore. It's the only thing I can do for her.

287
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:21,294
Mingliang, listen to me.

288
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:23,854
- Just stop. 
 - Enough.

289
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:25,520
Impossible.

290
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:28,534

291
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:30,874
 Self-destruct program initiated.

292
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:34,555
 Five minutes count down.

293
00:35:38,474 --> 00:35:43,095
So you were talking to me just to buy time?

294
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:49,054
This house has more than one terminal.

295
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:56,095
What really destroys the game

296
00:35:56,095 --> 00:36:00,095
is the program Yongcheng installed in the system.

297
00:36:00,735 --> 00:36:03,075
Once this string of code is decrypted,

298
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:06,014
the game will end.

299
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:18,034
Uncle Chun, leave.

300
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:27,924
Gao Xuan.

301
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,035
Why did you have to destroy my plan?

302
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:25,575
Why?

303
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:28,894
Why did you stop me from avenging my daughter?

304
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:30,408
Why?

305
00:37:31,654 --> 00:37:33,195
Why?

306
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:52,155
You can't escape anymore.

307
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:08,856
President Yan.

308
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:13,274
Actually, I know everything you did

309
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:15,834
was not to avenge your daughter,

310
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:19,355
but because you hate yourself.

311
00:38:21,614 --> 00:38:26,075
You hate that you missed her live stream that day

312
00:38:26,075 --> 00:38:28,195
and couldn't save her.

313
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:33,775
You are afraid and unwilling to face the truth.

314
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:39,832
You wouldn't understand

315
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:46,356
the pain of losing a daughter as a father.

316
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:48,748
I know.

317
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:54,114
I can also understand the pain of losing a loved one.

318
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:58,215
For example, my father.

319
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:01,495
My mom abandoned him,

320
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:03,614
so he took out his anger on me

321
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:06,234
and on the whole world.

322
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:11,214
When he died of alcohol poisoning in front of my eyes,

323
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:16,692
Only then did I realize, he blamed himself for his failure

324
00:39:16,692 --> 00:39:19,054
and chose to escape.

325
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,814
However, if he didn't face it head on,

326
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:27,834
he would never escape that pain.

327
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:32,035
It would make him and those around him

328
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,494
to constantly get hurt.

329
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:49,332
President Yan.

330
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:52,914
There is a dark side to this world,

331
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:59,214
but the purpose of our life is to find the light, is it not?

332
00:40:01,494 --> 00:40:03,795
We all have encountered misfortune,

333
00:40:04,494 --> 00:40:06,694
but Chun Yu has become warm,

334
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:08,914
Brother Qiang is no longer selfish,

335
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:11,195
and Qing You learned how to be brave.

336
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:15,515
We are all trying to start a new life.

337
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,895
President Yan.

338
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:20,494
If your daughter were still alive,

339
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:25,035
she would wish for her father to move on.

340
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:27,795
 Dad, I regret it.

341
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:30,235
 If I hadn't come to this haunted house,

342
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:32,094
 I wouldn't have been injured.

343
00:40:32,094 --> 00:40:36,314
 I still prefer a bright, warm world.

344
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:49,935
Uncle Yan, it's not too late.

345
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:52,012
Let's leave together.

346
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:58,595
- Let's go. 
 - All right, come on.

347
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,908
Gao Xuan.

348
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,580
♫  He tossed and turned so many times that he couldn't tell the difference between right and wrong  ♫

349
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:22,410
♫  Like a shooting star falling from darkness into gray  ♫

350
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:27,970
♫  An unclear role inverting right and wrong  ♫

351
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:33,200
♫  The most panicked one passes through the darkness and falls into gray  ♫

352
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,660
♫  A new world has begun  ♫

353
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,650
♫  All choices are yours  ♫

354
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:49,970
♫  The new time has been restarted  ♫

355
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:56,550
♫  What kind of yourself do you want to be?  ♫

356
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:01,495
Gao Xuan!

357
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,780

358
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:09,810

359
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,306
♫  I go from running  ♫

360
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:17,730
♫  To flying  ♫

361
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,688
♫  Through setbacks and hardship  ♫

362
00:43:21,688 --> 00:43:25,146
♫  So what?  ♫

363
00:43:25,146 --> 00:43:28,830
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

364
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,531
♫  It shines on my face  ♫

365
00:43:32,531 --> 00:43:36,174
♫  Unwilling to lose hope  ♫

366
00:43:36,174 --> 00:43:39,669
♫  I only want to bloom  ♫

367
00:43:40,502 --> 00:43:44,894
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

368
00:43:44,894 --> 00:43:48,310
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

369
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:54,005
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

370
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:59,358
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

371
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,290
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

372
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:08,474
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

373
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,563
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

374
00:44:11,563 --> 00:44:15,242
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

375
00:44:15,242 --> 00:44:18,070
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

376
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:20,694
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

377
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:23,386
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

378
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:26,250
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

379
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:30,030
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

380
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,726
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

381
00:44:32,726 --> 00:44:39,082
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

382
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:58,714
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

383
00:44:58,714 --> 00:45:02,338
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

384

♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫
