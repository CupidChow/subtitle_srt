1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,060

2
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:56,696

3
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:59,740

4
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,572
What are you thinking about?

5
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,488
I'm thinking of Dou Dou.

6
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:38,251
Are you being too serious about this game?

7
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,388
Be careful not to get scammed.

8
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,950
 It's too dangerous to enter the game,

9
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,411
 but if we don't enter, what about Dou Dou?

10
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,020
Yang Bawan!

11
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,444
What's the matter with you?

12
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,651
When I look at your face, it's like a mask of pain.

13
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:00,391
Why aren't you eating?  Is thinking of Dou Dou enough to fill you?

14
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,710
What are you talking about?

15
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,451
You said that you are thinking about Dou Dou.

16
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:11,976
Let's eat. Eat,

17
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,952
Thank you.

18
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,590
 Xiao Ya, I have taken a new job.

19
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,070
 I'm earning much more than before.

20
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,530

21
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,920

22
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,231
Don't get me wrong.

23
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,591
I'm not gloating over someone's misfortune.

24
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,096
You're back.

25
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,650
Is Qing You okay?

26
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,651
She has a chip in her brain.

27
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:41,190
You, me, everyone who plays this game has one.

28
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,231
That's why we can play the game without any special devices.

29
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,704
A chip?

30
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:50,431
So you mean Tianji is behind this?

31
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,690
There can't be anyone else but them.

32
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:56,451
Then Qing You will remain unconscious.

33
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,096
Actually…

34
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:04,311
Actually, if we keep playing the game,

35
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:08,071
completing the levels might wake her up.

36
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:16,656
Fine.

37
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,592
Are you sure?

38
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:24,871
I just like playing games.

39
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:27,971
And in the game world, compared to reality,

40
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,530
my movements are much more agile.

41
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,211
I thank you on behalf of Qing You.

42
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:36,031
Don't make me sound too noble.

43
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,390
If I get tired of it, I'll be the first one to remove the chip.

44
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:44,171
We'll meet in the cafeteria this afternoon.

45
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,371
Let's meet in the game instead.

46
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:50,131
You have to keep my identity as Dou Dou a secret.

47
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,164
I'm exhausted.

48
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:00,290
You're both here. Then help me.

49
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:08,190
Forget it, it's better to rely on myself.

50
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:21,351
 What about Yang Bawan?

51
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,731
 Will he continue the game?

52
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,571
Something on your mind, Sakuragi Bawan? 
  (Manga Slam Dunk Character)

53
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,244
Give me the ball.

54
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:52,690
How about this?

55
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,931
If I win a point against you, you answer one of my questions.

56
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,211
What? Are you looking down on me?

57
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:03,151
Are you asking for trouble?

58
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:05,450
If you win, you can ask me to leave.

59
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,990
Fine. What are we competing for?

60
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,491
Free-throw line, one shot each.

61
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,970
Missing the shot counts as a loss.

62
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,370
Come on. Come on.

63
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,184
Come.

64
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,640
You…

65
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,750
You... You take it easy.

66
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,908
Shoot.

67
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,872
The loser honors the bet.

68
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:53,790
I know what you want to ask.

69
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,810
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

70
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:59,804
Are you not honoring the lost?

71
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,290
This is all because of Dou Dou.

72
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,711
That game is too dangerous.

73
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:14,530
If I go, I will be in danger.

74
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,711
If I don't go…

75
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,211
Anyway, you know, I don't want to lose contact with her.

76
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,391
That's because you're scared.

77
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:22,750
What, what am I scared of?

78
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,970
I'm afraid she's in danger, all right?

79
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,571
That game is really too scary.

80
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,311
So many people ran into trouble after trouble.

81
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:31,730
I'm very worried about her. I have to tell her, but…

82
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,271
I am really afraid of entering the game.

83
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,270
However, if anything should happen to her,

84
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,850
I would regret it for the rest of my life, okay?

85
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:43,851
Since it's so dangerous now, maybe she won't go either.

86
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,970
She will go.

87
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,911
Because she's braver than all of us.

88
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:52,591
She is the most beautiful, coolest, and kindest girl

89
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,531
I've seen in my life.

90
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,890
Enough! Enough! You internet addict!

91
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,110
Of course, it's not entirely because of her.

92
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,170
I knew it. How could you be so kindhearted?

93
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,060
It's not that.

94
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,670
It's that other friends are in trouble too.

95
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,291
I must find Dou Dou and tell her.

96
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,951
I can't let her face these dangers without knowing anything.

97
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:26,590
How can you, a man, be so picky?

98
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,351
Go find her and protect her.

99
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:31,451
Why not solve the problem with her?

100
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:36,636
What did you just say?

101
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:41,912
Yes, that's right.

102
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:44,250
I can protect her in the game.

103
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,771
You are brilliant, Xiaoqin.

104
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,410
I've had a sudden realization. Now it's clear to me.

105
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,611
Now, I've decided to join the game with her.

106
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,090
Brilliant.

107
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,090
Nan Xiaoqin I did not expect this.

108
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,610
I never thought you could say something smart.

109
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:03,191
You're asking for it, Yang Bawan.

110
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:04,531
No, I'm not.

111
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,530
- I'm just joking with you. 
 - You're asking for a beating.

112
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,344
You are.

113
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:14,968
Slow down.

114
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,231
 Uncle Lin, get the matches from my pocket.

115
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,092
 Hurry up.

116
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:33,340
 Now,

117
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,490
 I could finally protect you.

118
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:40,471
Sir, is there any food left?

119
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:44,316
Qing You.

120
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:45,311
I'm sorry.

121
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:48,750
I was reading at the library and lost track of time, so I'm late.

122
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,890
I… I haven't touched it. You can have mine.

123
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,371
It's fine, thank you, Sir.

124
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,870
 Uncle Lin, is your leg fine now?

125
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,470
 Uncle, do you understand me?

126
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,464
It seems they probably won't come anymore.

127
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,524
Let's wait a little longer.

128
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:09,910
- Uncle Lin. 
 - Uncle Lin.

129
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,030
Gao Xuan, Chun Yu, let us sit down and talk.

130
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,191
My presence here represents my stance.

131
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,888
I will continue,

132
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,870
but what about Bawan and A'Qiang?

133
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,480
Come out.

134
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:54,744
Let's go.

135
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,712
Come up.

136
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,092
Don't move!

137
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,336
Don't move!

138
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:16,732
I'm sorry, Bawan.

139
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,136
Don't blame me.

140
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,640
If you want to blame someone, blame your dad.

141
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:28,651
I haven't settled the old scores with him yet.

142
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,090
This is a new grudge.

143
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,640
There is no need to look around.

144
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,731
This is my friend's old factory.

145
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:47,991
It has been closed for over half a year.

146
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:49,784
Everyone has left.

147
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:52,731
You are in a difficult situation. There is no way out.

148
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:24,256
There's no need to be nervous.

149
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:27,651
I kidnapped you to make your father pay back.

150
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:30,970
As long as your father pays back the money, I won't hurt you.

151
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,380
I have no other choice.

152
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,910
My buddies have already got into trouble in game.

153
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,511
If I get in trouble, too, and I can't wake up,

154
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:05,831
I, at least, owe my buddies' family an explanation.

155
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,871
The point is, your father owes my company money.

156
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,631
He should pay it back, shouldn't he?

157
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:21,720
Is this your dad?

158
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:39,050
Speak!

159
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,431
Hello, you are Mr. Yang, right?

160
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:42,211
Your son is currently in my hands.

161
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:45,730
If you don't pay, I will kill your son tonight.

162
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:49,891
This damn kid's WeChat account has been hacked.

163
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:52,331
To say my son is in his hands.

164
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,611
Come on, whose turn is it?

165
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,110
I'll call your dad again. You can tell him.

166
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,048
Don't say anything stupid.

167
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,911
Kill him! Kill him! Hurry up and kill him!

168
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:22,451
Dad, Dad, Dad! It's me, I have really been kidnapped.

169
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:25,230
You should pay Mr. Qiang the money you owe him.

170
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:29,590
You brat! Did you spend all your monthly allowance? You should starve.

171
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,251
No, Dad, Dad! I've really been kidnapped. It's really me.

172
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:34,444
If you ignore me, I will be BBQed. I'll be BBQed, Dad.

173
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,651
 Then you'd better get BBQed fast.

174
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:37,331
Dad, Dad! Hello? Dad?

175
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,330
Hello? Hello?

176
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,960

177
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:46,272
- What does BBQed mean? 
 - It means to be dead.

178
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:47,291
It means to be dead.

179
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,871
No, no, don't talk nonsense. BBQed refers to barbecue.

180
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:50,891
Come on, let's carry on.

181
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:52,231
All you think about is food.

182
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:53,851
What barbecue?

183
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,911
Your dad teased you, didn't he?

184
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,230
Now, you understand.

185
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,351
Making him pay back is basically impossible.

186
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:22,610
Your dad is a scoundrel, a gangster!

187
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,630
If he has no money, it's okay not to pay. But he has the money, and yet he doesn't pay.

188
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,591
Your father only cries when death stares him in the face.

189
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:39,790
I have to teach him a harsh lesson.

190
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,456
Brother Qiang.

191
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,611
Brother Qiang, let's talk this over.

192
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:47,050
Brother Qiang, can I call my dad again?

193
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,411
Brother Qiang, Brother Qiang, don't, don't!

194
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:50,791
You, you, calm down.

195
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,711
Can I call my dad again, please?

196
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:53,931
Brother Qiang, don't.

197
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:57,411
He is calling me back! He is calling back!

198
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:05,191
What a lousy phone? How do I unlock it?

199
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,851
Mr. Yang, are you scared now?

200
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:11,391
If so, I warn you. Transfer the money to my card today,

201
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,690
otherwise, I'll kill your son, Yang Bawan.

202
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,651
What did you say?

203
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,252
 That's not right.

204
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:18,371
 No payment, no hostage.

205
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:20,130
 I warn you,

206
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,090
 this is your last chance before I take action.

207
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,391
 Do you hear me?

208
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,790
Okay, I agree with your terms,

209
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,091
but you have to promise me…

210
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:29,684
Hello?

211
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:34,730
They are together, but Brother Qiang has kidnapped Bawan.

212
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,990
Why would he come after you?

213
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,911
There must be some misunderstanding.

214
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,411
Brother Qiang mistook me for Bawan's father and wants me to pay the debt.

215
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:43,451
He told me "no payment, no hostage."

216
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:45,810
Time? Location?

217
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,212
Right.

218
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:51,360

219
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:59,770
Brother Qiang set up a meeting at such a place in broad daylight.

220
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:04,460
Chun Yu, it would be inconvenient for you to enter.

221
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,030
Uncle Lin, let's go in together.

222
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:09,840
All right.

223
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,311
Keep this card with you.

224
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,291
It has the money Brother Qiang wants.

225
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,191
First, we will go in and talk to him.

226
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:19,131
If the talks fail, call the police immediately.

227
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:20,692
Isn't Brother Qiang…

228
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:22,971
We are already at this point. I don't care anymore.

229
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,831
Let's discuss this in the game.

230
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,870
We are going inside to find someone.

231
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,430
Sir, please take your tag.

232
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,540

233
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:09,810
This bathhouse is quite large.

234
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:20,490
Uncle Lin, let us each take a side.

235
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:24,450
 Ouch, ouch, ouch! Gently, gently, gently!

236
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,831
 Gently, gently, gently!

237
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:27,136
Is it Bawan?

238
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:28,411
Let's go and take a look.

239
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:29,568
Let's go.

240
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:30,791
Be careful.

241
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,476
Please be careful, too.

242
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,470
Uncle Lin, over there.

243
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:46,791
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!

244
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,500
 It hurts.

245
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:52,211
 Can't you be more like me?

246
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,350
 Can't you keep your mouth shut?

247
00:21:55,251 --> 00:21:56,891
Brother, it's not his fault.

248
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,951
It's because your skin is too thick.

249
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,051
Then use some strength.

250
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:01,452
Okay.

251
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,772
Bawan?

252
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,088
Old Gao?

253
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:09,644
Uncle Lin.

254
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:12,390
Well, you, you guys...

255
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,284
Brother Qiang.

256
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:25,088
Have a massage.

257
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,170
Why did you suddenly move the patients in your care to ICU?

258
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,810
What is your purpose?

259
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,651
Director, actually, I was coerced.

260
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:47,210
I came to the hospital for graduate studies because of Tianji company

261
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,644
Chun Yu.

262
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,988
Chun Yu.

263
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:19,091
Brother Qiang, first of all, take this.

264
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:22,071
This is the medical fee we raised for A'Yong.

265
00:23:22,071 --> 00:23:23,251
We are all friends.

266
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:24,791
If you have any problems, we will definitely help you.

267
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,324
First, try to calm down.

268
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:28,020
I will not accept this money.

269
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,271
Besides, you have no right to lecture me.

270
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:32,230
Don't force yourself.

271
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,730
We all know the difficulties you are facing.

272
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,330
Brother Qiang, please take this money.

273
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,772
I will pay them back.

274
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:47,410
What are you doing? Are you mocking me?

275
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,090
Who are you to create such a mess?

276
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,970
- No, Brother Qiang, I… 
 - All right, no more talking.

277
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,171
It was wrong to involve you in your father's business with me.

278
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:09,531
It's just that he owes Hei Er and A'Yong.

279
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,791
As the group leader, I must personally get it back.

280
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,470
I never expected him to value loyalty.

281
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:21,711
Let him cool off on his own.

282
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,811
Now, we need to talk business.

283
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:24,336
Right.

284
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:31,611
I have something to do. You guys should go back.

285
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:33,591
Yang Bawan! Bawan!

286
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:36,630
Stop calling him.  He'll keep playing the game.

287
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,871
I'm afraid he might cause more trouble.

288
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,992
All right then. Let's go back to the college.

289
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:45,572
Uncle Lin, you can go back.

290
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:48,351
Chun Yu and I have other things to do.

291
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:49,951
All right, then.

292
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:52,911
I-I still have some work to do in the cafeteria.

293
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:54,648
Be careful.

294
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,888
Be careful.

295
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:02,896
Come.

296
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,312
I just saw someone we know inside.

297
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,970
I also saw this person while I was waiting outside.

298
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,471
I saw there were two of them,

299
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:25,771
but I didn't get a good look at the other person.

300
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:27,784
So there were two of them?

301
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:30,510
Then he must be meeting someone.

302
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,650
Tianji wouldn't be planning something in the hospital again, would they?

303
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,550

304
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,430
Damn, he might have noticed us.

305
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,850
Don't let them get away. Split up and chase after them.

306
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,810

307
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,691
Tianji Science and Technology Invitation?

308
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,390
Seems pretty high-end.

309
00:26:31,104 --> 00:26:32,760
One dick. 
  (Term in Mahjong Game)

310
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,448
South Wind.

311
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:39,272
Nine dots.

312
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:40,790
Come on, hurry.

313
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,540
Three bamboos.

314
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,772
Three bamboos.

315
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:46,260
Dad.

316
00:26:48,891 --> 00:26:50,716
Why are you back?

317
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,991
I…

318
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:54,911
Mumbling? What the hell are you mumbling about?

319
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:56,600
North Wind.

320
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,750
Now, I remember.

321
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,930
Weren't you kidnapped?

322
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,190
You can't trick me, and you're asking for money in person?

323
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,451
You should go back, I'm busy.

324
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:11,051
- Come on, it's my turn, right? 
 - Yes.

325
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,190
Why are you standing here, protesting?

326
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:20,304
Dad.

327
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:23,204
You… You should replay your debt to Brother Qiang.

328
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:24,952
Four dots.

329
00:27:24,952 --> 00:27:26,812
What did you say?

330
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,471
I said you should repay the money.

331
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:32,391
That's adults' business. Kids shouldn't meddle.

332
00:27:32,391 --> 00:27:33,931
No, Dad.

333
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,710
How can you make sense even when you owe someone money?

334
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,791
You little brat.

335
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,752
Calm down, calm down.

336
00:27:42,752 --> 00:27:43,810
Why fuss over your child?

337
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,560
All right, all right.

338
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,811
I'm doing business here. You should go back.

339
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:50,610
We'll talk about the money later.

340
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,100
Come on, who's next?

341
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,088
- Your turn. 
 - It's your turn.

342
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,710
It is my turn. Things are all messed up. Come on.

343
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,090
Pay back the money you owe right now!

344
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:05,210
Why are you so shameless?

345
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,991
Yes, all you know is how to hit people.

346
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:08,731
Are you still rational?

347
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:11,370
You clearly have money. Why don't you pay it back?

348
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:14,291
You disrespect elders, always choosing sides against your own.

349
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,610
Mr. Yang, look at you.

350
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,911
You're a disgraceful brat!

351
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:19,471
You're just being unreasonable. I'd rather not be your son

352
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:21,170
Enough! Aren't you going to apologize to your father?

353
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,560
Why should I apologize?

354
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,651
He's clearly the one who's wrong.

355
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:24,831
He is such a dishonest person,

356
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:26,671
and yet you all come every day to support his business.

357
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:27,931
He'll eventually cheat you all.

358
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:30,031
You little brat! I don't have a son like you.

359
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:31,864
Less talk, please.

360
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,880
 Old Yang! Old Yang!

361
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,151
If you don't pay today, I won't recognize you as my father.

362
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:40,471
You're always like this.

363
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:42,851
Since the demolition, you've completely changed.

364
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:45,031
Ever since I was young, aside from leaving me some money,

365
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:46,411
what else have you ever done for me?

366
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:47,671
Have you ever truly cared about me?

367
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:49,491
Do you even know what I truly want?

368
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:51,251
What I like and don't like.

369
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:52,416
I'm asking you.

370
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,651
Do you know the name of the university I'm attending?

371
00:28:57,631 --> 00:29:00,371
What else do you care about besides money and mahjong?

372
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,091
You even name me Bawan. 
  (It means 8 Characters for Mahjong)

373
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:04,470
I don't care! Today you have to pay back the money!

374
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,772
You!

375
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,030
Are you stupid? Why didn't you dodge?

376
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,671
Never mind that. I won't leave until this is resolved today.

377
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:14,991
You suggested this idea to my son, didn't you?

378
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:17,071
You suggested this idea to my son, didn't you?

379
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:18,951
What? You enjoy hitting people, don't you?

380
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:23,091
Come on, I'll fight you. Come on! Come on!

381
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:24,311
I'm the one who wants to help him.

382
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:25,970
I just can't stand your bullying behavior.

383
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,810
Who's the bully? Who's the bully? Get out!

384
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,884
Give the money back to them now, right now!

385
00:29:30,884 --> 00:29:31,831
Get out!

386
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:34,371
You don't want to pay? No problem.

387
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:36,410
- Go, go, go. 
 - I'll call the police.

388
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,328
Stop. Stop.

389
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,231
Hit me, hit me, kill me!

390
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:44,670
If you kill me, no one will ask you for money.

391
00:29:48,731 --> 00:29:49,920
Get out!

392
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,780
Old Yang, calm down.

393
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,831
- Calm down. 
 - Enough, enough.

394
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:57,771
Separate them. Separate them!

395
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:59,231
- You better leave quickly. 
 - Separate them, separate them.

396
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,691
Hurry up and leave. Leave quickly.

397
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:03,090
Hurry up, hurry up and go away, hurry up.

398
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,560
Calm down.

399
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,396
Brother Qiang,

400
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:26,292
I'm sorry.

401
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,950
You don't have to apologize to me.

402
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,011
As for your father's business, I involved you in that.

403
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:43,604
It was my fault to begin with.

404
00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:44,831
I should be the one apologizing to you.

405
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:47,110
Here you go. The skewers are ready.

406
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,590

407
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,536
All right, let's eat.

408
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,570
I'm even more worried than you, and I didn't even think of that.

409
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,044
Right?

410
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,380

411
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,730
Hello, Director Chen.

412
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,331
The matter with Old Yang…

413
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:29,970
 Qiangzhi, you are quite capable.

414
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,230
 I thought Old Yang's money was gone for good.

415
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,712
What do you mean?

416
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:38,328
What does that mean?

417
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:39,631
 The money has been transferred.

418
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,011
 Good, good, well done.

419
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:45,091
 Your three commissions have been deposited into your accounts.

420
00:31:45,091 --> 00:31:47,610
 I'll add another ten percent to your share.

421
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,931
 Money owed feels like it just fell into our laps.

422
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:52,430
 Well done! I believe in you .

423
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,172
 I have to hang up now. .

424
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,340

425
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:20,491
Brother Qiang, Brother Qiang, let's discuss this.

426
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:27,352
What are you doing?

427
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,731
Your father paid back the money!

428
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:37,090
Your father paid back the money!

429
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:42,090
My boss gave me an extra ten percent commission.

430
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,320

431
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:48,520
My dad paid it back?

432
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:02,392
Give me your hand.

433
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,016
Yang Bawan,

434
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,270
you're a good buddy.

435
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,984
As of today, no, as of now,

436
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:11,450
you, Yang Bawan, no,

437
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,351
I, Zhang Tianqiang, am your big brother.

438
00:33:13,351 --> 00:33:15,791
Everything that concerns you, Yang Bawan,

439
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,731
will be handled by me.

440
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:21,520
- Really? 
 - Really.

441
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,731
Although we didn't get them today,

442
00:33:24,731 --> 00:33:28,571
I feel I've seen the person who met Dr. Jia before.

443
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:30,611
Why do you think that?

444
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:34,490
I don't know, I just feel his physique is very familiar.

445
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:37,451
And that mole.

446
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:39,528
What mole?

447
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:42,791
Although I didn't see his face in the bathhouse,

448
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:47,491
that person had his right hand on the wardrobe

449
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:50,851
and on the back of his hand, he had a very noticeable mole.

450
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:54,111
I keep thinking I've seen this mole somewhere before.

451
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,991
Chun Yu, Old Gao,

452
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,668
I've made up my mind.

453
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,988
I want to keep playing the game.

454
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:10,500
What about Bawan?

455
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,771
Bawan will listen to me. He is my good brother.

456
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:16,431
I'm wholeheartedly with Brother Qiang.

457
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,304
That's great.

458
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:21,790
Wait a minute. When did you two become good buddies?

459
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:28,071
It has to do with personal charm. You wouldn't understand.

460
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:30,631
All right then, I've delivered the message.

461
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:32,051
I'm leaving, I have something else to do.

462
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:35,471
We'll see each other in the game.

463
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:36,451
I'm leaving.

464
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,536
Brother.

465
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:39,060
Well,

466
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,504
the floor hasn't been mopped yet.

467
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:49,290
When the time comes, don't hold me back in the game, all right?

468
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,896
My good buddy.

469
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,931
I'm really convinced.

470
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,711
I can't win even if I have a ready hand.

471
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:08,740
I'll let you win by throwing it away.

472
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:13,431
Old Yang, how about we call it a day?

473
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:15,591
If you have something on your mind, you can't win.

474
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:18,670
Who says I can't win?  You're the jinx who can't.

475
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,111
Hurry up. It's your turn.

476
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:21,790
I won.

477
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,940
Great, great. It's late.

478
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,571
Let's finish. Finish it, finish it.

479
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:27,991
To finish what? Finish what?

480
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:30,111
No, no, no. Let's play another four rounds.

481
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:31,136
Go on, go on.

482
00:35:31,136 --> 00:35:34,211
Whoever leaves today will never come back.

483
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:36,372
- Go on, let's play another four rounds.  Come on. 
 - Okay, okay.

484
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:37,811
- Just four rounds. 
 - Come on! Four rounds, four rounds.

485
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:39,750
Come on, come on, hurry up.

486
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,950
You have nothing to do if you go back.

487
00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:47,384
Bawan is here.

488
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,616
Dad.

489
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:54,671
Dad, I brought you some kebabs.

490
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,180
You've mistaken. You've got the wrong person, haven't you?

491
00:35:59,328 --> 00:36:02,252
- Four dots. 
 - No, you…

492
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,951
Old Yang, I'm actually hungry.

493
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:14,811
How about I eat some first?

494
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:17,171
Put them down. My son bought them for me.

495
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:19,230
If you want to eat, have your son buy it for you.

496
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,916
You're so petty!

497
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:28,171
These tiles.

498
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:30,604
Enough, I'm not playing.

499
00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:32,191
I'm done. I'm not playing.

500
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,711
- Didn't we agree to play four rounds? 
  - I'm done. I'm not playing.

501
00:36:33,711 --> 00:36:36,970
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

502
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,411
He's not usually like this.

503
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:40,711
Why did he change today?

504
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:44,488
Let him be. Let him be.

505
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,760

506
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,950
Right.

507
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,211
 Liberate yourself.

508
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:03,890
 - Miss. 
 - Self-forgetfulness is the foundation of acting.

509
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:05,630
- Excavator. 
 - Okay.

510
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,891
That building is over there.

511
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,610
Xu Wenya, make bigger movements.

512
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:12,611
This is very good.

513
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:14,490
Very good, very good.

514
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,251
 Use your body and act according to your feelings.

515
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:19,491
 Exceptionally good.

516
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:21,890
 Come on, everyone, continue.

517
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,810

518
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,830

519
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,970

520
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:59,980

521
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:04,579
♫  I go from running  ♫

522
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:08,003
♫  To flying  ♫

523
00:39:08,003 --> 00:39:11,961
♫  Through setbacks and hardship  ♫

524
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:15,419
♫  So what?  ♫

525
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:19,103
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

526
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:22,704
♫  It shines on my face  ♫

527
00:39:22,704 --> 00:39:26,347
♫  Unwilling to lose hope  ♫

528
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:29,742
♫  I only want to bloom  ♫

529
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:34,867
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

530
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:38,483
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

531
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:43,678
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

532
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:49,531
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

533
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:53,463
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

534
00:39:53,463 --> 00:39:58,447
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

535
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,736
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

536
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:05,415
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

537
00:40:05,415 --> 00:40:08,243
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

538
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:10,867
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

539
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,559
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

540
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:16,523
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

541
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:20,203
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

542
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:22,899
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

543
00:40:22,899 --> 00:40:29,155
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

544
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:48,787
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫
