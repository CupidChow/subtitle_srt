1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,990

2
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:56,736

3
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,708

4
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:04,608

5
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:08,832

6
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:21,893
 If we don't go, we'll never know the truth.

7
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:33,120

8
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,190
Miss Chun Yu, Mr. Gao Xuan, hello. I have been waiting for you.

9
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:40,513
Do you know us?

10
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:42,494
I received the signed players' information early.

11
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,694
Please come with me.

12
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,948
This way.

13
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,233
This way, please.

14
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,824

15
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,314
Please take a short break here.

16
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,594
Feel free to enjoy drinks and desserts in the self-service area.

17
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:30,354
A staff member will guide you through the signing process later.

18
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:31,968
Thank you.

19
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,174
You must have noticed it too.

20
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:53,534
The promotional video game content

21
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,633
is completely different from the version we actually experienced.

22
00:03:56,633 --> 00:04:00,673
It's like an embellished version.

23
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,774
And generally, a signing event is usually designed to be grand.

24
00:04:03,774 --> 00:04:06,714
This one is very low-key.

25
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:12,414
Hello! Please take a look at our flyer.

26
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:19,353
 Why did you come in?

27
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:31,474
- Hello. 
 - It is all just junk.

28
00:04:32,714 --> 00:04:34,760
What's the matter, Chun Yu?

29
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:41,388
- It's nothing. 
 - Hello.

30
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:43,954
Please come with me.

31
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,368
Please.

32
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,954
This is about company confidentiality

33
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:05,274
so before you enter the room,

34
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:08,254
please place your phones in the small basket at the entrance.

35
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,128
Please.

36
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,788
Please take a seat.

37
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:32,194
Both of you rank quite high in our comprehensive evaluation,

38
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:34,814
and surprisingly, you're friends in private.

39
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:38,613
Being good friends in the game gives you a great advantage.

40
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:42,034
I'm sorry, but let's make this short.

41
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:44,953
You called us here to sign a contract, right?

42
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:54,934
That's right. You survived over 20 hours in the game,

43
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:58,394
which qualifies you to become our Contract Experience Officers.

44
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:02,854
As Contract Experience Officers, you can unlock even more exciting levels in the game.

45
00:06:02,854 --> 00:06:07,753
Another great thing is that players who finish the game can win a generous cash prize.

46
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:10,213
Who wants your damn prize money? I want my buddy back!

47
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:12,994
Sir, take it easy. We can talk this over.

48
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,914
We can discuss this matter.

49
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:18,293
Does it matter what you say? Get your leader here.

50
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,334
I've already informed our manager.

51
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:22,494
He said he'll be here soon.  Please stay calm.

52
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:23,616
- Back off! 
 - Manager Zhang.

53
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,794
All right.

54
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:27,474
Mr. Zhang Tianqiang, right?

55
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:29,993
I am the manager here. My name is Zhang Yunfeng.

56
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:32,914
Please let me know if you have any demands.

57
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:35,313
I just want to ask you one question.

58
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:37,233
What is this lousy game?

59
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:41,514
If someone dies in the game, they fall into a coma in reality?

60
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:42,873
Where did you hear such rumors?

61
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:44,054
It's none of your business where I heard it.

62
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:45,574
Besides, this isn't a rumor.

63
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:47,834
Listen! My demands today are very simple.

64
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,074
Firstly, bring back my buddy Hei Er,

65
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:51,934
then wake up my buddy A'Yong,

66
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:54,394
and then you should pay us compensation.

67
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:55,594
You can both rest assured.

68
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:58,074
We are a company that follows the rules very closely.

69
00:06:58,074 --> 00:07:02,188
If you approve this agreement, please sign it.

70
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,433
- Next— 
 - I want to ask a question.

71
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,008
Please go ahead.

72
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:12,814
What happens to people who die in the game?

73
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,774
Nothing.

74
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:20,634
They just log off and lose their player status.

75
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,774
Just like the players a moment ago.

76
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,193
They just found the game very exciting

77
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:28,313
and wanted to strive for another chance.

78
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:30,294
Then why do some people die in the game

79
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:32,754
and remain comatose in reality?

80
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:35,213
We have never had such a situation.

81
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:37,793
Could it be caused by other reasons?

82
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:41,494
If the game induced comas, we would have stopped it long ago.

83
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,074
We would not proceed with the tests.

84
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:46,673
Then where exactly is Hei Er?

85
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:50,574
If you can't handle this today...

86
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:53,468
A call.

87
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,190

88
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:00,504
Hello?

89
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,568
 Brother Qiang.

90
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:08,793
Hei Er? W-W-Where did you go?

91
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,228
You don't care if you left your phone in the hospital?

92
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,154
 I bought a new phone.

93
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:14,314
 That piece of junk was useless, so I threw it away.

94
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:17,568
I knew it. So where are you now?

95
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:18,734
 I'm in Linshui.

96
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,474
What are you doing there?

97
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,474
 I got into some trouble recently and came to hide for a few days.

98
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:24,914
 I wanted to tell you, but when I left that day,

99
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:27,404
 you were both sleeping so soundly I couldn't wake you up.

100
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:28,634
What the heck is so urgent?

101
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,154
You got discharged without even telling me!

102
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:31,534
 I can't tell anyone.

103
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:33,974
 Also, keep it a secret from my brother for now.

104
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:36,133
 I'll be hiding for a few more days. I'll tell you more when I return.

105
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,213
Your brother is sick now.

106
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:38,914
- He— 
   - I have to hang up. Bye.

107
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:41,673
Hello?

108
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:44,934
This brat, always in a rush.

109
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:46,853
Mr. Zhang Tianqiang.

110
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:51,093
Put the knife down first. Let's have a good talk, shall we?

111
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:53,454
That won't solve the problem.

112
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:04,954
He's the same. He lost his player qualifications.

113
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:08,074
As for his whereabouts, you'll have to ask your friend Zhang Tianqiang.

114
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:11,633
That's Brother Qiang. I think he knows better.

115
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:19,174
The person who died the same time as Hei Er in the game is…

116
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:22,954
Him? He is Xiao Li, our engineer.

117
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:25,214
He played a tragic character

118
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:28,694
who was alive for three seconds at the start of the game

119
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,873
to give everyone a sense of crisis.

120
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:37,034
He is outside. Should I call him to verify what I've said?

121
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,453
No need. I've seen him already.

122
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:41,493
As for the things you heard,

123
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,434
that person has a grudge against our company.

124
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:45,494
That's why he said those things.

125
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:47,813
Actually, the matter is quite simple.

126
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:50,073
Wait a few days until A'Yong wakes up.

127
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:53,234
You'll know this has nothing to do with our game.

128
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,394
- Qiang. 
 - Old Lin, why are you here?

129
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:59,354
All right, now we can discuss the contract details.

130
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:01,374
- Okay. 
 - Please follow me.

131
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:09,874
Be smart. Don't just sign the contract.

132
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:24,994
Please wait. Due to confidentiality,

133
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:28,874
please place your cell phone in this small basket&lt; before entering.

134
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,984
Thank you for your cooperation.

135
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,193

136
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:41,834
If there are no questions, please sign here.

137
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:44,293
I am sorry, I have a question.

138
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:47,593
How exactly did we enter this game?

139
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,434
When you first tried on the helmets,

140
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:51,854
the system recorded your player identities.

141
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:54,734
When the game started, you were automatically logged in.

142
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:55,873
Automatically?

143
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,134
We did not wear helmets when we entered the game.

144
00:10:58,134 --> 00:11:00,933
This is our latest technology.

145
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,793
This is about giving players a fully immersive experience.

146
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:07,434
There's no need to wear a helmet when entering the game.

147
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,594
The latest technology? What's the principle behind it?

148
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:12,514
If we accept what you just said,

149
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:15,134
this technology should be difficult to implement now.

150
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,114
Yes, it's very difficult, but not impossible.

151
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:21,114
That's what makes our game unique.

152
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,554
Our R&amp;D team has overcome the technology barrier

153
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:26,073
and completed revolutionary work.

154
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:30,493
As beta testers, you witnessed this creation with us.

155
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:33,514
Naturally, our company's specific technology is patented

156
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:34,873
and must be kept confidential.

157
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:40,034
Players must simply enjoy the game.

158
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,753
What if we don't sign?

159
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:47,773
I'll sign. Why should I not sign?

160
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,893
Won't you reconsider?

161
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:52,274
After all, this game is quite difficult.

162
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:56,253
I don't care how difficult it is.

163
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:58,874
I just want to know when I can get this.

164
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:02,634
Don't worry. You will receive a bonus as long as you pass.

165
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:05,653
That's right. You should have said it earlier.

166
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:11,914
Just this one copy? D-Don't I get one?

167
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:14,994
Yes, it's the company's policy.

168
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:22,553
Give me some time to look it over.

169
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:25,573
Sure, feel free to do it.

170
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:41,614
Sir, could you get me some water?

171
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:43,128
Okay.

172
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,854
Of course, this is your right,

173
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:32,073
but I sincerely hope you'll reconsider.

174
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:34,734
I bet you play games all the time.

175
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:37,664
You do know the meaning of this game.

176
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:39,613
The excitement and the immersion.

177
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:43,234
Aren't they enough to entice you?

178
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:45,056
Our staff has reviewed the recordings.

179
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,373
Chun Yu, your reactions in the game,

180
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:50,813
your timing, wit and courage

181
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,414
all prove that you are most suitable for this game.

182
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:57,473
Don't you think that in 19th Floor, you could reach a higher self?

183
00:13:57,473 --> 00:14:00,334
Also, passing the game can make you earn a substantial bonus.

184
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:03,094
Thank you, but I won't sign.

185
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,760
I won't sign either.

186
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:09,614
Then your game experience ends now.

187
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:36,054
Qing You.

189
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:38,154
Chun Yu.

190
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:40,200
Why are you here?

191
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:51,034
I'm here to sign a contract.

192
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:53,884
Did you sign it?

193
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:11,934
 Miss Qing You, have you decided?

194
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:15,154
 Will you sign or not?

195
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:18,373
 That is why a strong person is willing to unite with another strong person.

196
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:23,094
 So you mean I should become stronger,

197
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:24,633
 instead of holding her back?

198
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,854
 I must become stronger.

199
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:28,974
 Only then I can be her only best friend.

200
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:32,044
Yes, I'll sign.

201
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:34,593
- Let's go. 
 - What are you doing?

202
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:36,154
Let's get the agreement back.

203
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:39,953
Don't you know this game is too dangerous? You can't sign.

204
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:44,274
Let go.

205
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:47,713
This is my choice. I decide for myself.

206
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:56,354
Is the friendship between women really that superficial?

207
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,274
Not exactly.

208
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:05,454
What's wrong?

209
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:06,856
I'll sign.

210
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:09,354
Okay, here it is.

211
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:11,034
It's a win-win situation.

212
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:13,960
You can play the game and win a prize at the same time.

213
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,152
I'm signing too.

214
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:44,494
Actually, you didn't have to sign.

215
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:48,514
Then you didn't have to sign, either.

216
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,974
I didn't do it for Qing You.

217
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:55,673
I just want to know the truth behind all of this.

218
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:01,993
Me too. It's just my curiosity.

219
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,116
 Xiao Yu.

220
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:19,640
Granny.

221
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,814
 I was wondering when you'd be back.

222
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:24,894
 I've prepared all your favorite dishes today.

223
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:27,273
 Let me show you. Take a look.

224
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:29,514
Granny, I'm sorry. I forgot.

225
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:32,214
I have to take care of a few things, so I won't be back for a while.

226
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:35,893
W-W-What's going on? Are you going to cancel on me again?

227
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:38,254
 Whose car are you in?

228
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:40,033
I'm in a taxi.

229
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,313
Granny, I really have something to do. I…

230
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:47,093
 Xiao Yu, I'm done!

231
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:48,214
- Granny. 
  - Xiao Yu.

232
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,354
Granny!

233
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:52,214
- Make a U-turn, please. 
 - Shannan Road.

234
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:53,713
How fast can we get there?

235
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:55,752
Five minutes.

236
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,028
Granny?

237
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,934
Are you surprised?

238
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,544
Hello, Granny.

239
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,354
Xiao Yu, you found a boyfriend already.

240
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:37,448
That's really something.

241
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,814
- Granny, it's good to see you're okay. 
 - Good.

242
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:42,394
If there's nothing else, we'll be leaving.

243
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:44,074
What are you talking about?

244
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:46,433
You came back just in time.

245
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:48,734
I just finished cooking and you arrived.

246
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:52,314
You two are both gluttons.

247
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,333
Be careful.

248
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,728
Come and sit down.

249
00:18:57,728 --> 00:19:00,012
- Okay. 
 - Take a seat.

250
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:05,173
I don't cook very well. I hope you'll like it.

251
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:07,014
It looks delicious.

252
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:08,594
You're pretty sweet.

253
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:10,953
Now that you're here, have a meal with your Grandma.

254
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:12,993
It won't take too long.

255
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:16,014
What are you standing there for?

256
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:19,054
Hurry up and bring the bowls and chopsticks.

257
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:21,114
G-G-Go.

258
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:23,694
Come and sit down.

259
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:25,473
- Sit. 
 - Okay.

260
00:19:25,473 --> 00:19:28,434
Young Man, what's your name?

261
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,034
Granny, my name is Gao Xuan. I am Chun Yu's senior,

262
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:32,894
and a substitute teacher for her computer class.

263
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:35,554
You can call me Xiao Gao.

264
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:40,433
Senior, Xiao Gao.

265
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:42,912
- The soup must be ready soon. I'll go check. 
 - All right.

266
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:44,914
- You stay here. 
 - Okay.

267
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,833
Xiao Yu, let me tell you.

268
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,014
I think this guy is very good.

269
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:56,694
If you like him, you have my full support.

270
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:02,954
What are you dawdling for?

271
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,033
You should go there.

272
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:07,633
Don't keep him waiting. This is embarrassing. Don't you think?

273
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:14,834
It has been several days now.

274
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,373
 If you three still can't get Old Yang's renovation money back,

275
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:19,174
 don't even think about getting paid.

276
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,244
Hey!

277
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,513
Yang, I'm telling you.

278
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:38,594
No matter what, you have to pay me back today.

279
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,552
Do you hear me?

280
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:49,353
 No way. Yang is too scary.

281
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:52,834
 Getting thrown out like that last time was embarrassing.

282
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,434
Eight of bamboos, come on.

283
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:58,213
It's bad. Come on, whose turn is it?

284
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,394
Five of bamboos.

285
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:03,214
No, I need a good plan.

286
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:05,774
- I'll win. 
 - You'll win?

287
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:08,016
I'll change it. Seven dots.

288
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,974
- Pung. 
 - Hurry up, wait.

289
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,912
A bottle of mineral water.

290
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:25,432
¥3.

291
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,272
Pung.

292
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:52,920
Two characters.

293
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:55,254
Dad.

294
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:59,254
Why aren't you in school?

295
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:01,984
Dad, it is Sunday.

296
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,254
Is it Sunday today?

297
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:04,754
- Yes, it is. 
 - Is it?

298
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,294
Sunday! Just go home and have fun.

299
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:08,794
Don't hang around here. Go back.

300
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,113
Dad, about last week's allowance, you didn't…

301
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:13,694
- Eight characters. 
 - I won.

302
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:16,754
I got your eight characters.

303
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:19,033
You ask me for money when I play Mahjong?

304
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,994
Don't you know that doing so makes me gift my opponent?

305
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:26,033
Are you afraid that I won't give you your allowance?

306
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,853
Go home and wait.

307
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:29,934
I'll come back after I win a few hands by myself

308
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,814
Get out of my sight!

309
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:35,936
 That's his father! There is a God.

310
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:37,033
Don't be angry.

311
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:39,774
Can't you just make a transfer via WeChat or Alipay?

312
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:40,796
Making your son work for it.

313
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:43,354
These are all frivolous things. I don't use them.

314
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,628
Yang Bawan.

315
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:54,254
Bro! Why are you here?

316
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:59,114
What's the matter?

317
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:05,094
Brother, slow down. How did you find this place?

318
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,980
There isn't a place I don't know about.

319
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,464
Be gentle.

320
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:15,154
What's wrong?

321
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:17,224
Let me tell you.

322
00:23:17,753 --> 00:23:22,054
From now on, every night, you will be dragged into a game called 19th Floor

323
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:24,133
and you will not be able to escape.

324
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:27,254
Of course. I'm going to see her.

325
00:23:27,254 --> 00:23:28,960
See who?

326
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:31,913
Wait, what are you so happy about? Don't you think it's dangerous?

327
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:33,914
Yes, it is quite thrilling.

328
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:36,293
Bullshit!

329
00:23:37,534 --> 00:23:40,193
You are just a fool.

330
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:42,513
You probably don't know

331
00:23:42,513 --> 00:23:45,814
what happens in reality when you die in the game.

332
00:23:45,814 --> 00:23:50,034
In reality, you would go offline.

333
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:52,254
You will become a vegetable

334
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:56,193
lying in the hospital, unable to move, only able to breathe.

335
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,056
You don't believe it?

336
00:24:03,214 --> 00:24:07,014
 Bro, let me use your photo to deceive this naive man.

337
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:09,973
 If I get back the money, we'll share the credit.

338
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:13,753
Look, this is my buddy, A'Yong.

339
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,814
Died in the previous game level

340
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:19,154
and is still in a coma in the hospital.

341
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:26,694
If you don't believe me, you can ask Chun Yu.

342
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:33,233
H-H-How could this be? They all know.

343
00:24:35,513 --> 00:24:40,394
No wonder they kept reminding me to be careful.

344
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:44,074
I won't beat around the bush with you.

345
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:50,614
Your dad owes me money. I need you to help me.

346
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,274
O-O-Okay, he's at the mahjong parlor.

347
00:24:54,274 --> 00:24:56,573
I'll go get him for you.

348
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:03,894
Did I ever ask you for this kind of help?

349
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:10,273
What if I can't help you?

350
00:25:10,273 --> 00:25:13,414
Then I will kill you in the game.

351
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:22,893
 Are you done eating? Then, let's clean it up.

352
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:25,214
 I will make some tea for you.

353
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,513
Granny, let me help you.

354
00:25:28,513 --> 00:25:31,173
No need, it's hot.

355
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,673
Let me do it.

356
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,094
- Take a seat. 
 - Okay.

357
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:47,074
Granny, Chun Yu used to laugh so happily when she was a child.

358
00:25:47,074 --> 00:25:51,993
Do you think Xiao Yu is a little eccentric?

359
00:25:51,993 --> 00:25:54,673
Not at all. She is quite nice.

360
00:25:54,673 --> 00:25:59,594
Nice? She was much nicer when she was young.

361
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:04,233
Enthusiastic, generous and so sensible.

362
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:07,033
 My name is Chun Yu. What's yours?

363
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:14,194
She was laughing every day.

364
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:16,533
I met her before.

365
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,460
What did you say?

366
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:24,154
Nothing. I mean, she is a nice person now too.

367
00:26:25,953 --> 00:26:29,354
Actually,

368
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:33,373
her change is linked to the car accident when she was 11.

369
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:36,794
She injured her head.

370
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:43,133
Furthermore, her mother died in that accident.

371
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:46,273
It was a huge shock for her.

372
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:51,714
Since then, I have never mentioned her childhood,

373
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:55,400
afraid to upset her.

374
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:58,673
So that's how it is.

375
00:26:58,673 --> 00:27:01,613
And her dad isn't a good father.

376
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:04,414
After her mom passed away, her dad didn't take care of her.

377
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,953
It has been another few months without provision for living expenses.

378
00:27:07,953 --> 00:27:13,193
He didn't even pay her university tuition. Really shameful.

379
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:17,073
Right. I have to call her father.

380
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:18,120
- Okay. 
 - Y-Y-You stay seated.

381
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,910
Okay.

382
00:27:19,914 --> 00:27:24,433
Her father was absent even when his daughter went to university.

383
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,840
What's wrong, Chun Yu?

384
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:43,533
How can a pen from Tianji be here?

385
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:48,233
Granny.

386
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,173
Where did this pen come from?

387
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:53,034
I saw it when I was cleaning your room.

388
00:27:53,034 --> 00:27:57,133
It ran out of ink. I thought it was useless, so I threw it away.

389
00:28:00,014 --> 00:28:01,993
You should stay here.

390
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:43,473
Is something wrong?

391
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,853
Someone has been in my room.

392
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:48,394
Who would do that?

393
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,054
 Tianji, why? This pen looks so familiar.

394
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:53,374
 Besides Tianji, where else have I seen it?

395
00:28:53,374 --> 00:28:56,764
 Dr. Jia took me into his office for a while.

396
00:28:56,764 --> 00:28:58,432

397
00:28:59,914 --> 00:29:03,874
- Dr. Jia. 
 - Dr. Jia?

398
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:07,393
He was my doctor after a car accident.

399
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:09,794
He also had a pen like this.

400
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:24,073
 Boss, we found no information related to him.

401
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:26,074
 Come back.

402
00:29:26,074 --> 00:29:27,612
 Yes.

403
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:43,354
Your condition isn't serious. The prescription has been issued.

404
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:45,914
Take your medication on time and have monthly checkups.

405
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:48,214
Okay, thank you, Dr. Jia.

406
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:51,634
Dr. Jia, please come with me to the nurses' station.

407
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:53,248
Okay.

408
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:58,314
What would a neurosurgeon be doing in Tianji?

409
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:04,093
Even if it is connected, why would they put a Doctor here?

410
00:30:08,214 --> 00:30:11,334
Is the players' coma related to Tianji?

411
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:15,334
You need a doctor's help to resolve this matter.

412
00:30:51,753 --> 00:30:53,694
Sir, don't stop yet.

413
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:14,833
 The prescription has been issued.

414
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,654
 Take your medication on time and have monthly checkups.

415
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:27,668
I've been exposed.

416
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,773

417
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:31,913
 Got it. Wrap it up as soon as possible.

418
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:33,468
Then what?

419
00:31:33,468 --> 00:31:36,613
Don't worry. I have plans.

420
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:38,713
You can rest for a while.

421
00:31:48,964 --> 00:31:53,132

422
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:56,740

423
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:02,373
Hey, what are you doing? This is the girls' dormitory.

424
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:07,334
Madam, I urgently need Chun Yu and Qing You.

425
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:09,174
Could you please call them for me?

426
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:12,213
Aren't you here for them? Why didn't you call them?

427
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,834
I did call. One didn't answer, and the other's phone is turned off.

428
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:16,253
Which room is it?

429
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:18,074
W-W-Which one?

430
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:20,293
What is their major?

431
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:25,536
Security?

432
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:27,274
A male student is trying to enter the girls' dormitory.

433
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:29,394
No, don't. Auntie, I made a mistake.

434
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:31,573
I was wrong. I'm leaving.

435
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:34,953
You think you can fool me? You're too young.

436
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:45,184
Kitty.

437
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,440
You're such a good kid.

438
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,614
You know it, too.

439
00:32:51,614 --> 00:32:54,734
If I treat you well, you'll treat me well, too.

440
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:58,434
If I could be a little stronger,

441
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:01,433
would she be a little nicer to me then?

442
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:14,873
Qing You, there you are.

443
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:16,408
What brings you here?

444
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:18,573
I came for you guys.

445
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:22,093
Long story short, do you know who Dou Dou is?

446
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:23,104
Dou Dou in the game?

447
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:26,014
Yes, do you know her? Is she from our school?

448
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:28,934
I don't know her. Why are you looking for her?

449
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:31,833
Tell her dying in the game will result in a coma in real life.

450
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:32,896
Who told you that?

451
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:34,234
See? You knew about it, right?

452
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:36,094
You all know. You just didn't tell me.

453
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:37,274
Brother Qiang told me about it.

454
00:33:37,274 --> 00:33:40,014
Isn't that why his buddy A'Yong is still in a coma in the hospital?

455
00:33:40,014 --> 00:33:43,694
So I must hurry and tell Dou Dou to stop playing the game.

456
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:47,853
 We should choose the weakest one to get in that coffin.

457
00:33:47,853 --> 00:33:50,390
 Dying in the game will result in a coma in real life.

458
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:54,233
 Let me out. Let me out.

459
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,934
 You don't deserve to be with them.

460
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:06,193
Are you okay? Why do you look so pale?

461
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:11,593
I don't know Dou Dou. I have other things to do. I'm leaving.

462
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,694
No, d-d-don't go.

463
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:17,813
Does Chun Yu know her? Can you ask her for me?

464
00:35:49,368 --> 00:35:53,120

465
00:36:03,674 --> 00:36:05,436
 Chun Yu.

466
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:39,674
 So I am like that injured kitten.

467
00:36:39,674 --> 00:36:42,554
 We could both be abandoned, right?

468
00:36:43,874 --> 00:36:45,660
 No.

469
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,560

470
00:36:51,560 --> 00:37:01,300

471
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,096
♫  I go from running  ♫

♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

492
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,516
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

493
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:30,672
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

494
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:50,404
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

495
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:53,828
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

496
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:59,288
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

497
00:39:00,644 --> 00:39:05,140
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

498
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,928
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

499
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:14,048
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

500
00:39:15,172 --> 00:39:17,169
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

501
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:20,900
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

502
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,716
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

503
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:26,244
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

504
00:39:26,244 --> 00:39:28,996
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

505
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:31,928
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

506
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:35,640
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

507
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,426
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

508
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:44,764
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫
