1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,010

2
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:56,740

3
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,776

4
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:08,040

5
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,280

6
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:44,052

7
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:56,644

8
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:07,892
Chun Yu?

9
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:10,020
Uncle Lin.

10
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,038
Uncle Lin, you're back.

11
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:14,818
Your daughter came to see you, so I let her in.

12
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:17,678
- She… 
 - Quickly get that computer.

13
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:20,617
Young lady, let me tell you, your dad truly loves you.

14
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,198
He spent a lot of money

15
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:26,618
to buy an expensive laptop for you.

16
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:28,877
- Uncle Lin, hurry up. 
 - She is not…

17
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:31,518
Too embarrassed to do it yourself, are you? I'll do it for you.

18
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:33,557
She's your child. Don't be embarrassed.

19
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:34,998
Don't go through my things, you…

20
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:38,458
- Don't think I don't know. You just put it under this sheet. 
 - Don't go through my things.

21
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,838
All right, all right. Leave please.

22
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:42,918
Hello.

23
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,800
 Hello, is this Chun Yu?

24
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,788
Yes.

25
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:47,238
 Please come to the school gate.

26
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:49,078
 It's your grandma. She…

27
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,798
- What's wrong with my grandma? 
  - Are you all right?

28
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:53,298
 No, she's… she's in the guard room. Just come over here.

29
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:55,058
- Okay. 
 - What happened to your grandma?

30
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:56,618
I don't know. They said she's at the gate.

31
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:58,458
I'll come along.

32
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,528
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

33
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:03,598
Please sit down, please sit down.

34
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:07,098
Things are getting serious again.

35
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,018
Grandma.

36
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:10,812
Xiao Yu.

37
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:13,438
You are Chun Yu, right? You finally made it.

38
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:15,818
Your grandma insisted on entering to bring you food.

39
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:18,478
but we have a policy that no outsiders are allowed in now.

40
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,858
As you know, we've been practicing fire drills for two days.

41
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,058
I brought you some drunken shrimp.

42
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,998
Just let me in and I'll come right out.

43
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:29,438
I'll just put it there and leave right away.

44
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:32,137
- Why don't you let me in?  Why don't you let me in? 
 - Grandma.

45
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:34,937
We really do have a no entry policy.

46
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:39,617
Grandma, thanks for bringing me my favorite drunken shrimp,

47
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:42,418
but the school does have its policies.

48
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,398
I'll walk you back, and we'll eat it together, okay?

49
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:47,838
No.

50
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:52,858
You take it back and share it with your friends in the dorm.

51
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:56,438
- Okay, okay. 
 - I'm leaving.

52
00:04:56,438 --> 00:04:57,958
- I'm leaving. 
 - Bye, grandma.

53
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,677
Goodbye, Granny.

54
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:02,078
- What's wrong? 
 -  What's the matter?

55
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,637
- My back! 
 - Let's go to the hospital.

56
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,398
My back!

57
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:08,077
Can we go to the hospital? Come on, let's go to the hospital.

58
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:09,898
Are these chronic problems?

59
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:15,057
Then I'll take your grandma home with you.

60
00:05:15,057 --> 00:05:17,778
- All right. 
 - Let's go.

61
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:19,877
- Be careful. 
 - I'm going to call a taxi.

62
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:22,758
I'll call a taxi. Be careful.

63
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,176
Xiaoqin?

64
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:35,317
Did you choose this class too?

65
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:49,952
What about Yang Bawan?

66
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:53,198
I don't know. He's probably not taking this class.

67
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:03,257
Just stop thinking about those things.

68
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:06,458
Live in the moment. We'll get through it together.

69
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:19,676
Xiaoqin.

70
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:25,077
Wenya, could you move over there?

71
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:26,544
Sure.

72
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:32,217
Don't forget what I said this morning.

73
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:36,738
I understand. Time and space, right?

74
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,557
I'm sitting here. This space should be far enough, right?

75
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:00,958
Students, class has begun.

76
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:06,458
Come on, class has begun. Turn to page seven.

77
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:15,664
Be careful.

78
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,196
- Be careful. 
 - Be careful.

79
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:23,558
Be careful.

80
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:25,678
Cushion, put on the cushion.

81
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:29,918
- Xiao Yu, go pour Uncle Lin a glass of water. 
 - Okay.

82
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:31,457
No need, I'm leaving.

83
00:07:31,457 --> 00:07:33,338
Wait. Uncle Lin, take a seat.

84
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,797
You still need to drink some water.

85
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:37,677
All right.

86
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:39,384
Come on.

87
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:47,884
Come on.

88
00:07:48,557 --> 00:07:50,078
Look at you, you are so careless.

89
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,136
When will you change that?

90
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,278
- It's fine. 
 - I'm sorry.

91
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:53,778
- Look, it's all wet. 
 - It's okay.

92
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:55,916
It's just a little water.

93
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,492
It's okay.

94
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:00,084
 He's so attached to this notebook.

95
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:01,980
 What exactly is written inside?

96
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,618
This water is cold. Get some warm water.

97
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,344
Okay.

98
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:10,140
I'm sorry, Uncle Lin.

99
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:13,777
Take a look at this child.

100
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,038
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm okay.

101
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:28,038
Grandma, did you make dumplings?

102
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:29,977
The stuffing is already done,

103
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,358
but I haven't rolled the wrappers.

104
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:34,337
I thought you were coming back to eat.

105
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:37,697
Roll the wrappers? I don't know how.

106
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:42,298
Uncle Lin, why don't you teach me and have a meal with us?

107
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,938
Look at this girl.

108
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:47,298
He has to cook for the students.

109
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:49,978
Today I don't have a shift in the canteen.

110
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:51,337
Anyway, I'm free.

111
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:54,358
Chun Yu has been helping me all this time.

112
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:56,697
- This is my opportunity to thank her. 
 - Right, right.

113
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:59,198
Okay then. Where are the dumplings?

114
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:00,288
Grandma, just wait here.

115
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,778
Well, that's great.

116
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:04,158
Let me help you.

117
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:06,678
No need, you can just watch.

118
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,678
By the way, Xiao Yu, our rice cooker is broken.

119
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,958
Maybe you should find someone to fix it.

120
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,868
Okay.

121
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:19,637
I can take a look.

122
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:23,477
S-Sure.

123
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,772

124
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:33,157
This is the one. It may not be repairable.

125
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,077
I'll take a look.

126
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:43,492
There is no light in here.

127
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,717
Maybe there's a bad wire.

128
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:49,077
Do you have an electrician's toolkit at home?

129
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:53,960
Yes.

130
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:08,358
 Nian Yongcheng refused my request for help.

131
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,297
 I've been to the equipment management center,

132
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:13,638
 but it requires a high-security access card.

133
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:19,077
 Look for it in the Chief Engineer's office, room 202.

134
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,940

135
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,472

136
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,480

137
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:08,004

138
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,078
 Do you know Chun Yiming?

139
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:18,917
 Is he related to all this?

140
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:22,597
 We'll be in touch after you get the pulse device.

141
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,808
 Look for it in the Chief Engineer's office, room 202.

142
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,440

143
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:42,717
Hi, Engineer Gao, do you need help?

144
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:46,078
No, I'm going back. Thank you.

145
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,417
Uncle Lin, do you know how to repair it?

146
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:14,858
When I first came to the city, I worked as an electrician.

147
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:21,378
It's on. You are great.

148
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:24,077
Let's make more dumplings.

149
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:27,318
Okay, Grandma, just wait a minute.

150
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:53,097
Grandmother, why did you come here?

151
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:54,818
Sit over there and rest.

152
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:57,677
I'm here to supervise the work.

153
00:13:57,677 --> 00:14:01,378
To supervise? We won't slack off.

154
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:05,518
You won't slack off, but I'm afraid you'll cut corners.

155
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,057
Look at this.

156
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,818
Look at this girl working.

157
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:48,138
She's making a mess everywhere.

158
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:51,878
She's afraid no one will know she's been working.

159
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:56,277
Mr. Lin,

160
00:14:56,277 --> 00:15:01,277
today, our dumpling filling has no onions. 
   (Won't cause any tears.)

161
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:06,118
I miss my daughter.

162
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:10,058
I haven't seen her in a while.

163
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:14,358
Do you miss your daughter?

164
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:17,217
I have a good idea.

165
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:23,198
Put all of your yearning and missing into the filling,

166
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,217
give it a pinch,

167
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,677
and then eat it.

168
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:34,618
When I'm full, I'll have a sweet dream.

169
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:37,778
It'll be nice just to see her.

170
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:41,897
It is still nice to see her in a dream, is it not?

171
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:47,498
The water is boiling. Come on.

172
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:48,918
Time to drop the dumplings.

173
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,238
I'll also carry this plate over.

174
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:52,918
Let's cook the dumplings.

175
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:01,138
- The dumplings are here. 
 - They're here.

176
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:05,678
Uncle Lin, today let's treat each other as family

177
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:08,497
and have a good meal, shall we?

178
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:09,658
Please taste it.

179
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:11,278
Let's start eating.

180
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:12,217
Let's eat.

181
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,297
Come on, let's eat.

182
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:15,818
Thank you.

183
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:18,498
- Come on. 
 - Okay, thank you. I'll do it myself.

184
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:20,918
You did all these things.

185
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,018
You are too kind.

186
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:30,497
Chun Yu, are you interested in my notebook?

187
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:31,616
I…

188
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:35,557
Look. These are some of my daily notes.

189
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:40,736

190
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:50,877
It's a recipe book.

191
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:54,798
Our leader said students nowadays have more picky taste buds,

192
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:57,138
so he asked me to come up with a few new dishes.

193
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:59,698
That is why I spend all day studying it.

194
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:01,436
Professional.

195
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:05,598
Stop looking. Come on, let's eat.

196
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,637
- Okay. 
 - Come on.

197
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:10,037
The drunken shrimp is so delicious.

198
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:11,858
- Come on. Eat. 
 - Yes, I'll give it a try.

199
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,340
All right.

200
00:17:33,737 --> 00:17:37,798

201
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:40,980

202
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,352

203
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:56,777
 Uncle Lin could open it because he was an electrician.

204
00:17:56,777 --> 00:18:00,837
 There are rational explanations for the notebook and the recipe.

205
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:09,098
 That means there is only Chun Yiming left,

206
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:12,377
 whose identity is still suspicious.

207
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:15,618
 If Chun Yiming is Mazzolini…

208
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,940

209
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,250

210
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,680

211
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,110

212
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:40,158
 Then how is he related to Gao Xuan?

213
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,500

214
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,492
 Where are you?

215
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:07,497
 I'm heading out for an emergency. I'll come back to you later.

216
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:20,110

217
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:32,392

218
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,880
 Zero, Four, One, Nine. .

219
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:44,917
 You Brat! What are you doing?

220
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,397
 You're as ruthless as your mom.

221
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:49,957
 If you dare, then leave!

222
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:53,818
 How dare you pour out my wine!

223
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,752

224
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:17,898
 That is the day we met when we were children.

225
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:24,360

226
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,660

227
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:28,810

228
00:23:07,858 --> 00:23:11,498
 I'd like to know more about the self-developed equipment.

229
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:14,158
 Well, the self-developed equipment section

230
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:16,578
 is confidential.

231
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,478
 I'm afraid I can't share that information with you.

232
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:20,498
 Okay, I understand.

233
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:42,757
 Gao Xuan, do not disappoint me.

234
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,890

235
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,544
 Okay.

236
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,830

237
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:26,478
 Hello, Chun Yu. Where are you?

238
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:28,024
I'm out.

239
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:31,378
I was telling you I found something very important.

240
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,597
I'm busy, we'll talk later.

241
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:43,520

242
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:22,278
 My dear daughter, you are so clever.

243
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:24,497
 Your father is also Microtech's former chief engineer.

244
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,536
 My project has been completed.

245
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:26,598
 Microtech and Tianji have a very close connection.

246
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,998
 This place has been untouched since your father's resignation. 
 Your father was one of the founders of Tianji.

247
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:33,358
 This is President Nian's office.

248
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:35,518
 These two companies' businesses are quite similar.

249
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,278
 This indicates there is a connection between them.

250
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,798
 I have a friend who wants to fund all of my research.

251
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:05,958
 In the end, everything is related to you.

252
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,392

253
00:31:26,697 --> 00:31:30,537
You are finally here, my daughter.

254
00:31:42,697 --> 00:31:46,038
I know you have a lot of questions.

255
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,437
I'll tell you everything right now.

256
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:53,578
Where should I start?

257
00:31:54,438 --> 00:32:00,737
Chun Yu, have you ever felt lonely?

258
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:05,437
It's not what you think.

259
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:09,198
This is what will make you fly in the sky

260
00:32:09,198 --> 00:32:12,437
but only to find yourself in the abyss.

261
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:15,438
Do you know what it feels like?

262
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:18,518
 Daddy, come play with me.

263
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:27,677
Maybe a lot of people thought I had a happy life.

264
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:32,497
I became a professor when I was 30 years old.

265
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:37,877
I had a wife, a child, and seemed to be happy.

266
00:32:37,877 --> 00:32:40,057
However, deep inside my heart,

267
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:43,117
I always felt lonely.

268
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:47,917
This feeling of loneliness grew more intense.

269
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:50,718
I am obviously a genius,

270
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:54,038
but every day I had to do the most ordinary things.

271
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,857
So when you were with my mother and me,

272
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:58,098
instead of feeling happy, you felt lonely.

273
00:32:58,098 --> 00:33:00,218
Don't interrupt me!

274
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:08,118
I'm sorry. Please let me finish.

275
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:13,537
This feeling of loneliness suddenly made me realize

276
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:18,477
that this world is too boring and too flawed.

277
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:19,938
With my talent,

278
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:25,278
I could create my own world, a perfect world!

279
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,270

280
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:35,338
Before long, I found a man called Yan Mingliang.

281
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:40,358
He was very wealthy. He was not just a businessman,

282
00:33:40,358 --> 00:33:43,558
but also an idealistic dreamer.

283
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:47,278
That's why he was so easily convinced

284
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:49,558
and decided to invest in my project.

285
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:53,077
I had a sense of purpose again.

286
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:56,077
It was a wonderful time.

287
00:33:56,077 --> 00:34:01,178
It was simple, pure. All my dreams before my eyes.

288
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:03,358
Do you know?

289
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:07,758
The beauty of a dream is that if you work hard enough,

290
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:11,798
it will be yours indefinitely.

291
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,898
 How did it go?

292
00:34:53,898 --> 00:34:56,977
 We made it.

293
00:34:56,977 --> 00:34:58,780
 We made it!

294
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,652
 No.

295
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:06,957
 It's not enough.

296
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:12,057
Everyone thought this system called "Future Microworld"

297
00:35:12,057 --> 00:35:13,858
was already magnificent enough.

298
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:17,617
Yet in my heart I still felt

299
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:21,918
it was not my ideal world.

300
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:25,157
Something seemed to be missing.

301
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:29,677
It's like writing a play without a core,

302
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:33,038
or painting a dragon without eyes.

303
00:35:33,038 --> 00:35:37,618
It had no soul.

304
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,998
After a long period of research and development,

305
00:35:40,998 --> 00:35:44,157
we finally entered the testing phase.

306
00:35:56,418 --> 00:35:58,140
 Mingliang!

307
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:02,144
 Mingliang!

308
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:21,557
 Mingliang! Yan Mingliang, wake up!

309
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:24,097
 Wake up, Mingliang!

310
00:36:28,218 --> 00:36:30,417
 How could it be?

311
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:34,277
 This is a virtual world.

312
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:37,798
 How would he be in a coma?

313
00:36:44,398 --> 00:36:47,958
 Mingliang! Yan Mingliang. Mingliang!

314
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,737
 President Yan! President Yan!

315
00:36:50,737 --> 00:36:52,376
 Call 120. (Ambulance)

316
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,977
 No, wait.

317
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:03,118
 President Yan.

318
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:14,457
 Mingliang!

319
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,498
 He's awake.

320
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:22,878
 President Yan, are you okay?

321
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:31,237
 I passed out in the system.

322
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:34,597
 How could this happen?

323
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:36,918
 It was the moment you fell into the water.

324
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:38,918
 Due to the extreme shock,

325
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:42,198
 you briefly lost consciousness

326
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:44,617
 and went into a coma within the system.

327
00:37:44,617 --> 00:37:47,118
 That's quite a bug.

328
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:48,278
 What should we do?

329
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:51,637
 Have we been working all these years for nothing?

330
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:55,630
 No, it worked.

331
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,650
 It worked.

332
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,078
At that moment,

333
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:05,398
I knew the perfect world I had been waiting for all my life

334
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:07,758
was finally here,

335
00:38:07,758 --> 00:38:13,338
so I quickly developed a completely updated design proposal,

336
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:15,437
"19th Floor."

337
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,410

338
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:45,480

339
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,128
♫  I go from running  ♫

340
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,552
♫  To flying  ♫

341
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:57,510
♫  Through setbacks and hardship  ♫

342
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,968
♫  So what?  ♫

343
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:04,752
♫  Oh ~ the light  ♫

344
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:08,353
♫  It shines on my face  ♫

345
00:39:08,353 --> 00:39:11,896
♫  Unwilling to lose hope  ♫

346
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:15,291
♫  I only want to bloom  ♫

347
00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:20,616
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

348
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:24,132
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫

349
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:29,627
♫  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  ♫

350
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:35,380
♫  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  ♫

351
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,112
♫  The triumphant song will eventually soar through time and space  ♫

352
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:44,396
♫  The desire for freedom is strong and cannot be extinguished  ♫

353
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,385
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

354
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,064
♫  Hey, I'm following the direction of my dreams  ♫

355
00:39:51,064 --> 00:39:53,892
♫  Hey, let's embrace future challenges and opportunities  ♫

356
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,516
♫  Find clarity amid uncertainty  ♫

357
00:39:56,516 --> 00:39:59,108
♫  I rise against the wind  ♫

358
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,072
♫  Embracing light's power  ♫

359
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:05,752
♫  Hey, I must soar even with broken wings  ♫

360
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:08,548
♫  Hey, witness fate triumph over darkness  ♫

361
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:14,704
♫  Forge a medal using thorns  ♫

362
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:34,436
♫  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  ♫

363
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:37,860
♫  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  ♫
