1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,050

2
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:56,717

3
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,661

4
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:44,772
The Nian beast is gone.

5
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:46,162
So are the shadow puppets.

6
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:47,542
The Nian beast?

7
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,042
This place had such thrilling things?

8
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,521
So what do we do now?

9
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:53,861
Move to the next level.

10
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:55,472
Let's go.

11
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,100
The figurines are gone too.

12
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:13,376
Let's keep moving.

13
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,408

14
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:39,863
No train. No clown either.

15
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:42,724

16
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:10,808
Even the bugs are gone.

17
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,268
Be careful.

18
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,641
There's nothing here either.

19
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,181
Wait, Old Gao.

20
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,901
What exactly is going on?

21
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:06,642
The game is likely suspended.

22
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:09,402
All traps and monsters are no longer active.

23
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,882
What happens now?

24
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:15,402
If we can't find the entrance, we can't enter the Ultimate Space.

25
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:22,501
Run away! Run!

26
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,020
Hurry up!

27
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:40,022
All the games have been suspended.

28
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:42,902
It's likely an accident caused by system instability.

29
00:05:43,582 --> 00:05:46,762
The good news is, they must have entered the Ultimate Space.

30
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,702
But it's best not to die to get in.

31
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:51,301
President Nian warned us about this earlier.

32
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,161
It seems we can only ask President Nian for help.

33
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:12,162
Then the only way is to take you to Tianji.

34
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,401
You can enter the system from their host room.

35
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:17,282
This will take you directly to the Ultimate Space level.

36
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:18,932
Thank you.

37
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:23,482
Won't you put yourself at risk if you did that?

38
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:31,521
Helping you means helping my daughter and myself.

39
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:36,356

40
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:50,962
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

41
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,550

42
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,644
Come in.

43
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:12,142
It's late at night. I'm getting hungry.

44
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:14,621
- Let's grab something to eat. 
 - Okay.

45
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:16,902
Same place we ate last time?

46
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,702
- The meat there is so delicious. 
 - Right.

47
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:23,281
I think it's the best one around here.

48
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:24,802
They have good ribs.

49
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:27,642
I find myself craving it every few days.

50
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:58,192
Come in.

51
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:21,542
All right.

52
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,462
The console here is set with permissions.

53
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,102
I can only lead you into the Ultimate Space.

54
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:28,922
Once you're in, you have to act as you go along.

55
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,761
I will be out here helping you as much as I can.

56
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,388
Okay.

57
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,741
 Mom, we are going home now.

58
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:12,842
 Okay. Let's go home.

59
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:17,741
 Bro, if you want to run, run that way.

60
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:19,641
 Let me be a hero for once.

61
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:22,342
 It may sound cruel, but it's true.

62
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,482
 Your leg may not recover completely.

63
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,642
 - Scream. 
 - Let me out!

64
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,602
 You can scream, but no one will come for you.

65
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,342
 Give me the tag.

66
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:33,602
 Brother. Save me.

67
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:34,841
 Dad, it hurts too much.

68
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,142
 Stop hitting me, Dad!

69
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:38,242
 You brat!

70
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:39,302
 Dad.

71
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:40,942
 You're as ruthless as your mom.

72
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:43,481
 If you dare, then leave!

73
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:48,821
 Happy birthday to you!

74
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,961
 I wish you a happyâ€¦

75
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:54,622
 Yiming, why aren't you singing?

76
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:59,401
 Today, the project did not advance.

77
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:00,522
 It's over.

78
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:02,442
 Dad, that's not the case.

79
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:04,222
 Everything is over.

80
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:06,062
 Your dad is too busy.

81
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:09,962
 There must be a reason he missed your birthday party.

82
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:13,361
 Your dad is the best dad in the world.

83
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:15,442
 He loves you.

84
00:10:56,014 --> 00:11:00,120

85
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,520

86
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:17,856

87
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:24,100

88
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,641

89
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:31,904

90
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:33,860

91
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,600

92
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,163

93
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,754

94
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:43,912

95
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,739

96
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:50,816

97
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:27,781
Bawan, are you okay?

98
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:31,442
Xiaoqin, I feel so bad.

99
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:39,001
Go check on her. Leave Bawan to me.

100
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,222
Wait.

101
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:42,621
Wenya, are you all right?

102
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:44,782
When will these nightmares end?

103
00:12:44,782 --> 00:12:46,642
I wanted to die in there.

104
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,481
Just hang on a little longer.

105
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:16,240
Qing You.

106
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:23,302
Qing You, are you okay?

107
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:30,260
Qing You.

108
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:53,741
It's time to eat.

109
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,108
Let's go.

110
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,222
What does this mean?

111
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,244
Qing You.

112
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:26,364
What's going on?

113
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,688
- Qing You. 
 - Hurry up.

114
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:48,536
Let's go.

115
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:09,721
- Brother Qiang. 
 - No noise allowed.

116
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:11,502
Brother Qiang.

117
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:13,581
Brother Qiang. It's nice to see you.

118
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,682
Brother Qiang, we are here to save you.

119
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,492
Brother Qiang.

120
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:23,041
What happened to them?

121
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,902
Could it be that they've been here too long,

122
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:27,402
tormented by their inner demons every day,

123
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:30,021
so their mental state is very weak?

124
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:36,781
Meal time is ten minutes.

125
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:41,522
Do we return to our cells after the meal?

126
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,762
More nightmares?

127
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:46,181
This is so terrible.

128
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,552
Qing You.

129
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:38,001
You eat it, I'm not hungry.

130
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,482
Uncle Chun should be here soon.

131
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,088
Don't worry.

132
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:02,641
Senior Sister.

133
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:06,522
I was wrong earlier,

134
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:11,862
but rest assured, we are here to save you.

135
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:14,082
Move aside, illusion!

136
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:15,662
No fighting.

137
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:17,482
I didn't fight. I'm not like Uncle.

138
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,481
I'm obedient.

139
00:17:20,462 --> 00:17:22,028
Uncle?

140
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:25,742
Senior Sister. Did you see an uncle fighting with someone?

141
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:27,762
- No noise allowed. 
 - It wasn't me.

142
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:28,862
She didn't talk to me either.

143
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:30,922
I-I don't want to go to the dungeon. I'm afraid of the dungeon.

144
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,656
Sit back down.

145
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:42,882
My dad's in the dungeon.

146
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:45,142
Uncle Chun wouldn't fight for no reason.

147
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:46,701
He must have his reasons.

148
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,392
Don't worry too much.

149
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,421
Brother Qiang.

150
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:53,661
We are not illusions, we are real.

151
00:17:53,661 --> 00:17:56,002
Brother Qiang, we really are here to save you.

152
00:17:56,862 --> 00:17:58,516
Brother Qiang.

153
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,822
I'm going to the dungeon to find my dad.

154
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:19,742
I'll go to the control room, turn off the fog, and open the cell doors.

155
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:24,116
Xiaoqin.

156
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:28,168
And me.

157
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,424
What are you doing?

158
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:48,902
There's a fight! Chun Yu is hitting someone.

159
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:51,081
Great Devil is hitting someone.

160
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,452
Someone come!

161
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:55,182
There's a fight. There's a fight.

162
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:56,820
Stop.

163
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,341
Stop fighting.

164
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:00,542
Chun Yu, stop.

165
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,284
Chun Yu.

166
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:08,202
Sorry, sorry. Don't hit me.

167
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,436
Don't move.

168
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,762
N-No, I-I didn't hit anyone.

169
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,761
I-I-It's all her fault. I have nothing to do with it.

170
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:29,041
Right, it was her.

171
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:34,301
Take her to the dungeon. Take her away.

172
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,122
Time's up. Back to the cells.

173
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:08,676
Let's go.

174
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:11,808
Let's go.

175
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,432
Get in.

176
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:47,662
Dad.

177
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:49,241
Dad, is that you?

178
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:51,152
No noise allowed.

179
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,222
Dad, are you okay?

180
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,384
Chun Yu.

181
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:39,116
Get in.

182
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:36,602
I remember when you were little,

183
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:39,141
I taught you to play chess with the computer,

184
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:42,641
and we often came up with the same moves.

185
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,602
But I always came up with better moves than you.

186
00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:49,261
Of course.

187
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:53,481
Because you're my daughter. Children are always better than their parents.

188
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:07,820
I'm sorry.

189
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:20,241
Dad. I've forgiven you in my heart long ago.

190
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:25,961
I know you're just doing what you have to do.

191
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:30,542
You didn't mean to neglect me and Mom.

192
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:35,684
Thank you.

193
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,721
That's right. Why did you come in again?

194
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:51,502
W-We asked President Nian for help.

195
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:55,682
Not just me, there's also Gao Xuan, Bawan, Xiaoqin and Wenya.

196
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:57,382
We all came in.

197
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:59,262
Silly children.

198
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,362
You're asking for trouble.

199
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:05,881
Dad, we're also just doing what we have to do.

200
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:28,550

201
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:38,541
 Give me the tag.

202
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,762
No, I didn't mean to.

203
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:45,862
I didn't mean to.

204
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:48,121
 Save me.

205
00:26:52,802 --> 00:26:54,800
 Save me.

206
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:58,584
 Brother.

207
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:01,421
 Run.

208
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:25,122
Dad, Gao Xuan succeeded.

209
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:27,216

210
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:27,340
Old Gao succeeded.

211
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:06,182
Why isn't this door opening?

212
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,662
Dad, you came to the dungeon

213
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:46,981
because there's something very important here, right?

214
00:30:47,622 --> 00:30:50,601
I designed the core architecture of this game

215
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:52,922
and I built a secret door in it.

216
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:55,641
If we use it as a breaking point to implant a Trojan virus,

217
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:58,041
then we can destroy the entire system.

218
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:02,662
But unexpectedly, Yan Mingliang has made a lot of changes.

219
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:05,902
I've been through almost all the levels in 19th Floor,

220
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:08,062
but I haven't found that secret door yet.

221
00:31:08,062 --> 00:31:10,922
The only place you haven't been yet is the Ultimate Space.

222
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:12,804
Right.

223
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:17,462
After arriving here, I closely examined the room's structure.

224
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:21,562
There's a good chance the secret door is in the dungeon.

225
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:23,181
Chun Yu.

226
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,501
Check if you have any leads on your side.

227
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:28,741
What does it look like?

228
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:30,261
It's very simple.

229
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:33,561
It's the character of 'Yu' in 'Chun Yu'.

230
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:03,441
I wonder how Bawan is doing.

231
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:19,201
Bawan, are you awake?

232
00:32:20,702 --> 00:32:22,341
T-Thisâ€¦

233
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:24,248
Xiaoqin?

234
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:27,772
Oh no.

235
00:32:27,772 --> 00:32:29,882
Why doesn't he respond?

236
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,122
Is he really in danger?

237
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:36,001
Bawan.

238
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,422
She hit it so hard,

239
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,602
is she in danger?

240
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:43,821
Xiaoqin.

241
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:45,062
He hit it so hard.

242
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:47,161
He's really in danger.

243
00:32:47,161 --> 00:32:48,322
Xiaoqin, don't worry.

244
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:51,482
- Old Gao has already succeeded. The door will open soon. 
 - Don't worry! I'm right beside you.

245
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:53,762
Xiaoqin, don't be scared.

246
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:56,552
What are you doing?

247
00:32:58,301 --> 00:32:59,902
Hitting the wall.

248
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:01,902
Why are you awake?

249
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:05,181
R-Right, I am having a nightmare.

250
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:06,902
Help! Let me out.

251
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,962
Help!

252
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,962
Something is wrong with the control room.

253
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:16,122
Everyone assemble in the control room.

254
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:17,780
 Yes.

255
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,312
Let's go.

256
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:33,322
 Something is wrong with the control room.

257
00:33:33,322 --> 00:33:35,681
 Everyone assemble in the control room.

258
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:42,324

259
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,280

260
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:22,080

261
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,746
â™«  I go from running  â™«

262
00:34:26,746 --> 00:34:30,270
â™«  To flying  â™«

263

â™«  Through setbacks and hardship  â™«

264
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:37,586
â™«  So what?  â™«

265
00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:41,370
â™«  Oh ~ the light  â™«

266
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,971
â™«  It shines on my face  â™«

267
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:48,614
â™«  Unwilling to lose hope  â™«

268
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:52,009
â™«  I only want to bloom  â™«

269
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:57,334
â™«  One must, time and time again, leap over the giant waves  â™«

270
00:34:57,334 --> 00:35:00,750
â™«  Trek through the wilderness over and over again  â™«

271
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:06,445
â™«  When a new day begins, hope is born anew  â™«

272
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:11,898
â™«  Once again, set sail for the distant place in your heart  â™«

273
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:15,730

274

275
