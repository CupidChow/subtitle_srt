1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,030

2
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:56,727

3
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,771

4
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,260
 Why am I here?

5
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,370
 Could it be a prank?

6
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,680
 What's wrong?

7
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,700
 W-What?

8
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,900

9
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,610

10
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,056
You are here.

11
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,984
You two, you are quick.

12
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:21,281
Uncle Lin, we just got here.

13
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,380
Brother Gao.

14
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,324
And me, too.

15
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,140
Dou Dou.

16
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:32,481
Dou Dou, I-I…

17
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:34,136
Bawan.

18
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,704
Brother Qiang.

19
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:44,541
Hear me out.

20
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,781
Stand behind me when you enter, so I can protect you.

21
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,520
Okay.

22
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,628
And…

23
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:52,340

24
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,461
I'm no fool, either.

25
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,024
If there's a chance, I'll help you with it.

26
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,800
For real?

27
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,081
Of course. Why would I lie to you?

28
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:05,021
But first we must save A'Yong.

29
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,220
Chun Yu, Senior.

30
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,520
Why are you guys here?

31
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,881
Xu Wenya.

32
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,521
You…

33
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:19,760
W-What's your name again?

34
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,500
Yang Bawan. You're such a muddle head.

35
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,621
Do you know what is most attractive about a man?

36
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,044
A sense of security.

37
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:30,840
I teach you a trick.

38
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,148
Beauty,

39
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,816
let me tell you.

40
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:41,741
When we get in later, it's quite dangerous inside,

41
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:45,501
but don't be afraid. Stand behind me, I will protect you.

42
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,960
- Are you crazy? Who needs your protection? 
 - Brother Qiang.

43
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,101
- I… 
 - Brother Qiang!

44
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:53,901
- Forget it. 
 - Nobody beats someone the first time they meet.

45
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,101
- Forget it. 
 - This feeling…

46
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:59,021
This dream is so real. All of you...

47
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:01,380
All of this may seem bizarre,

48
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,801
but Xu Wenya, this is not a dream.

49
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:05,328
It's not a dream.

50
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:08,781
So where are we now?

51
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:11,420
- In a game. 
 - A game?

52
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:17,172
How did I get to be here?

53
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,981
Think about it. Have you ever put on Tianji Science and Technology's VR device?

54
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:28,281
I put on a headset while unpacking a package this afternoon.

55
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,020
So this is really a game?

56
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,060
Then you're all experts. Are you?

57
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,961
This is not a simple game.

58
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:42,021
Anyway, don't ask questions or talk nonsense.

59
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:44,861
Just do whatever we do.

60
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:49,401
How are you still acting like a devil in the game?

61
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,121
Everyone, let's go.

62
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,741
Do we really have to go in?

63
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:07,261
You can play outside alone, nobody's stopping you.

64
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,121
Why are they all so mean?

65
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,710

66
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:31,380
This setup looks crazy.

67
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,341
This looks pretty cool.

68
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:35,628
Why are you saying it looks crazy?

69
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,621
Student Xu, as your senior, let me give you a friendly reminder.

70
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:43,420
This can be very dangerous. Be careful.

71
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,120
You're all so nervous.

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,921
What exactly happened earlier?

73
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,044
Let's go.

74
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,300

75
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,190

76
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,261
 Welcome to the World of Joy.

77
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:34,340
 I wish you a lot of fun.

78
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,881
 May you always smile.

79
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,280
This game's atmosphere is impressive.

80
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,820
We will all keep playing the game as agreed.

81
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,121
You better keep your promise.

82
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:51,941
Yes, Qing You must wake up after we finish the game.

83
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:53,960
A'Yong too.

84
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:57,661
That's just a NPC. It won't answer us.

85
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:00,141
What does Qing You have to do with all this?

86
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:03,181
Miss, don't worry about that for now.

87
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,920
Let's get through this level first.

88
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,760
But…

89
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:15,756
 Now please approach the card slot in the center of the stage.

90
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:20,081
 Each of you will pick one card.

91
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,240
What is this?

92
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,340
It's a lucky draw.

93
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,040

94
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,920
The cards may have numbers matching these cabin numbers.

95
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,561
Wait, why are we entering this cabin?

96
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,460
Stop saying nonsence.

97
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,750
Just take the card.

98
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,400

99
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,880

100
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,581
Dou Dou, you are next to me.

101
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:03,901
We can take care of each other.

102
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,341

103
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,481

104
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:11,841

105
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:14,101
You're right.

106
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:18,260
Why doesn't it tell us the rules?

107
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,581
Maybe it won't tell us until we're inside the cabins.

108
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,981
Everyone, be careful.

109
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,920
Dou Dou, you too. Stay safe.

110
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:42,101
Is it that serious?

111
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:48,192
Hey, Bawan.

112
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:51,101
Be careful.

113
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:53,764
But don't worry, I've got your back.

114
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:55,461
Brother Qiang, rest assured.

115
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:57,701
You should be careful as well.

116
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,528
Bawan.

117
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:36,641
Why is there a toy train in my cabin?

118
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:40,480
Brother Qiang, what did you say?

119
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,860
Bawan?

120
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,132
Yang Bawan?

121
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:55,900
Brother Qiang?

122
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:08,248
Dou Dou!

123
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,536
I know.

124
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:15,540
Wait.

125
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,981
What are you talking about?

126
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,712
Senior.

127
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,660
Wait.

128
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,500
Uncle, what's going on?

129
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,680
Missy, what did you say?

130
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,981
I can't hear you.

131
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:43,541
 Game: Blow Me Up.

132
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,261
 Time: three minutes.

133
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:48,101
 Game rules: there's a bomb in the toy train.

134
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,660
 Wind it up fully, and the toy train starts.

135
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,761
 When time's up, the toy train blows up.

136
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:58,421
 Whose area it stops in, whoever is doomed.

137
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,928
A toy train?

138
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,840
Do you have a toy train there?

139
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,860
T-T…

140
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:15,640
 If it is based on numbers, then the toy train should be at…

141
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,860
This is the clockwork spring.

142
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,220
All right, now I should rewind it.

143
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:50,201
Come on, here I go.

144
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,740
Calm down.

145
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,320

146
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:06,161
 The game begins.

147
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,961
That thing has a bomb?

148
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,281
That was a joke, right?

149
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:43,841
The rule is wherever the toy train stops at, the player who…

150
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,001
So each person has their own designated area.

151
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,421
This means,

152
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:50,221
if the toy train explodes in a player's area…

153
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:53,500
There's a clockwork spring on it that winds.

154
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,801
- That person will die. 
 - That person will die.

155
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:01,540
Why did it stop?

156
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,800
Rewind it.

157
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,628
The clockwork spring.

158
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:09,380
Uncle Lin, what are you doing?

159
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:12,560
T-There really is a bomb?

160
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,680
Gao Xuan, the clockwork spring.

161
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,100
That…

162
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:25,020
Looks like everyone has to rewind it to get the train moving.

163
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,721
Missy, rewind it.

164
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:39,112
R-Rewind it?

165
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,301
This thing won't explode here, right?

166
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,520
No.

167
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,221
It just said three minutes. There's still time.

168
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:50,501
I should be safe.

169
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,981
The toy train will explode anyway.

170
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:08,260
Someone will definitely die.

171
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,941
Is there no solution to this game?

172
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:12,341
No.

173
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:14,680
There must be a way for everyone to pass.

174
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,721
Three minutes.

175
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,301
That's 180 seconds.

176
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:20,480
This means timing is important.

177
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,541
Simply determine the toy train's trajectory and endpoint,

178
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,561
 making it explode at a certain point.

179
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:27,860
 Then we can all be safe.

180
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,680
Time.

181
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,181
I need to measure time.

182
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,081
But how?

183
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,128
Time.

184
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,220

185
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,380
Dou Dou is timing.

186
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:02,180

187
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,141
 When the time runs out, the toy train will explode.

188
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:13,140
 Whichever area it stops at, that person will be doomed.

189
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,801
 That's right, Brother Qiang is number one.

190
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:20,241
 He has the toy train.

191
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:23,120
 The game begins.

192
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,204
 There is nothing we can do.

193
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:32,861
 Can we just wait until the toy train comes?

194
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:35,540
 Chun Yu and Gao Xuan are both trying to find a solution.

195
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,141
 What can I do?

196
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,572
 How can I help everyone?

197
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:43,121
 Time: three minutes.

198
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:45,640
There is no timer.

199
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,081
That's right.

200
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:49,740
My normal heart rate is 60.

201
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,261
 A great swordsman must remain absolutely calm

202
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:02,700
 even at the last moment.

203
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,480

204
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,960

205
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,160

206
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,621
D-Dou Dou is…

207
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,761
Dou Dou is timing.

208
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:28,141
One, two, three,

209
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:31,384
four, five, six,

210
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,920
seven,

211
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,841
eight,

212
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,432
nine,

213
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,656
ten.

214
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:41,632
Ten seconds.

215
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
Five seconds.

216
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,840
 I'm reversing!

217
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:18,401
What the heck?

218
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:19,600
You can't do that.

219
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,680
Did it reverse?

220
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,116
What's going on?

221
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:25,060
What happened?

222
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,500

223
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,910

224
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,680

225
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,321
Three, three.

226
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:50,661
It has been a while.

227
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:53,621
It takes five seconds to rewind it.

228
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:57,081
The train reaches the next glass cabin in ten seconds.

229
00:20:57,081 --> 00:21:00,601
So each run takes 15 seconds.

230
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:02,360
15 seconds from Brother Qiang,

231
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,960
30 seconds to Uncle Lin, 45 seconds…

232
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,460

233
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:13,481
Wan-165 sec, Dou-180 sec.

234
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,930

235
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,981
Why did it return?

236
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:43,680
How much time has elapsed?

237
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,141
It's not going to explode here, is it?

238
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:51,572
Chun Yu.

239
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:56,284
Chun Yu.

240
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,456
 I'm reversing.

241
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,468
One.

242
00:22:06,468 --> 00:22:07,924
 Two.

243
00:22:07,924 --> 00:22:09,220
 Three.

244
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,141
 Four.

245
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:12,664
 Five.

246
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,420

247
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:19,961
 I'm reversing!

248
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:22,461
It took five seconds to reverse.

249
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:25,301
So it takes 175 seconds to leave Dou Dou's cabin.

250
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,100
and five seconds on the move.

251
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,400
That takes about 180 seconds…

252
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,801
The game is called  "Blow Me Up."

253
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,900
Just now it shouted "I'm reversing!"

254
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,868
So the clown is the "I".

255
00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:45,761
The game ends when the clown is blown up.

256
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,760
Old Lin, hurry up. Old Lin, no.

257
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,440

258
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,984
Don't panic.

259
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,960
Come on, come on.

260
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,001
Just rewind it. Just rewind it.

261
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,841
Rewind, rewind, rewind it.

262
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:37,801
Don't panic.

263
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:40,040
What's wrong with him?

264
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,530

265
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,281
Brother Qiang. Don't panic.

266
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:53,121
As long as nothing goes wrong, no one will be blown up.

267
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,640
Brother Qiang.

268
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,781
Brother Qiang, hurry up.

269
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:08,121
Do it now.

270
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,400
Why didn't the toy train leave yet?

271
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,750

272
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:30,181
Brother Qiang delayed for ten seconds.

273
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:33,001
Then Dou Dou won't have enough time.

274
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,381
Oh, no.

275
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:40,880
If that's the case, the bomb will explode at Dou Dou's cabin.

276
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,660

277
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,952
Bawan.

278
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,390

279
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,570

280
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:19,740
Time is running out.

281
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,321
The toy train has stopped again.

282
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,410

283
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,484
Yang Bawan.

284
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:43,136
What should I do?

285
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,780
No, no, no.

286
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,421
I absolutely cannot let Dou Dou die.

287
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:53,700
Everyone needs me.

288
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,600
Calm down.

289
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,470

290
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,970

291
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,904
Bawan.

292
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,601
Yang Bawan.

293
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,600

294
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:27,388
Bawan.

295
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:29,401
Yang Bawan.

296
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:31,580
No.

297
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,610

298
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,121
Bawan.

299
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,524
I'm okay.

300
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,640
He's okay.

301
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,328
Are you kidding me?

302
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:50,820
I'm fine.

303
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,680
I'm fine. Look!

304
00:27:58,752 --> 00:27:59,881
Dou Dou!

305
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:01,500
Bawan!

306
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,436
- Bawan. 
 - Bawan.

307
00:28:03,436 --> 00:28:05,300
Doudou, my name is Yang Bawan. Don't forget to find me.

308
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,904
Bawan.

309
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:14,601
- Bawan. 
 - W-What's going on?

310
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,148
Let me out.

311
00:28:25,192 --> 00:28:26,816
Yang Bawan.

312
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:29,881
- Bawan. 
 - Yang Bawan.

313
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:32,021
- Yang Bawan. 
 - Bawan.

314
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:35,400
Bawan, are you okay?

315
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,461
Yang Bawan.

316
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:42,741
Bawan, you have to be all right. Yang Bawan.

317
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,021
Yang Bawan.

318
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:48,900
Don't be a hypocrite.

319
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,200
If it weren't for your delay, Bawan wouldn't fail.

320
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:56,721
Why is it my fault? Why is it my fault?

321
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:58,601
Yang Bawan failed only to save you.

322
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:00,920
Don't attempt to twist logic.

323
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,320
- Dou Dou, Dou Dou. 
 - No, no.

324
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,580
Don't you understand it yet?

325
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:09,001
If no one wasted time, no one would be lost.

326
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,061
If each one of us were to rewind it properly,

327
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:19,640
then the toy train would be here when the time expired.

328
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:28,921
In this case, the one who would explode is the clown.

329
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:33,388
Everyone, the broadcast did not announce the end of the game.

330
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:35,201
Actually, the game is simple.

331
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:38,460
As long as we trust each other, we can definitely pass.

332
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,321
We just have to calm down and not make any mistakes.

333
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,430

334
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:57,640
 Please approach the card slot and pick your cards.

335
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,901
 Enter the cabin and get ready for the second round.

336
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,561
Are we still playing?

337
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:09,121
If we don't keep playing, we can't save the others

338
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:11,861
and we cannot leave either.

339
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,372
Brother Qiang.

340
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,200
Take the cards.

341
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,450

342
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:29,440
It's a clown.

343
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,981
As long as the toy train explodes at that spot,

344
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:46,756
we'll all be safe, won't we, Chun Yu?

345
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:55,821
 Game: Blow Me Up.

346
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:56,801
 Second round.

347
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:57,940
 Time: 100 seconds.

348
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,001
 Game rules:

349
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,160
 blow me up,

350
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,200
 then the player who failed in the first round gets rescued,

351
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,921
 and everyone passes.

352
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,181
 If I don't get blown up,

353
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:08,381
 the two players who failed enter the elimination house together

354
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,601
 for the final elimination.

355
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:13,941
 The winner and other players pass the game.

356
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:15,621
Bawan is not dead.

357
00:32:15,621 --> 00:32:17,961
If we can blow up the clown, we can save him.

358
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:21,061
B-Bawan can still be saved.

359
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:25,281
Bawan can still be saved.

360
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,280
 The game begins.

361
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,810

362
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,640

363
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:18,404
Ten seconds.

364
00:33:26,861 --> 00:33:29,620
 The toy train left car seven in ten seconds.

365
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,340
 From Chun Yu's cabin to Dou Dou's 25 seconds.

366
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,736
 From Dou Dou's cabin to Wenya's, 40 seconds.

367
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:36,061
 At exactly 100 seconds,

368
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:39,740
 the toy train will enter cabin 7 and will explode.

369
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,040

370
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,280

371
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,020

372
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,750

373
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,990

374
00:34:16,741 --> 00:34:18,961
Only eight seconds?

375
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:20,681
Time has advanced.

376
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:22,592
Eight seconds.

377
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:31,341
No matter what happens,

378
00:34:31,341 --> 00:34:34,041
I will be safe. I will be safe.

379
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,976
I will be safe.

380
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,990

381
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,070

382
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,820

383
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:02,381
 The toy train is faster.

384
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,181
How did it reach me so quickly?

385
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,290

386
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,600
Dou Dou.

387
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,140
Don't be distracted.

388
00:35:30,472 --> 00:35:31,400
 Dou Dou!.

389
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,321
 Dou Dou, my name is Yang Bawan. Don't forget to find me.

390
00:35:34,321 --> 00:35:36,821
 She is such a special girl.

391
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:40,441
 So brave. So powerful.

392
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:46,521
 I'm looking forward to seeing her in the game.

393
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,910

394
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:11,721
The toy train is moving faster. It is impossible to count.

395
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:14,080
We can't blow up the clown.

396
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,541
 The toy train is speeding.

397
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,321
 Even if we cooperate well,

398
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:20,960
 the last spot the bomb explodes would not be Cabin 7,

399
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,240
 but is more likely to be…

400
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,220

401
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,261
 Dou Dou, don't panic.

402
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:44,896
I can't count anymore.

403
00:36:44,896 --> 00:36:46,841
What should we do?

404
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:55,601
 If I don't get blown up,

405
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:58,021
 the two players who failed to enter the elimination house together

406
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:01,220
 for the final elimination

407
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:05,080
 It seems there is still a chance in the Elimination House.

408
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,681
 I have to find a way to save Bawan.

409
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,824
I will go and save Bawan.

410
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,561
Brother Qiang.

411
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:11,760
Brother Qiang, what are you doing?

412
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,701
Brother Qiang, hurry up.

413
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:17,381
Time is almost up.

414
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,600
Brother Qiang, what are you doing?

415
00:38:27,861 --> 00:38:29,361
Qiang, rewind it.

416
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:32,300
Don't drag us down again, okay?

417
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,001
 You're a good buddy.

418
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:13,021
 As of today, I, Zhang Tianqiang, am your big brother.

419
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,240
 Then you have to cover for me in the game.

420
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:20,776
 As long as I am here,

421
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,952
 you will definitely be here with me.

422
00:39:22,952 --> 00:39:26,896
 My buddy. I will go save him myself.

423
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:21,400
 The time is up.

424
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,421
Brother Qiang seems to be bad,

425
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:48,420
but unexpectedly, in the end, he is quite cool.

426
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,161
We don't know what they will face next.

427
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:54,700
I hope they will both do well.

428
00:41:57,821 --> 00:42:00,400
But he said this is the final elimination,

429
00:42:03,341 --> 00:42:06,920
which means between the two,

430
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,521
only one person can…

431
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,400

432
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:48,380

433
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:52,959
