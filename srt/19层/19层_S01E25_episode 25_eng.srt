1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040

2
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:56,759

3
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,703

4
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,540
 I just didn't want to let you down.

5
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,960
 Mom, I can do it. Look.

6
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,699
 All these years I've never been myself,

7
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,240
 I've already paid the price with my leg.

8
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,859
 I won't let you crush another child with your dreams.

9
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:27,260
 She chose this path herself.

10
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,928
Mom.

11
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,012
Have a seat.

12
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,839
You have a classmate, named Yang Bawan.

13
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,940
Yes.

14
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,599
He's my classmate.

15
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,120
We're good friends, and we hang out every day.

16
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,399
So what?

17
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,819
Mom, this isn't a fencing hall.

18
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,360
I haven't been fencing for a long time.

19
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,279
Do you have to control my every move?

20
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,699
Yesterday afternoon,

21
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,919
your classmate, Yang Bawan, came to the fencing hall,

22
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,759
holding a prop sword that he borrowed from some troupe.

23
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,660
He looked like he wanted to challenge me.

24
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,660
Sounds like something he would do.

25
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,060
He was trembling all over,

26
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,219
but still stuttered out a shout at me.

27
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:55,480
"Auntie, you made a mistake."

28
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,000
"Auntie, you made a mistake."

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,380
"You made a huge mistake."

30
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,820
I almost ripped a hole in him with the foil.

31
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,200
At that moment,

32
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,139
he brought this out.

33
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,552
You were very focused.

34
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:33,979
It's very difficult for you to make a layup,

35
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,319
but you still tried hard and never gave up,

36
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,839
just like when you practiced fencing.

37
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,800
Just like me.

38
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,700
The only difference is that you smile

39
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,736
and you look very happy.

40
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:57,400
Xiaoqin.

41
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:03,359
I shouldn't have forced my vision on you,

42
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,919
which would only increase your pain.

43
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,000
From now on,

44
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,220
just be yourself.

45
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,564
Mom.

46
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,260
As for your sister, she is still young,

47
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,539
and doesn't know what she truly loves yet.

48
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,719
So she needs to keep practicing with me.

49
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,419
In the future,

50
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,980
I'll let her choose between guitar and fencing.

51
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,696
Really?

52
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:51,859
I'm leaving. No need to see me off.

53
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,800
Although you no longer practice fencing,

54
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,759
the school is not far from the fencing hall.

55
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,100
You can still visit often

56
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,920
to see your sister

57
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,920
-  and…  
 - I know, Mom.

58
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,970

59
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,040

60
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,540
Didn't she ask me to meet?

61
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,136
Where is she?

62
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,596
What happened?

63
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,220
Yang Bawan.

64
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,640
Why did you do it?

65
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,716
Who told you to find my mom?

66
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

67
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,980
P-Please let me explain.

68
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,340
T-That day in the cafeteria, the day the seed sprouted,

69
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,820
your sister came to school looking for you, and saw us together,

70
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,040
so she told me about your mom.

71
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,020
I was worried about you, so I went to see your mom.

72
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,540
Sorry, sorry, Xiaoqin, I shouldn't…

73
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,520
Come on! Look at that!

74
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,248
What's wrong?

75
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:51,020
What are you looking at?

76
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,540
Yang Bawan, thank you.

77
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,299
I-I…

78
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,464
I thank you too.

79
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,360

80
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,280
Senior Gao.

81
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,639
Thank you for coming.

82
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,440
It's no big deal.

83
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,620
I'll show you.

84
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,100
 19th Floor.

85
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,480
 A technology that will change the future.

86
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,360
 - An unprecedented sense of freedom.  
 - Wait.

87
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,980
 An unparalleled authentic experience.

88
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,699
 The most immersive, cutting-edge technology.

89
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:40,619
 The most thrilling and exciting journey.

90
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,560
Senior Gao. This is a new game that has just been released.

91
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,360
You need to wear their VR Headset to play.

92
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,436
We are all looking forward to it.

93
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:57,280
Go on.

94
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,620
What are you doing? Drop your phone.

95
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,439
One more.

96
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,859
It's okay, they are…

97
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:04,859
What's this?

98
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:08,120
19th Floor, the newly released game. It is so interesting.

99
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,100
Come on.

100
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,580
 - The most thrilling and exciting journey.  
 - Not bad.

101
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,792
Let me take a look.

102
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,000
 Once you try this VR headset from Tianji Science and Technology,

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,240
 you can download the 19th Floor app for free

104
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,359
 and be a part of this amazing journey

105
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,660
 that transcends common sensory experiences of sight and sound

106
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,900
 to touch, smell, and even taste.

107
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,380
 A full public beta of 19th Floor will be released in ten days.

108
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,320
 An unprecedented gaming feast is about to begin.

109
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,180
- Old Gao. 
 - You are here.

110
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,860
Where's Chun Yu?

111
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,704
I didn't ask her to join us.

112
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,820
We shouldn't disturb Chun Yu right now.

113
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,139
Chun Yu looks fine,

114
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:11,759
but she must be sad because of her dad.

115
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,080
Don't bother her at this time.

116
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,420
Everyone, the game is now fully promoted.

117
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,340
The public beta starts in ten days.

118
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,639
I am afraid many people will be in danger.

119
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,519
What should we do?

120
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,400
If we anger Yan Mingliang, Uncle Chun and our friends inside will be in great danger.

121
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,000
Besidew, we should give Uncle Chun more time.

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,459
Once he's saved everyone, we'll call the police immediately.

123
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:42,900
What if Uncle Chun isn't successful by the official release?

124
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:47,240
We have to save them before the game launches.

125
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,699
Do you still remember the photo frame on Yan Mingliang's desk?

126
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:55,060
The frame has a photo of a young girl.

127
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,340
 I didn't expect that you guys would pull off such a move.

128
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,660
Now that you mention it, I do remember.

129
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,859
It must be his daughter.

130
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:14,180
This morning, I searched online and found this video.

131
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:20,860
 The building I'll be exploring today is very famous. It's over there.

132
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,879
 Building 19?

133
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:30,059
Perhaps we can start from here.

134
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,350

135
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,200

136
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,280
Come on. Scan the code to pay.

137
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,580
Scan the code to pay.

138
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,524
Scan the code to register.

139
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:55,740
Don't push me.

140
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,880
I've scanned it, give me one.

141
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,539
Alright, no problem.

142
00:11:58,539 --> 00:11:59,759
Just a moment, here's one for you.

143
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,856
Okay, thank you.

144
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:02,880
Aren't you that…

145
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,236
I've registered. Hurry and get me one.

146
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:06,540
Just hold on.

147
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,020
You can all get one, no need to rush.

148
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,700
Why am I here?

149
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,380
 Dear player, if you don't like this place,

150
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,399
 we have various other scenes available for you.

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,380

153
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,759

155
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,680

What about "Joyful Circus" or "Abandoned Factory"?

159
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,999
 Sorry, no related scene found.

160
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,940
What?

161
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,379
Hello, we want to see President Yan.

162
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,640
Do you have an appointment?

163
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,280
Please tell President Yan Gao Xuan and his friends are here.

164
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,396
We have something important to discuss with him.

165
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:24,339
Sorry. If you don't have the appointment, President Yan won't see you.

166
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,539
- Please… 
  - Let them in.

167
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,980
Yes, President Yan.

168
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,899
President Yan agreed to see you. Please follow me.

169
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:33,460
Open the door.

170
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,650

171
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:47,340
Hello, President Yan.

172
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,379
I didn't expect you would come to see me.

173
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,840
Why is one person missing?

174
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,060
Where's Chun Yu?

175
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,819
Chun Yu has other things to attend to.

176
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:00,060
We would like to talk to you first.

177
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,279
I know what you are going to say

178
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,499
but sorry, rules are rules.

179
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,320
I won't let anyone go.

180
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:19,260
President Yan, I remember you saying you made the 19th Floor

181
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,019
to create a world full of thrills and excitement

182
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,659
and a timeless masterpiece. Is that right?

183
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:28,312
Of course.

184
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,419
Still, that's not what you really want, is it?

185
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,060
What are you saying?

186
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:41,940
Perhaps you are an excellent businessman,

187
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,540
but you may not qualify as a father.

188
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:54,179
 This is the legendary haunted house.

189
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:57,119
 Actually, it's really dark in here.

190
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,100
 I do feel a chill running through my bones.

191
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,680
 To be honest, I'm a little scared right now.

192
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,004
 However, I'm Qi Qi the Kid, so I'm not afraid.

193
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,919
 It's just a piece of rotten wood.

194
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,320
 I'm not afraid. Qi Qi keep going.

195
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,479
 Let's keep moving on.

196
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,639
 The person I'm waiting for is not online yet.

197
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,719
 Never mind. Let me start with a challenge.

198
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,180
 I'm going to climb up on that beam.

199
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,672
Stop it.

200
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,360
Stop it.

201
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:49,759
Since you all know,

202
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,959
there's nothing more to say.

203
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,360
I just want to punish them,

204
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,019
make them feel fear and helplessness.

205
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,880
 This is the hallway of Microtech.

206
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,420
 Do you want to take a look at the office?

207
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,760
 Sure.

208
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,900
 This is my dad's office.

209
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,356
 Okay, I know.

210
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:15,220
 - Come on in.  
  - Qi Qi.

211
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,252
 No filming.

212
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:20,340
 No filming in here.

213
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,368
 See you tonight.

214
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:25,880
 Qi Qi, I have a meeting coming up.

215
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,700
 You can walk around,

216
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,199
 but remember, no photos or videos.

217
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:35,040
 Everything here is classified.

218
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,000
 You should watch my live stream when you are fee. It's fun.

219
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,439
 Sure, I'll watch it when I can.

220
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,099
 It starts at 9:00 p.m. sharp.

221
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,536
 Okay.

222
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:47,840
 - Dad, wait. 
 -  What is it?

223
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,320
 Let's take a photo.

224
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,876
 Okay.

225
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:56,420
 Come on.

226
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,000
 Three, two, one.

227
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,280
 Cheese.

228
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,340

229
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:32,810
 President Yan.

230
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,350
 President Yan. President Yan.

231
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:38,320
 Don't panic.

232
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,068
 Something's happened.

233
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,579
That day, provoked and urged by those people,

234
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,799
Qi Qi walked to the rotten beams on the haunted house's roof.

235
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,280
 See?

236
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,799
 I made it.

237
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,760
 All right! Now I'll show you how brave I am.

238
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:48,220
 The blood looks so real.

239
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,659
 These days, the hosts really go the extra mile.

240
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:52,280
 My fans.

241
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,679
 This doesn't seem like an act.

242
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,959
 Is she really hurt?

243
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,539
 I thought she's a host showing her pretty face.

244
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,939
 What is she doing this late at night? This isn't fake.

245
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:13,892
 I… really…

246
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:15,668
 feel bad…

247
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:17,459
 Save me.

248
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:19,300
 This is amazing!

249
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,700
 She's doing all she can for the rankings.

250
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,719
 Maybe we should call an ambulance.

251
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:26,096
 Save me.

252
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:30,700
 These female hosts today are trying hard to become famous.

253
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:36,680
 Some rich guy sends her a gift to do this more often.

254
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:41,628
These people,

255
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,539
all those bastards were just watching like it was a joke.

256
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,219
No one tried to save her.

257
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,919
My daughter's blood

258
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,120
just drained away like that.

259
00:20:57,099 --> 00:21:01,440
All who watched her die without helping her deserve death.

260
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:07,172
Every one of them must be punished.

261
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:10,500
No, not really.

262
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:14,540
Later, I checked everything.

263
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,139
Actually, someone called the police,

264
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:21,600
but the ambulance was in very heavy traffic.

265
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,879
Doctors and nurses got out of the vehicle and ran.

266
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:27,599
There's a nurse who's been hit by a car,

267
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,080
but still went on despite her injuries.

268
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,699
Also a boy, who saw it all on his classmate's phone,

269
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:36,120
and went immediately to Building 19 to save your daughter.

270
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:39,600
Did he save my daughter?

271
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,519
They were too late, but they all did their best.

272
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,480
President Yan.

273
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,180
This world is not insensitive.

274
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,439
There are still many good people.

275
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:03,120
Please stop all this.

276
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,100
Don't punish the whole world for the dark part.

277
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,296
It's a pity there is too little light.

278
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:20,120
I must sweep away the darkness. All of it.

279
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,652
See the guests out.

280
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,180
Please, everyone.

281
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:42,936
Let's go.

282
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:05,912
Qi Qi.

283
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,959
Trust me.

284
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,219
I will definitely make them pay.

285
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:33,428
Old Gao.

286
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:38,940
What's the matter, Xiaoqin?

287
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,160
Old Gao, what should we do?

288
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,868
What else?

289
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:50,280
Let's go back to the game and save Uncle Chun and the others.

290
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,539
No.

291
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,240
You just removed the chips and escaped danger.

292
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,028
You can't take any more risks.

293
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,320
Old Gao, I support Xiaoqin.

294
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,040
If Uncle Chun can take risks for us,

295
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,019
why can't we take risks for others?

296
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:09,208
I agree.

297
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,459
Either way, if you go, I'll go.

298
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:24,400
Okay.

299
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,039
We are no longer the same people who went into the storm.

300
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,840
Hello, President Nian.

301
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,972
Grandma.

302
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,800
Xiao Yu, you're finally back. Come take a look.

303
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,940
Check the handwriting to see if it's the same.

304
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,880
I got a delivery today from Mr. Lin,

305
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,460
the chef from your college.

306
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,580
Except these fruits and vegetables, there's this letter.

307
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,400
He's been missing for so long, and suddenly sent a letter.

308
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,000
The thing is, he asked Uncle Lin to hand it over.

309
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,599
Maybe you should ask Uncle Lin about it.

310
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,232
Uncle Lin...

311
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,356
Uncle Lin, might not know either.

312
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:38,179
He just handed it over.

313
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:39,659
Grandma, don't be anxious.

314
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,920
I can't. I am not a fool.

315
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,280
Anyway, this is your dad.

316
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,820
First, check what's written in the letter.

317
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,176
Take a look.

318
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:57,620
Hurry up.

319
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,880
What does it say?

320
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,068
It's okay.

321
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,360
Don't worry. Look, it's fine.

322
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,108
- Really? 
 - Really.

323
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,312
Well, I'm going back to school now. I have things to do.

324
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:25,380
Wait.

325
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:30,832
Xiao Yu.

326
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:34,339
These are dumplings Uncle Lin made a few days ago.

327
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:37,479
I cooked some for you. Take them.

328
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,584
Xiao Yu.

329
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,060
All these years, no matter what you've done,

330
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,500
I've never said a word,

331
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,539
because I know you're careful and cautious.

332
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,348
Actually,

333
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,639
I don't ask for much.

334
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,660
I just hope you are safe and sound.

335
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,668
Well…

336
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,740
no matter what happens,

337
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,919
whatever obstacles you encounter, you must eat.

338
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,752
 Chun Yu.

339
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,712
 I hope this letter finds you well.

340
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:58,339
 I am writing this letter to tell you

341
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,559
 that I remember everything about you

342
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,699
 and your mom.

343
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:10,639
 The first day I met your mom

344
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,400
 was while I was giving a presentation on stage

345
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,259
 and your mom came to interview me.

346
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,580
 I stuttered and was nervous,

347
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,380
 which made her smile.

348
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,119
 It was the most beautiful smile I've ever seen in my life.

349
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:33,904
 Later, we fell in love

350
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:36,139
 and then we got married,

351
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:38,419
 and had you.

352
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,519
 I remember the day you were born,

353
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,719
 I held you in my arms, full of joy.

354
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:48,099
 3.38 kilograms.

355
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,359
 I remember the first time you grabbed my thumb

356
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,400
 and wouldn't let go.

357
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,439
 I remember the first time you called me dad,

358
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:01,319
 and tears blurred my face.

359
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,180
 I remember all these.

360
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,280
 But I am a clumsy dad.

361
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:12,199
 I don't know how to express my love

362
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:16,179
 or balance work and family.

363
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:20,460
 So all this led to…

364
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,360
 This morning, I went to see your mother.

365
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,019
 I explained to her all this little by little,

366
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:38,844
 but she…

367
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:42,999
 She wouldn't listen anymore.

368
00:29:48,256 --> 00:29:52,799
 I had wasted too much time in my life.

369
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,739
 Due to my work,

370
00:29:54,739 --> 00:30:00,360
 I will end up hurting you, even your friends.

371
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,028
 Rest assured.

372
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:07,819
 I will definitely save Qing You and Brother Qiang.

373
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:10,940
 I will succeed,

374
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:14,540
 because I still want to see you through college,

375
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,340
 attend your graduation ceremony,

376
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,560
 see you find a job and fall in love.

377
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,599
 And then on your wedding day,

378
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,960
 I'm going to escort you personally

379
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,180
 and entrust you into his hands.

380
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,668
 But… my girl,

381
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:36,339
 even if I don't succeed,

382
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,619
 no matter what happens,

383
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:43,860
 you have to take care of yourself.

384
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,939
 You are the smartest, the cutest, the bravest

385
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:55,239
 the kindest, the strongest child.

386
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,819
 You are my most beloved person.

387
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
 Dad.

388
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:00,640
 Dad, I want to put this inside.

389
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,400
 Okay, I'll make a lucky dumpling for Chun Yu.

390
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,600
 Come on.

391
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,120
 I'm watching you, no cheating.

392
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,144
 No cheating. Look.

393
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,739
 Those who eat the lucky dumplings

394
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:20,460
 will surely get what they want.

395
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:00,919
You are here.

396
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,252
President Nian.

397
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:08,680
Chun Yu, how about giving him a few more days?

398
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,219
I can't wait any longer, he's my dad.

399
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,239
All right, let's talk inside.

400
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:11,859
Why are you all here?

401
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,700
We all decided to go back to 19th Floor with you

402
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,640
and help Uncle Chun save everyone.

403
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,740
No way.

404
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,399
Everything started because of my dad

405
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:33,460
and you are all victims.

406
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,499
I cannot let you take more risks.

407
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:38,119
Yan Mingliang is the real culprit.

408
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Uncle Chun just wanted to stop him.

409
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,220
He is a victim too.

410
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,800
- But… 
 - Chun Yu, enough.

411
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,940
Just tell us if we're good partners and teammates or not.

412
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,999
That's right, Chun Yu. We are the best partners and teammates.

413
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,600
Just get to it.

414
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,120
Chun Yu, don't forget, I am a warrior in the game.

415
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,119
You can't do without me.

416
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,559
Thank you, everyone.

417
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,220
All right. Since the decision has been made, let's get started.

418
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:22,219
At present, the new VR headset released by Tianji

419
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:25,359
corresponds only to the experience scenes.

420
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,779
The real game will be launched nine days later.

421
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:34,299
So the only way to get to the real 19th Floor

422
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:36,940
is through your old headsets.

423
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,499
What I am injecting now

424
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:43,160
are the chips removed the day before yesterday.

425
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,419
I'll ask you one last time.

426
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:50,620
Are you sure you want to enter 19th Floor?

427
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,336
Get ready.

428
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,260
There's one thing I want to tell you.

429
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,419
We can't access backstage from here.

430
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:13,139
The headset can only be used to enter the game,

431
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,660
but I can't help you with anything here.

432
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,660
President Nian, you've already helped us a lot.

433
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,220
We're all familiar with the interior.

434
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,199
Just follow the plan.

435
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,320
Once you are in, find a way to the entrance of Ultimate Space.

436
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,539
Although I can't help you over here,

437
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,940
I did make some improvements to the headsets.

438
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,859
If something happens to you in there,

439
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,380
just press on the back of the head here.

440
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,200
Then you can exit the game and return instantly to reality.

441
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,039
Are you ready?

442
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,130

443
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:51,090

444
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:55,680
