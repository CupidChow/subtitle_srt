1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,030

2
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:56,704

3
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:59,676

4
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:06,034
 Of all these figurines, the doppelgängers are the most powerful.

5
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:08,414
 Let's work with Chun Yu to lure them away separately,

6
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:11,733
 and take them down one by one.

7
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:17,760
I'll leave this one for you.

8
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,454
Brother, I'm really sorry.

9
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:28,074
We may look alike, but our perspective is different.

10
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,984
Do it!

11
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:18,613
Two of them at once. It's trickier.

12
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:20,214
It's fine. It's six versus two.

13
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:21,894
We still have the upper hand

14
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:24,894
and those two are the weakest.

15
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:38,068
Get up.

16
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:43,314
How come the two weakest turned out so fierce?

17
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:46,173
Guys, we should get going.

18
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:49,413
Brother Gao, can we rest for a while?

19
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:51,094
I'm exhausted.

20
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,674
We were very loud.

21
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:54,833
If we don't leave now, it'll be too late.

22
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:08,596
Be careful.

23
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:10,613
Oh no, we are doomed.

24
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:12,313
Now what?

25
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:14,813
What do we do? We must fight them!

26
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,068
What do we do?

27
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,824
Chun Yu.

28
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:01,172
Let's go.

29
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:29,032
 Chun Yu.

30
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:32,044
Chun Yu.

31
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,914
 Chun Yu, wake up.

32
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:42,752
 Chun Yu.

33
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,034
 Chun Yu, wake up.

34
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:32,854
 The evil spirits have been eliminated. Level up.

35
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:10,204
A'Yong.

36
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:12,934
A'Yong.

37
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:17,894
Bawan, it's time for class.

38
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:20,620
Be quiet.

39
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:27,420
I was playing games all night. Let me sleep.

40
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,134
Fine, I'll leave you alone.

41
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:52,054
 Chun Yu, why did you lock me inside?

42
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:54,053
 Qing You.

43
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:59,954
 Do you see? Being defenseless and obedient didn't save you.

44
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:02,154
 Will you continue being a coward?

45
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:04,814
 Will you continue relying on someone else?

46
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:08,394
 Come on. Get stronger with me.

47
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:12,734
 Conquer your weakness. Defeat yourself.

48
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:17,314
 Let me out! Is anybody here?

49
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:20,113
 Let me out.

50
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:30,176
 Chun Yu.

51
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:34,812
 Chun Yu!

52
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:38,294
 I knew you wouldn't abandon me.

53
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,694
 I knew you would come.

54
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:47,174
 I didn't abandon you.

55
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,593
 Why did you betray me?

56
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:58,533
 No, I didn't. We are best friends.

57
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:01,894
 Why would I betray you? I didn't.

58
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,793
 Best friends?

59
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:09,073
 And you sent me to die?

60
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,876
 No, I didn't.

61
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,724
 No, I didn't.

62
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,893
 I didn't, Chun Yu. I didn't.

63
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:46,894
What is your problem? Why the heck did you scream?

64
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:49,334
I-I'm sorry.

65
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:53,853
I was almost done with my makeup. Seriously.

66
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:56,034
Did you have a nightmare?

67
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,934
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

68
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:04,993
Come on. If you're not sleeping well,

69
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,973
take some sleeping pills, okay?

70
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:10,234
Seriously! A few pills won't kill you.

71
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:12,814
Look what you did to me.

72
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:15,974
Whatever she decides, it's not your business.

73
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:17,554
Haven't you ever had nightmares?

74
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:20,814
Did I complain when you woke up screaming when school started?

75
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:23,194
Come on, I'm the victim here.

76
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:25,713
Why is this my fault?

77
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:29,853
You're a victim indeed.

78
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,936
I-I'm sorry. Please stop fighting.

79
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:37,014
It's all my fault.

80
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:38,848
It's okay.

81
00:13:46,414 --> 00:13:49,313
Why did the chat group explode this morning?

82
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:52,334
It must be some big gossip.

83
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,564

84
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:55,668

85
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,288

86
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,872
Qing You.

87
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:05,832
Check this out.

88
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:18,773
 - Give her a taste of her own medicine. 
 - Unbelievable.

89
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:21,874
 So cold-blooded. Outrageous.

90
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:24,614
 - Poor kitty. 
 - What's wrong with her?

91
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,713
 Karma is going to get her! What a disgrace!

92
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:27,893
Oh my God!

93
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:28,928
 She should be arrested.

94
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:31,034
 - She is so brutal. 
 - She may start killing people.

95
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:32,574
 She doesn't deserve to be a human.

96
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:33,874
 The kitty did nothing wrong.

97
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,054
 Yeah, that's right!

98
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,974
 There will be karma.

99
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,753
It may be fabricated.

100
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,674
No way!

101
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:46,133
On the first day of school, someone said she was cold-hearted and violent.

102
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:48,074
They went to the same high school.

103
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:52,014
That's right. He also said she's always armed.

104
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:54,694
Don't you remember? On the first day,

105
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,994
she had a hammer in her bag.

106
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:59,194
I had nightmares at the time

107
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:02,394
because I was afraid she would strike me at night.

108
00:15:04,094 --> 00:15:07,294
No, I'm switching dorms.

109
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:10,834
Go ahead. It'll be more spacious without you.

110
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:14,673
Seriously? Are you picking on me again?

111
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:19,674
Fine, whatever. I'll share it in my fan group.

112
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:23,774
What are you doing? This is my phone. Give it back!

113
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:26,153
Retract your post.

114
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:36,076

115
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:46,414
Is it… true?

116
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,744
Here.

117
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:11,453
Seriously?

118
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:15,374
Everybody bullies me.

119
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:54,836
A’Yong.

120
00:16:57,493 --> 00:17:01,553
All right. Now you don't even answer.

121
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,892
Do you want a banana?

122
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:13,474
It's your favorite.

123
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:24,434
Well done. You're really something.

124
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:37,274
It tastes good. Are you sure you don't want a bite?

125
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:57,184
A’Yong.

126
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,293
Why aren't you waking up?

127
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:06,554
Will you wake up or not?

128
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:17,634
   .

129
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,214

130
00:18:20,214 --> 00:18:23,168

131
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,736

132
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,174
Auntie, that one.

133
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:48,830
Buns please.

134
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,950
And two eggs.

135
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:57,594
Auntie, where is that Uncle?

136
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:01,594
Old Lin? He didn't make breakfast today.

137
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:03,552
Okay, thanks, Auntie.

138
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,614
Why so little food?

139
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,414
Why do you care?

140
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:19,434
You're still growing. You should eat more.

141
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:21,214
Otherwise, you may get sick.

142
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:23,933
Not before you do.

143
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,813
 What's your name?

144
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:33,632
 My name is Dou Dou.

145
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:42,594
Did you really get sick?

146
00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:44,894
Its love sickness.

147
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:46,094
Who is she?

148
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,694
Should I speak with her?

149
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:49,314
You can't.

150
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,134
Just tell me. What's her name?

151
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,720
Dou Dou.

152
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,533
 What's your name?

153
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,184
 Dou Dou.

154
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:03,328
Do you know her?

155
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,036
No.

156
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:10,614
I knew it. You can't possibly know her.

157
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:16,274
I met her in my dream.

158
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:47,328
Nan Xiaoqin, look at your eyes.

159
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:52,274
Why are her eyes sexy and twinkling and yours ordinary and dry?

160
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:53,773
Don't make me punch you.

161
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:55,553
Your eyes are soulless, and your face is dull.

162
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:58,574
I bet you'll die young.

163
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:02,600
Oh, come on.

164
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:08,374
I was joking. Why are you offended?

165
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:15,253
Hi, Mom. Are you here?

166
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:17,732
I'm at the canteen.

167
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:24,744
Go away.

168
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,960

169
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:04,054
What kind of mother is she? She won't even help her daughter?

170
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:13,472

171
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:15,264

172
00:22:15,264 --> 00:22:17,536

173
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,064

174
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:30,944
We're running late.

175
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:35,034
Go ahead, I have a bowel crisis.

176
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,360
All right.

177
00:22:49,388 --> 00:22:50,888

178
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:52,412

179
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,084

180
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,014
- Watch out. 
 - Sorry.

181
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:20,553
So shameless.

182
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:23,034
She's being obnoxious? After what she did?

183
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,454
What's wrong, Yao Yao?

184
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:26,713
She's the cold-hearted cat-killer.

185
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:29,053
Chun Yu, a freshman in Geriatric Rehabilitation.

186
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:31,833
Didn't you see the video? It went viral.

187
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,632
No, I didn't.

188
00:23:35,974 --> 00:23:37,556
Chun Yu.

189
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:42,493
What a small world.

190
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:45,412
I thought you were following Dr. Jia.

191
00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:50,013
With only a pen, it's hard to link him to Tianji and the 19th Floor.

192
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,454
Don't tell me you think he isn't linked to Tianji?

193
00:23:52,454 --> 00:23:54,293
Of course not.

194
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:56,594
It's just that we don’t have enough evidence.

195
00:23:56,594 --> 00:23:58,454
We were a little careless yesterday.

196
00:23:58,454 --> 00:24:01,533
I'm afraid it won't be easy to find evidence now.

197
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:05,654
I think A’Yong is still at Guangming Hospital.

198
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:09,454
With Dr. Jia there, A'Yong is still in danger.

199
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:11,293
We should transfer him.

200
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:13,833
All right, I'll take care of it.

201
00:24:15,493 --> 00:24:16,894
They are talking as if nothing has happened.

202
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:19,973
I guess this incident doesn't affect her at all.

203
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:49,414
Who is it?

204
00:24:49,414 --> 00:24:53,614
 It's me. Gao Xuan. How is A’Yong?

205
00:24:54,214 --> 00:24:55,994
He is still in a coma.

206
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,813
 I doubt he'll ever wake up.

207
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:00,013
It was days ago.

208
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:03,093
Even an alcohol intoxication should be over.

209
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:06,314
Yes, I seriously doubt this hospital's doctors.

210
00:25:06,314 --> 00:25:09,733
Listen, A'Qiang. I happen to know someone from a top hospital.

211
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,753
Let me contact them and get A’Yong transferred there.

212
00:25:12,753 --> 00:25:15,713
All right, that's great.

213
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:19,434
But remember. Don't say anything negative about Guangming Hospital.

214
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:23,473
Don't use statements like "your doctors aren't great" to avoid trouble.

215
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:27,374
Fine, I won't argue with them.

216
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:29,973
I do have a little EQ.

217
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:31,448
All right.

218
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:47,654
A’Yong, let's try another hospital in a few days.

219
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:51,794
You'll be fine. Hang in there.

220
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,020

221
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,932

222
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:04,493
It is possible their test result is inaccurate.

223
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:06,174
Let's try another hospital.

224
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:11,053
Xiaoqin, we've tried four hospitals.

225
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:14,253
It may sound cruel, but it's true.

226
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:17,434
Your leg may not recover completely.

227
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,774
No, mom, someday I'll be fine.

228
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,094
I'll get back on the piste. 
   (T/N: Play area for fencing)

229
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:24,794
You will teach me and I will be the champion.

230
00:26:25,573 --> 00:26:27,192
We'll see.

231
00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:49,934
Is there a newcomer?

232
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:53,593
Get in the car. I have to get back to training.

233
00:26:54,354 --> 00:26:57,014
It's okay. I'll let you get back to work.

234
00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:59,313
I'll take a cab.

235
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,674
I'm talking to you.

236
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:17,514
Why can't I get him transferred?

237
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:19,414
I've told you many times.

238
00:27:19,414 --> 00:27:21,534
A family member must sign the application.

239
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,974
My buddy has only one grandmother.

240
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,354
"Should I bring her here to sign it?"

241
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,874
Why can't you be more flexible?

242
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:29,373
We have regulations.

243
00:27:29,373 --> 00:27:31,574
Besides, the patient is still in a coma.

244
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:33,594
An irrational decision can be harmful.

245
00:27:33,594 --> 00:27:37,424
Irrational decision? It's irrational to keep him here.

246
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:40,614
What about Dr. Jia? He's the doctor in charge. Call him here.

247
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:43,693
Dr. Jia was here for graduate studies and the course has ended.

248
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:45,188
I don't care if he's here.

249
00:27:45,188 --> 00:27:47,740
Whatever. I have to transfer my buddy today.

250
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,874
Let me talk to the doctor.

251
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:51,014
Fine, hurry up.

252
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:52,473
By the way, sir.

253
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:55,253
Please pay the bill before the transfer.

254
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:57,860
The deposit has expired.

255
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,800

256
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,416

257
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:06,696
 That much?

258
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:13,908

259
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:26,316

260
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:30,474
 Boss, they seem to be alert.

261
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:33,893
 Zhang Tianqiang wants to transfer to another hospital.

262
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:35,493
I've made arrangements.

263
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:37,320
 Got it.

264
00:28:42,614 --> 00:28:46,854
Director Yan, there's one thing I don't understand.

265
00:28:46,854 --> 00:28:49,293
They have already entered the game.

266
00:28:49,293 --> 00:28:50,773
Why do we need a contract?

267
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:53,854
This world is governed by law, isn't it?

268
00:28:53,854 --> 00:28:56,234
I like playing by the rules

269
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,253
and being a law-abiding citizen.

270
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,728
Senior Brother.

271
00:29:05,728 --> 00:29:07,456
- Is the class over? 
 - Yes.

272
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,988
Any more classes?

273
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:11,254
I'm done for the morning.

274
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:13,154
Chun Yu, where are you going?

275
00:29:13,154 --> 00:29:15,112
The Student's Office.

276
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:17,868
The Student's Office?

277
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,234
Nian Sulan, you visit the Student Office often.

278
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:23,153
Do you know what happened to her?

279
00:29:23,153 --> 00:29:25,064
I have no idea.

280
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:29,094
Senior Brother, what did you call her again?

281
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,652
Chun Yu.

282
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:35,114
Somebody posted a video today with a girl named Chun Yu.

283
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:36,484
What video?

284
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,633
Let me find it.

285
00:30:04,374 --> 00:30:07,473
No. 188, East Tianhe Road.

286
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:10,872

287
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:23,893
Are all players of this game here today to sign the contract?

288
00:30:23,893 --> 00:30:27,894
They'll come on different days. It depends on when they started the game.

289
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:31,614
Are you going to sign a player named Dou Dou?

290
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:34,314
I can't disclose the players' information.

291
00:30:34,314 --> 00:30:35,874
Please wait here.

292
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:37,894
Feel free to enjoy the food and drinks in the self-service area.

293
00:30:37,894 --> 00:30:41,934
Then, follow the instructions of the staff to sign the contract.

294
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:47,164
That strict?

295
00:31:10,214 --> 00:31:13,053
Hello, are you Mr. Yang?

296
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:16,000
Please come with me.

297
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:21,694
C-Can we eat while we talk?

298
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:24,854
As you please. This way.

299
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:27,608
Take a seat.

300
00:31:30,293 --> 00:31:31,860
Mr. Yang.

301
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,053
First, let me explain the contract terms.

302
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:36,234
Sure.

303
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:37,773
After the first few levels of the trial,

304
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:41,294
I believe you've developed a deep understanding of the game.

305
00:31:41,294 --> 00:31:44,254
You've survived over 20 hours in our gamem

306
00:31:44,254 --> 00:31:47,214
and you qualify as an Experience Officer.

307
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:52,473
So whoever survives over 20 hours becomes an Experience Officer?

308
00:31:52,473 --> 00:31:54,594
Yes, once you become an Experience Officer,

309
00:31:54,594 --> 00:31:57,464
you'll get gifts and bonuses as you level up.

310
00:31:57,464 --> 00:32:01,013
Do you contact all those who survive over 20 hours?

311
00:32:01,013 --> 00:32:02,484
That's right.

312
00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:04,354
Do you know a player called Dou Dou?

313
00:32:04,354 --> 00:32:07,253
Who is she? Is she from my college?

314
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:10,814
I'm sorry, we can't disclose the players' information.

315
00:32:10,814 --> 00:32:14,333
Just tell me if she's here today.

316
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,794
She was my teammate in the game.

317
00:32:17,794 --> 00:32:19,953
Didn't you contact her?

318
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:22,920
I'm sorry.

319
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:28,134
Mr. Yang, if you don't have any other questions,

320
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:31,733
please sign the contract.

321
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:48,233
Actually, I do have a question.

322
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,944
I'm listening.

323
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:53,712
Can you tell me Dou Dou's real name?

324
00:32:53,714 --> 00:32:54,714
You don't need to tell me all her information.

325
00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:55,934
I will find her on my own.

326
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,733
I won't sell you out, okay?

327
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:01,713
I'm sorry, this is confidential.

328
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,574
We can't disclose any information on any player.

329
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:06,204
I'm so sorry.

330
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:10,153
Then I won't sign it.

331
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:14,596
Miss Nurse.

332
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:20,768
Well…

333
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:25,714
Do I have to pay the bill to transfer the patient?

334
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:28,314
Of course, this is the rule.

335
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:32,392
Help me out.

336
00:33:32,392 --> 00:33:34,054
Can you make an exception?

337
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,374
Rules are rules. Pay the bill before the transfer.

338
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:38,974
Come on, you're so pretty.

339
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:40,954
I bet you're sweet, too. Please help me.

340
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:44,274
Bed 13's vitals are off. Get a doctor.

341
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:49,134
- Which bed? 
 - Bed 13.

342
00:33:49,134 --> 00:33:50,374
Emergency aid for Bed 13.

343
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:52,124
A'Yong.

344
00:33:52,124 --> 00:33:55,400
Yong. Yong.

345
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,950
A'Yong. A'Yong.

346
00:33:57,954 --> 00:33:59,413
Let me see my buddy.

347
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,960
Wait outside. You can't come in.

348
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,494
- Hurry. 
 - I'm sorry.

349
00:34:02,494 --> 00:34:04,113
Doctor, check on my buddy!

350
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:06,754
Wait outside.

351
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:11,296
Prepare for defibrillation.

352
00:34:19,952 --> 00:34:24,196

353
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:41,354
Doctor…

354
00:34:41,354 --> 00:34:43,414
How's my buddy?

355
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,214
His vital signs have been stabilized.

356
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:46,674
However, further observation is still required.

357
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:48,774
We're getting him to the ICU.

358
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,574
To the ICU?

359
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,373
There is no need to panic.

360
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:57,654
If his vitals remain stable,

361
00:34:57,654 --> 00:35:00,593
we'll transfer him to a general ward soon.

362
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:05,694
If you have any questions, come to my office.

363
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:10,554
You said it was an alcohol intoxication.

364
00:35:10,554 --> 00:35:13,393
Why is he still sick?

365
00:35:13,393 --> 00:35:15,673
Why did he end up in ICU?

366
00:35:15,673 --> 00:35:21,073
The alcohol intoxication damaged his respiratory system

367
00:35:21,073 --> 00:35:24,793
and reached the neuronal membrane.

368
00:35:24,793 --> 00:35:28,013
Things don't look very promising.

369
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:35,554
Is it that bad? What can we do now?

370
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,313
I suggest we keep the patient in ICU for a few more days.

371
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:46,674
I heard you were going to transfer him.

372
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:48,934
You saw what happened.

373
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:51,214
The patient is not stable.

374
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:56,534
We cannot guarantee that nothing will go wrong.

375
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:03,233
All right, I see. Thank you, Doctor.

376
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:06,436
Wait.

377
00:36:06,436 --> 00:36:09,534
I heard you haven't paid the bill.

378
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,834
Don't forget that.

379
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:14,714
Also, the ICU will cost more than a general ward.

380
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,154
You should be prepared.

381
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:17,784
Okay.

382
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:32,244

383
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:35,808

384
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,660

385
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:58,814
 Check out what they're saying online.

386
00:36:58,814 --> 00:37:03,634
 Cold-hearted demon. Gen Z cruel cat-killer.

387
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:06,193
 Chun Yu, let me remind you.

388
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:11,333
 If we investigate, and it proves to be true, you'll be punished.

389
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:14,213
 Go ahead and investigate.

390
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:18,634
 - She should be expelled. 
 - So cruel!

391
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:20,294
 - Do they teach this at college? 
 - Torturing cats now?

392
00:37:20,294 --> 00:37:22,834
 - What next? 
 - Disgusting.

393
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,373
 College student?

394
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:27,694
 - She should be expelled! 
 - I bet she's an orphan.

395
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:30,374
 Young people today are so cruel.

396
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:31,974
 - What's going on? 
  - Who's going to marry her?

397
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:33,913
 Poor cat.

398
00:37:33,913 --> 00:37:36,834
 - I heard she was never a kind person. 
 - I went to high school with her.

399
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,613
 - She was cruel. 
 - They called her the Bully.

400
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:40,980
 - I heard she was a bully. 
 - Don't hurt the animals.

401
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,434
 - So cruel! Punish her. 
 - She got worse.

402
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:04,096

403
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,908

404
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,896

405
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,440

406
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:43,400

407
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,984
♫  I go from running  ♫
