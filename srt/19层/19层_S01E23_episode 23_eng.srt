1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,980

2
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:56,659

3
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,703

4
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,210
Mom, I came to see you.

5
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,740

6
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:32,507
Tell me,

7
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,327
why do all good things end so quickly?

8
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:46,947
I remember once

9
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,507
we had a period of brightness.

10
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:56,228
I think he loved us back then.

11
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:02,507
But after we came to Jiangning,

12
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:05,787
why did everything change?

13
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,268
 You leave early and return late every day.

14
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:09,288
 Do you care about your wife?

15
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:11,327
 Do you care about your child?

16
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,912
 Dad.

17
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:17,728
 Dad, please come back early.

18
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:23,768
 I will try.

19
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:33,828
♪  Happy birthday to you!  ♪

20
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:40,408
♪  Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!  ♪

21
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:44,308
♪  Happy birthday to you!  ♪

22
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:47,427
 Make a wish.

23
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:52,148
 I hope my dad can celebrate my next birthday with me.

24
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,590

25
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,227
 Silly child, your wish won't come true if you say it out loud.

26
00:04:58,227 --> 00:04:59,968
 It does not matter.

27
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,687
 We'll still celebrate without him, right?

28
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,960
 Chun Yu, cut the cake.

29
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,516
 Come on.

30
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:11,147
After you left,

31
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:14,968
even though I was extremely mad at him,

32
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:18,587
I got low grades intentionally,

33
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:21,407
and ignored him on purpose.

34
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:25,128
That's because I always had hope in my heart.

35
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:27,040
I thought…

36
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:31,347
I thought he might change.

37
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:38,707
Now I realize it's impossible.

38
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:43,728
He has lost his mind.

39
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:51,327
I'm sorry, Mom.

40
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,907
I shouldn't tell you this.

41
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:06,227
Because I know,

42
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:11,667
that even though the world has changed,

43
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:18,247
you won't change.

44
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:23,388
I often think,

45
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:29,548
that if you were still here,

46
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:37,227
you'd surely cherish me and love me.

47
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:38,940
Is that right?

48
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:44,388
Mom.

49
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:51,867
I'm really tired.

50
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,310

51
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,080

52
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,870

53
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,680

54
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,360

55
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,447
 Chun Yu, where are you?

56
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,547
 Chun Yu, can we meet and talk?

57
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:02,528
Chun Yu!

58
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:13,468
Uncle Lin.

59
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:15,808
Can we talk inside?

60
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:19,007
Of course. Please come in.

61
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,427
Uncle Lin, have a seat anywhere.

62
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:41,787
Uncle Lin, drink some water.

63
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:47,248
Uncle Lin, how did you know I live here?

64
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:48,508
It doesn't matter.

65
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:52,707
What matters are the things I am about to tell you.

66
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:54,988
All right, go ahead.

67
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,868
It's time for you to know everything.

68
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:03,707
Actually,

69
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:07,467
I am Mazzolini.

70
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:17,340
This way.

71
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:19,344
Here.

72
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:21,920
Everything is right here.

73
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:26,807
Following the rules can easily lead to mistakes.

74
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:29,067
I have been too careless.

75
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,500

76
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500

77
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,450

78
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,480

79
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,710

80
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,547
Maybe we should just leave.

81
00:11:25,547 --> 00:11:27,847
Give them some space.

82
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:29,928
You're becoming more perceptive.

83
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:32,668
Thanks to your teachings, Master Xiaoqin.

84
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:47,264
I haven't seen you all day.

85
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:49,052
Are you okay?

86
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,300
I'm fine.

87
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,664
I…

88
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:59,868
went to see my mom.

89
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:07,768
Chun Yu.

90
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:13,228
After we pass the level today, I'll explain everything, okay?

91
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,988
Explain what?

92
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,628
Mazzolini, myself, and everything I know.

93
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:12,988
Xiaoqin.

94
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:15,607
What? Do I look better in the game?

95
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:16,807
Am I not good looking in real life?

96
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,428
N-N-No, no.

97
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:21,448
You are good looking, both in the game and in real life.

98
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:24,488
You are beautiful, brave, righteous,

99
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:26,380
and kind to me.

100
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:29,747
Everything is true but the last one.

101
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:33,387
What is this?

102
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:37,200
Be careful.

103
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,128
Is your leg okay?

104
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:42,208
I'm okay. Y-You go ahead.

105
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,992
I'll catch up.

106
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,908
I'll take a look first and come find you later.

107
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:49,268
Be careful.

108
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:50,808
Okay.

109
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:59,587
 Chun Yu.

110
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,568
 Chun Yu.

111
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,228
 Chun Yu.

112
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:21,028
 Chun Yu.

113
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,508
 Chun Yu.

114
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,407
 You've grown up.

115
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,580
Mom.

116
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:13,208
I miss you so much.

117
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,908
 I miss you too.

118
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,887
 It's all right now.

119
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:28,128
 Everything's fine now.

120
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,307
 You, me, and Dad,

121
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:38,728
 we can be together as a family.

122
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:44,948
 From now on, we will never be separated again.

123
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,844
 Silly child,

124
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:08,387
 are you angry at your dad again?

125
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:11,107
 Don't be.

126
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:17,707
 Your father is the person who loves and cherishes you the most.

127
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:23,552
 That has never changed.

128
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,807
No.

129
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:41,368
Mom.

130
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,710
I know

131
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,000
you are not real.

132
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:01,240
My Mom

133
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,100
has already been gone for a long time.

134
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:09,107
 Silly child…

135
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:29,007
A-Aren't those just moths?

136
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,740
Don't you think they're much bigger than normal moths?

137
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,048
What happened?

138
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:35,387
She said there were moths here.

139
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:39,468
When we came in, I saw moths like these in the bomb shelter.

140
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:41,168
I think it has something to do with the game.

141
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,268
Yes, most likely.

142
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:44,356
Right.

143
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,128
Where is Chun Yu?

144
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:47,988
She is behind us, on the way.

145
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:49,888
Why didn't you stay with her?

146
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:51,608
Now, it's really dangerous.

147
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,332
I'll go find her.

148
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:58,616
Chun Yu.

149
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,344
Chun Yu.

150
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:08,052
Chun Yu.

151
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:12,756
Chun Yu.

152
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,464
Chun Yu.

153
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:20,564
Chun Yu.

154
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:25,116
I'll go this way.

155
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,168
Let's follow Uncle Lin, in case something happens.

156
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:31,716
Let's go.

157
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:34,627
Wait for me.

158
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:51,636
Chun Yu.

159
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:56,956
Danger!

160
00:18:57,948 --> 00:18:59,540
Chun Yu.

161
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,732
Chun Yu.

162
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,067
Chun Yu.

163
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:18,628
Chun Yu. Chun Yu.

164
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:20,128
Chun Yu.

165
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:23,088
Chun Yu, it's okay.

166
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,328
Don't be afraid.

167
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,988
I'm here.

168
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,568
Don't be afraid.

169
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,212
It's okay.

170
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:46,812
I know you've suffered a lot,

171
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:52,584
but rest assured, I'll always be here for you.

172
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,628
 Don't be afraid.

173
00:19:58,228 --> 00:19:59,996
 Don't be afraid.

174
00:20:03,908 --> 00:20:05,907
No matter what happens,

175
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:08,007
I'm not giving up on you.

176
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:19,568
Please, don't give up on yourself, okay?

177
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:38,187
What's okay about that?

178
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:45,608
It's so romantic and touching,

179
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,768
but what good can it do?

180
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
He said he would never give up on you.

181
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,827
Do you believe it, Chun Yu?

182
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:55,712
Shut up.

183
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:58,588
 Are you feeling guilty?

184
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:01,928
He doesn't even believe his own words.

185
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:05,228
Why would you believe such a story?

186
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:06,748
In this world,

187
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:09,648
love and affection

188
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:12,328
are like an impenetrable wall for a genius.

189
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:15,608
The only thing it would do is trap you.

190
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:18,448
What is the most important thing?

191
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:20,208
You are.

192
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,428
It's your freedom.

193
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:27,928
You are only your true self without the shackles of love and affection.

194
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:31,368
Take me and your mother for example.

195
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:36,247
Back then, I was trapped by her for a very long time.

196
00:21:36,247 --> 00:21:37,847
Then one day,

197
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:40,368
I became free.

198
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,608
Do you know which day that was?

199
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,648
I told you to shut up.

200
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:53,168
It was on that day, that afternoon.

201
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:55,807
Rain poured down from the sky,

202
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:58,156
and you were also in the car.

203
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:01,768
Crack, crack, with thunder and lightning.

204
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:04,928
 The cars were roaring and running.

205
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:07,328
 Suddenly, bang!

206
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:12,948
The whole world suddenly fell silent.

207
00:22:12,948 --> 00:22:15,087
In that very moment,

208
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:21,408
that impenetrable wall that bound me for years

209
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:23,408
had disappeared.

210
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,808
I was reborn.

211
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:34,227
Chun Yu.

212
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,128
Don't listen to his nonsense.

213
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:39,387
He's lying.

214
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:48,307
It was your birthday, wasn't it?

215
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:13,547
Chun Yu.

216
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:19,348
Chun Yu.

217
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:20,792
Chun Yu.

218
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:22,776
Chun Yu.

219
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:25,224
Chun Yu.

220
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:55,767
Chun Yu.

221
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:00,587
Chun Yu.

222
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:03,227
Chun Yu, this is not your true self.

223
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:05,288
Right now you feel angry and helpless,

224
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:07,047
but don't give up on yourself.

225
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:09,508
Everything is an illusion.

226
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:14,008
Chun Yu, stop.

227
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:15,604
Stop.

228
00:24:17,948 --> 00:24:20,388
 Chun Yu, stop.

229
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:22,408
 Stop, stop.

230
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:26,727
Why would you stop?

231
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:28,828
Chun Yu, you are already free.

232
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:30,488
Look!

233
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:33,788
The light is before us.

234
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:39,028
Isn't that what you want?

235
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:47,128
Chun Yu, go on.

236
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:50,268
Freedom is within reach.

237
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:57,188
Don't listen to his nonsense.

238
00:24:57,188 --> 00:25:00,768
Everything he said about your father is a lie.

239
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:02,827
It's not a lie.

240
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:07,108
The truth is often cruel. No one wants to hear it.

241
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:10,248
However, facts are facts. You can't change them.

242
00:25:10,248 --> 00:25:11,728
Don't listen to him.

243
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:14,608
He doesn't know how your father really thinks at all.

244
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,467
Who would know if not me?

245
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:19,267
Chun Yu, you have to use your own judgment.

246
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,568
Don't listen to his jabber.

247
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:22,688
Shut up. You don't know anything,

248
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,508
but I do.

249
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:25,808
I know everything, Child.

250
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:26,827
I know everything.

251
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:28,748
I remember all of it.

252
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:30,588
I see it before my eyes, Child.

253
00:25:30,588 --> 00:25:32,136
Because…

254
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:39,407
Old Gao, the door won't open.

255
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:40,667
What should we do?

256
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:43,888
We can't get inside, and we don't know what's going on.

257
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,067
Let's not panic.

258
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:52,928
I think as long as Uncle Lin is inside, Chun Yu will be fine.

259
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:56,387
Uncle Lin? What do you mean?

260
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:02,907
Actually, Uncle Lin in the game

261
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:06,308
is not the same Uncle Lin we know from school.

262
00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:08,648
Then who is he?

263
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:11,387
He is Chun Yu's…

264
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,087
I am your dad.

265
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:17,948
I am your dad, Child! I am your dad, Child!

266
00:26:37,268 --> 00:26:39,427
You're so good at making things up.

267
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:42,428
You're starting to say complete nonsense.

268
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:46,148
Chun Yu, this old man is obviously lying.

269
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:47,667
If he's not Old Lin,

270
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:50,787
then why did he choose to say it now and not earlier?

271
00:26:50,787 --> 00:26:52,788
I am not lying, Child.

272
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:54,788
I am just trapped in Old Lin's body.

273
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:58,247
 I dared not reveal my identity to protect you.

274
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:00,087
 Keep lying.

275
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:01,708
 If he really wanted to protect you,

276
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,907
 then why did he still let you play this game?

277
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:06,667
 Believe me, Child.

278
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:10,907
 Your date of birth is June 5th.

279
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:13,348
On the day you were born, it rained lightly,

280
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:16,228
so your mom named you Chun Yu.

281
00:27:16,228 --> 00:27:19,188
 Also, your mom's name is Zhou Xiaoting.

282
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:22,347
 We returned to Jiangning together.

283
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,688
Enough.

284
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:27,767
Even if you are Chun Yiming,

285
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:30,427
did I say anything wrong?

286
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:35,448
Why did you suddenly become such a loving father?

287
00:27:36,307 --> 00:27:39,208
Have you forgotten what you did before?

288
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,608
 Why did you return to Jiangning?

289
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:45,008
 Were you really trying to reunite Chun Yu with her grandma?

290
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:46,587
You only did it for yourself.

291
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:48,468
You bastard.

292
00:27:50,948 --> 00:27:53,928
Isn't all that followed, even the death of Chun Yu's mother,

293
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:57,027
- closely connected to you? 
 - Child.

294
00:27:57,027 --> 00:27:59,147
 Chun Yu, he's lying.

295
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:02,387
 Hasn't he lied to your mom enough?

296
00:28:40,992 --> 00:28:44,928
Chun Yu, you are free.

297
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:52,008
Chun Yu.

298
00:28:58,827 --> 00:29:01,028
Hold tight, Child.

299
00:29:01,028 --> 00:29:02,876
I'll pull you up.

300
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,572
I am begging you.

301
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,088
Let go of my daughter.

302
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:11,988
Just aim at me.

303
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:13,368
Don't hurt her, okay?

304
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:15,707
I am begging you.

305
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:18,608
Moths always fly toward the flames.

306
00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:22,328
She's already been possessed by a moth,

307
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,848
so she can't hear you at all.

308
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,268
How can I save her?

309
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:27,648
I am begging you.

310
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:30,308
Tell me! How can I save her?

311
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:33,787
Hang in there, Child.

312
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:35,727
It's actually very simple.

313
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:40,468
As long as the moth is on her, no one can stop her.

314
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:42,204
Unless…

315
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:46,468
Unless the moth is transferred to another host.

316
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:08,208
Hang in there.

317
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,468
I will pull you up.

318
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:12,184
Hang in there.

319
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:36,052
Child.

320
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:39,436
 I apologize to your mom.

321
00:31:39,436 --> 00:31:41,376
 I apologize to you.

322
00:31:42,432 --> 00:31:45,487
I can't undo the past,

323
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,887
 but I hope in the future,

324
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:51,028
you will live a good life.

325
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:48,120
 Uncle Lin.

326
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,488
Dad.

327
00:33:20,192 --> 00:33:21,916
Yan Mingliang.

328
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,187
You pretended to be Uncle Chun.

329
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:27,548
That's right.

330
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,907
This was all part of my plan.

331
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,448
Anyway, congratulations.

332
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:33,508
You've passed.

333
00:33:37,468 --> 00:33:39,128
Chun Yu.

334
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,192
Chun Yu.

335
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:10,468
You're awake.

336
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:15,308
Come on, take it slow.

337
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,432
Be careful.

338
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:27,688
Where is this?

339
00:34:28,547 --> 00:34:30,727
This is the safe house President Nian found for us.

340
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:33,148
The people from Tianji don't know about this place.

341
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:37,788
How long have I been unconscious?

342
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:42,627
This morning, Nan Xiaoqin and Xu Wenya exited the game.

343
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,448
They found you unconscious,

344
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:45,972
so they contacted me,

345
00:34:45,972 --> 00:34:48,268
and President Nian arranged this place for us.

346
00:34:50,408 --> 00:34:52,348
Don't overthink it. It's good that you're awake.

347
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:54,288
I'll pour you a glass of water.

348
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:02,888
Uncle Lin and Chun Yiming.

349
00:35:03,908 --> 00:35:06,247
What exactly is going on?

350
00:35:28,508 --> 00:35:30,400
Drink some water first.

351
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,148
I only recently discovered the whole truth, too.

352
00:35:48,964 --> 00:35:53,020
Yesterday afternoon, Uncle Lin suddenly came to see me.

353
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:56,892
 Uncle Lin.

354
00:35:58,227 --> 00:36:01,308
 It's time for you to know everything.

355
00:36:01,948 --> 00:36:03,776
 Actually,

356
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:07,747
 I am Mazzolini.

357
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,448
 You are Mazzolini?

358
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:15,608
 I'm also Chun Yiming,

359
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,768
 Chun Yu's father.

360
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,167
 After the accident,

361
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:28,628
 my relationship with my daughter had serious problems.

362
00:36:29,227 --> 00:36:33,788
 I tried to ease the tension and get close to her,

363
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:39,587
 but what made me feel hurt and helpless

364
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:42,727
 was that Chun Yu ignored me completely.

365
00:36:43,788 --> 00:36:45,948
 She didn't argue with me either,

366
00:36:45,948 --> 00:36:48,128
 she just ignored me.

367
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:50,148
 As though her father

368
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:55,007
 didn't exist at all.

369
00:36:58,408 --> 00:36:59,764
 Mom.

370
00:37:01,468 --> 00:37:05,028
 Chun Yu, I came to see you.

371
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:06,267
 Mom.

372
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:09,028
 Here is the ginseng protein powder I bought for you.

373
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:10,844
 It's especially good.

374
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:13,784
 Chun Yu.

375
00:37:14,468 --> 00:37:17,928
 This is your favorite tiramisu.

376
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:29,447
 Chun Yu, your homeroom teacher called me,

377
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:33,107
 and said your grades have been dropping unnaturally lately.

378
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,540
 I know that you're struggling with a problem,

379
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:42,100
 but…

380
00:37:43,868 --> 00:37:45,687
 I am talking to you.

381
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:48,667
 Can you stop playing the game for a while?

382
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,608
 Chun Yu.

383
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:54,707
 Chun Yu, give it to me.

384
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,107
 - Give it to me. 
 - Let go of her.

385
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,248
 - Let go of her. 
 - Chun Yu.

386
00:37:57,248 --> 00:37:58,828
 You let go of her.

387
00:37:58,828 --> 00:38:00,688
 Let go of her.

388
00:38:03,627 --> 00:38:07,548
 It's bad enough she lost her mom. What's wrong with playing games for a while?

389
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:11,288
 Let me tell you, this is not your lab.

390
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:16,828
 She is not your equipment, instrument, or container.

391
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:24,228
 Since Chun Yu wouldn't talk to me,

392
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:25,888
 I came with the idea

393
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:30,508
 to create a game with brain-computer interface technology.

394
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:34,067
 That way, I could perhaps communicate with Chun Yu.

395
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:41,308
 Half a year ago, we finished all the preparations.

396
00:38:41,308 --> 00:38:46,047
 On the test day, Yan Mingliang, who you have already met,

397
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:50,628
 project investor, and technical partner

398
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,508
 had the same day a serious family problem,

399
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:58,408
 but he still arrived at the lab on time to conduct the test.

400
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:31,480
 Mingliang.

401
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:37,648
 Should we take a break?

402
00:39:37,648 --> 00:39:38,668
 Why?

403
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:43,328
 Your family has suffered a lot. You should take a break.

404
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:44,747
 Old Chun.

405
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:48,868
 Now only work can distract me from the pain.

406
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,164
 Let's go.

407
00:39:51,164 --> 00:39:53,467
 I must keep going.

408
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,227
 Then go slow and be careful.

409
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,707
 It's all right.

410
00:39:57,707 --> 00:40:02,167
 Fear and danger are just what we need right now.

411
00:40:06,628 --> 00:40:08,052
 Mingliang!

412
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:13,927
 Old Chun, Old Chun.

413
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,868
 Old Chun, Old Chun.

414
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:24,960
 Old Chun, wake up.

415
00:40:27,107 --> 00:40:28,987
 How could this happen?

416
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:32,847
 This is a virtual world.

417
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:36,187
 How would he slip into a coma?

418
00:40:44,948 --> 00:40:46,968
 Old Chun! Old Chun! Chun Yiming!

419
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:48,147
 - Chief Engineer! 
 - Chief Engineer!

420
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:49,676
 Call 120! Hurry!

421
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:51,787
 No, no, no, wait.

422
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:55,148
 Chief Engineer!

423
00:41:07,308 --> 00:41:08,952
 Old Chun.

424
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:12,808
 He's awake.

425
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:15,208
 Chief Engineer, are you okay?

426
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:18,300
 Are you okay?

427
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,204
 Old Chun.

428
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:25,567
 Did I just faint from within the system?

429
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,592
 How could this happen?

430
00:41:30,592 --> 00:41:32,268
 It was the moment you fell into the water.

431
00:41:32,268 --> 00:41:33,748
 Due to an extreme shock,

432
00:41:33,748 --> 00:41:38,288
 you temporarily lost consciousness in the game.

433
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:43,707
 That's quite a bug.

434
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:45,324
 Yes.

435
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:49,268
 Testing must temporarily halt.

436
00:41:49,268 --> 00:41:51,108
 Let's solve this problem first.

437
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,187
 You are right.

438
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:54,488
 Show me the current data.

439
00:41:54,488 --> 00:41:56,688
 What if something goes wrong?

440
00:41:58,388 --> 00:42:03,468
 That's when Yan Mingliang set up his plan.

441
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,020

442
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:21,040

443
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:25,568
♫  I go from running  ♫

444
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:28,992
