1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,970

2
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:56,627

3
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:59,771

4
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:18,980
Chun Yu.

5
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,360

6
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:24,256
Chun Yu,

7
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,548
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,360

9
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:06,552
Don't be afraid.

10
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:10,227
Do you want to save Chun Yu?

11
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,360
If you want to save her,

12
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,230
you must listen to me.

13
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,510

14
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,552
It is time.

15
00:03:59,552 --> 00:04:02,227
Let the sacrifice begin.

16
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,900
- Qing You. 
 - Qing You.

17
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,800
It's very simple.

18
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,523
To pass the level, you only need to kill one person.

19
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:50,332
Don't be afraid.

20
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,270
Don't you want to save Chun Yu?

21
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,840
Think carefully who you want to kill.

22
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:03,103
I-I didn't agree to kill anyone.

23
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,182
You have no other choice!

24
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:09,232
No.

25
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:15,262
This is the only way to pass the level.

26
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:19,702
This is the only way to pass the level.

27
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:23,820
Very good.

28
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:26,500
Very good.

29
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,643
Do you know what will happen to Chun Yu if you don't kill?

30
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:45,332
This is the only way to save Chun Yu.

31
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:48,323
Can you save Chun Yu?

32
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:51,812
Go on.

33
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,060
W-What are you doing?

34
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:49,343
Qing You, what are you doing?

35
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:58,183
You're not going to stab me, are you?

36
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,343
Qing You, don't mess around!

37
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:01,763
Qing You,

38
00:07:01,763 --> 00:07:05,183
no matter how annoying Brother Qiang is, you can't stab him with a knife.

39
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,902
Let's talk this over.

40
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:09,882
Missy, put the knife down now!

41
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:11,480
Exactly.

42
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,690
They're all right, listen to them.

43
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,000
Put the knife down.

44
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,500
Be good, put the knife down.

45
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,683
Chun Yu, do you still recall that drawing and this level's mission?

46
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,842
Complete the Deserted Village Ritual.

47
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:26,400
 This level's mission is

48
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,442
 to eliminate evil spirits,

49
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:30,482
 and complete the Deserted Village Ritual.

50
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:34,143
The sacrifice! The sacrifice is…

51
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,203
Let's not rush this. Think carefully.

52
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,943
Alright. Fine.

53
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:47,800
If you're going to stab me, make sure to kill me at once.

54
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,400
If you don't stab me to death, I'll come out and kill you.

55
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,382
I'll kill you even if I turn into a ghost.

56
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:53,303
I'll turn into a figurine and bite you to death.

57
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:55,464
I'll bite you to death.

58
00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:59,802
All right. If I tell you not to stab me, you won't stab.

59
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:01,843
That's all you know how to do.

60
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:04,682
Come on. Come at me.

61
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:07,183
Come on! Stab me!

62
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:09,152
Stab me!

63
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:11,272
 I didn't.

64
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:13,483
You're only good at holding others back.

65
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:16,902
Cowardly, timid, incompetent.

66
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:19,503
Every time you nearly killed Chun Yu,

67
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:22,623
but this time, you can save her.

68
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,923
This is your only chance.

69
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:26,816
Kill him.

70
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,963
Get away from me.

71
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:35,082
No. Think carefully.

72
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,703
Think carefully. Think carefully.

73
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:40,743
Think. Think.

74
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:43,162
Think about how

75
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,200
they have treated you in the past.

76
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,800
You're so pitiful, so pitiful.

77
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,323
You must feel so wronged.

78
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:58,003
 So she really has this claustrophobia.

79
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:00,463
 That's weird. No wonder she doesn't have many friends.

80
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:01,363
 She's acting, right? Why is she so timid?

81
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,823
 She's acting, right? Why is she so timid?

82
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,463
 Y-You know

83
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,096
 I'm afraid of the dark.

84
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:08,883
 Please don't make me get in.

85
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:09,983
 Chun Yu.

86
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,900
 Are you willing to be the weakling?

87
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,200
Shut up!

88
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,300
- Come on. 
 - Stab me!

89
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Come at me!

90
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,163
- Aren't you ashamed?  
 - Is that the best you can do?

91
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:27,582
- Come on! 
 - Qing You.

92
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:30,162
You can't do this.

93
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:32,000
You... Y-You are not this kind of person.

94
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,200
- What's wrong with Qing You? 
 - Her eyes are very strange.

95
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
No.

96
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,422
Sister Qing You.

97
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:39,943
Sister, you're a forgiving person.

98
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:41,143
I-I was just kidding.

99
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:42,323
- D-Don't stab me. 
 - Missy.

100
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:43,983
Wake up now. Wake up!

101
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,223
Quickly, wake her up. She has already gone mad.

102
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:49,143
She's not waking up. What should we do?

103
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,862
Then one of us has to die.

104
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,048
I don't want to die.

105
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:56,500
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

106
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:59,092
Qing You!

107
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:01,542
This is so like you.

108
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,943
You are that kind of person.

109
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:08,282
You are always behind everyone.

110
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:11,103
You repeat other peoples' words.

111
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:12,583
Chun Yu, what are you doing?

112
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,540
Stop arguing.

113
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,343
You are a repeater of other people's words.

114
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:19,422
You never had a self-identity.

115
00:10:19,422 --> 00:10:21,440
You're wrong!

116
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:25,083
No, I'm right.

117
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,623
You are the weakest one,

118
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:29,130
and you are the most selfish.

119
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:34,003
You always need someone else's protection to survive.

120
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:38,763
Qing You, don't tell anyone out there I'm your good friend.

121
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,922
Do you know what you need?

122
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:45,203
You really need a strong person to protect you,

123
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:47,963
and I happen to be that strong person.

124
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:53,943
You are the most selfish person. You are the most selfish person!

125
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:01,762
I'm not.

126
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,083
- You are. You are a selfish person. 
 - I'm not that kind of person.

127
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,063
- I'm not, I'm not! 
 - You are, you are!

128
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:25,916
Qing You...

129
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:29,642
This isn't who you are.

130
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:33,162
Wake up now!

131
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:35,343
Who are you exactly?

132
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:38,444
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:41,440
What I just…

134
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:45,962
What I just said wasn't true.

135
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:50,042
From what I remember,

136
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:56,503
Qing You is someone who's a lot like me.

137
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:58,582
She is always by herself,

138
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:00,876
a little lonely,

139
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:08,180
but a very gentle and kind person.

140
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:13,432
Qing You,

141
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:16,800
do you know?

142
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:22,056
I…

143
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:24,244
I…

144
00:12:24,922 --> 00:12:30,583
I have always considered you as my best friend.

145
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:45,012
Chun Yu.

146
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,680
Chun Yu.

147
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:55,628
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

148
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:58,143
That wasn't me. That wasn't me just now.

149
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:01,463
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay, Qing You.

150
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:06,882
This was my choice.

151
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,736
It's not your fault.

152
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,328
Chun Yu.

153
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,402
Why did you do this?

154
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:19,256
This will help us pass the level.

155
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:33,456
Chun Yu.

156
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:46,136
Qing You!

157
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,660
Qing You!

158
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:14,796
 Thank you.

159
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,210

160
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,448
 Let's go.

161
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:29,056
Chun Yu,

162
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:33,483
wasn't I very strong this time?

163
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:37,662
I'm sorry.

164
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:43,280
I've been hiding behind you the whole time.

165
00:15:44,363 --> 00:15:50,463
Now I could finally protect you.

166
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,956
Thank you.

167
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:00,943
Thank you, everyone.

168
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:13,703
I apologize for the trouble I've caused you.

169
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:19,868
Chun Yu.

170
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:12,922
 Congratulations to all players on completing the Deserted Village Ritual.

171
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:19,702
Qing You is not a weakling.

172
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:28,063
She is the strongest among us.

173
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:48,960
Qing You, Qing You.

174
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,802
Qing You.

175
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:54,023
Qing You, wake up! Qing You! Qing You!

176
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:58,282
Qing You! Qing You, wake up! Qing You!

177
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:00,436
Qing You!

178
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:05,843
Hello, this is the Jianghua College Women Dormitory.

179
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:08,243
Someone has fainted. Come quickly.

180
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,908
Qing You.

181
00:18:28,203 --> 00:18:29,876
Qing You.

182
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:51,800
Dou Dou.

183
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:16,776
Anyway,

184
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:19,740
thank you.

185
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,520

186
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:39,222
Help her pack her things.

187
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:40,720
Okay.

188
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,550

189
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:47,956
Be careful.

190
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:56,002
Did she lose consciousness because of this game?

191
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,643
You can stay here. Give me the bag.

192
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:04,343
Also, can you not tell anyone that I'm Dou Dou?

193
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:06,163
- We're leaving. Who's coming with us? 
 - Me.

194
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,800
Okay, let's go.

195
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10,328
Get in.

196
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:14,380

197
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,603
Every sacrifice is immortal.

198
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:35,163
Even the weakest firefly will shine.

199
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:40,663
The dark shadow hiding behind the firefly will eventually appear.

200
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,683

201
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:56,290
Hello, I'd like to see Qing You's medical record.

202
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,520

203
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,440
Okay, thank you.

204
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:07,760
A foreign object is detected.

205
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,950

206
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,940

207
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,403
There is a clear foreign object in the brain stem.

208
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:15,632
How could there be a foreign object?

209
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:28,160
Has she had surgery recently?

210
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,784
No.

211
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:34,963
This foreign object in her brain is very likely a metal piece.

212
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:36,542
A metal piece?

213
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:37,643
Yes.

214
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:40,562
Based on the shape and size of this foreign object,

215
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:43,082
it's most likely a piece of metal.

216
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:46,823
Dr. Jia actually helped Tianji hide the truth about us.

217
00:21:46,823 --> 00:21:48,762
If the metal piece is a chip,

218
00:21:48,762 --> 00:21:50,483
we can basically conclude

219
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:53,883
that it is the carrier that controls our entry into the game.

220
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:58,743
Will everything be okay once it is removed?

221
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,042
What if Qing You doesn't wake up after it is removed?

222
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:04,923
But if we don't remove it, Qing You will remain in a coma.

223
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,583
The situation can't get any worse.

224
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,522
The doctor just said,

225
00:22:09,522 --> 00:22:11,422
this surgery carries a high risk.

226
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:12,883
If anything goes wrong…

227
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:14,723
In any case, she is already in a coma.

228
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:18,023
Removing the chip might give her a chance.

229
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,862
Chun Yu, what do you think?

230
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:27,462
I just want to save Qing You.

231
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,490

232
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:46,928
Who is this?

233
00:22:47,623 --> 00:22:49,863
 If you want her to die,

234
00:22:49,863 --> 00:22:51,982
 go ahead and remove the chip.

235
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:53,788
What did you say?

236
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:59,343
 Your guess about the chip is correct.

237
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:02,264
 Don't be nervous.

238
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:06,623
 I want to warn you that removing the chip on your own is very dangerous.

239
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:10,383
You should know the brain is very fragile.

240
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:13,682
Aren't you afraid of permanent brain damage

241
00:23:13,682 --> 00:23:16,042
 and never waking up again?

242
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:22,523
As long as you obey, I can guarantee that Qing You will wake up.

243
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:24,443
 Who are you exactly?

244
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:27,623
Qing You's consciousness is still trapped in the game.

245
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:30,622
Removing it now will only result in brain death.

246
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:32,942
Don't scare people like that.

247
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:35,883
 Of course, there is a solution.

248
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:40,023
 As long as you continue and finish the game,

249
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:43,243
 everyone's consciousness can be restored, including Qing You.

250
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:46,262
 However, if any of you quit halfway

251
00:23:46,262 --> 00:23:48,982
 or plan to create trouble in the hospital,

252
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:51,383
 with just one light touch,

253
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:55,242
I will put everyone in a coma forever.

254
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:07,082
Why should we believe you?

255
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:08,903
You don't have to believe me.

256
00:24:08,903 --> 00:24:10,963
The choice is in your hands.

257
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:14,262
 How can you ensure Qing You will wake up once we finish the game?

258
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:16,362
Believe it or not,

259
00:24:16,362 --> 00:24:18,802
it's all up to you.

260
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:28,583
Hello? Hello?

261
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:38,643
This is too scary.

262
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,032
I don't want to play this game anymore. I want to quit.

263
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:43,103
How do you plan to quit?

264
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:46,163
Do you believe what that liar said?

265
00:24:46,163 --> 00:24:49,103
I can't gamble with everyone's lives.

266
00:24:49,842 --> 00:24:51,542
Even if we want to quit the game,

267
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:53,023
after what he just said,

268
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:57,043
if we remove the chip in a regular hospital, it could be dangerous.

269
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:59,703
We might lose our memory or suffer from impaired intelligence.

270
00:24:59,703 --> 00:25:02,023
What if he was lying?

271
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:06,343
Chun Yu, I'm not saying I don't care about Qing You.

272
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:10,532
I mean, can we think of another way?

273
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:14,488
For instance, try a bigger hospital.

274
00:25:14,488 --> 00:25:15,963
I have another way.

275
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:17,863
First, I will contact a brain-computer interface expert.

276
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:20,003
Don't rush into removing the chip.

277
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:22,643
If he gets angry out of humiliation and attacks Qing You,

278
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:25,723
we will lose the only chance to save her.

279
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:28,863
That person just said that we have to finish the game together.

280
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:29,920
What about Dou Dou?

281
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,203
We don't even know who she is. Will she join us?

282
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:33,716
She…

283
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:38,303
She will continue the game.

284
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,383
Why don't we all just think about it for a while?

285
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:43,428
We'll get together later.

286
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:47,352
Still, I have to save Qing You.

287
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:50,243
Chun Yu, that's not what I meant.

288
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:52,163
- I didn't say to ignore Qing You. 
 - Qing You.

289
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:54,650
Qing You. Qing You.

290
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,943
Qing You. Qing You.

291
00:25:57,943 --> 00:26:00,063
Nurse, where is the little girl named Qing You?

292
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:02,063
- On the right side, turn left. 
 - Qing You.

293
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:03,182
Auntie.

294
00:26:03,182 --> 00:26:06,382
Chun Yu, Director Liu told me Qing You was in the hospital.

295
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:08,422
How is she?

296
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:44,564
Uncle Lin.

297
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,562
Chun Yu sent you?

298
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:51,943
If I can prove Tianji's claims are credible,

299
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,962
would you be willing to continue?

300
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:59,103
This… I'm still not sure.

301
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:01,583
I'm just wondering,

302
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,883
is it worth risking the safety of so many people

303
00:27:04,883 --> 00:27:09,783
for a chance that may or may not be real?

304
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:16,203
Uncle Lin, are you scared?

305
00:27:17,163 --> 00:27:19,140
You might not be afraid,

306
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:23,103
but what about your family and your friends?

307
00:27:23,103 --> 00:27:25,583
What about the people who care about you?

308
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:29,852
I am old.

309
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:32,342
Of course, I think about more than that.

310
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:38,042
I understand everything you said.

311
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:40,723
Then please consider it carefully.

312
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:43,982
I will ask everyone to meet in the cafeteria at three o'clock this afternoon.

313
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:47,082
Then, you can announce your decision.

314
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:49,720
All right

315
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:08,963
Hello, Brother Qiang. Where are you?

316
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:10,543
 I'm out eating.

317
00:28:10,543 --> 00:28:11,883
 Brother Xuan, what's up?

318
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:14,463
Wait a minute. I'm coming to find you.

319
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:22,963
A chip? Inside the brain?

320
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:30,343
T-Then A'Yong…

321
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:33,092
Now you know everything.

322
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:34,662
I want to know your thoughts.

323
00:28:34,662 --> 00:28:36,963
Will you continue playing with us?

324
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:39,262
I'm so ready, my ass!

325
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:41,003
From what you said, this game is extremely dangerous.

326
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:44,382
Am I that stupid? Would I continue to play just to waste my life?

327
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:48,482
I know what you're worried about.

328
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,422
We also received a message.

329
00:28:56,362 --> 00:29:02,562
Even if we remove this chip, the brain is still at risk.

330
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,562
This is all your speculation.

331
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:21,722
So you will no longer take care of Hei Er and A'Yong?

332
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:29,083
Have you considered that completing this game could save them?

333
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:41,582
This is my business. I don't want you to interfere.

334
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:44,920
Brother Qiang.

335
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:47,922
If you change your mind,

336
00:29:47,922 --> 00:29:51,223
meet me in the school cafeteria at three o'clock.

337
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:08,482
Qing You is a timid child.

338
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:13,843
Her claustrophobia makes her very introverted

339
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:16,683
and she has no friends.

340
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:23,522
It was only after she met you

341
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:26,702
that she gradually grew braver.

342
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:30,743
I don't understand what happened between you and her.

343
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:34,503
I just know you have always been her role model.

344
00:30:34,503 --> 00:30:36,603
Even when she got into college

345
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:41,162
she wanted to attend the same one as you.

346
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:45,162
She wanted to be your best friend forever.

347
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:47,448
But…

348
00:31:49,802 --> 00:31:53,282
 Chun Yu, I've been worried about something.

349
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:55,823
 I don't know how to tell you this,

350
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:59,443
 but I have to apologize to you.

351
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:02,103
 I am truly very sorry.

352
00:32:02,643 --> 00:32:04,942
 I posted the cat video.

353
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:08,402
 Whether you care or not, I know...

354
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:10,943
 that the rumors will hurt you.

355
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:13,583
 It's all my fault.

356
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:18,363
 It was my weakness and sensitivity that led to the current situation.

357
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:22,043
 I don't ask for your forgiveness.

358
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:24,422
 I just want to say,

359
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:27,462
 "Thank you, Chun Yu."

360
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:30,363
 You taught me how to be strong.

361
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,810
♫  I will always stand by your side  ♫

362
00:32:42,082 --> 00:32:45,703
Those who haven't submitted their homework, stand at the back.

363
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:54,120
♫  And give you all of my energy  ♫

364
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:00,250
♫  We support one other on narrow shoulders  ♫

365
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:08,040
♫  Since we can't predict the chaos of tomorrow  ♫

366
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:14,170
♫  Let me keep vigil by your side  ♫

367
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:21,700
♫  Shards of memory without sorrow are no more than…  ♫

368
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:26,700
Chun Yu.

369
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:35,390
♫  Secretly fulfilling each other's wishes  ♫

370
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:41,910
♫  We promised to count the stars together one day  ♫

371
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:48,870
♫  Even as the world changes, we will remain ourselves  ♫

372
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:59,960
♫  We will forever shine as brightly as the beginning  ♫

373
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:01,782
Sister, you're busy, aren't you?

374
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:03,576
Yes.

375
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:25,268
Grandma.

376
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:28,900
Grandma, how many times have I told you?

377
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,443
Don't collect these things.

378
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,703
Stop collecting them, stop it.

379
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,302
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

380
00:34:33,302 --> 00:34:35,462
If you're out of money, just tell me.

381
00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:38,423
Tianqiang, I don't lack money.

382
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:40,183
It's just that as long as I can still work,

383
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:41,912
I want to earn a bit more.

384
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:44,783
You left the money last time, didn't you?

385
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,142
I won't take it.

386
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:48,072
Grandma.

387
00:34:48,072 --> 00:34:51,092
Well... about the money from last time,

388
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,563
A'Yong asked me to give it to you.

389
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:53,803
It's A'Yong's money.

390
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:55,223
A'Yong?

391
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:59,342
Why didn't he give it to me himself?

392
00:34:59,342 --> 00:35:01,563
This kid hasn't been home for several days now.

393
00:35:01,563 --> 00:35:04,323
Neither has Hei Er.

394
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,444
Really.

395
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:11,483
T-The two of them are busy with work.

396
00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:15,263
They are on a business trip, Grandma. A business trip.

397
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:17,063
They... They are doing fine.

398
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:19,483
There's nothing to worry about. Rest assured, Grandma.

399
00:35:20,003 --> 00:35:21,503
They are on a business trip?

400
00:35:21,503 --> 00:35:24,163
That's good.

401
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,962
Tell them to be careful in everything.

402
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:31,943
Safety is most important.

403
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,703
Tianqiang, you too.

404
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:36,663
Thank you for taking care of A'Yong and Hei Er.

405
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:38,492
Thank you.

406
00:35:48,202 --> 00:35:49,812
Grandma.

407
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:55,203
Well, Grandma, I still have things to do. I'm leaving.

408
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:57,922
It's good to be busy. Go on. Go do your work.

409
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,983
Don't worry about me. Don't worry about me.

410
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:03,503
Good child, off you go.

411
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:19,022
 Grandma, rest assured.

412
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:21,863
 I will definitely pay for A'Yong's medical expenses

413
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:25,283
 and bring him and Hei Er back safely.

414
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:55,103
How was your meeting with Brother Qiang and the others?

415
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:58,123
I told everyone to gather in the cafeteria.

416
00:36:58,123 --> 00:37:00,123
I believe as long as we give them some time,

417
00:37:00,123 --> 00:37:02,763
they will all make the right choice.

418
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:06,503
No matter what happens, I am determined to save Qing You.

419
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:09,422
I'm just a little worried about Brother Qiang.

420
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:12,482
When he heard it, he immediately refused.

421
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:15,483
But don't worry,

422
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,843
we will find a better way.

423
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:20,003
Regardless of their decisions,

424
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:22,762
I will accompany you to save Qing You.

425
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:24,063
I don't want to force anyone.

426
00:37:24,063 --> 00:37:25,562
If you don't want to continue the game…

427
00:37:25,562 --> 00:37:27,292
I'm not forcing myself.

428
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,962
As long as you want to continue this game, I won't leave.

429
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:41,460
I…

430
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:46,642
I think he will continue.

431
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:51,023
Because of Hei Er and A'Yong?

432
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:08,628
Eight characters.

433
00:38:09,642 --> 00:38:11,163
I just want to discard eight characters.

434
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,342
It's your turn.

435
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:13,908
The green one.

436
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:16,400
Two characters.

437
00:38:17,323 --> 00:38:19,442
 What's the deal? Have you collected the money?

438
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,302
Get ready to collect the money.

439
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:24,222
Then prepare my share and my buddy's.

440
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,356
What's more,

441
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:29,983
I'm telling you, I am not working with you anymore.

442
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:33,728
Five characters.

443
00:38:34,722 --> 00:38:36,940
I've discarded a tile, too.

444
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,023
 I won!

445
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:08,743
You're really amazing, Old Yang.

446
00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:10,743
Yang, pay back the money.

447
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:12,904
No, this round…

448
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:15,262
You're merciless over that small amount of money, aren't you?

449
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:17,243
I lost more in this round than I owe you.

450
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,223
Then why don't you pay it back?

451
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,603
Just for that little money, my buddy risked his life.

452
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:24,263
You will pay that money back today, no matter what.

453
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:25,908
Pay back my ass!

454
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:26,883
Old Yang, Old Yang!

455
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,096
Scram!

456
00:39:28,096 --> 00:39:29,183
That last round doesn't count.

457
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:30,183
How can that be?

458
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:32,243
How could it count when I dropped it?

459
00:39:45,522 --> 00:39:46,603
You are all bullying me.

460
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:49,443
I am also a big man. I am also a big man.

461
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:23,250

462
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,042

463
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:40,783
This time, I want to see just how strong your friendship really is.

464
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,290

465
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:55,250
