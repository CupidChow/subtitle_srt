1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

2
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:56,759

3
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,703

4
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,600
We just passed the Logistics Department.

5
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,323
Downstairs are the offices of other departments.

6
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:10,124
There are too many offices.

7
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:12,423
I was a little confused.

8
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,564
Obviously, a large company has many departments and employees.

9
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:23,072
Of all the offices, which one is the boss's?

10
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:26,483
It's the last one upstairs, at the end of the hallway.

11
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:28,503
W-What's wrong?

12
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:32,483
Nothing. I was wondering if we could take a tour.

13
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:35,884
I'm afraid we can't do that.

14
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:37,628
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,020
Well...

16
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:44,403
friends, I am a bit tired today.

17
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:46,263
Maybe we should call it a day.

18
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:48,392
Bye-bye, my dears.

19
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:53,784
Well, I do feel a little tired today.

20
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:55,424
I was wondering

21
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,564
if you could offer us a place

22
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:58,223
where we could go and take a break.

23
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:00,164
No problem at all.

24
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:01,448
Come with me.

25
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,172
Come on.

26
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,152
This way.

27
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:30,224
You can take a rest here.

28
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:32,164
Let me know if you need anything.

29
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:34,700
All right, then you go ahead with your work.

30
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,100
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

31
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:59,683
Director Yan, they're here. Just as you ordered.

32
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,040
Keep an eye on them.

33
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:15,083
Everyone, come over here,

34
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,256
but don't get close to them.

35
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,696
 Everyone, come over here, but don't get close to them.

36
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:50,928
Roger that. Got it.

37
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:52,650
Let's go.

38
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,410

39
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,950

40
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,670

41
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,100
Chun Yu, what's wrong?

42
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,684
Don't you think everything is going too smoothly?

43
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:01,804
Are you jealous that my plan is too perfect?

44
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:24,292

45
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:36,364
 Xiao Jia gave me a series of numbers before he left.

46
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:40,383
 I don't know if this is useful.

47
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:51,643
Could there be someone else?

48
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:53,372
Chun Yu!

49
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,500
Chun Yu, it's too late.

50
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:05,664
All right, Chun Yu, stop looking. There's no time.

51
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:07,200
Hurry up!

52
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
It's this guy.

53
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,276
Old Gao?

54
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:39,732
Why are you here?

55
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:41,532
Let's talk outside.

56
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:58,000
Old Gao, you've arrived just in time.

57
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,100
You came to save us, didn't you?

58
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:04,664
I was thinking since the chips can be removed,

59
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:06,683
they must have some kind of device.

60
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:09,204
That's right. Whoever did the poisoning must have an antidote.

61
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,384
How is it? Did you find anything?

62
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:13,964
Their utility unit is very well protected.

63
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:15,324
I couldn't hack into it.

64
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:18,684
So the alarm went off because of you?

65
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:22,723
You knew we were here.

66
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:23,988
Yes.

67
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:26,143
Bawan told me about your plan.

68
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:29,384
I thought more people could distract Tianji's attention.

69
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,224
You used us as a cover.

70
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:33,583
We could have discussed it before taking action.

71
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,084
We almost got caught.

72
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:37,948
No, no. Old Gao didn't do it on purpose.

73
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:42,264
At most, he's just… eager to succeed, aren't you, Old Gao?

74
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:44,523
I know he didn't do it on purpose,

75
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:48,224
but our plan failed, so I can complain a little, right?

76
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:52,124
Chun Yu, why are you leaving? Let's discuss the plan.

77
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:54,684
Let's talk about it.

78
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:57,504
I really don't want to play this game again.

79
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,884
What's there to discuss?

80
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:00,924
Just let him decide.

81
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,400
Aren't you angry?

82
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,100
He used us as a cover.

83
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,903
A little.

84
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:11,864
But I think he did it for us.

85
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:17,504
Are you upset because the mission failed,

86
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:20,283
or…

87
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:27,004
I'm just asking.

88
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,970

89
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:48,283
I-I've checked thoroughly.

90
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:53,823
The young man entered the utility room, bypassing the access control.

91
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:58,483
He set off the alarm while hacking into the secret storage unit.

92
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,824
Is any equipment missing?

93
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,124
No.

94
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:03,704
After setting off the alarm, he ran away,

95
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:07,260
but our system was partially damaged.

96
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,203
The game system needs a complete upgrade for safety reasons.

97
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:16,163
This means 19th Floor cannot be launched tonight.

98
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,984
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,800
This is my own fault.

100
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,888
Then let them relax for one night.

101
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:40,820
Yes.

102
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,800

103
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,490

104
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,700

105
00:11:11,883 --> 00:11:13,304
 Aren't you angry?

106
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:14,964
 He used us as a cover.

107
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:19,824
 Are you upset because the mission failed,

108
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:22,263
 or…

109
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,740

110
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,210

111
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,560

112
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,740

113
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,330

114
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:29,752
 Is everyone here?

115
00:13:57,244 --> 00:14:00,644
 Last night I didn't enter the game. What about you?

116
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,412
 I didn't either.

117
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,083
Chun Yu, last night I didn't enter the game.

118
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,248
Neither did I.

119
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,304
Why is that?

120
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:44,483
Don't we enter the game every night?

121
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,064
 What's going on?

122
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:52,484
 Chun Yu, Xu Wenya, what about you two?

123
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:54,364
 Did you enter the game or not?

124
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,164
Who is it? It's so early in the morning.

125
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,143
Can't you let me sleep?

126
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:10,104
Right. Why…

127
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,224
 I didn't enter either, what is going on?

128
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:20,884
Chun Yu!

129
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:23,096
Chun Yu!

130
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,143
Chun Yu. I didn't…

131
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:44,724
When did they get so close that they use the restroom together?

132
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:47,523
 I think maybe I did some damage to their system

133
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:50,103
 when I hacked their server unit.

134
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:52,923
 So, although Old Gao failed,

135
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:55,044
 we still managed to do some good.

136
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:58,244
 If this is true, I hope the damage is permanent,

137
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,763
 so we won't have to enter the game again.

138
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:04,224
 If that is the case, then we have God's blessing.

139
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:06,023
 This does not necessarily mean the system is damaged.

140
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:07,403
 This is just a guess.

141
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:10,664
 If the system is damaged, would it affect Brother Qiang, Qing You, and the others?

142
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:11,964
 That's right.

143
00:16:11,964 --> 00:16:14,404
 Who is Dou Dou in reality?

144
00:16:15,023 --> 00:16:16,944
 I also want to know.

145
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:19,424
 Where's Chun Yu? Why isn't she speaking?

146
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:21,440
 She's washing up.

147
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:43,863
Mom, it's so early, what's up?

148
00:16:43,863 --> 00:16:46,543
 Son, I got you a job here.

149
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:49,824
 When you finish graduate school, come back to work.

150
00:16:49,824 --> 00:16:52,623
Mom, I never planned to leave Jiangning.

151
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:54,704
Look at you.

152
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:56,344
Ever since your dad's incident,

153
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:58,984
I finally got the chance to have you by my side.

154
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:03,024
I've done my best to provide you with the best conditions,

155
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:05,404
 yet you insist on returning to Jiangning.

156
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:08,203
This is so much better than Jiangning.

157
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,824
Mom, I'm not a child anymore.

158
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:11,804
I’ll make my own choices.

159
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:16,924
Gao Xuan. That place left you with too many bad memories.

160
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,623
 I couldn't protect you in the past,

161
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:23,363
so now I must protect your future.

162
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:27,384
Mom. None of that matters to me now.

163
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:33,203
All I care about now is a very special situation.

164
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:35,744
Please don't rush me to go back.

165
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,683
I have my own choices and arrangements.

166
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,320
Rest assured.

167
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,264
 All right, I won't push you anymore.

168
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:47,144
 Remember to take good care of yourself, okay?

169
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:49,563
Okay, don't worry.

170
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:51,260
Bye-bye.

171
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:02,804
 We've failed, what else can we do?

172
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:04,460
 Future Technology.

173
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,964
 However, you may know it better by another name, Microtech.

174
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:12,404
 What does Microtech have to do with this?

175
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:15,724
 The core components of the device are assembled here.

176
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,910

177
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:34,004
Hello, Sir.

178
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:35,584
What can I do for you?

179
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:39,436
Hello, I'm here to sign up for the Micro Youth Talent Project. My name is Gao Xuan.

180
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:41,503
- Please follow me. 
 - Thank you.

181
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,172
This way, please.

182
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,630

183
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:59,064
 Please remember, that for the neglected elderly,

184
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:01,163
 psychological care is of greater importance.

185
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:02,904
 Well, that concludes this lesson.

186
00:19:02,904 --> 00:19:06,123
 Students, let's thank Grandma Li.

187
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:07,304
 Come on, let's thank Grandma Li.

188
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:08,823
 Thank you, Grandma Li.

189
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:10,004
 Thank you, Grandma Li.

190
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:12,083
There is no need. Don't be so nice.

191
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:15,844
You guys are too kind.

192
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:18,803
 Do me a favor when you get out.

193
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:24,204
 I want you to check on A'Yong and Hei Er's grandmother, okay?

194
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:34,903
I am President Nian's assistant.

195
00:19:34,903 --> 00:19:36,724
He's still in a meeting. Please have a seat.

196
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:38,724
Okay, thank you.

197
00:19:54,263 --> 00:19:56,263
You are finally here.

198
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,664
Hello, Gao Xuan. I am Nian Yongcheng.

199
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,148
Hello, President Nian.

200
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,944
Come on, let's sit down and talk.

201
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:02,948
Okay.

202
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:06,904
Well, the invitation has been sent to you for so long,

203
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,184
and you haven't responded.

204
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:11,544
I thought we lost you.

205
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,064
Fortunately, you are here today.

206
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:15,024
It's a relief.

207
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:16,064
Have a seat.

208
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,243
I am flattered.

209
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:18,904
She's my daughter.

210
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:22,816
I think you are a substitute teacher at her school.

211
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:23,784
Yes.

212
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,724
I did meet your daughter a few times.

213
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,200
Gao Xuan.

214
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:32,403
The school is small,

215
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:36,604
you are Microtech's chosen future talent.

216
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:39,184
Today, after signing the contract,

217
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:42,044
you can come over and accomplish something great.

218
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,944
Thank you, President Nian.

219
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,963
However, if there's no rush,

220
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:50,723
I want to finish my work first.

221
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,056
Of course.

222
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:55,563
Let me know if there's anything else you need.

223
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:59,384
We will fully support your research project.

224
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:02,723
President Nian, I hear that Microtech

225
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:05,044
has developed many new products this year.

226
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:06,384
I'm quite interested in them.

227
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:10,024
I wonder if it's convenient to visit the R&amp;D center.

228
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:11,783
No problem,

229
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:16,023
but today it seems they have an important task.

230
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:17,780
Let's schedule another time. I'll arrange it.

231
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,364
Okay, then, thank you.

232
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:21,184
Don't mention it.

233
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,444
President Nian, please stay.

234
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:27,924
Nothing at all. I'll see you out.

235
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:30,984
I wish I could talk more with young talent like you.

236
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:32,724
 - Come down here! 
 - Madam, please don't shout.

237
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,943
 We're still working.

238
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:35,444
 Madam.

239
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:36,644
 Chun Yiming!

240
00:21:36,644 --> 00:21:38,783
 - Stop screaming! 
 - You don't raise your child, nor give her any living expenses .

241
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:40,644
 and now you are being a coward.

242
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,944
I-It won't work with me!

243
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:45,244
- Don't be mad. 
 - Grandma.

244
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:46,724
Chun Yiming, come down here!

245
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:48,584
- Grandma, Grandma! 
 - Chun Yiming!

246
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:50,643
- Grandma. 
 - What? Who's your grandma?

247
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,008
President Nian, you see…

248
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:55,203
- It's you, Xiao Gao! 
 - Don't get angry. Don't get angry.

249
00:21:55,884 --> 00:21:58,124
Grandma, this is President Nian from Microtech.

250
00:21:58,124 --> 00:22:02,836
Auntie, who is Chun Yiming to you?

251
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:05,003
He's my son-in-law.

252
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:08,923
My daughter died in a car accident.

253
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:11,424
My son-in-law said he was busy with work,

254
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:15,023
and couldn't care for the child, so he left the child with me.

255
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:19,304
At first, it was fine. He provided a monthly living allowance,

256
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:24,223
but now… he hasn't even paid the child's college fees and living costs.

257
00:22:24,223 --> 00:22:26,404
I can't even find him anymore.

258
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:28,224
Auntie,

259
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:32,152
Chun Yiming resigned some time ago.

260
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:34,772
No.

261
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:36,604
No way.

262
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:38,763
He must no longer want to provide for his daughter.

263
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:41,944
- Auntie, really, he has already resigned. 
 - I know him.

264
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,423
I don't know where he went.

265
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:49,796
What should I do now?

266
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:56,063
Why didn't he tell me about his resignation?

267
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:57,704
President Nian, I am really sorry.

268
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:00,163
- Where did he go? 
 - It's fine.

269
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:06,336
Where did he go?

270
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:08,216
Grandma, be careful. Be careful.

271
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:09,224
Be careful.

272
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:10,432
Grandma.

273
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,643
Xiao Yu.

274
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:13,176
You're here.

275
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:15,524
Xiao Yu, you're here.

276
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:18,564
I've been trying to get some money from your father today,

277
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,024
but they won't let me in.

278
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:25,104
They said your dad has resigned for some time.

279
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:31,004
Your dad… just resigned. That's no big deal.

280
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:33,476
We couldn't find him for so long.

281
00:23:33,476 --> 00:23:37,800
Grandma. Maybe Uncle… really has some difficulties.

282
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:41,244
He never warns us.

283
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:42,644
Let's not talk about him anymore.

284
00:23:42,644 --> 00:23:44,584
It really annoys me.

285
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:46,244
Let's go, Grandma. Let's go home.

286
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:47,360
Let's go home.

287
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,784
Xiao Gao, let's go.

288
00:23:48,784 --> 00:23:50,883
Come home with me for dinner.

289
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,684
What?

290
00:23:52,684 --> 00:23:54,603
What do you mean?

291
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:56,904
Are you silly?

292
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:58,664
Xiao Gao helped me today.

293
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:01,424
We should invite him to come home for a meal.

294
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:02,963
Let's go, Xiao Gao.

295
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:05,684
- Don't mind her, let's go. Let's go home. 
 - Okay, Grandma. Let's go.

296
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:06,944
Take it easy.

297
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:08,524
Go home.

298
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:18,703
What? No one answered yet?

299
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:21,664
Whatever.

300
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:24,823
Pathetic.

301
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:27,244
Having such a dad.

302
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:28,324
Let's not talk about him.

303
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:29,824
We should have a chat.

304
00:24:29,824 --> 00:24:31,844
Time for tea. Don't worry about it.

305
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:35,184
- Don't bother. 
 - You two have a chat. I'll handle this.

306
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:49,323
Grandma is still so kind.

307
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,603
Do you enjoy awkward chatting?

308
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,136
Chun Yu.

309
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:57,924
- Actually, I'm also… 
 - I don't want to know.

310
00:25:02,164 --> 00:25:05,204
Wait here, I'll make you some nice tea.

311
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:09,223
I'll get you a new tea set.

312
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,363
Where did it go?

313
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:16,983
I remember putting it right here.

314
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,344
Where did it go?

315
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:22,463
- Look, this is weird. 
 - Grandma, you put it here.

316
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,483
I'm getting old and useless.

317
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:36,376
I'm going to get some fresh air.

318
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:37,664
Look, look, look!

319
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:40,004
Grandma, I'll go out check on her.

320
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,816
Hurry up and go.

321
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:04,384
The view is pretty nice.

322
00:26:06,624 --> 00:26:09,584
How did you know where to find the tea set?

323
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:15,223
Didn't I come to your house once before?

324
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:17,524
I saw Grandma put it there that time.

325
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:21,864
You know it. My memory is no worse than yours.

326
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:24,952
Gao Xuan.

327
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm serious. I can't tell which of your words are true.

328
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,684
I don't know what else you're hiding from me.

329
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,123
 You brat!

330
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:47,784
 What are you doing?

331
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,044
 You're as ruthless as your mom.

332
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:54,503
 If you dare, then leave!

333
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,760

334
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,428
 You…

335
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:45,143
 My name is Chun Yu, what's yours?

336
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:05,763
 This thing will make you smile.

337
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:30,772
 My…

338
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,684
 My name is Zhao Lei.

339
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:52,610
♫  I understand your sudden silences  ♫

340
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,150
♫  And your smiles through the tears  ♫

341
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:06,840
♫  You are like a gentle and warm breeze  ♫

342
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,330
♫  that has learned to recklessly accompany me in madness  ♫

343
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,644
 Chun Yu.

344
00:30:15,644 --> 00:30:18,363
 I have imagined the scene of our reunion countless times,

345
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:20,104
 but when I saw you on campus,

346
00:30:20,104 --> 00:30:22,763
 I didn't know how to approach you.

347
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:28,583
 When we met in the haunted building, you did not recognize me.

348
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:31,924
 I also don't know where to begin.

349
00:30:31,924 --> 00:30:35,344
 I wish one day, you will remember me on your own.

350
00:30:35,344 --> 00:30:37,884
 But none of that matters.

351
00:30:37,884 --> 00:30:42,836
 I will always be there for you, no matter what.

352
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:54,864
Grandma, don't see me out.

353
00:30:54,864 --> 00:30:56,703
I'll be going back now.

354
00:30:56,703 --> 00:30:58,323
I'll visit you again sometime.

355
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,324
How much is that fruit?

356
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:02,343
It's free, a gift for you.

357
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:03,703
You need to scan a QR code, do you?

358
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:05,643
No, no.

359
00:31:09,323 --> 00:31:11,884
Well, I don't know how to use it.

360
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:13,404
Grandma, there is no need.

361
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,523
You're right. I don't know how to use it.

362
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:18,784
This is my grandson's phone.

363
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,884
Tianqiang brought it to me a few days ago.

364
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:28,304
Grandma, do you mind if I look?

365
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,636
Sure, go ahead.

366
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,760

367
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:46,464
That's right. That's the agreement from Tianji.

368
00:31:46,464 --> 00:31:48,744
- Whose phone is this? 
 - Hei Er's.

369
00:31:48,744 --> 00:31:50,984
I don't really know. I think Brother Qiang took the picture.

370
00:31:50,984 --> 00:31:52,763
Hei Er's phone?

371
00:31:52,763 --> 00:31:54,964
Yes, Brother Qiang gave me an address

372
00:31:54,964 --> 00:31:57,104
and asked me to take care of A'Yong and Hei Er's grandma,

373
00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:59,364
so I went to see her today.

374
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:01,576
And then…

375
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:04,784
I didn't expect Brother Qiang to be so clever. Nice.

376
00:32:04,784 --> 00:32:07,023
Of course, he's my big bro.

377
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:09,663
Now we have the agreement

378
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,604
and the video of the players in a coma.

379
00:32:11,604 --> 00:32:13,864
Do you think we could negotiate with Tianji's people?

380
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:17,464
I can't find any information about the Tianji boss online.

381
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:20,724
He's also very mysterious.

382
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:24,784
So what should we do next?

383
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:31,964
Go, go.

384
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:35,243
The longer you delay, the more complicated things will be. Go.

385
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:36,884
Hurry up.

386
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:38,544
Chun Yu!

387
00:32:39,444 --> 00:32:41,212
Chun Yu.

388
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,463
Yesterday I thought your plan might fail,

389
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:50,624
but I have a good chance of finding the device.

390
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:54,063
Besides, I thought that Tianji wanted us to keep playing,

391
00:32:54,063 --> 00:32:56,484
so that they don't harm you.

392
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:58,604
I'm sorry.

393
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:00,152
I'm sorry, Chun Yu.

394
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:03,063
I shouldn't have used you.

395
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:06,263
We should be united.

396
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:14,232
Chun Yu.

397
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:18,743
Why are you talking so much? Are we going to Tianji or not?

398
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:21,304
Yes.

399
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:22,523
We are coming too.

400
00:33:22,523 --> 00:33:24,412
Wait for me.

401
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:32,004
Why don't we call Uncle Lin?

402
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:34,224
We will tell him when there is good news.

403
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:35,924
All right.

404
00:34:00,563 --> 00:34:02,183
Everybody, please sit down here.

405
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:03,564
Help yourself to desserts and drinks.

406
00:34:03,564 --> 00:34:05,923
Did you hear what I said? We need to see your boss.

407
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:07,543
I have forwarded your request,

408
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:09,704
but it's not my responsibility to make the arrangements.

409
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:11,543
Then let's call someone in charge.

410
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:13,004
Someone will handle it later.

411
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:15,303
How long will it take?

412
00:34:16,964 --> 00:34:18,584
Everyone, please remain calm.

413
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:22,224
All requests in our company must follow procedures.

414
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:25,016
We meet again.

415
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:28,883
I'm wondering why you all need to see our boss.

416
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:31,543
We'll tell him when we see him.

417
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:34,744
Our boss has an important meeting now

418
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:36,564
and a very busy schedule.

419
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:39,344
You could tell me the details first,

420
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:41,904
so I can report to him more efficiently.

421
00:34:41,904 --> 00:34:44,504
Just tell him we need to see him in ten minutes,

422
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:46,823
or, we will call the police.

423
00:34:47,776 --> 00:34:51,484
What exactly would you report to the police?

424
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:53,643
We have concrete evidence that prove

425
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:57,004
the game 19th Floor you developed poses a high risk

426
00:34:57,004 --> 00:34:59,264
of rendering players unconscious.

427
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,543
Isn't that enough to call the police?

428
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:14,403
All right, I'm going to make a call.

429
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:17,364
Hello.

430
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:19,123
Please put me through to the president's office.

431
00:35:19,123 --> 00:35:20,404
 This is President Nian's office.

432
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:23,004
 He's still in a meeting. Please have a seat.

433
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,923
You know Nian Yongcheng, don't you?

434
00:35:36,923 --> 00:35:38,304
Who?

435
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:40,043
The general manager of Microtech.

436
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:43,203
I saw a photo in his office.

437
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:46,284
You're the person standing next to him.

438
00:35:52,844 --> 00:35:54,244
You didn't even dial the phone.

439
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:56,884
What does that mean? Just find your boss.

440
00:35:56,884 --> 00:35:58,520
There is no need.

441
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:03,604
Who would befriend Microtech's general manager?

442
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:07,924
If nothing else, he's more than just an employee.

443
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,183
Exactly.

444
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:33,184
I'm the one you're looking for.

445
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,100

446
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:58,020
