2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,370
Don't stall time. Make it quick.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,639
I don't care if it's one or two.

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:19,550
I don't see a baby.

5
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:22,919
What?

6
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,119
The baby is gone.

7
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,470
See?

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,140
There's only one sac left.

9
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:44,570
What does that mean?

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,009
Only one sac left?

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,280
Vanishing twin.

12
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,850
It's called fetus in fetu.

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,750
One of the twins fails to grow...

14
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:54,519
and dies in the uterus.

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,080
It occurs in 20 to 30 percent...

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,850
of twin pregnancies.

17
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,820
And it doesn't affect
the other twin or you.

18
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,720
That's ridiculous.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,290
How is that even possible?

20
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:08,759
Ms. Oh Yeon Doo.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,000
Enough. I don't want to hear it.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,799
- Stay calm, Ms. Oh.
- Let go of me!

23
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,370
It has nothing to do with me.
That doesn't matter!

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,370
Ms. Oh...

25
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,080
(Episode 3)

26
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,349
Dr. Gong.

27
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,049
You have a visitor.

28
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,140
What brings you here?

29
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,870
I'm here to receive treatment.

30
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,310
Treatment? From me?

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,010
I'm not in charge of obstetrics.
Get out.

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,349
I don't need an obstetrician.

33
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,819
I'm here for the fertility clinic.

34
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,819
I'm infertile, Tae Kyung.

35
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,420
What?

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,530
I didn't know
I'd be telling you this way.

37
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:19,170
Even if we get married,
I can't be pregnant.

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,440
If you want,

39
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,070
our marriage can be perfunctory.

40
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:29,380
Are you saying
you just want to play pretend?

41
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,679
For what?

42
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,450
For everyone's peace of mind.

43
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,350
Why did you make things worse...

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,619
by telling Ms. Eun
that you'd cut ties with them?

45
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,019
You could've consulted me first.

46
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:43,290
About what?

47
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:45,230
Whether it's perfunctory or not,

48
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,730
I'm not marrying you.

49
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,299
Don't you care about Ms. Lee at all?

50
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,529
- If you're like that...
- I know what I'm doing.

51
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:55,570
It has nothing to do with you.

52
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,910
While trying to follow you out,

53
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,679
Ms. Lee cut her foot
on a piece of broken glass.

54
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,649
If you keep being like this,
your mother will suffer.

55
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:09,920
You should think
about what you need to do...

56
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,790
as a son.

57
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,860
I should get going.

58
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,049
What if...

59
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:46,049
I'm pregnant?
Would things be different?

60
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,890
I want an abortion.

61
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,589
I want it now. Right now.

62
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:53,630
I can't wait.

63
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,959
The baby is gone.

64
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,230
See?

65
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,899
There's only one sac left.

66
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,659
If you keep being like this,
your mother will suffer.

67
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:30,060
You should think
about what you need to do...

68
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,399
as a son.

69
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:43,769
Is your foot all right?

70
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,109
I just needed a Band-Aid.
I didn't have to go to the ER.

71
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,380
I'm fine, so stop worrying about me.

72
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:54,820
You don't have to buy
things like this.

73
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,120
Just get better
and carry them with you.

74
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,330
Tae Kyung said
he'd cut ties with the family,

75
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,060
but he just did it in a fit of rage.

76
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,060
I'll talk to him.

77
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,599
It's not something
he would've said easily.

78
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:14,769
Leave him alone for the time being.

79
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,479
What?

80
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
What...

81
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:40,490
What do you think you're doing?

82
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,800
Grandmother had the staff
move Tae Kyung's stuff.

83
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,300
- Mother did?
- Yes.

84
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,240
And you stood and watched?

85
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,440
You should've stopped them!

86
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,969
Come on, Dad.

87
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,969
There's no stopping Grandma.

88
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,740
He left saying he'd cut ties.

89
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,440
He should take his stuff.

90
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:58,950
What?

91
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,479
I'm sorry, Father, Mother.

92
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,779
Grandmother was insistent
and there was nothing we could do.

93
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,930
Father.

94
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,200
You went shopping too?

95
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,370
You don't mind at all?

96
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,399
What got into you?
Watch your manners.

97
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,709
Are you all right, Mother?

98
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,959
Slam the door harder next time.

99
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,229
Mother. Why are you
making things worse?

100
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,029
What did I do?

101
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:50,729
When someone moves out,
they take their belongings.

102
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,969
No one's moving out.

103
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,070
Tae Kyung's part of our family.

104
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,140
"Family?"

105
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,070
He calls me by my name...

106
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,709
and doesn't call you "Father"
and he's family?

107
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,510
He was just so angry...

108
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,209
Do you see and care that he's angry,

109
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,919
but you don't care that I am?

110
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,880
Mother, will you please...

111
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
Honey.

112
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,390
Mother, he got all agitated...

113
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,390
because of me. I apologize.

114
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,359
I have a tea ceremony tomorrow.

115
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:21,159
Run a bath then wake me.

116
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes, Mother.

117
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,029
- Come with me.
- Mother, you really...

118
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:27,070
Let's go.

119
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
My goodness.

120
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,150
Chun Myung, why is something
always happening in your family?

121
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,389
I think our Chalttuk's stressed out.

122
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,520
Will it be okay?

123
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,790
It'll be fine.

124
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,290
We're not yet sure
you are pregnant, so...

125
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,459
What does that mean?

126
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,660
Do you want us to lose our baby too?

127
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,800
I have no ill will
toward your Chalttuk.

128
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,099
Don't exaggerate.

129
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,369
Honey, Chalttuk,
let's go to our room.

130
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:06,509
Come along.

131
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:25,660
It's all done. Now go to bed.

132
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,160
Let's worry about
tomorrow's things tomorrow.

133
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,109
How can she
love her husband so much...

134
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:42,739
when her son wants to cut ties?

135
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,749
Or is it our money she's after?

136
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,190
Don't forget our wedding anniversary
gathering tomorrow.

137
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,450
Whatever.

138
00:09:58,629 --> 00:09:59,629
Darn you.

139
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,330
In Ok.

140
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:11,629
Are you protesting? Wake up.

141
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,780
I need some time to think.

142
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,379
Please don't tell Tae Kyung.

143
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,920
In Ok!

144
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,290
My goodness.

145
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,389
Mother, did you see In Ok?

146
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,719
I want to ask you that. Wake her up.

147
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:38,229
I'll be late for the ceremony.

148
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,830
Honey!

149
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,430
- What's wrong, Father?
- Honey.

150
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,430
What's he doing?

151
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,499
Have you not seen her either?

152
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
Who?

153
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,999
Your mom.

154
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,609
You're not making any sense.

155
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,339
Where did she go?

156
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
She said she needs time to think.

157
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,810
She asked me
not to tell Tae Kyung either.

158
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,580
What?

159
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,520
My gosh.
Did Mother leave home, then?

160
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,550
She left home?

161
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:07,290
Try calling her, Father.

162
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,520
Yes, right.

163
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,099
I'm here to take you
to the ceremony.

164
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,070
Why are you all up?

165
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,540
Forget the tea ceremony.
What on earth...

166
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,270
Sir.

167
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:28,209
Ms. Jang. Something crazy happened.

168
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,580
Mother left home.

169
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,950
What?

170
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,550
The phone is turned off.
Please leave...

171
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
The phone is turned off.
Please leave...

172
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:43,920
Darn it.

173
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,989
Sir. Just a moment.

174
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:50,459
Let me go, Ms. Jang.

175
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,570
You can't go anywhere
dressed like this.

176
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,540
Ms. Lee hates it
when you look unkempt.

177
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,440
Right.

178
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,209
Calm down, sir.

179
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,109
You'll only make things worse
if you overreact.

180
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:07,879
You have a breakfast meeting
with the Minister of Startups.

181
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,520
Don't agitate Ms. Eun anymore.

182
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,790
Stick to your work schedule.

183
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,050
I'll do what I can...

184
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:16,420
to bring Ms. Lee back home.

185
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,430
Be at the gathering later
or I'll turn nasty.

186
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:27,629
You care about the gathering...

187
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,300
when Mother's out there somewhere?

188
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:31,869
I do.

189
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:34,979
People gather every year
to congratulate us on our marriage.

190
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:37,509
We haven't
made our divorce public yet.

191
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:39,379
Must I go alone
and humiliate myself?

192
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,950
Why do I even bother?

193
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:45,820
If you're a no-show,
I won't divorce you.

194
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:57,900
You might get sick.

195
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,930
Too much water isn't good for you,
Grandmother.

196
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,839
Where do you think she went?

197
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,839
She was a homebody,
so she won't have any friends.

198
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,670
Darn it.

199
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,509
Call the fool immediately.

200
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:28,459
I'm so bothered.

(Gong Chun Myung)

202
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,440
What's the occasion?

203
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,969
Was this your idea?

204
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:45,379
Grandmother?

205
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,979
Answer the question.

206
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,420
Did you get your mother
to move out too?

207
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,780
No, Grandmother.

208
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,050
She asked us not to tell Tae Kyung.

209
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,959
What do you mean?

210
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,389
What does Mom not want me to know?

211
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:58,020
That she ran away from home.

212
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,959
If you hear from her,
tell her I won't let her back.

213
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:04,459
What are you saying?

214
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,170
You said you would cut ties with us.

215
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:08,800
Fine.

216
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:11,239
Why don't we part ways now?

217
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,770
Before I hire a lawyer
to cancel your adoption...

218
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,910
Let's talk later. Bye.

219
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,940
Let go. Give me your phone.

220
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:19,810
Call him back right now.

221
00:15:20,109 --> 00:15:21,410
Grandmother.

222
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,089
Grandmother.
I can't live without you.

223
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,719
Try to calm down, for my sake.

224
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,160
Honey, get her calming medication.

225
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,259
Okay.

226
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,959
- Oh, dear...
- Grandmother. Calm down.

229
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:11,800
I'm sorry, kids.

230
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,430
My writing's horrible...

231
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:15,700
and I can't focus.

232
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,910
Let's wrap up for today.

233
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,239
I'll make up for it next time.

234
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,540
- Okay.
- Okay.

235
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,660
- Have a good day.
- Seriously?

236
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,660
I can't believe it.

237
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,060
- No way.
- Stop that.

238
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,700
But it's fascinating.

239
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,030
- Why are you taking photos?
- No way.

240
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,070
I think it belongs to a teacher,
not a student.

241
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,770
It's super annoying though.

242
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,839
Hi, Ms. Oh.

243
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,910
Hey.

244
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,670
There's nothing to see here.

245
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,910
Stop that.

246
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,580
(Looking for the owner)

247
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,580
Don't be so annoying.

248
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,379
- Whose can it be?
- Oh, no.

249
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:05,150
I know who this belongs to.

250
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,349
Stop that.

251
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,719
Get going, will you?

252
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,929
What kind of an idiot
would play such a dirty prank?

253
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,599
Just wait till I find out
who did this.

254
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,669
You'll be kicked out of
this academy!

255
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,169
Don't you agree, Ms. Oh?

256
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:38,220
You shouldn't have left the key
to your drawer in plain sight.

257
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,389
It was too easy to find.

258
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,260
How did you know
I had that ultrasound picture?

259
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,429
Have you been
checking my whereabouts?

260
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,030
As if.

261
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,030
You know my wife and I
are expecting our second child.

262
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:58,000
My wife's OBGYN
is a doctor at the famous...

263
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,770
Gong Obstetrics and Gynecology.

264
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,040
Gong Obstetrics and Gynecology?

265
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:04,139
That's right.

266
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:06,679
She saw you asking for an abortion.

267
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,550
I figured she saw wrong...

268
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,320
but I went through your drawer
just in case.

269
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Bingo.

270
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:14,419
Guess what I found.

271
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:17,159
I bet your family doesn't know yet.

272
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,689
Your mom once came to me...

273
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:21,030
with a packed lunch
hoping I'd be nice to you.

274
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,629

275
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,399
What is it that you want?

276
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:31,199
Quit this academy immediately.

277
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:33,869
Why are you being this mean to me?

278
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,510
I started off as your assistant,
remember?

279
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,040
I got you your cigarettes,

280
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,849
ironed your clothes, helped you
put together your textbook,

281
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,280
and even drove you around
while building my career.

282
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,480
It's why you should've
only crawled up so far.

283
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,730
First, you begged in tears...

284
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,830
for a chance to be my assistant.

285
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,699
But you crawled your way up,

286
00:18:58,129 --> 00:18:59,599
and now
you're threatening my career.

287
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,000
Please give me some time.

288
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:04,699
I can handle this mess.

289
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,139
How?

290
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:08,980
This is a conservative facility
where students receive education.

291

Having a child out of wedlock
could easily ruin your career.

292

Hand in your resignation letter

- but your mom...
- I know.

303
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,070
Grandmother told me.

304
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
You know?

305
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,339
Then why are you here
working at the office?

306
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,770
I told you that I was done
with the family.

your family affairs yourselves.

about your mother?

00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,349
Aren't you worried about her?

Something came up at the academy,

318
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,790
and I couldn't find
the time to call.

319
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,919
It's all right.
Are you on your way though?

I'm afraid not.
We won't be able to meet today,

You have a cashier's check
but no cash?

Just let her go.

00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,270
it won't be good for Ms. Lee either.

364
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,810
I can't stand this.
I should go and see Tae Kyung.

365
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,380
They're already looking for him
at Gong Obstetrics and Gynecology.

366
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:06,820
If you get worked up,
it'll be harder to convince Ms. Eun.

367
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,991
I'll make sure to find her
and bring her to you.

368
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:30,411
Wait.

369
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,251
Wait.

370
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,080
Here.

371
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,251
Isn't this yours?

372
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,211
It must be.

373
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,151
Twins?

374
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:11,850
They...

375
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,451
were twins.

376
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,221
They...

377
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,391
were twins?

378
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:20,891
One is gone.

379
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:23,330
Oh, my.

380
00:27:24,461 --> 00:27:26,001
How did that happen?

381
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,830
You must be upset about
what happened to your baby.

382
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,641
You still shouldn't drink.

383
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:34,741
It's not because of that.

384
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,981
I'm a teacher at an academy.

385
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:43,411
Someone blackmailed me
knowing that I was pregnant.

386
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:46,251
I might have to quit.

387
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,580
Oh, my.

388
00:27:48,891 --> 00:27:50,251
That must feel unfair.

389
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,961
It took me seven years...

390
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,560
to come this far.

391
00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:59,100
I'm so close to achieving my goal.

392
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:04,070
I did so much to survive.

393
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:09,110
If I was going to lose one,
why couldn't I just lose both?

394
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:12,741
Why did one stay?

395
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,011
That baby...

396
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,020
must be trying to survive.

397
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,891
Like you.

398
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:28,360
I was alone
when I gave birth to my baby.

399
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:31,161
He's already...

400
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,931
over 30 now.

401
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:48,211
But now...

402
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,921
he wants to live as strangers.

403
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:56,251
He must really not like me.

404
00:28:58,221 --> 00:28:59,620
Even if he's your child,

405
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:01,991
you must resent him.

406
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,461
No.

407
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:10,100
He didn't do anything wrong.

408
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,201
It's all my fault.

409
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,110
Right. Do you want to see my son?

410
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,310
Here.

411
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,481
He's cute.

412
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:32,590
He has your eyes and mouth.

413
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:35,661
He is my baby.

414
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,330
That's when he turned one.

415
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:42,471
Back then, I was everything to him.

416
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:45,370
I didn't even notice
when I was tired.

417
00:29:48,171 --> 00:29:50,141
Gosh.

418
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:53,580
I'll go...

419
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,550
and cool down a bit.

420
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,991
Right. One second.

421
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:24,241
Gosh.

422
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:43,891
How could you speak that way
about your mother?

423
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:45,360
Aren't you worried about her?

424
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:51,770
Dr. Gong.
Here is Ms. Oh Yeon Doo's chart.

425
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,471
I'll see you tomorrow.

426
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,810
Okay.

427
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,711
Right. Your mother
came by earlier, right?

428
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,780
- What?
- I met her...

429
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,110
in front of the hospital earlier.

430
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,681
She had luggage.

431
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:06,721
Dr. Gong.

432
00:31:26,641 --> 00:31:28,770
Ms. Lee.

433
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:30,441
Gosh.

434
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,651
Gosh.

435
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:49,330
(Ms. Jang)

436
00:31:52,231 --> 00:31:53,401
Yes. It's me.

437
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,880
What's wrong?

438
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,181
Did she drink?

439
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:11,820
It seems like it.

440
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,891
She can't drink alcohol.
What was she doing?

441
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:19,461
What if you catch a cold?

442
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,630
Sorry, Tae Kyung.

443
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,560
Don't get angry.

444
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:27,931
I don't see her bag.

445
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,501
Ms. Lee.
Where did you leave your bag?

446
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:36,340
At the food cart.

447
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:40,181
We should warm her up.

448
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:42,350
I'll take her,

449
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,211
so go back to the food cart
and look for her bag.

450
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,290
Go to my room. Please.

451
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,891
Don't worry.

452
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:21,951
(My Tae Kyung, June 4, 1991)

453
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:23,491
Tae Kyung?

454
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,590
You should meet him and face it.
Whatever conclusion you come to.

455
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,161
Enough. I don't want to hear it.

456
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,060
- Stay calm, Ms. Oh.
- Let go of me!

457
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,560
It has nothing to do with me.
That doesn't matter!

458
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,050
What? Mr. Gong.

459
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:57,120
What brings you here?

460
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:01,290
What's with him?

461
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,701
Oh, the check lady?

462
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:08,931
She got drunk and left.
Then she didn't come back.

463
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:12,540
She was only going to have udon,
but that girl got her to drink.

464
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,770
- Someone got her to drink?
- Yes.

465
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,870
Who was that?

466
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:17,540
Where is she?

467
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:20,511
She took the lady's luggage
and left just now.

468
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,851
Her luggage?

469
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:23,581
Yes.

470
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,090
Where are you?

471
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:36,331
Gosh. It's so heavy.

472
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,360
What are you doing?

473
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,201
Did you follow me?

474
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:50,471
Did you drink with her?

475
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,681
Oh, yes.

476
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,741
Do you know her?

477
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,951
She's my mother.

478
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,780
What? Your mother?

479
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,750
Oh, my.

480
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,590
So, this picture is you.

481
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,491
Were you this adorable?

482
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:12,831
No way.

483
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:16,670
- Why did you make my mother drink?
- What?

484
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,570
She can't drink alcohol.
Why did you make her drink?

485
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,011
Who made her drink?

486
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:23,511
You drank too, right, Ms. Oh?

487
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,411
How could you drink
after leaving like that yesterday?

488
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,750
Don't you know anything
about pregnancy?

489
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,011
Whether you had an abortion or not,

490
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:32,951
you can't be drinking.
Don't you know that?

491
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:35,621
Why are you always like this?

492
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:37,050
You just drink when you're upset.

493
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,920
When you're mad at someone,
you scribble on his car.

494
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,761
Does acting up help you feel better?

495
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,300
Do you even know the damages
I had to suffer because of you?

496
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:47,900
What damages did you suffer?

497
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:51,331
Forget it.

498
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,771
I don't want to talk to you.

499
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:56,971
Nothing quite works out...

500
00:35:57,641 --> 00:35:59,081
when you're involved.

501
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,411
I'll just walk away.

502
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:06,451
That's right! I drank!

503
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,690
I tried, but I couldn't swallow it.
I spit it out like a fool.

504
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,261
Is that so wrong?

505
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,761
To make you think
that I forced her to drink?

506
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,630
Now I understand
why your mother was agonizing.

507
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,371
- What?
- You told her...

508
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:27,371
that you'd cut ties
with your family.

509
00:36:27,371 --> 00:36:29,271
After breaking her heart like that,

510
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,780
why are you acting
as if you care about her?

511
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,581
Watch what you're saying, Ms. Oh.

512
00:36:34,581 --> 00:36:37,851
It's your mother's fault, after all.

513
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:40,250
She raised you to be so twisted.

514
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,851
Please tell your mother...

515
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:45,690
that she's in
for a rough ride ahead.

516
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,630
Gosh, seriously...

517
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:54,300
What?

518
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:59,000
You're so indifferent.
No wonder you don't have a friend.

519
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,741
What did you say?

520
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:02,411
Why? Am I wrong?

521
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,541
You had no one to talk to,

522
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:07,141
so you asked a stranger
to drink with you.

523
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,411
You have no one around you...

524
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:11,380
because of the petty life
you've led.

525
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:17,050
- Darn you.
- Gosh.

526
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:22,190
Even if I don't have any friends,

527
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,230
I won't make your acquaintance.

528
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:29,371
Hey, stop right there.

529
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,101
Hey!

530
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:33,000
Darn it.

531
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:38,911
Chairman Gong, I took Ms. Lee
to Gong Tae Kyung's room.

532
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:40,581
Please don't worry.

533
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:41,951
Now I'm relieved.

534
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,411
Thanks, Ms. Jang.

535
00:37:44,411 --> 00:37:45,420
My pleasure, sir.

536
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,150
Please get some rest tonight...

537
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,420
and visit Ms. Lee later.

538
00:37:48,991 --> 00:37:50,121
I'll see you tomorrow.

539
00:37:54,161 --> 00:37:55,331
Tae Kyung.

540
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,261
Tae Kyung.

541
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:01,931
Tae Kyung...

542
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,181
She just fell asleep.

543
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:22,451
She has no fever,
but we need to wait and see.

544
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:25,190
We need to talk.

545
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,800
It must've been hard
to look for her.

546
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,271
Thanks.

547
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:38,641
This is surprising.

548
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:40,340
I didn't think
you wanted to talk to me.

549
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,741
By the way, did something happen?

550
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,940
You look awful.

551
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,451
Nothing.

552
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:58,561
I think Ms. Lee is
having a hard time.

553
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:01,860
She wept in her sleep
calling Chairman Gong's name.

554
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,300
When Chairman Gong heard
that I found her,

555
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,831
it sounded like he cried too.

556
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,771
They have a happily married life,

557
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,400
so they can't spend a moment apart.

558
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:20,840
I told you.

559
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,980
You being like this
will only add to the problem.

560
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:26,681
I told you...

561
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,920
that I couldn't have a baby.
Remember that?

562
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,391
My offer still stands.

563
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't mind paper marriage.

564
00:39:40,431 --> 00:39:42,201
Once we get married,

565
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:45,541
everyone in the family
will feel at ease.

566
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,780
- It looks so pretty.
- I know.

567
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,610
I'm hooked on pink these days.

568
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,451
Tell me about it. So am I.

569
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:02,891
Ji Myung, isn't he your brother?

570
00:40:03,391 --> 00:40:06,161
Is he invited
to the wedding anniversary too?

571
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:07,820
He's not invited.

572
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,090
And he's not my brother anymore.

573
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:30,411
Come on. Let's not talk about that.

574
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:32,820
Why not? Are you hiding something?

575
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:35,250
If you don't stop,
you'll end up fighting.

576
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,991
Aren't you coming?
Do you want to fight me?

577
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:39,121
Ji Myung.

578
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,661
I guess we're the only friends...

579
00:40:41,661 --> 00:40:43,991
who celebrate
your anniversary for so long.

580
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:46,201
So you should be nice to us.

581
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,261
I'm tired of celebrating
the wedding anniversary.

582
00:40:48,261 --> 00:40:50,000
You just end up fighting
on a special occasion.

583
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,130
I know.

584
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,141
When I'm with my husband all day,
we have nothing to say.

585
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,110
- Honey.
- What? Oh, right.

586
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,411
Here. This is for you.

587
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:02,250
You didn't have to do this.

588
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:03,681
Thanks.

589
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,150
You'll be surprised.

590
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,050
The lingerie is
softer than your skin.

591
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,391
When we lost the spark between us,

592
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:14,860
we got pregnant because of that.

593
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,761
I got you something too.

594
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:20,101
Here, Ji Myung.

595
00:41:20,331 --> 00:41:23,101
It's the bath treatment from Europe.

596
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,601
Just by smelling it,

597
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:28,641
a couple who sleep in separate rooms
will be drawn to each other.

598
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,581
But aren't we the ones
who need stuff like this?

599
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:35,280
Ji Myung and her husband
fell in love at first sight...

600
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,750
and got married in three months.

601
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,681
And they are still
in the sweet honeymoon phase.

602
00:41:40,451 --> 00:41:42,521
- Right.
- Gosh, I'm so jealous.

603
00:41:43,621 --> 00:41:46,061
So when is Hyun Woo coming?

604
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:47,161
Is he busy?

605
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Yes.

606
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,030
It's tiring
that the hospital is busy.

607
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,230
- He just texted me he couldn't...
- Hello.

608
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,831
I'm sorry I'm late.

609
00:41:56,831 --> 00:41:58,271
- Hello.
- Hello.

610
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,570
- Hello.
- Hello.

611
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:03,210
Thank you for marrying me, Ji Myung.

612
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,940
That's so sweet.

613
00:42:08,311 --> 00:42:10,110
All right. Thanks.

614
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,150
- Have a seat, honey.
- Okay.

615
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,791
What took you so long?

616
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:20,161
That doesn't concern you.
Just give a big smile.

617
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,701
Did you eat a lot?

618
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:26,701
Yes.

619
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:31,871
I missed out on so much.

620
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,971
Gosh, look at you.

621
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,110
Done.

622
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,150
You two never change.

623
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,181
You guys are like newlyweds.

624
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:47,420
We almost got divorced recently.

625
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
What? You want me to lose weight?

626
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:54,090
Men are all alike.

627
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,690
Do you know what my husband said?

628
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,161
He says our kids are lazy
because they take after me.

629
00:42:58,761 --> 00:43:01,230
That almost made me
set my seal on the divorce paper.

630
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,670
What are you guys talking about?

631
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,300
Honestly, I don't understand
those who want to get divorced.

632
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:12,880
You can just give in a little
and make concessions.

633
00:43:14,681 --> 00:43:15,750
Don't you think so, honey?

634
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,250
Sure.

635
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:22,021
The only problem with us
is that we're the perfect match.

636
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:25,391
Let go of me.

637
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,561
What if I refuse?

638
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,431
You two should get a room.

639
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:34,800
Which is why I got you
one more gift.

640
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,201
A key to the suite.

641
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,400
- What?
- Pardon?

642
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
- No.
- It's okay.

643
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,771
- Just take it.
- We're really okay.

644
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:43,610
- There's no need.
- No, it's okay.

645
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,771
- You two should use it.
- All right.

646
00:43:44,771 --> 00:43:46,940
Let's drink to a toast
and wrap things up.

647
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,681
All right.

648
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:51,050
To their heated night!

649
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,380
- To their heated night!
- To their heated night!

650
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:57,021
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

651
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,000
(noonaspoiler.site)

652
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,270
- Have a good time.
- See you.

653
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,299
- Thanks.
- Bye.

654
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,270
A vodka martini, please.

655
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,639
Shaken, not stirred, two olives.

656
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,750
A vodka martini.

657
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,020
Shaken, not stirred, two olives.

658
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:15,670
You ruined my appetite.

659
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,040
I got here first. Get out.

660
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,610
Why should I leave?
You can if you want.

661
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,739
Why should I leave?

662
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:34,690
One more.

663
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,119
One more.

664
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:49,730
One more.

665
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:51,139
One more.

666
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,179
- More.
- More.

667
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:14,790
Gosh.

668
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,259
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

669
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,239
What? Wipe it for me again.

670
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,170
You pretended to be
so sweet earlier.

671
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,139
What about you?

672
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,840
"I don't get couples that divorce."

673
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,480
"They should try to compromise."

674
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,319
Did you ever compromise with me?

675
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,290
You asked for a divorce first!

676
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,750
Forget it!

677
00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:45,020
Excuse me.

678
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:54,069
- What...
- Here.

679
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:01,040
Gong Ji Myung.

680
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,110
Gong Ji Myung!

681
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:30,500
Your family may be rich,
but you shouldn't...

682
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,199
throw away credit cards.

683
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:41,650
Hey. Am I an insect?

684
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:43,750
Am I a virus to you?

685
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,989
I hate you more than I hate bugs.

686
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:50,790
You're worse than a virus.

687
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,920
That goes for me too.

688
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,529
You disgust me.
I can't stand your breathing.

689
00:47:57,029 --> 00:47:58,029
What?

690
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,869
If you hate me that much,
why did you marry me?

691
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:06,400
Because I loved you.

692
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,040
I didn't know you were like this.

693
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:12,239
You know,

694
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,849
I don't like how hypocritical
you are around others,

695
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:19,520
how you always put work before me,

696
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,349
and how you make all the decisions
yourself as if you're smart!

697
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:26,090
All sorts of physical contact with you
give me the creeps!

698
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:43,840
What are you doing?

699
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,310
Gong Ji Myung!

700
00:48:51,049 --> 00:48:53,849
Do you dislike me that much?

701
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:00,259
Even now?

702
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,130
Even now?

703
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:09,929
Even now?

704
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:33,119
- That way.
- Okay.

705
00:49:52,509 --> 00:49:53,509
Ta-da!

706
00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:55,250
What's this?

707
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,580
Isn't it pretty?
We went shopping for Soo Kyum...

708
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,380
Let me. I'll tell her.

709
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,819
I liked it as soon as I saw it.

710
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,920
It's meant to be yours.

711
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,719
It looks expensive.
You can wear it to work,

712
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,290
Ms. Star Instructor.

713
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,500
Right. Thanks, everyone.

714
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,299
Auntie, try it on.

715
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:15,230
Yes, let's see how it looks on you.

716
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,440
Okay, fine.

717
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,739
- Oh, gosh.
- Amazing.

718
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,110
What do you think?

719
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,949
You look amazing, sweetie.

720
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:30,179
You look awesome.

721
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:32,750
You look like
a news presenter on TV.

722
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,719
I have a great eye
when it comes to fashion.

723
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:36,819
You do.

724
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,989
How nice.

725
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:42,889
Sorry, this is an important call.

726
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:52,599
Hello, Director.

727
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,009
Sorry to call so late.

728
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,110
I have something to tell you.

729
00:50:57,409 --> 00:51:00,449
It's fine. Go ahead.

730
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,980
I don't think you can work with us.

731
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,449
I'm really sorry.

732
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,250
Okay.

733
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,090
May I ask why?

734
00:51:11,389 --> 00:51:12,989
See for yourself.

735
00:51:13,389 --> 00:51:15,029
Check the student forum.

736
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:16,659
What?

737
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,770
Oh Yeon Doo is to be a single mom?

738
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:31,110
What a betrayal.

739
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,949
Doesn't she feel bad
for her students?

740
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:36,409
Whose lecture should I
subscribe to when she retires?

741
00:51:36,779 --> 00:51:38,880
Shouldn't she compensate us
instead of just a refund?

742
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,489
(Edu Mind, Oh Yeon Doo)

743
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:33,099
My gosh...

744
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,250
Darn it.

745
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:41,969
I'm off to work, Mom.

746
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:43,670
Don't skip breakfast.

747
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,360
(My husband)

748
00:54:15,069 --> 00:54:16,110
My gosh.

749
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,509
Why did you jump?

750
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,679
I didn't jump.

751
00:54:26,049 --> 00:54:27,119
Move.

752
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,549
You're wearing yesterday's outfit.

753
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,520
Were you perhaps with another woman?

754
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,759
What? Unbelievable.

755
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,960
That's what you say after
barging into my office this early?

756
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,099
Get out.

757
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,969
Of course.
You're not one to have affairs.

758
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,670
You love your wife way too much.

759
00:54:43,869 --> 00:54:46,000
Cut the nonsense
and tell me what you want.

760
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,040
Why are you here?

761
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,210
Right.

762
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:50,340
I found my mom.

763
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:53,610
She got wasted after a few drinks,

764
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:54,880
so I took her to my room.

765
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,250
Mother had drinks?

766
00:54:58,279 --> 00:54:59,779
It must've upset you.

767
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:01,349
Are you all right?

768
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,029
By the way, can I have the material
for the upcoming event?

769
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:09,090
It's in two days.

770
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,259
Right, of course.

771
00:55:10,259 --> 00:55:11,630
(We support single parents!)

772
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:14,569
It's an event for single mothers.

773
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,900
When things are hectic,
it's best to bury yourself in work.

774
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,980
Doctor, you have a visitor
in your office.

775
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,650
Ms. Jang told me about your mom.

776
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:40,489
I'm glad we were able to locate her,

777
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,730
but she still isn't taking my calls.

778
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,560
It's all my fault.

779
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,599
And I apologize, Chairman Gong.

780
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:51,069
I'm the one who's sorry.

781
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,299
This is all on me.

782
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,810
I wanted to be the fence
that kept you safe,

783
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,440
but all I did was hurt you.

784
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,650
I apologize on behalf of everyone,
Tae Kyung.

785
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,380
Please don't.

786
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,619
Don't force yourself
into an unwanted marriage.

787
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,389
You marrying a decent young lady...

788
00:56:12,389 --> 00:56:14,190
is what your mom and I want for you,

789
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,929
but there's nothing we can do...

790
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:20,060
if that's not what you want.

791
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:25,139
However, we can't
let this family fall apart.

792
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,270
I will persuade my own mother,

793
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:32,739
so all I ask is that
you do the same with yours.

794
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:36,750
We'll all get together in one place.

795
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,020
If we must be
at each other's throats,

796
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,480
we'll do it in person.

797
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,020
When I call,

798
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,219
bring your mother out with you.

799
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,429
That's all I ask, Tae Kyung.

800
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:55,770
Here.

801
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:00,469
Nice. You and your 20-20 vision.

802
00:57:00,909 --> 00:57:02,340
I'll patch up Soo Kyum's sock.

803
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:04,409
Are you leaving
without having breakfast?

804
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:05,710
It's the first day of school,

805
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,909
and I need to snag
the front row seat.

806
00:57:06,909 --> 00:57:08,580
You get seated
based on your eyesight,

807
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,310
so how can you sit in the front row?

808
00:57:10,409 --> 00:57:12,020
There's a way to everything.

809
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,119
The store will be vacated
in a few days,

810
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,389
so go to a renovation contractor
with your uncle.

811
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:19,690
- Got it.
- I want to go as well.

812
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:37,069
Ms. Oh, meet me in my office.

813
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,380
Come in.

814
00:57:42,279 --> 00:57:44,719
Yeon Doo,
can I borrow your car today?

815
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,049
Uncle and I need to meet
with a renovation contractor.

816
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,549
Sure. Take it.

817
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:50,690
Thanks.

818
00:57:51,389 --> 00:57:52,420
Dong Wook.

819
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,190
What is it?

820
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:57,130
What's your thought on me...

821
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,929
quitting my job
as an academy instructor?

822
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:00,130
Are you out of your mind?

823
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,770
Why would you quit...

824
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,569
when what you dreamed of
is within reach?

825
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:05,170
Don't you remember
what you went through...

826
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:06,739
to keep having
a career in this field?

827
00:58:07,469 --> 00:58:11,480
There's no need to yell.
I was only joking.

828
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,880
I won't quit, so you can get going.

829
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,960
(Old School)

830
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,659
Next up is Ms. Kang Bong Nim.

831
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,529
Can you tell me what this is?

832
00:58:34,299 --> 00:58:35,299
As if I wouldn't know.

833
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:37,739
It's a plane
which I've never been on.

834
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,270
It's a car.

835
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:44,239
Where on this circle
is it disconnected?

836
00:58:44,779 --> 00:58:47,509
Anyone would know that.
It's disconnected at the top.

837
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,480
Is that a circle and not a square?

838
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,750
Can you tell me what this is?

839
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,619
That darn geezer...

840
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,489
had to pick the number
that symbolizes death.

841
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:02,659
It's eight. I'm sure of it.

842
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,960
Ms. Kang, you have poor eyesight.

843
00:59:07,569 --> 00:59:09,099
In fact, your vision is the worst.

844
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:11,239
What now, Principal Jang?

845
00:59:11,469 --> 00:59:13,440
Should I sit up front?

846
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,049
You must be thrilled
to have the best seat.

847
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,980
I should hide in the back row
and have my lunch.

848
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,779
I keep forgetting what I learned...

849
00:59:25,779 --> 00:59:27,920
and should constantly ask questions
from that seat.

850
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:30,119
That's the best seat
to get to the restroom.

851
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:32,360
What if I wet myself?

852
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,360
Ladies, I'm sorry.

853
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,830
All that reading...

854
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,299
must've messed with my vision.

855
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,500
Ms. Kang Bong Nim.

856
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,440
(Ms. Kang Bong Nim,
you're on cleaning duty.)

857
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,110
Hold on. Why am I
on cleaning duty today...

858
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,779
when it's not my turn?

859
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:59,049
Look. You managed to read that.

860
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:02,020
It seems as though
you can read this.

861
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,020
Hold on.

862
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,759
Can you make out those tiny letters?

863
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,429
You must have 20-20 vision.

864
01:00:08,429 --> 01:00:11,299
Move to the back, Ms. Bong Nim!

865
01:00:11,299 --> 01:00:12,860
Unbelievable.

866
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:17,369
Ms. Bong Nim,

867
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,440
why did you lie on your eye exam?

868
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,009
I only wanted to get good grades.

869
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,840
Mr. Jang,
I need to get into college.

870
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,610
Are you suggesting
that the others don't want that?

871
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,610
Sorry?

872
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,150
Not everyone can get into college.

873
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,880
Only someone with grades
as good as mine...

874
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,319
You can lie
as long as you get good grades.

875
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,659
Is that what you taught
your children?

876
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:41,929
Why would you suddenly
bring up my kids?

877
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:43,489
My children are all sweet...

878
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:45,130
and never lied while growing up.

879
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,770
Maybe you should learn from them.

880
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,469
At times, even parents
learn from their children.

881
01:00:52,099 --> 01:00:54,170
Anyway, Mr. Jang...

882
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:55,509
Ms. Kang Bong Nim.

883
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,179
You were wrong to lie,
so you'll be on cleaning duty.

884
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,619
(Teachers' Office)

885
01:01:10,819 --> 01:01:14,119
You geezer.
Why are you always on my case?

886
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:32,840
Hey, your aunt told you
that her laptop was off limits.

887
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,610
Just a second.

888
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:36,949
The pink sweater is on sale.

889
01:01:37,409 --> 01:01:40,750
Get out. Come on.

890
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:52,730
(Reserved for Expectant Mothers)

891
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:16,590
That baby must be trying to survive.

892
01:02:17,389 --> 01:02:18,389
Like you.

893
01:02:18,389 --> 01:02:19,889
Don't you remember
what you went through...

894
01:02:19,889 --> 01:02:21,389
to keep having
a career in this field?

895
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,770
I see you're just like me.

896
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:41,880
You may be the principal,
but you sure are annoying.

897
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,909
I'll consider this as your face.

898
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,590
Who are you blaming
when you're the one who farted?

899
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,849
Why you...

900
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,960
Why are you cleaning
when it's not your turn?

901
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,460
Have you forgotten already?

902
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,690
The mother of
an academy star instructor...

903
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,599
lied her butt off.

904
01:02:58,799 --> 01:02:59,860
I know.

905
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,230
But my Yeon Doo
will soon sign a contract...

906
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:03,869
and make eight figures a year.

907
01:03:03,869 --> 01:03:05,170
- Eight figures?
- Eight figures?

908
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:06,369
Will she earn that much?

909
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:08,639
She'll earn 1,000 dollars
with every breath she takes.

910
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:11,139
But I'm a known liar,
so don't believe me.

911
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,179
What do you think
of my youngest son?

912
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,509
He's an assistant manager
at a large company.

913
01:03:14,509 --> 01:03:16,509
My nephew's a dentist.
Would you be interested?

914
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:18,179
How about a lawyer?
I live next door to one,

915
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:19,449
so why don't I set it up?

916
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:20,679
Save it.

917
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:22,349
I wouldn't trade...

918
01:03:22,349 --> 01:03:24,460
a whole truck of them
for Ms. Yeon Doo.

919
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:31,000
(The Korean Master, Oh Yeon Doo!
Edu Mind)

920
01:03:36,529 --> 01:03:39,069
Ms. Oh, what now?

921
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:54,819
Ms. Oh.

922
01:03:55,049 --> 01:03:58,790
This isn't what I had in mind when
I gave you the dried bellflower tea.

923
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,830
Do you have any idea how much damage
you've caused us?

924
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,299
Parents are calling nonstop...

925
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,630
asking for a refund
on their children's classes.

926
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:09,869
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

927
01:04:10,699 --> 01:04:12,540
This kind of conduct
from an unmarried woman?

928
01:04:13,299 --> 01:04:15,639
I don't even want to speak of it,

929
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:19,239
so get out of here
before I sue you for damages.

930
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:28,020
(Edu Mind)

931
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,719
Shouldn't you
get on your knees or something?

932
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,690
Shouldn't you get down and beg,

933
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,330
at least
for your poor mother's sake?

934
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:39,860
I guess you'll understand
how your mother feels...

935
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:41,529
once you have a kid like you.

936
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:43,500
What a good child.

937
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,340
Sir. Do you know...

938
01:04:50,969 --> 01:04:53,210
who made a big deal
out of something...

939
01:04:54,009 --> 01:04:55,650
that could've been
dealt with quietly?

940
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:58,119
I don't know.

941
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:00,920
You stole my ultrasound picture...

942
01:05:01,049 --> 01:05:02,849
had shared my private life
without permission.

943
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,250
What are you talking about?

944
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:07,020
Sir. This is just slander.

945
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:12,000
Slander? Who slandered who?

946
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,230
Go ahead and look
at the security camera footage...

947
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:16,569
and track the IP address.

948
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:18,569
No. Call the police right away.

949
01:05:18,569 --> 01:05:21,239
Ms. Oh!
Are you really going to be this way?

950
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,369
You already caused us
so much trouble.

951
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:27,810
Why are you harassing the person
who brings in the most revenue?

952
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,819
What? Harass?

953
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:33,650
Sir. Don't get angry.

954
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,849
How dare you raise your voice?

955
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:37,960
Don't you have any shame?

956
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,360
Is that how your mom taught you?

957
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,719
Stop talking about my mom!

958
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,599
I'm sorry
for causing the academy trouble,

959
01:05:44,759 --> 01:05:47,560
but is it wrong for a single woman
to get pregnant?

960
01:05:47,799 --> 01:05:49,670
Is what you did not wrong?

961
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,239
Is my pregnancy the only sin here?

962
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:52,670
Do I have shame?

963
01:05:53,139 --> 01:05:55,610
You used my weakness
to look good to your superiors.

964
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:57,040
Don't you feel shame about that?

965
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,179
Don't you feel ashamed
to face your students?

966
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,310
I can't work at such a dirty
and cheap place like this.

967
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:06,219
No. I'm not doing it!

968
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:06,840
(The Real Has Come!)

969
01:07:07,279 --> 01:07:08,679
It's money!

970
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:10,009
It could be a conception dream.

971
01:07:10,009 --> 01:07:11,080
A conception dream?

972
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,420
You're such an important daughter
to Mom.

973
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,449
Get rid of it right away.

974
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:16,790
Kim Jun Ha?

975
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,219
I didn't want to believe it.

976
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,960
This punk.

977
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,159
I'm going to get a divorce.

978
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:25,529
- Oh, my.
- Grandma!

979
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,599
Do you know Gong Tae Kyung?

980
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,730
Let's get married. You and I.

981
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:31,940
- What?
- What?
