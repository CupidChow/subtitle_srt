Oh. hello.

Do you know where
the patient named Oh Yeon Doo is?

I'm her mom.

Why did you not tell me
that you were pregnant?

12
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,350
Do you want it to haunt me later on?

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,480
Do you want to ruin my life or what?

Hey. that's enough.

This is good.

Hey. Dr. Stalker.
Get her an abortion now.

You're not the father.

such a horrible thing to my baby?

to make a move on you.

who would you make a baby with?

You treated me like trash.

Were you seeing him then?

106
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,280
Did you put the blame on me
while you were cheating too?

I wanted to give him everything.

171

You said he was a doctor.

let's find a better way.

Are you really pregnant?

184
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,100
Why ask
when you know the answer? Bye.

185
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,429
How far along are you?

186
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,669
How many weeks?

187
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,370
You can tell me that much.

188
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,980
I'm eight weeks along.

189
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,750
Two months. then.

190
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,220
You've been seeing him
for that long?

191
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,490
Wait.

192
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,589
Our 300th day together
was around that time.

193
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,130
You were with me
until the morning after!

194
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:08,959
So what?

195
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,929
Why did you ask me that then?

196
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,069
If things would be different
if we had a baby...

197
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,699
Is the baby really his?

198
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,510
Is it mine? Tell me now if it is.

199
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,010
Yeon Doo. Why are you so quiet?

200
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,309
Is the baby his or mine?

201
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,260
(My Jun Ha)

202
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,760
(Power Off)

203
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm drained.

204
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,740
Are you headed home?

205
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,110
Did something go down earlier?

206
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,339
A nurse asked me about it.

207
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,809
Was it a problem patient?
Or guardian?

208
00:11:58,449 --> 00:11:59,750
It was neither.

209
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,650
Your wedding's a week off.
Are preparations going well?

210
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:05,750
I don't know.

211
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,390
Yes. You feel all sorts of confusion
before the wedding.

212
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,589
Do you want a drink with a veteran?

213
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,439
I'm no veteran.
I signed the divorce papers.

214
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,120
- You're home.
- Ma'am.

215
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,919
What's all this?

216
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:41,890
She's redoing the interior tomorrow.

217
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,429
You should turn everything
into a house fit for newlyweds.

218
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,260
"Newlyweds?"

219
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,329
Did you think you fooled me?

220
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,929
You lied about
nursing me all night...

221
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:54,270
and also about being infertile.

222
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,669
Did you really think I didn't know?

223
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,439
You're the one who broke the rules.

224
00:12:57,669 --> 00:12:59,169
so the responsibility
is yours to bear.

225
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,809
Our relationship...

226
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:03,809
ends right here.

227
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,319
The call cannot be connected.

228
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,689
You haven't told them yet?

229
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,530
If you can't do it.
I'll tell them myself.

230
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,270
Mom.

231
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,240
Tae Kyung. get in here immediately.

232
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,390
I told her everything.

233
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,949
That I lied about being infertile.

234
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:49,620
What?

235
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,760
You still haven't been able
to shake off your tendencies.

236
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,929
I had you engaged so that
you'd be done being a womanizer,

237
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,870
but you didn't even wait long
to invite a woman into your hotel room.

238
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,900
A woman?

239
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,439
Look at you sleep unaware of
who nursed you all night.

240
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:13,750
Thank you for yesterday.

241
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:16,150
Drink lots of warm water...

242
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,380
and get well soon.

243
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:21,049
She has nothing to do with me.
Grandmother.

244
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:22,589
Once again.

245
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,589
you brazenly lie.

246
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,959
She said that about the woman...

247
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,900
who scribbled on your car.
calling you a cheater.

248
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,030
How can you be harassed
and nursed by a woman...

249
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,299
who has nothing to do with you?

250
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:36,240
She's only some pregnant lady.

251
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:37,569
A patient of mine to be exact.

252
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:40,470
What? She's pregnant?

253
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,909
You invited a pregnant woman
to your hotel room?

254
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,549
My goodness. You...

255
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:49,449
You couldn't keep up with your lies.
and now you're talking madness.

256
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,419
It's not like that.

257
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,490
It's all my fault. Ms. Eun.

258
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,360
Despite being anxious.
I should've nursed him myself...

259
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,890
and shouldn't have lied
about being infertile.

260
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,230
That's enough!

261
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,900
How dare you raise your voice
in front of me?

262
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,370
That's right. You're also to blame.

263
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,809
However. you were wrong
to make your fiancee anxious.

264
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:16,980
Bring her over if you're not lying.

265
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,949
Let me get to the bottom
of your relationship.

266
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:20,980
This instant.

267
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,390
Why aren't you answering me?

268
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,520
Have your mother come in here.

269
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,720
I ought to know
how she raised her son.

270
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,789
Ms. Eun. please don't.

271
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,059
Ms. Lee will be in shock
if she finds out.

272
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,459
What?

273
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,870
Mother. please come out here.

274
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What?

275
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:51,380
Why on earth is Chun Myung crying?

276
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,880
What upset my eldest grandson?

277
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:58,480
Mother. there was an issue
with the pregnancy.

278
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,990
What? My gosh.

279
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,020
- Ms. Eun!
- Goodness.

280
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,159
Where's Soo Jung?

281
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:03,760
She fainted
and was taken to the hospital.

282
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,020
Then. she went to her parents'.

283
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,289
Chun Myung will pack a bag
and head over there tomorrow morning.

284
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,199
My goodness. How did this happen?

285
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,130
How could have this happened?

286
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,669
Why are you just standing there?

287
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:20,970
Your immoral deeds are the reason
something bad happened to the family.

288
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
- You...
- Gosh.

289
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,679
My gosh.

290
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,679
Goodness me.

291
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,260
What are you getting at?

292
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,329
Why are you doing this to me?

293
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,699
Because I want to marry you.

294
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:48,000
Because I must marry you.

295
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,539
I just can't understand it.

296
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,039
Why are you hellbent
on getting married?

297
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Because it's an opportunity.

298
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,179
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
that could change my life.

299
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:02,480
What?

300
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,890
You should've been the grandson
your grandmother had approved of.

301
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,419
If you hadn't been the ugly duckling
who got ostracized by your family,

302
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,990
I wouldn't have had my chance.

303
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,289
Thanks to you.
I have a way to join the family.

304
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,359
Thank you...

305
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,430
for letting me share your privilege.

306
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,700
Finally. you show your claws.

307
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,680
Hasn't it occurred to you that
I might expose your ulterior motive?

308
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,740
Go ahead.

309
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,740
This time around.

310
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,579
I'll say that you're lying
to get out of the marriage.

311
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,520
Jang Se Jin...

312
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:37,619
You saw how it went earlier.

313
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,789
No one will believe a word
you say anymore.

314
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,160
Be with all the women you want.

315
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,930
Just be sure
not to ruin my marriage to you.

318
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,510
Yes. I'm home.

319
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,179
I'm doing fine.
so don't worry about me.

320
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,050
Being at my parents'
calmed me down as well.

321
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:17,419
You're the one
who shouldn't worry about me.

322
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:22,250
By the way...

323
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,119
What is it?

324
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:32,429
How would our Chalttuk
have looked like?

325
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:34,770
Why would you imagine that?

326
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,840
I was curious. that's all.

327
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:41,369
If we had gotten an ultrasound image.
we would've seen Chalttuk's face.

328
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Soo Jung.

329
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,909
Stop thinking about Chalttuk.
You're hurting yourself.

330
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:49,609
I'm not thinking about Chalttuk.

331
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:52,050
Why would I think of a baby...

332
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:54,020
who left its parents?

333
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,659
Right.

334
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,429
We should forget about Chalttuk now.

335
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,790
Get some rest.

336
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,060
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

337
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:06,899
Sure.

338
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,240
I'm perfectly fine.

339
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,240
so sleep tight.

340
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,010
- I'll hang up. then.
- Sure.

341
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,080

00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:53,649

00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,099
We need to talk.

346
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,230
Just a second.

347
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,139
Yes. sir.

348
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:53,310
I'll go with the property
you showed me yesterday.

349
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,909
The sooner. the better.

350
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,310
Sure. Please call me
when you get in touch...

with the landlord.

352
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,909
What kind of property lease
are you signing?

353
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,020
I'll need a place to stay
when I move out.

354
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,250
A place to stay? Already?

355
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,419
"Already" isn't the word I'd use.

356
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,090
The consideration period
is almost over.

357
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,119
What did you want to say to me?

358
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,599
Forget it. You don't even
have the right to hear it,

359
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,899
so head to work.

360
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:20,869
I'm going to have breakfast first.

361
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,899
Must you bite my head off
first thing in the morning?

362
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,580
Darn it.

363
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,189
Chalttuk.

364
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,359
Did you hate
your loser of a father that much?

365
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,270
Couldn't you still have come
into this world, though?

366
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:55,929
Your mom...

367
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:02,109
Your mom is having a rough time.

368
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,750
Couldn't you have helped your mom?

369
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,179
I'm skipping breakfast today.

370
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:18,820
Chun Myung.

371
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:23,230
Why are you back already?
I said I'd go to you today.

372
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,199
I should've put this away.

373
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,500
I came because I was worried
that you'd be like this.

374
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,609
I thought you might cry
while organizing Chalttuk's things.

375
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,849
Honey.

376
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,149
Sorry. honey.

377
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,849
It's all my fault.

378
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,320
You went through all of that trouble
trying IVF because of me.

379
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,330
I'm sorry I made you feel sad too.

380
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:58,359
Why is that because of you?

381
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,300
I was the one who insisted on having
a baby that took after you.

382
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:05,540
No. I knew you were struggling.
but I pretended as if I didn't know.

383
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,369
I thought everything would be fine
once we had the baby.

384
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:09,840
I was being selfish.

385
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,310
I'm so sorry. honey.

386
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,310
Let's just...

387
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,419
give it all up.

388
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:18,720
Let's...

389
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,649
let Chalttuk go. honey.

390
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:29,560
How can we let Chalttuk go?

391
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,599
I can't.

392
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Honey.

393
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:38,500
I won't be able to live
if something were to happen to you.

394
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,580
Soo Jung.

395
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,139
If you keep being this way.

396
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:48,480
Chalttuk...

397
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:53,349
won't be able to leave in peace.

398
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,820
Let's let Chalttuk go.

399
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:11,000
Chalttuk.

400
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:15,310
I was so happy...

401
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,080
that you were in my belly...

402
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:21,949
at least for a few days.

403
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,520
Thank you.

404
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,490
Don't cry. It's okay.

405
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,189
- Don't cry.
- Chalttuk. Goodbye.

406
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,899
Did you give Yu Myung a call?

407
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:46,040
She should attend
her brother's wedding.

408
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,169
She said she would come to Korea
sometime this week.

409
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,810
Why isn't Chun Myung coming down?

410
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,040
He should eat
and go see his wife soon.

411
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,109
- Soo Jung.
- What?

412
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,250
When did you get here?

413
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,619
Are you feeling okay?

414
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:04,020
Grandma. Father. Mother.

415
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,560
We're going to give up
on having a baby.

416
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,929
I can no longer watch
Soo Jung struggling.

417
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:15,730
Okay. You both went through a lot.

418
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,199
You made a hard decision
while still in recovery.

419
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:23,209
Mother. Father. I'm sorry.

420
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,909
Grandmother. I'm sorry.

421
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:28,480
It's okay.

422
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:32,580
The universe is being severe.
What can we do about that?

423
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,949
Sit down and eat. I'm done.

424
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:37,889
Gosh.

425
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,199
Mother.

426
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,300
Are you okay?

427
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,709
Gosh. I guess we won't hear...

428
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,679
an infant's cry
in this house anymore.

429
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,879
Chun Myung can't have a baby.

430
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,849
Ji Myung's working all the time.
I'm sure they won't have one.

431
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,449
Yu Myung is still a baby herself.

432
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,919
We still have Tae Kyung.

433
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,159
He's getting married soon.

434
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:15,030
Tae Kyung isn't blood-related.

435
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,629
Who cares if he has a baby or not?

436
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,929
I'm worried
he's going to use his baby...

437
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:22,470
to make my kids feel bad.

438
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,470
Don't be ridiculous.

439
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,679
No one will believe a word
you say anymore.

440
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:38,149
Be with all the women you want.

441
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:41,050
Just be sure
not to ruin my marriage to you.

442
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,290
Tae Kyung.

443
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,899
Why are you standing there
like that?

444
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:57,169
I was so busy yesterday.
I couldn't even ask.

445
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:00,199
Did you get scolded
by Grandma again?

446
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,840
- Mom.
- Okay.

447
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,310
Did something happen with Se Jin?

448
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:09,349
Tell me.

449
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,060
It's nothing.

450
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,260
You know guys have that thing...

451
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,290
where they get nervous
before their wedding.

452
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,500
I'll go wash up.

453
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,359
The phone is turned off.

454
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:06,470
Hello? Se Jin?

455
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,939
Who are you?
Why are you looking for Se Jin?

456
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,080
Hello. This is Tae Kyung.

457
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,580
I wanted to ask her about
our homework.

458
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:14,349
Se Jin's sleeping right now.

459
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,750
We're moving out tomorrow.

460
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,050
so don't call Se Jin from now on.

461
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:22,349
Your family will misunderstand.

462
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,619
Ms. Joo.

463
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,240
What are you doing?

464
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,010
Let go.

465
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,209
Why didn't you come yesterday?

466
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,109
You're moving out?
What does that mean?

467
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:54,020
You like me. don't you?

468
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,290
What?

469
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,189
Actually. I like you too.

470
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,560
How much do you like me?

471
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:09,369
A lot.

472
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:13,199
You're being fooled again.

473
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,310
What? You were fooled by me.

474
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,109
I acted as if I liked you...

475
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:23,609
to see if you would fall for me.

476
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:26,280
But...

477
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,189
you fell for me too easily.
It's not fun.

478
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Bye.

479
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,159
Why did you hang out with me
all this time?

480
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:38,730
Why did you accept the necklace?

481
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,730
I just told you.

482
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:42,300
I was playing with you.

483
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:45,599
Why? You don't believe me?

484
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,510
My family may have gone bankrupt.

485
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,980
and we may be living in your house.

486
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,510
but how could I like a guy like you?

487
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:56,250
Why are you doing this to me?

488
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:58,550
- Because you're easy.
- I'm easy?

489
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,550
Yes.

490
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:02,919
Everyone in that house
treats you badly.

491
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,990
They look down on you
because you're leeching off of them.

492
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,889
So I tried treating you badly too.

493
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:12,699
It's okay to treat you like that.

494
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,770
Nobody told you to fall for me.

495
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:20,909
Take it back.

496
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,740
This necklace is cheap like you.

497
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:53,300
Is the baby really his?

498
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,540
Is it mine? Tell me now if it is.

499
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:05,879
Hey. Why are you putting
your spoon down?

500
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:07,020
Eat some more.

501
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,250
It's okay. Uncle. I'll eat later.

502
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,490
Auntie. Is the guy you had
a one-night stand with...

503
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,590
going to be my uncle?

504
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,389
- What?
- What?

505
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:18,659
I heard everything last night.

506
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,369
But what's a one-night stand. Dad?

507
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:24,040
You shouldn't eavesdrop
on adult conversations.

508
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,939
I didn't eavesdrop.

509
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,169
I can hear everything
even when people whisper.

510
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:29,240
What am I supposed to do?

511
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,639
Soo Kyum. You can't go around
saying things like that.

512
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,810
You'll get in big trouble.

513
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:37,010
By the way. where did Mom go. Uncle?

514
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,050
What?

515
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:45,260
(Gong Obstetrics and Gynecology)

516
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,429
Good morning. Dr. Gong.

517
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,970
I'm very sorry about yesterday.

518
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,470
Oh. yes.

519
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,290
This is the handkerchief you lent me
in the nurse's office.

520
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,520
It's so fascinating. right?

521
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,419
I was almost about to die
choking on bibimbap.

522
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,290
The person who saved my life...

523
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:24,760
was you.

524
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,599
Yes. I am.

525
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,240
What are you doing back here?

526
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,010
Yeon Doo told me...

527
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:39,139
the baby was a result
of a one-night stand.

528
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:43,580
I'm sure it wasn't planned.
but what can we do?

529
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,820
She's carrying a baby.
and it's growing.

530
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,349
Is that what she said?

531
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,359
She doesn't know I'm here.

532
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,330
You don't dislike her. do you?

533
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:58,730
Well. "dislike" is a strong word.

534
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,800
If you don't dislike her.
then it's fine.

535
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,599
Lots of couples get pregnant
before they get married.

536
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:09,909
There's a reason people even say
a baby is considered dowry.

537
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,280
You and Yeon Doo...

538
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:14,980
will get married. won't you?

539
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:21,220
We won't.

540
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:22,949
Why...

541
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,290
Why not?

542
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,889
Did Ms. Oh not tell you?

543
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:32,929
I respect her decision to have...

544
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,300
and raise the baby on her own.

545
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:48,250
"Respect?"

546
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,419
What kind of respect is that?

547
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,389
What about the baby's surname?

548
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:56,790
What family name should it have?

549
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,889
Ms. Oh said
she'd give it her surname.

550
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,230
You're putting the burden on her
in a sly and crafty manner.

551
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,859
You had your fun.
and now you're ditching her?

552
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:09,300
You're going to ignore
the seed you sowed?

553
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,240
Vent your frustration
at Ms. Oh, not at me.

554
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,340
I have nothing more to say.

555
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,850
I can't believe
someone like you is a gynecologist.

556
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,459
What an insult!

558
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,541
You're pregnant. I'll do the dishes.

559
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:47,810
Give me the gloves.

560
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,711
It's okay. Uncle.

561
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:51,881
What's taking Mom so long?

562
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,510
She just went up the hill nearby.

563
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:56,280
What? Well...

564
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Hang on.

565
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,620
Your phone's ringing.

566
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,751
"Gong Tae Kyung?"

567
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:07,321
Excuse me.

568
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,671
Hello?

569
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:17,401
What do you think you're doing?

570
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:19,801
What's this about a one-night stand?

571
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:22,541
What? Who said that?

572
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:24,881
Your mother just left.

573
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,751
She thinks terribly of me...

574
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,780
because I said I wouldn't marry you!

575
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,881
I didn't think
she'd visit you again.

576
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,890
Sorry.

577
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,421
I don't care if you're...

578
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,990
What now?

579
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:41,691
Why didn't you sort things out?

580
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:44,660
Why are you so angry?

581
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,830
You told me to do whatever I wanted.

582
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,501
And if I told my mom the truth.

583
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:51,771
she'd rush over to see Jun Ha.

584
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:53,341
I couldn't let her do that.

585
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:54,671
Whatever.

586
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,370
We're both responsible.
so let's discuss this in person.

587
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:59,211
Come to the cafe by my clinic.

588
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,051
What?

589
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,961
The patient's mom
who caused a scene yesterday came back?

590
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:15,490
Yes. and they got in a fuss again.

591
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,501
- Dr. Gong.
- Take my next patient.

592
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:19,530
I won't be out for long.

593
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:23,830
What could be going on?

594
00:36:28,211 --> 00:36:29,211
Gong Tae Kyung!

595
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,381
Why do you keep showing up?

596
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,551
Why are you copying me?

597
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:40,850
The same clothes. the same car.

598
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,350
and now the same woman?

599
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:44,251
Who's copying whom?

600
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,120
I don't share your terrible taste.

601
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,291
You did the terrible stuff.
so shut your mouth.

602
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:51,030
You're the dirtbag who stole my girlfriend
and knocked her up.

603
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,160
"Dirtbag?"

604
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,830
Who are you calling dirty
when you had an affair too?

605
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,030
Be quiet!

606
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,870
Yeon Doo used to care for
no one but me.

607
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:02,071
She'd never cheat on me first.

608
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,771
How did you seduce her?

609
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,010
I didn't.

610
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,051
If you'd satisfied her.

611
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:10,481
she wouldn't have dated me.

612
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:13,850
You're an embarrassment to men.

613
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,191
If you have issues down there.

614
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,450
see a urologist. not a gynecologist.

615
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,691
How dare you...

616
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Darn you.

617
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:24,091
Come here.

618
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,660
You punk.

619
00:37:27,231 --> 00:37:28,231
Darn it.

620
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,801
Hey. you. Come here.

621
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,771
I'll kill you.

622
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,481

Your name. age. and address.

626

He knocked up my girlfriend.

628
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:27,291
He's even worse trash.

629
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,990
He cheated on his girlfriend first.

630
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:33,801
What kind of tragedy is this?

631
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,001
Okay. Mr. Trash and Mr. Worse Trash.

632

Why can't you say?

634
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,240
For fear of being humiliated?

635
00:38:44,211 --> 00:38:45,580
Why would I be humiliated?

636
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,381
I did nothing wrong.

637
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,080

What's going on?

Why won't you say?

If you're not the dad I am.
so speak up.

648
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,370
Whose baby is she having?

649
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,111
Is it yours or mine?

650

00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,651
And they don't know who the dad is?

652
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,051
I guess only the woman knows.

- I don't want to.
- Neither do I.

00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,430
What do you want to do. then?

658
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:44,401
Do both dad candidates
want to end up in lockup?

659
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,970
Yeon Doo. I'm glad you're here.

660
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,740
Look what he did to...

661
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,310
What happened? Who did this to you?

662
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,111
Don't bother.

663
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,291
Are you more worried about him
when I'm right here?

664
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,521
Yes. I beat him up.

665
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:09,990
I was going to kill him.
but I didn't.

666
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,301
You cheated on me with him
and got pregnant.

667
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,301
Wouldn't you be angry
if you were me?

668
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:16,830
What excuse do you have?

669
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,640
- So what?
- Tell me.

670
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:20,470
Who's the dad?

671
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,640
Neither of you will say
as if you're colluding.

672
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,711
Don't avoid the question.

673
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,740
Only you can answer.

674
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,291
- Ms. Oh.
- Don't say a word.

675
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:41,890
I'll ask you again.

676
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,091
Your baby.

677
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,530
Is it mine?

678
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:50,771
Is it his?

679
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:00,310
It's mine.

680
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:03,051
It's yours?
This isn't some word game.

681
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,180
Quit joking around and...

682
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,180
It's yours.

683
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,850
Okay?

684
00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:10,720
- What?
- It's your baby.

685
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,861
What'll you do now?

686
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:14,760
Will you be a responsible dad?

687
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:19,600
I'll take responsibility.

688
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,430
Why can't I?

689
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,671
Then why did you
tell me to abort it?

690
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:27,140
When I asked if a baby
would change things between us,

691
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,341
and when you realized
I was pregnant,

692
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:32,640
you yelled and told me to abort it
so I wouldn't trap you.

693
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,780
You don't care about me at all.

694
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:38,021
You don't want to
take care of the baby.

695
00:41:38,021 --> 00:41:41,080
You can't stand that
I might have been with someone else!

696
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,591
Nothing you do...

697
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:44,921
will make this baby yours!

698
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Let's go.

699
00:41:57,271 --> 00:41:58,671
Are you sure it's not mine?

700
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,111
You clearly said I was not the dad.

701
00:42:07,111 --> 00:42:08,810
Don't change your mind later.

702
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,651
What is the matter with you?

703
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,521
Don't bother.

704
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,950
I don't have to see
what his kid will end up like.

705
00:42:16,321 --> 00:42:18,120
Good luck raising it.

706
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:32,541
Don't you dare
shoot your mouth off again...

707
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:34,301
about him...

708
00:42:35,671 --> 00:42:36,711
or this baby.

709
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,551
- But...
- Just one more dab.

710
00:43:23,191 --> 00:43:25,260
Hang in there even if it stings.

711
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,260
Let me get a bandage on there.

712
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:32,961
Don't you regret it?

713
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,441
I don't.

714
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,341
Then it's all good.

715
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:52,450
Why do we always
get mixed up this way?

716
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:58,361
No matter how I think about it.
it sure is odd.

717
00:44:05,131 --> 00:44:06,231
Mr. Gong?

718
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:08,370
Right.

719
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:10,970
I thought about it too.

720
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,740
and you weren't wrong
about this being odd.

721
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:18,881
The one who first knew
about your pregnancy.

722
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:23,350
The one who you sought out
to have an abortion.

723
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:26,881
The one...

724
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:30,390
who told you that
you lost one of the babies.

725
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:32,291
It was all me.

726
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,861
In addition to that.
you even claimed...

727
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,160
to be the father.

728
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:44,030
I guess you can say
we've been through a lot.

729
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,341
We both witnessed the worst moment
of each other's lives.

730
00:44:57,711 --> 00:44:59,321
I'm glad. though.

731
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,551
We were both in the worst situation.

732
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:05,760
But I'm in the clear now...

733
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,231
and so are you.

734
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:12,330
Not me.

735
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,470
What are you talking about?

736
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,370
I think I'll end up married.

737
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:28,180
How can you marry someone
who told such a lie?

738
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:31,510
It just happened that way.

739
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:36,321
Isn't there a way out of it?

740
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,220
If I run from this.
my mom will suffer.

741
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,660
There simply
isn't a way out of this.

742
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,231
I'm sorry.

743
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:52,671
You have helped me numerous times.

744
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,970
but I can't be of help to you.

745
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:01,140
Here. You treated this wound.

746
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:04,151
I'm fine. so head home.

747
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:08,720
Stop feeling guilty and go.

748
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,691
If you ever need my help.
don't hesitate to ask.

749
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:17,191
And apply more ointment
so that it doesn't get infected.

750
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:19,361
I'll get going. then.

751
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,970
Be with all the women you want.

752
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:02,771
Just be sure
not to ruin my marriage to you.

753
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,010
Isn't there a way out of it?

754
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,850
We can't do a DNA test
on an unborn baby.

755
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:12,350
If you ever need my help.
don't hesitate to ask.

(tteokbokkisubs.com)

757
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,760
What is it. Mr. Gong?

758
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,941
Let's get married. Ms. Oh.

759
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,570
- What did you just...
- Be my fake fiancée.

760
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:03,111
What are you saying?

761
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,180
Revealing that
I'm not your baby's father...

762
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,180
puts you in a predicament.

763
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,081
Meanwhile. I need someone
who can ruin my marriage.

764
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,421
You need me. and I need you back.

765
00:48:13,921 --> 00:48:17,320
I honestly don't get
what you're saying.

766
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:19,861
I won't be forced into a marriage
as long as I have this baby.

767
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,001
I'll be the father of your child.

768
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,331
Stop joking around.
I'm offended as is.

769
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,171
It won't be for long. Ms. Oh.

770
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,401
Let go of me.

771
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,780
I didn't mean to say that
you were the father of this baby.

772
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,010
But now you want
to knowingly lie to people.

773
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,081
Do I seem that easy to you?

774
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,590
I'll tell my family today
that you're not the baby's father,

775
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,490
so cut the nonsense and run along.

776
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,461
I must be
a terrible judge of character.

777
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:54,331
You said...

778
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,831
I could come to you for help.

779
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,280
Ms. Oh!

780
00:49:21,651 --> 00:49:25,291
How could she have gotten mixed up
with such an irresponsible jerk?

781
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:28,361
My poor Yeon Doo.

782
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:32,030
She'll really end up
an unwed single mother at this rate.

783
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,271
Bong Nim.
if he's being an outright jerk,

784
00:49:39,671 --> 00:49:41,611
we can go to his parents.

785
00:49:43,711 --> 00:49:45,510
- What?
- He's right.

786
00:49:45,711 --> 00:49:48,151
His parents won't stay put
knowing that she's pregnant.

787
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,481
How do we find his parents. though?

788
00:49:55,351 --> 00:49:58,061
Do you see this? Gong Tae Kyung?

789
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:59,760
That's my name.

790
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:01,631
His ID card.

791
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:05,300
I remember that his address had
a five and was in Pyeongcha-dong.

792
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,970
But I can't remember the rest.

793
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,700
That's crazy.
You only saw it for one second.

794
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,410
How could you remember that?

795
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,311
There's a reason
why I excel in class...

796
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:16,910
even though
I started studying at this age.

797
00:50:17,211 --> 00:50:18,950
Your mom has 20-20 vision.

798
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,651
However. I can't be sure
of her memorization.

799
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,280
Why you...

800
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:23,881
Mom. are you asleep?

801
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,220
Mom. I'm coming in.

802
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,631
Your mom's asleep.
She must be tired.

803
00:50:38,131 --> 00:50:41,200
Really?
But I heard her a second ago.

804
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,001
- She suddenly fell asleep.
- Right.

805
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,311
I'll wake her up. then.
I have something to tell her.

806
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,370
Not so fast.

807
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:49,680
How shameless are you?

808
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,811
Don't stress her out even more.

809
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:54,180
Just get to bed. Go on.

810
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,450
- What's with you?
- Go.

811
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:58,180
- But...
- Go on.

812
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,090
What's with him?

813
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:09,200
Let's get married. Ms. Oh.

814
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:11,731
I'll be the father of your child.

815
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,401
Darn it.

816
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,751
What?

817
00:51:26,111 --> 00:51:28,581
Where's Mom? Did she go out already?

818
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:29,780
Yes. she did.

819
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,751
And Uncle Dae Sang is out
taking Soo Kyum to kindergarten.

820
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,021
Why? Do you miss
your family members already?

821
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:38,021
Why did Mom go out so early?

822
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,691
Do you think
she's trying to avoid me?

823
00:51:45,671 --> 00:51:48,001
I'm so stressed out to find a job
that I have no appetite.

824
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,300
Maybe I need a new haircut.

825

we will be arriving...

826
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,840

- Stop it, Jay.

- I'll go get changed.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

we are now approaching
Incheon International Airport.

829
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,081
I can't do this.

830
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,090
I don't want to be away from you.

831
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,561
It will be only a week.

832

My dear. Let me see your face.

841
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,351
Did you come alone?

842
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:17,191
Of course. I told you not to come.
Why are you here?

843
00:53:17,191 --> 00:53:18,490
I was going to see you
at home anyway.

844

I can follow you wherever you go.

845
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,561
I would even come back
from the underworld just to see you.

846
00:53:23,561 --> 00:53:24,901
Why would you go to the underworld?

847
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,070
You can't die leaving me alone.

848

after Grandma.

about me, Yu Myung.

give you a hard time again?

- Grandma. don't be so mean to Mom.
- All right.

857

Fine. I'll be nice to her
while you're here.

00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,851
You look beautiful.

898
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,950
The wedding invitation makes me realize
that you're getting married.

899
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:32,521
You look so happy.

900
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:35,751
Now we will be serving you
as your secretaries.

901
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,490
Having someone work for me?
I just can't imagine that.

902
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,660
Please come to my wedding
and celebrate it.

903
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:43,001
- Of course.
- Sure.

904
00:56:58,510 --> 00:56:59,711
Executive Assistant Jang speaking.

905
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,081
This is Security.

906
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:03,780
A man named Kim Jun Ha
wants to meet you.

907
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,990
I don't know such a man.
Please turn him away.

908
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,521
Tell Jang Se Jin to come here.

909
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,231
I need to talk to her.

910
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:17,430
She doesn't want to meet you.
Please leave.

911
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:20,800
Move over.

912
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:22,870
Who are you to stop me
from seeing her?

913
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,300
You have to stop if you don't
want to get into trouble.

914
00:57:26,311 --> 00:57:28,140
Trouble? Go ahead and do it.

915
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,240
Go ahead and put me in trouble.

916
00:57:36,021 --> 00:57:38,450
Get off me. Let go.

917
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:40,921
Why are both Oh Yeon Doo
and Jang Se Jin doing this to me?

918
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:42,620
Come on out. Jang Se Jin!

919
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,320
If you don't listen to me.
you'll regret it.

920
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,291
I'll make you regret it.
Come on out!

921
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:54,370
This is really happening.

922
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:57,870
You're going
to be my daughter-in-law.

923
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:02,340
I didn't know you'd be
my father-in-law, either.

924
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,351
Right. No one saw this coming.

925
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:08,510
So what do you want to do at work?

926
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,021
Pardon?

927
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:13,320
I can't let my daughter-in-law
serve as my assistant.

928
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,861
You've worked hard.
so it's okay to take some time off.

929
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,490
Or I can transfer you
to another department if you want.

930
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:23,561
If you don't mind. Mr. Gong...

931
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,840
I'd like to work
in the Financial Department.

932
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,010
Financial Department? Why?

933
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:40,251
Do you think Gong Chun Myung is
easy to deal with?

934
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:43,251
Hey. watch what you say.

935
00:58:43,251 --> 00:58:44,680
Who is the man?

936
00:58:45,381 --> 00:58:48,421
The one who was asking for you
in the lobby.

937
00:58:50,691 --> 00:58:51,720
A man?

938
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:56,061
I don't know him.
so I turned him away.

939
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:58,001
I'll make sure to check again
what it was about.

940
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:02,001
I thought
he was your ex or something.

941
00:59:02,001 --> 00:59:03,001
Ji Myung.

942
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:12,581
What's with all the fuss?

943
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:14,910
Can't you take care
of an uninvited visitor?

944
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,581
I'm sorry. Ms. Jang.

945
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,021
You know I'm getting married soon.

946
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,990
Now that I'm marrying
the chairman's son,

947
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:25,620
all sorts of strange people are
trying to get to me.

948
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:28,890
If anything happens
to get in the way of my wedding,

949
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,430
will you take responsibility?

950
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,700
We will put him on the blacklist...

951
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,601
so he can't come near the office.

952
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,470
I'll be sure
to remember your hard work.

953
00:59:40,441 --> 00:59:41,441
You're dismissed.

954
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:11,171
(Se Jin)

955
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:14,740
(Se Jin)

956
01:00:41,101 --> 01:00:42,271
You said you finished it.

957
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:43,541
Why are you doing this?

958
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:44,840
Gosh. stop it.

959
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,970
Before I die.

960
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,010
- Just once.
- Just once.

961
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,640
- Mr. Jang.
- Yes?

962
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,811
Have you not found
our homeroom teacher yet?

963
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:58,120
No. I promise I'll find
a good teacher for you soon.

964
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,450
I'll call the attendance.

965
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:02,861
Ms. Kang Bong Nim.

966
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:05,061
What?

967
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:06,561
What?

968
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:08,260
Is Bong Nim in the restroom?

969
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,631
It's me who went to the restroom.

970
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:13,470
Bong Nim is not here yet.

971
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:15,731
Isn't Ms. Kang Bong Nim here yet?

972
01:01:15,731 --> 01:01:17,240
- No.
- No.

973
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:22,840
Hello?

974
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:24,441
Is this Bong Nim's place?

975
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:26,280
Is Bong Nim home?

976
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,680
She went to school.

977
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:29,921
School?

978
01:01:30,151 --> 01:01:31,950
Is there another school
that she goes to?

979
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:33,691
What are you talking about?

980
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,550
Why didn't she come to school?

981
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:39,260
What? Mom didn't go to school?

982
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:47,501
Who is it?

983
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:52,101
Does a man named Gong Tae Kyung
live in this house?

984
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:54,240
No. he doesn't live here.
Please leave.

985
01:01:58,611 --> 01:01:59,611
Gosh.

986
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:03,251
(Pyeongcha-ro. Jongseo-gu. Seoul)

987
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:09,890
Gosh. it's such a big neighborhood.

988
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:12,760
I just can't find him.

989
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,660
I'm telling you. He's my son-in-law.

990
01:02:18,831 --> 01:02:21,271
As you said.
this is Dr. Gong's wedding invitation.

991
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,570
I never thought he'd get married.

992
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:25,800
Look how pretty my daughter is.

993
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,570
Who would refuse her?

994
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,611
Make sure to spread the word
that Dr. Gong is engaged...

995
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:35,950
so no woman will flirt with him.

996
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:42,021
You know Dr. Gong Tae Kyung. right?

997
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:44,090
He's going to be my son-in-law.

998
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:47,260
He's the son of NX Group's owner.

999
01:02:47,961 --> 01:02:50,501
The wedding will take place
at a fancy wedding hall,

1000
01:02:50,501 --> 01:02:53,271
and we will be serving a meal
worth over 200 dollars.

1001
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,901
Please come to the wedding
and have some steak.

1002
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:09,680
Let's get married. Ms. Oh.

1003
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:12,381
Be my fake fiancée.

1004
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:17,990
You crazy freak.

1005
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:23,200
My son-in-law.

1006
01:03:23,561 --> 01:03:28,171
Look at you.
You look great in that gown.

1007
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:32,240
You're wearing a doctor's gown.
but you look like a model.

1008
01:03:33,941 --> 01:03:35,140
What brings you here?

1009
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:38,780
I just wanted to look
around your office...

1010
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,510
and hand out wedding invitations.

1011
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:43,620
Oh. right. I hear Yu Myung is back.

1012
01:03:43,851 --> 01:03:45,180
Take me to your place.

1013
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:47,550
My place?

1014
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,271
My goodness.

1015
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:44,280
Hello. Mr. Gong.

1016
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,811
Hello. Ms. Joo.
You're here with Tae Kyung.

1017
01:04:48,381 --> 01:04:50,720
I went to his office
to take a look around...

1018
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,521
and hand out
the wedding invitations.

1019
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,291
I'm so happy.

1020
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:59,590
By the way. the father-in-law
and the daughter-in-law.

1021
01:04:59,831 --> 01:05:01,631
The mother-in-law
and the son-in-law.

1022
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,861
How beautiful this is.

1023
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,401
Oh. right.

1024
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,401
Of course.

1025
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:12,441
this is even more beautiful.

1026
01:05:13,111 --> 01:05:14,470
Come on. Mom.

1027
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:15,941
I agree this looks nice.

1028
01:05:16,441 --> 01:05:18,111
Tae Kyung. let's go in.

1029
01:05:18,111 --> 01:05:19,640
Shall we?

1030
01:05:26,151 --> 01:05:29,220
I'm shocked!
Are you really getting married?

1031
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,961
Why? What's the reason?

1032
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:33,961
I thought you had
a fear of marriage just like me.

1033
01:05:33,961 --> 01:05:34,990
Yu Myung.

1034
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,861
Your future sister-in-law is here.
What are you saying?

1035
01:05:38,731 --> 01:05:41,731
I thought Grandma was lying
just to make me come home.

1036
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:45,171
Why are you marrying Tae Kyung?
You don't even love him.

1037
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,410
The thing is...

1038
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:50,180
How would she marry him
if she didn't love him?

1039
01:05:50,581 --> 01:05:53,481
Look. They look beautiful together.

1040
01:05:53,611 --> 01:05:56,111
They will make a happy couple.

1041
01:05:56,381 --> 01:05:58,151
Don't you think so. Ms. Eun?

1042
01:05:58,151 --> 01:05:59,351
Of course.

1043
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:03,160
They will be a couple
who live happily ever after.

1044
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,731
Is this Mr. Gong Tae Kyung's place?

1045
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:16,171
What?

1046
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:28,811
Mr. Gong Tae Kyung!

1047
01:06:29,311 --> 01:06:31,921
I know this is
Mr. Gong Tae Kyung's place.

1048
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,731
(The Real Has Come!)

1049
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:22,271
I proposed
to Ms. Oh Yeon Doo yesterday.

1050
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:24,800
He's my son-in-law as of today.
He's my family.

1051
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:25,970
Let your mother-in-law
fill your glass.

1052
01:07:26,811 --> 01:07:28,041
My goodness.

1053
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,140
I'm just happy.

1054
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,111
I really like this family.

1055
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,220
Will you be my uncle
and live here with us?

1056
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:41,151
Mr. Jang's daughter is
getting married tomorrow.

1057
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:43,120
Gong Tae Kyung. that brat
is getting married tomorrow.

1058
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:45,691
Mr. Gong Tae Kyung
isn't the father of my baby.

1059
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:48,231
I lied.

1060
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:49,561
Your mom is gone.

1061
01:07:49,561 --> 01:07:50,831
Don't try to look for me.

1062
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,430
What if something happens to Mom?
What should we do?

1063
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,271
You. the biggest scumbag
in the world.
