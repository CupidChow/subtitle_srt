00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:28,494
<i>Who are you?</i>

3
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:37,244
Here we go again!

4
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:41,874
Ms. Oh! Stop working on your teaching material at night and get some sleep!

5
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:44,984
How strange.

6
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:48,294
There was definitely one.

7
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:50,424
What do you mean?

8
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:55,284
In my dream, a rabbit ran over to me.

9
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:59,574
But it suddenly became two.

10
00:00:59,574 --> 00:01:00,854
The rabbits?

11
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,454
Two of them?

12
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:06,074
Catching two rabbits.

13
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:08,434
Work and love. Love and work.

14
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:12,014
Aren't you getting married and getting a raise soon, too?

15
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:16,364
Over there. Don't you see? 
 <i>[Best Faculty Are Here To Guide You On A Path To Success]</i>

16
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:21,834
I'm No. 2, who's way smaller, even in the poster. 
 <i>[Literature: Yoon Gi Chang, Literature: Oh Yeon Doo]</i>

17
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,554
Just make my makeup looks good.

18
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:25,534
You're successful. Don't be silly.

19
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:28,594
Don't forget about me even when you become the No. 1 lecturer with a 100 million won salary.

20
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:31,664
Of course, I won't!

21
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:36,314
- Ms. Oh! We have ten minutes to go! 
 - Okay!

22
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:38,134
Hurry! Hurry!

23
00:01:40,284 --> 00:01:42,874
<i>[Episode 1]</i> 
 - Do I look okay? 
 - Yes.

24
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:44,794
You look amazing!

25
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:47,664
Text me if I start talking fast when you're monitoring.

26
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:49,864
- I'll adjust it. 
 - Okay!

27
00:01:54,474 --> 00:01:56,374
Cheese!

28
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,704
<i>Ms. Oh!</i>

29
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,694
Hello, everyone!

30
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:16,864
My name is Oh Yeon Doo.

31
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:19,614
<i>Hello!</i>

32
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:21,294
"Jo Sam Mo Sa."

33
00:02:21,294 --> 00:02:23,234
Does anyone know the modern meaning of it?

34
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:25,354
I do! I do!

35
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,864
Jo Sam Mo Sa.

36
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:28,784
When you're not sure, pick No. 3

37
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,194
and if you have no idea, pick No. 4.

38
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:33,694
Bingo.

39
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:38,074
If that's your style, I hope you don't come to my lecture.

40
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,114
The tenaciousness in which you try to solve the problem until the end.

41
00:02:41,114 --> 00:02:45,194
That's what I want to see in you guys.

42
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:48,254
Open page 25 of my textbook.

43
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:50,244
Shall we start with nonfiction comprehension?

44
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,744
<i>Yes!</i>

45
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:59,134
The pace is great and the finish was amazingly impactful!

46
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:01,204
I can understand things so easily!

47
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:04,694
That easily? Really?

48
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:07,434
Hello, sir.

49
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,294
This one.

50
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:11,294
And this one.

51
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:14,254
All the boys are in the front.

52
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:17,014
I was wondering why I had so many cancellations.

53
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:18,784
It was all you guys' fault.

54
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:20,414
Pardon?

55
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:22,664
It might look like a tricky question,

56
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:25,124
but there's definitely a way to solve it.

57
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:29,614
You're completely screwed if you lose your spirit in the literature section of the national exam.

58
00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:32,354
- So what did I tell you? 
 <i>- Don't get intimidated!</i>

59
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:34,964
That concludes today's lecture.

60
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,154
<i>Thank you!</i>

61
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,534
<i>[Mr. Yoon Gi Chang] 
 The makeup turned out nicely.</i>

62
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:45,124
<i>Must be nice.</i>

63
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,514
<i>You can rely on your good looks.</i>

64
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:51,104
Tell Oh Yeon Doo.

65
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:56,794
Unless she wants to lose her career, she'd better stop stealing my students.

66
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,144
I'm off.

67
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:00,614
Yes.

68
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:07,444
You must've heard that.

69
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:11,874
You won't have to relay the message. Carry on!

70
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:18,744
- There are more female students than male students. 
 - What?

71
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:24,354
A lot of your female students came to me more than the male students.

72
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,834
I'd accept your criticism if it were about my teaching ability.

73
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:33,814
But it makes me uncomfortable when you say I take advantage of my looks or steal your students.

74
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:37,174
Why would my students go to you if it weren't for your pretty face?

75
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,474
I'm the No. 1 lecturer.

76
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:43,004
You think you can beat me with your mediocre lecture?

77
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,984
Mediocre?

78
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,934
I know that you use the textbook that's only been slightly edited.

79
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:51,384
A lecturer who's not driven nor hardworking.

80
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:54,644
- The students recognize that immediately! 
 - Um, what?

81
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:57,984
- I'm not hardworking? 
 - What are you doing, Ms. Oh?

82
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:03,744
How dare you be so rude to our No. 1 lecturer?

83
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:05,484
Follow me!

84
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,944
I'm sorry for earlier, Ms. Oh.

85
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:20,014
It's an organic black bellflower root tea made in Korea, which is good for your throat.

86
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:24,384
I got you a few boxes. Take good care of your throat.

87
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:27,134
Yes. Thank you.

88
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:29,094
I should be the one to thank you.

89
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:32,684
You're an important person who's about to become the No. 1 lecturer.

90
00:05:32,684 --> 00:05:33,704
Pardon?

91
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:38,024
I'm saying you're the rising sun, and Mr. Yoon is the setting sun.

92
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:41,614
I was just being polite to the setting sun earlier.

93
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:44,354
Please forgive me.

94
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:47,804
If you're planning to get married, you'd better do it before you become the No. 1.

95
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:51,114
It's more difficult to maintain the status than to get there.

96
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,054
Do you have a boyfriend?

97
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:58,664
<i>[My Joon Ha] 
 Having lunch in my room.</i>

98
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:01,414
Yes, I do.

99
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:20,344
You can't do this to me.

100
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:23,204
I'm so worried about Mom right now!

101
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:25,204
When is she coming?

102
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:28,834
Dr. Gong Tae Gyeong, please hurry! Say it, Roundie.

103
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:39,034
You came, Doctor.

104
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:42,634
She stopped crying!

105
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,724
She's doing this again.

106
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:47,704
She stops crying whenever she sees you.

107
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:51,374
I think she knows that you're the one who brought her into this world.

108
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:53,564
Not at all.

109
00:06:53,564 --> 00:06:57,564
It's modern medicine that allowed Roundie to come to this world.

110
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,574
How about her mother? How is she?

111
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:03,144
She says her stomach feels tight, and she has severe pain.

112
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:05,414
We hurried here because we were worried.

113
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:08,914
I'm so sorry for calling you on your day off, Doctor.

114
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:10,554
That's my job.

115
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:13,074
- Let's go in. 
 - Yes.

116
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:19,264
There aren't any issues.

117
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,134
The cervical length is 3.5 cm.

118
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:24,114
It's the same as last time. It's maintaining itself well.

119
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:28,044
The contraction stress test result looks all normal, too.

120
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:31,744
Gosh. Thank you, Doc.

121
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:35,094
I got so scared because I thought there was something wrong with her.

122
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:36,974
It was difficult to get pregnant with Roundie, too.

123
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:39,454
I wonder if we were being too greedy to want another one.

124
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:41,614
It's not greedy at all.

125
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:44,784
A lot of people even get a test-tube baby for their second.

126
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:48,084
I had given up on having babies. But I have two now, thanks to you.

127
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,334
Thank you so much, Doctor.

128
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:54,094
The embryo selection went well, thankfully.

129
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:56,024
This is everything the clinic can do.

130
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:58,654
Let Dr. Cha take care of the delivery now.

131
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:03,174
- Hello, Dr. Cha. 
 - Hello.

132
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:06,054
Hello, Ma'am. Hello, Sir.

133
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:07,664
Goodness, look who's here!

134
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:10,184
It's Roundie, isn't it?

135
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,604
Thankfully, I get to care for you now.

136
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:16,774
I'll make sure the second baby gets delivered well, just like Roundie.

137
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:18,284
Thank you, Dr. Cha.

138
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:20,034
We'll get going now.

139
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:23,264
- I'll see you at the appointment. 
 - Take care.

140
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:25,154
Take care.

141
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:32,014
I heard she stopped crying when she saw you this time, too.

142
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:34,444
How fascinating.

143
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:38,094
Why did you come in, Director Cha?

144
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:42,054
I told you. I gave you my appointments for tomorrow. Thank you in advance.

145
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:46,514
You'd do anything for your patients. What made you cancel all your appointments?

146
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:48,034
Where are you going?

147
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:49,544
It's a secret.

148
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:52,454
Look how annoyingly well-dressed up you are.

149
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:54,024
Do you have a date?

150
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:58,574
Are you seeing that anchorwoman?

151
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,284
I'll get going.

152
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:03,204
That's Jin Soo Ji, right?

153
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:06,274
- It is! 
 - Wow, she's so pretty!

154
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:09,284
- She looks better in person. 
 - I know!

155
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:11,824
- Are they shooting something? 
 - I don't know.

156
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:14,574
- Let's take a picture first. 
 - She's pretty.

157
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:19,704
Oppa!

158
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:21,294
Hey.

159
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:26,824
- Who's he? 
 - I don't know.

160
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:28,634
I got you the usual.

161
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,904
- Aren't you glad? 
 - Thank you.

162
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,454
Are you okay with meeting at a public place like this?

163
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:36,684
Everyone recognizes you.

164
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:38,144
What's the big deal?

165
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,534
Pictures of the two of us will be all over the news anyway.

166
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:44,134
What are you talking about?

167
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,944
Men don't have to be the ones to propose.

168
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:53,044
Oppa, let's get married.

169
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:01,564
- Oppa! 
 - I told you.

170
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:03,604
I'll never get married.

171
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,564
That's when you loved me less.

172
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,194
You love me a lot now.

173
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:11,424
Also, we're compatible during the night and day, too.

174
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:14,944
Do we have to get married if we're compatible?

175
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:17,254
I want you to be my man.

176
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:19,414
I want you exclusively because I love you.

177
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:21,024
Don't you want me?

178
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:24,024
- Don't you want me to be your woman? 
 - No.

179
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,894
I want to love you.

180
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,274
I don't want to possess you.

181
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:30,994
We went through this before we started dating.

182
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:33,344
I'm against marriage without exception.

183
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,004
I asked you if you'd be okay.

184
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:39,524
You said you'd be okay as long as I followed your rules.

185
00:10:39,524 --> 00:10:42,724
"Keep our relationship a secret. No unwanted touching.

186
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:44,444
No cheating."

187
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,264
Did I ever break those rules?

188
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:49,594
No.

189
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:51,534
I was upset because you never did.

190
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:54,044
"Why doesn't he brag about me?"

191
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,874
"How come he never initiates touching?"

192
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:03,704
That's enough.

193
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:10,364
Can't you think of me as an exception?

194
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:12,134
Why do you hate marriage so much?

195
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:15,384
I told you. I find the family bond suffocating.

196
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:20,034
I don't ever want a relationship where you're forced to love and sacrifice.

197
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:22,354
You just don't love me enough.

198
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:25,434
You don't love me enough to marry me!

199
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:44,124
- Oppa. 
 - The last rule.

200
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:47,554
"The relationship is terminated if one of us wants to get married."

201
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:49,184
You're impressive when you work.

202
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:54,334
Don't be restricted by this stupid ring and live for yourself.

203
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:17,334
<i>[Kalucia Hotel]</i>

204
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:48,054
<i>[Mother]</i>

205
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:06,434
<i>Tae Gyeong, are you going to the hotel today, too?</i>

206
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:09,434
<i>You should come back home now.</i>

207
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:18,804
- Yes, Mom. 
 <i>- Oppa!</i>

<i>It's Soo Ji.</i>

209
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:22,694
<i>I must've been crazy. I'm sorry.</i>

210
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,144
<i>Let's get back together.</i>

211
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:27,294
<i>I'll never ask you to marry me—</i>

212
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,714
Geez.

213
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:45,604
In broad daylight?

214
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:49,184
How shameless you've become, Kim Joon Ha.

215
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:41,224
My gosh!

216
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:56,534
Geez!

217
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:03,964
Yeon Doo?

218
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:07,224
Darling!

219
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:12,744
I think you and I are really meant to be together.

220
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:16,404
I'm becoming the No. 1 soon, apparently.

221
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:20,694
Director told me to get married before that.

222
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:24,004
That's great.

223
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:28,854
By the way, when did you prepare all this?

224
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:30,944
Hold on...

225
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:33,204
You're naughtier than I thought!

226
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:40,064
By the way, this is too big...

227
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,344
70C?

228
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:48,194
My gosh...

229
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:51,324
Don't you know my size yet?

230
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:52,754
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:55,984
I've never bought lingerie before.

232
00:15:55,984 --> 00:15:59,554
I can forgive you for that.

233
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:01,304
Here.

234
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:03,604
- What? 
 - The ring!

235
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:05,704
You should put it on for me!

236
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,404
The ring?

237
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,544
I should! I should put it on for you.

238
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,344
Shall we go?

239
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:35,654
It hurts. Stop.

240
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:37,244
What's with you, Hon?

241
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:41,964
I can understand getting the bra size wrong, but how could you not know my ring size...

242
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:51,204
Are you... by chance...

243
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,944
Yeon Doo! I can explain everything.

244
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:05,634
- Move! 
 - Listen to me first, Yeon Doo!

245
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,034
- I told you to move! 
 - No, please!

246
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:11,534
- Yeon Doo, please! 
 - Get out of the way!

247
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:19,864
Shit.

248
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,434
Geez!

249
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,204
What's this?

250
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:32,890
<i>[JH ❤️ SJ]</i>

251
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,684
You're mistaken!

252
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:38,274
Shit!

253
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:44,364
I ordered the cake for you, Yeon Doo.

254
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,964
Excuse me, Kim J.H.

255
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:50,074
Since when were my initials S.J.?

256
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:52,684
It says S.J. right next to the heart symbol.

257
00:17:52,684 --> 00:17:56,444
Who is it? Tell me! Go ahead!

258
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:11,414
Why did you have to come here, anyway?

259
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:13,244
What?

260
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:14,834
You messaged me to come here!

261
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:18,094
I deleted it in a second because I sent it by mistake.

262
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,424
How unlucky you are.

263
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:21,994
What?

264
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:24,174
Unlucky?

265
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,994
Hey. How could you do this to me?

266
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:31,874
You used to see me in this room. How could you propose to another woman here?

267
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:33,664
Answer me.

268
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:34,884
Go ahead and answer me!

269
00:18:34,884 --> 00:18:38,944
- You said you don't want to get married! 
 - When did I say that?

270
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:40,614
I said we should try dating for just a year.

271
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:41,954
Yes!

272
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,674
Your mom said you can never date a man who cheats!

273
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:47,754
You offended me by saying you want to keep an eye on me for a year.

274
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:49,264
What?

275
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:51,954
I offended you?

276
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:53,984
You're a cheater.

277
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:57,104
Are you blaming me right now?

278
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,104
You asshole!

279
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:04,910
I'm done with a shameless asshole like you! I'm done!

280
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,074
<i>Oppa!</i>

281
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,904
Stop crying and talk to me.

282
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:36,714
I'm listening.

283
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:03,364
Son of a bitch.

284
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:05,794
He already removed the picture of me.

285
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:16,924
Geez.

286
00:20:30,124 --> 00:20:31,974
<i>I can never break up with you.</i>

287
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:34,394
<i>I'm on my way right now. Let's talk in person.</i>

288
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:36,044
Don't come.

289
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:39,754
Soo Ji, let's just stop!

290
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:41,854
Let's end this cleanly...

293
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:48,344

Are you freaking kidding me?

298
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:18,474
Who did this? Who did this?

299
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:22,634
Hey! Stop right there!

300
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:24,544
Stop right there!

301
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:33,634
Oppa, it's my fault. Please forgive me.

302
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:37,414
- Let's talk somewhere else, okay? 
 -  Don't be like that. Please listen-

303
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,374
What's this?

304
00:21:39,374 --> 00:21:41,364
This is your car.

305
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:43,094
What does it say in red?

306
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,604
Don't look. Let's get out of here!

307
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,414
Let go!

308
00:21:46,414 --> 00:21:47,924
Shit!

309
00:21:47,924 --> 00:21:51,704
"There's a cheater in this car?"

310
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:54,414
Did they call you a cheater?

311
00:21:56,694 --> 00:22:00,454
By chance, did you cheat on me?

312
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:01,824
No!

313
00:22:01,824 --> 00:22:05,104
- A crazy woman just— 
 - Is that woman...

314
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:07,334
your real girlfriend?

315
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:09,484
What?

00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:12,004
"I like women with big breasts.

318
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:18,434
My breasts. My name is Soo Ji, S.J.!

319
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:20,134
It's all correct.

320
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:23,994
Your girlfriend thinks we cheated!

321
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,714
I think it's her!

322
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,964
People are watching. Okay?

323
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:31,064
Let's talk outside!

324
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:32,194
Let go!

325
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:33,994
Is this why you wanted to break up?

326
00:22:33,994 --> 00:22:36,954
Because your girlfriend caught you seeing me?

327
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:38,204
Unbelievable.

328
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:40,064
How could I be your mistress?

329
00:22:40,064 --> 00:22:43,044
I'm a successful anchorwoman Jin Soo Ji!

330
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:45,734
How could I be your second fiddle?

331
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:49,494
Who is she? How pretty and successful is she?

332
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,174
Is she an idol?

333
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:53,384
- Or a famous actress? 
 - I only dated you.

334
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:56,404
- I don't have another woman! 
 - There's evidence right here.

335
00:22:56,404 --> 00:22:58,294
And you're still lying?

336
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,714
What?

337
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,874
You're against marriage?

338
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:05,034
You're a piece of trash and a cheater.

339
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:08,064
Was it fun two-timing all this time?

340
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:11,084
Maybe you weren't two-timing.

341
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:14,044
Maybe you were ten-timing or hundred-timing!

342
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:17,214
Hey. Are you crazy?

343
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,394
I'm not the crazy one. It's you.

344
00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:23,304
You're a dirty bastard who's crazy about women.

345
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:38,524
Damn it!

346
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:44,961
Are you that happy, Ms. Bong Nim?

347
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:47,179
How could I not be happy, son?

348
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:49,309
I've been scanning barcodes to death.

349
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,749
But I signed a contract for a franchise.

350
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:53,839
I can't believe it!

351
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,429
"The contract period is

352
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:59,099
<i>[Article 10 (Regarding contractual period)]</i> 
 two years since the day the contract was signed."

353
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:01,909
Do you like the contract itself or reading it?

354
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:04,969
You learned how to read Korean over three years ago. Are you still fascinated by it?

355
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:08,119
Have you lived your whole life not knowing how to read?

356
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,829
Just knowing how to read the signs is so fascinating.

357
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,589
Jang Soon Min Bakery.

358
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:15,609
Raon Hair. Green Dry Cleaning.

359
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:17,449
You'd better drive carefully!

360
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:20,439
You're a newbie driver! Why did you have to take your sister's car?

361
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,559
I have to practice more because I'm a newbie!

362
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,449
You're the one who caused trouble without telling Sis about this first. Will it be okay?

363
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,599
<i>Catching two rabbits.</i>

364
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,549
<i>Aren't you getting married and getting a raise soon, too?</i>

365
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,559
Two rabbits, my foot.

366
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,449
It was just a stupid dream.

367
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,539
Geez!

368
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,579
Why won't this come off?

369
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,940
I won't cry.

370
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:17,519
I won't cry!

371
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,449
If I cry, I'd be losing to that bastard.

372
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,329
We're here, Ma'am.

373
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:48,739
Oh, I'm sorry.

374
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:00,209
That bastard!

375
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,449
Is he out of his mind?

376
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,049
Geez!

377
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:09,219
My goodness! Seriously.

378
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,139
How could you drive so poorly?

379
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:13,079
Don't you know how to keep a safe distance?

380
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,399
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, sir.

381
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:18,889
Seriously! I told you to be careful! What are we going to do?

382
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:21,559
You ruined your sister's car, too! What are you going to do?

383
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,209
I can fix it! I'll fix it without her noticing...

384
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,579
Sis!

385
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:28,869
Oh, my.

386
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,989
I left my business card in the car.

387
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:34,309
Please call me after getting the car fixed.

388
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,699
You want me to call you?

389
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:40,279
They're my mom and younger brother.

390
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:48,309
- Sis! 
 - Yeon Doo!

391
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,629
What's this doing here?

392
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,959
Yeon Doo told me to dry-clean this.

393
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:17,219
What's her favorite expensive blouse doing here?

394
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:22,719
Y-Yeon Doo.

395
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:31,219
Don't worry. I'll throw it out, Uncle.

396
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,819
Well...

397
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,059
Geez...

398
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:46,209
Did something happen?

399
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:49,149
I don't know.

400
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:52,389
<i>Hello, cuties!</i>

401
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:55,449
<i>Today, we have a jumpsuit.</i>

402
00:27:55,449 --> 00:28:00,659
<i>It's hard to dress because it's hot and cold these days, isn't it?</i>

403
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,759
<i>- Jumpsuits are perfect...</i> 
 - Soo Gyeom.

404
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,539
Smile!

405
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:06,309
Be cute and precious!

406
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,809
Be brighter!

407
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:11,299
<i>When it gets chilly...</i>

408
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:13,059
Soo Gyeom!

409
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:16,229
I told you not to touch my computer.

410
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:19,769
Hold on. I'm not done reviewing it.

411
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:24,149
What are you doing?

412
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:26,149
Let me buy a laptop, then.

413
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:27,859
I'll be buying it with my money.

414
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:30,159
Why would you stop me?

415
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,929
Why would a seven-year-old need a laptop?

416
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,189
Get out. I'm tired.

417
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:39,469
You hate me, don't you? You don't like me, huh?

418
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,969
What?

419
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:44,659
Goodness.

420
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:50,679
You little! You always try to argue with Aunt!

421
00:28:57,929 --> 00:28:59,499
Dad!

422
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,379
Soo Gyeom!

423
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:04,749
Here we go!

424
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:07,999
Goodness. I'm drying laundry.

425
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:10,159
Why does a little kid have so many clothes?

426
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,959
Soo Gyeoem, how could you be like this?

427
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,679
I take you to the kindergarten and make snacks for you, too.

428
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,489
I'm the one doing everything Dad's supposed to be doing.

429
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,689
Come on, Uncle. Doing a dad's job isn't the same thing as the actual dad.

430
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:23,419
No one told you to have a kid when you're a kid yourself.

431
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:26,959
Just ask anyone. Everyone would think I'm her dad.

432
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,269
Grandma is in Aunt's room, right?

433
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:32,889
I wonder if the conversation is going well.

434
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:34,459
What conversation?

435
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:37,609
Yes.

436
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:41,629
What is it?

437
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:44,049
Do you have something to say?

438
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,059
I mean...

439
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:50,129
Dong Wook said he'll take care of the repair.

440
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:51,489
Here.

441
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,069
- Take it easy, then. 
 - Sis, Sis, Sis!

442
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:57,229
I heard you signed the contract! Are you really becoming a store owner?

443
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,559
Contract?

444
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,779
Store owner?

445
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,319
What are you talking about?

446
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,109
The thing is...

447
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:11,229
It was such a rare opportunity. So I signed the contract first.

448
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:13,359
I'll never ask you for any money!

449
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,809
Uncle will join me, too.

450
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:17,419
- Right? 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

451
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:28,549
Please leave if you're done.

452
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:30,009
I want to lie down.

453
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:31,729
You should have dinner first.

454
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,429
Please!

455
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:36,159
Yes.

456
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,219
- Okay, let's go out. 
 - Yes.

457
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:41,139
G-Get some rest.

458
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:47,419
What did she say?

459
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:48,689
She got angry, didn't she?

460
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:50,429
No. She didn't say anything.

461
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:53,539
Seriously? That's so weird.

462
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:55,769
She didn't get angry even when I crashed her car, either.

463
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:57,579
Is there something going on with her?

464
00:30:57,579 --> 00:31:00,239
I ruined her designer blouse, but she just let it go!

465
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:03,169
Huh! You only yelled at me!

466
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:18,049
<i>Wow, it suits you so well.</i>

467
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:19,349
<i>Really?</i>

468
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,359
<i>Think of me whenever you wear it.</i>

469
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,519
<i>Of course!</i>

470
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:41,149
<i>[Kalucia Hotel]</i>

471
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:05,059
This is the security office, right?

472
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,149
Did you find that crazy woman earlier?

473
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:08,169
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

474
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:11,559
<i>She was a visitor. So we contacted the person she was visiting,</i>

475
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,089
<i>but he's not answering his phone.</i>

476
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:14,559
<i>We'll try calling again tomorrow.</i>

477
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,939
I'm watching the dashcam footage right now.

478
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:19,309
You have to find that woman and...

479
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,779
I got it.

480
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:24,179
Bye.

481
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:40,189
I found you.

482
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:43,129
The red marker.

483
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:51,149
Sis, come out! Dong Wook, come out!

484
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:52,679
Yeon Doo is missing!

485
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,089
- What? 
 - Yeon Doo is gone!

486
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:58,149
- What's this about? 
 - Yeon Doo is not in her room.

487
00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:00,689
I went in because the light was on, but she wasn't there!

488
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,109
Didn't she go to the bathroom?

489
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:03,929
- She poops in the middle of the night! 
 - No.

490
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:06,479
I searched the whole house, but she's not here.

491
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,189
It smells!

492
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,099
She's right.

493
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:16,099
What's this smell?

494
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,879
Yeon Doo's blouse.

495
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,279
This is her blouse, right?

496
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,949
What should I do? She must be really mad at me!

497
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:30,459
Si, what if she kicks me out? Where will I go?

498
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:33,119
Stop making a fuss! You're driving me crazy!

499
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,409
- Why did she... 
 - Huh?

500
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:40,729
The 100th day?

501
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,119
It's a picture of her with a guy!

502
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,809
If she celebrated the 100th day with him—

503
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,349
I get it.

504
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:50,049
Aunt must've ended a relationship.

505
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:52,759
The blouse was a gift from him, too.

506
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:55,719
What? Yeon Doo was in a relationship for more than 100 days?

507
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:57,009
How come I didn't know?

508
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:00,049
Have you ever seen her talking to us about herself?

509
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:02,459
- Call her. 
 - Okay.

510
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,840
Oh!

511
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:26,189
- She left her phone, wallet, and everything! 
 - What?

512
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,449
Could she be doing something bad?

513
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,309
Yeon Doo!

514
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:33,799
Well... Sis! Sis!

515
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:35,609
Yeon Doo!

516
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:38,169
- Come this way. 
 - Okay.

517
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:40,259
This way, this way.

518
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:45,949
She's not here, Sis. Where did she go?

519
00:34:48,029 --> 00:34:51,749
Yeon Doo!

520
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,879
She's not here, either!

521
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:57,929
Where did she go, anyway?

522
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,599
- Uncle. 
 - Dong Wook, did you see her? Did you find her?

523
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,119
- No. 
 - Gosh!

524
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,099
Yeon Doo, where did you go?

525
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:13,419
If only...

526
00:35:13,419 --> 00:35:16,429
If only I didn't run away with her dad's life insurance money,

527
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:20,279
I wouldn't have made her suffer like this.

528
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:22,009
Yeon Doo!

529
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:25,489
Don't forgive your pathetic uncle!

530
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:30,329
I gave her such a hard time because I had Soo Gyeon when I was in high school.

531
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,089
I'm sorry, Sis! It's all my fault!

532
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,459
- Yeon Doo! 
 - Sis!

533
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:38,019
She's not dead or anything!

534
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,729
Stop rambling and keep looking for her!

535
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,219
Grandma!

536
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:45,729
- What? 
 - Over there!

537
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:01,579
- What? 
 - Yeon Doo, are you okay?

538
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:03,199
I asked if you were okay!

539
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,419
You're bad!

540
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:05,839
Are you crazy?

541
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,199
Do you know how much we looked for you?

542
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,949
Geez! What's wrong with you?

543
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:11,709
Is it so bad that I was enjoying a convenience store meal?

544
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:14,379
I couldn't sleep because I was hungry. What was I supposed to do?

545
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:16,079
- Aigoo... 
 - Sis, Sis, Sis!

546
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,219
- Mom! 
 - Sis!

547
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,279
What a disaster!

548
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,459
Have a seat first.

549
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,199
Mom, are you okay?

550
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,389
What's the problem, exactly?

551
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:33,069
You shouldn't be worrying about me now.

552
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:36,079
Why did you break up? Who is he?

553
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,169
Well, I broke up because he deserved it.

554
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:50,449
It's not a big deal.

555
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:52,319
How is that not a big deal?

556
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:54,629
You must've cried your eyes out.

557
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,879
Why are you wearing sunglasses at night?

558
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:59,949
Oh, these?

559
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:02,509
I was worried I might run into my students.

560
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,109
Look! Look!

561
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,739
I didn't cry!

562
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,229
- Why not? 
 - What?

563
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:12,109
You should cry when something like that happens.

564
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:13,979
Who told you to act tough?

565
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:18,349
Do you really think you're something just because we said you're like the head of this family?

566
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:22,719
You should cry when something sad happens! That way, you won't have sadness in your heart!

567
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,859
Did you become a fool who doesn't even know how to cry because of us?

568
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:29,759
Don't be like that, Mom.

569
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,379
I'm sorry, Daughter.

570
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,489
I made you support the whole family even though you're young.

571
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,729
Gosh. Stop that, Mom.

572
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:43,509
I don't want to cry.

573
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:45,349
Yeon Doo,

574
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:51,219
when washing your clothes, I'll be sure to wash them separately with a delicate detergent.

575
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:52,849
Uncle.

576
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:54,579
I owe you an apology, too, Sis.

577
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:58,019
I'll never cause any trouble, whether it's having a baby or a car accident.

578
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:02,049
No matter how much Mom begs me to take your car, I'll never listen to her.

579
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:03,659
What? When did I...

580
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:06,519
How dare you sell your mom out? You bastard!

581
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:09,229
Grandma! Why do you curse at my dad?

582
00:38:09,229 --> 00:38:12,599
You told me to only use nice and pretty words.

583
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,419
Come on! That's enough!

584
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,239
Please let me eat!

585
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,929
Look! My ramen is all bloated.

586
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:24,449
I'm hungry. You should go home now.

587
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:27,049
- I'll join you after I finish this. 
 - Hold on!

588
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:33,399
Geez, this isn't right.

589
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:37,909
There.

590
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:41,599
My gosh.

591
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,289
Did you cook everything in the fridge?

592
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:46,379
You crave rich food when you're stressed.

593
00:38:46,379 --> 00:38:49,349
I made everything last night.

594
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:54,589
This is a true home meal.

595
00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:56,529
Don't try to stop me!

596
00:38:56,529 --> 00:38:59,179
I'm overeating tonight!

597
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:01,539
Okay...

598
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:08,489
- Is it good? 
 - So good!

599
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:15,099
Gosh! My baby! You eat so well! My baby!

600
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:16,779
Try this.

601
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:21,609
Is it good?

602
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,009
Gosh! Get her water!

603
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:24,369
Give her some water.

604
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:25,919
Gosh.

605
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:27,999
- Eat slowly. 
 - Gosh, be careful.

606
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,329
- Slowly. 
 - Goodness, seriously!

607
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:34,899
- Oh my, oh my! 
 - Is it going down?

608
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:36,709
- It's so good! 
 - Goodness.

609
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,869
Aunt, say ah!

610
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:43,049
- Gosh! 
 - Well done!

611
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,729
Gosh.

612
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,819
It's an honor to have you over for tea.

613
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:13,689
The tea will taste better because the weather's chilly today.

614
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:15,839
Let's go inside.

615
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:21,199
It's winter plum blossom tea from Hadong near Mt. Jiri.

616
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,919
Try smelling it first.

617
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:29,049
It smells so delicate.

618
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:31,779
Mother, you should start out first.

619
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,309
Yes.

620
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:48,579
Winter plum blossom tea is made by plucking the buds before they bloom, I heard.

621
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,369
It's very flavorful.

622
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:51,789
I'm glad to hear that.

623
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:56,919
Having important women like you enjoying this humble tea gathering

624
00:40:56,919 --> 00:41:00,039
makes me feel grateful every time.

625
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:04,889
My son works in a noisy and dirty world.

626
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:07,969
I should have a delicate and pure hobby like this, at least.

627
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:10,469
Yes, I agree with you.

628
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:16,359
My gosh, you're so elegant, Madam Eun.

629
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:17,969
The tea is exceptional.

630
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:20,819
It's a shame that the lady of the Ilsung Group isn't here.

631
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:22,639
I don't know the details,

632
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,859
but I guess something happened to her daughter.

633
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,829
Her daughter?

634
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:35,259
Welcome.

635
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:42,679
<i>I only dated you. I don't have another woman!</i>

636
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:46,259
<i>There's evidence right here. And you're still lying?</i>

637
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:47,869
<i>[Team Leader Kim Gye Won]</i>

638
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:51,979
- What's this? 
 <i> - Ms. Jang! It's a viral video on social media.</i>

639
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:55,789
<i>Phone calls asking if Gong Tae Gyeong is dating Jin Soo Ji are flooding in.</i>

640
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:57,499
What?

641
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,579
Where is the bastard right now?

642
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,679
My daughter went to the ER because of that cheating bastard.

643
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:14,889
- Your daughter did? 
 - Yes, my Soo Ji!

644
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:18,089
My innocent girl got scammed by that bastard

645
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:21,729
and she passed out because these photos were spread all over the internet!

646
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:25,009
What do you mean, scammed?

647
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,809
- You mean my Tae Gyeong did that? 
 - Yes!

648
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:29,939
What a despicable bastard.

649
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:36,399
He humiliated my daughter, who is a public figure at a cafe in front of everyone.

650
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:38,699
He didn't even tell her he had a girlfriend.

651
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:41,189
He was two-timing!

652
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:46,209
That fool... is still saying she loved him.

653
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:48,549
All she does is cry.

654
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:50,259
Ma'am, you're too upset.

655
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:51,839
Please talk to me instead.

656
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,769
Let go. You're just a lowly secretary.

657
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:56,719
Keep your voice down.

658
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:58,459
This is supposed to be a calming space.

659
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:00,689
How could I calm down right now?

660
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:06,419
Looks like you don't care how trashy he is because he's not of your bloodline.

661
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:09,629
Focus on educating him at home instead of pretending to be classy.

662
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,099
- Ma'am! 
 - What?

663
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:12,769
Did I say anything wrong?

664
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:15,729
He's a child you had out of wedlock!

665
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:20,119
I'll file a lawsuit in order to restore my daughter's dignity!

666
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:23,109
I'll hire a major law firm and sue you for all kinds of things!

667
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:25,389
Fine, go ahead.

668
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:28,579
Because my grandson is successful and our family is impressive,

669
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:31,139
all kinds of crazy people leech off us.

670
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:35,429
Aren't you trying to leech off us using your daughter, too?

671
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:37,919
I was holding myself back!

672
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:40,289
- Are you done talking? 
 - Ma'am! You can't be like this!

673
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:42,149
Please talk to me instead.

674
00:43:42,149 --> 00:43:43,429
Move!

675
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:45,289
Move, I said!

676
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:47,669
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

677
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:49,309
Wait...

678
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,559
Who told you to butt in?

679
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,639
<i>I don't have another woman!</i>

680
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:13,739
<i>There's evidence right here. Are you still lying?</i>

681
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:16,089
<i>You're against marriage?</i>

682
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:27,399
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

683
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:31,799
Ms. Jang, is your hand okay?

684
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,539
It's okay.

685
00:44:34,189 --> 00:44:36,689
It's my fault, Ma'am.

686
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:40,209
I missed Mr. Gong's relationship changes because I was busy preparing the tea gathering.

687
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:41,789
Stop making excuses.

688
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:44,559
Bring him in front of me immediately.

689
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,129
Yes, Ma'am.

690
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:57,159
Dr. Cha must've told you, but you have less amniotic fluid than most people.

691
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:01,389
You don't have oligohydramnios, but I recommend that you drink a lot of water.

692
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:02,749
Yes.

693
00:45:02,749 --> 00:45:06,339
By the way, is Dr. Cha ill by chance?

694
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:08,959
He doesn't normally miss appointments.

695
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:10,379
It's nothing.

696
00:45:10,379 --> 00:45:13,279
Dr. Cha will definitely see you next time.

697
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:15,399
Thank you.

698
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:35,929
Ms. Kim, how many more of Dr. Cha's appointments are left?

699
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:38,679
<i>She doesn't want you to see any more patients.</i>

700
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:40,409
Who said that?

701
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:52,069
Is it Grandma again?

702
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:54,289
What's it about now?

703
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,289
One of the student's literature scores went up a lot.

704
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:24,829
His parent sent this to you.

705
00:46:29,139 --> 00:46:30,559
Ms. Oh, where are you going?

706
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:33,359
You have another lecture.

707
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,549
I'll... play with flowers like a lunatic for a sec.

708
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:41,819
I'm crazy.

709
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,829
I'm not crazy.

710
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:48,189
I'm crazy.

711
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:51,979
I'm not crazy.

712
00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:55,079
I'm crazy.

713
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:58,509
Geez! Oh Yeon Doo!

714
00:46:58,509 --> 00:47:00,589
You must be really crazy!

715
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:02,729
It's over!

716
00:47:02,729 --> 00:47:05,659
Why are you still thinking about Kim Joon Ha?

717
00:47:08,189 --> 00:47:12,789
Geez! He couldn't wait for a second...

718
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:15,549
<i>[My Joon Ha]</i>

719
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:21,689
<i>[My Joon Ha]</i>

720
00:47:36,569 --> 00:47:40,109
<i>[You have a new voicemail. Hit the call button to access the voicemail]</i>

721
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,499
That's been bothering me.

722
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:02,829
Is it a sign of loyalty?

723
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:08,159
Or is it an honorable wound you got while serving the madams?

724
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,959
Everyone is waiting.

725
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:11,919
You should be over there.

726
00:48:25,429 --> 00:48:28,709
Madam Lee! I'll take over. You should rest now.

727
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:30,039
No, it's all done.

728
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:32,189
Please serve the rest of the dishes instead.

729
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:33,619
Yes.

730
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:39,699
Mother, I'm sorry I can't help you.

731
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:42,109
I can't do anything because I'm so anxious.

732
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:45,729
Of course, you are. In-vitro fertilization is so tough to do.

733
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:49,119
I'm extra nervous because this might be the last time.

734
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,139
Please, don't slip and hang in there.

735
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:55,369
Please be implanted and see each other soon!

736
00:48:56,229 --> 00:48:57,929
Apparently, grape juice is good for implantation.

737
00:48:57,929 --> 00:48:59,629
Drink it and get some rest.

738
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:01,099
Yes.

739
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:04,719
By the way, it tastes grassy and less sweet.

740
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,489
It's definitely not as good.

741
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:11,779
My parents always get the highest quality grapes and juice them themselves.

742
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:16,909
Please do that for me next time, Mother. Oh, right...

743
00:49:16,909 --> 00:49:19,259
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

744
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,579
How could you disgrace the Gong family like this?

745
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:24,789
How many women do you have, anyway?

746
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:26,459
How did you get into this mess?

747
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:30,599
That graffiti... It was done by a crazy woman who has nothing to do with me.

748
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,009
I didn't have many women. I just had a normal relationship.

749
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:36,629
Why would you mess with their daughter and get us in this mess?

750
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:40,729
How much womanizing have you been doing that you ended up disgracing us?

751
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:42,369
How many times do I have to tell you?

752
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:44,589
I'm not a womanizer. I'm just against marriage!

753
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:45,999
Against marriage?

754
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:50,229
Is avoiding marriage and fooling around with women your philosophy?

755
00:49:50,229 --> 00:49:52,809
- When did I fool around— 
 -  That's what you're saying right now.

756
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:56,989
You only swallow what's sweet and you spit out what's bitter. It's a nasty habit!

757
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:59,519
What if you end up getting someone pregnant?

758
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:00,869
Mother!

759
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:04,629
Please calm down. I'll talk to him.

760
00:50:04,629 --> 00:50:08,069
Yes. You're the one who brought him to this family.

761
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:12,209
Was your ex-husband a playboy, by chance?

762
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,889
Was his blood as dirty as his son's?

763
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:17,199
- Ms. Eun Geum Sil! 
 - "Ms. Eun Geum Sil"?

764
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:18,919
Punk, did you call your grandmother's name just now?

765
00:50:18,919 --> 00:50:20,129
- Move! 
 - Honey!

766
00:50:20,129 --> 00:50:22,809
Look at you...

767
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:24,999
How dare you treat the eldest son like that...

768
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:26,769
Are you still part of this family?

769
00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:29,419
You don't consider me as your family, Grandma.

770
00:50:29,419 --> 00:50:31,129
Get married!

771
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:35,449
Get married and have a family of your own.

772
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,529
I told you. I'm against marriage.

773
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:41,099
I'll get going.

774
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:44,529
My gosh!

775
00:50:44,529 --> 00:50:47,629
Tae Gyeong! Tae Gyeong!

776
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:49,139
Gosh...

777
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:53,889
Gosh. You insisted on adopting him as your own.

778
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:56,899
You don't even get treated like a father after more than a decade.

779
00:50:56,899 --> 00:50:58,289
What a sight to see.

780
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:01,659
Does putting red ink in the water turn it into blood?

781
00:51:09,419 --> 00:51:12,419
Tae Gyeong!

782
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:14,209
You should eat before you go, at least.

783
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:16,329
I made your favorite galbijjim, too.

784
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:18,559
I can't digest food in this house.

785
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,019
I'll just grab clothes from the annex.

786
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:21,579
Tae Gyeong.

787
00:51:23,269 --> 00:51:25,119
You must've been upset.

788
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,849
I know you. You wouldn't do something like that.

789
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:32,809
Don't come even if Grandma calls you from now on. I'll take care of everything.

790
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:35,129
Why would you take care of my problem?

791
00:51:35,129 --> 00:51:38,569
This is between Grandma and me.

792
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:40,319
I'm sorry, Tae Gyeong.

793
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,239
This is all my fault.

794
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:45,139
Why would you be sorry?

795
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:48,029
Please toss away that...

796
00:51:48,649 --> 00:51:50,509
useless guilt.

797
00:51:51,749 --> 00:51:53,569
I'm leaving.

798
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,859
Honey, just leave him alone for now.

799
00:52:25,649 --> 00:52:27,619
Why don't you pick up the phone?

800
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:29,699
Because of you, Hyung...

801
00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:32,119
Forget it. Where are you?

802
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:33,889
<i>I'm on a date with your sister.</i>

803
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,699
<i>Let's discuss the details later.</i>

804
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:38,239
Huh? D-Date?

805
00:52:39,029 --> 00:52:40,489
Yes.

806
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:44,239
Date.

807
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,379
What married couple has a date at the Family Court?

808
00:52:48,379 --> 00:52:50,559
Contact the press office, not the reporters.

809
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,589
Shut her up by tossing her an ad of her choice

810
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:55,499
and for the photos and videos on social media,

811
00:52:55,499 --> 00:52:58,209
- work with Jin Soo Ji's company and deal with it. 
 - Even on the day we get divorced...

812
00:52:58,209 --> 00:53:00,739
- she's a total workaholic. 
 - There can't be any noise about this.

813
00:53:01,999 --> 00:53:03,959
Gosh, Gong Tae Gyeong, that punk.

814
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:06,439
Why gain a title as a cheater? How trashy.

815
00:53:06,439 --> 00:53:08,629
Is this about Tae Gyeong?

816
00:53:08,629 --> 00:53:10,449
I don't know what it's about, but it's not true.

817
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:12,389
He's not a cheater.

818
00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:16,509
Why do you always defend that bastard instead of me?

819
00:53:16,509 --> 00:53:20,699
Why do you call your brother "punk, bastard" like that?

820
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:23,359
Whatever.

821
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,629
We're getting divorced because you wanted to.

822
00:53:25,629 --> 00:53:28,489
Keep it a secret until the waiting period ends, like we promised.

823
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:32,529
If our families found out, they'll meddle and try to tell us what to do.

824
00:53:35,249 --> 00:53:38,859
You'd better be good at pretending to be happily married.

825
00:53:44,909 --> 00:53:47,449
It's been a while since you came home together.

826
00:53:47,449 --> 00:53:49,889
We went on a date at a place with a nice view.

827
00:53:49,889 --> 00:53:51,429
It was really nice there, right?

828
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:54,689
Yes. Let's go back sometime.

829
00:53:55,759 --> 00:53:58,629
It's beef galbijjim. Tae Gyeong must've been here.

830
00:53:58,629 --> 00:54:02,149
He's not the only one who eats galbijjim.

831
00:54:02,149 --> 00:54:03,729
Did you block the articles from getting published?

832
00:54:03,729 --> 00:54:07,369
Yes. We had to spend money on ads, but it's been taken care of.

833
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,399
Ads? How much?

834
00:54:09,399 --> 00:54:12,519
It's not that much. It's nothing the finance team should worry about.

835
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:16,429
Miss, why shouldn't he worry about it when it involves money?

836
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:18,839
That's enough.

837
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:22,609
Ji Myeong, find bride material who suits our family.

838
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:24,119
Bride material?

839
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:26,219
For whom?

840
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:27,789
Tae Gyeong.

841
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,279
Including Chairman Jang's younger daughter and Chairman Lee's youngest.

842
00:54:31,279 --> 00:54:33,189
Search everywhere.

843
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:36,299
Chairman Jang and Chairman Lee?

844
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:39,769
Would they be okay with Tae Gyeong?

845
00:54:39,769 --> 00:54:41,309
Probably not.

846
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:44,629
They're close with my dad, and they're in the top 30 in the financial circle.

847
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:46,529
F-Father.

848
00:54:46,529 --> 00:54:49,419
You're not bringing Tae Gyeong into the company, are you?

849
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,119
Be quiet.

850
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:56,259
You should convince him and make him go on blind dates.

851
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,319
Honey.

852
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,239
I'll take care of his marriage plan.

853
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:01,199
Mother!

854
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:04,409
I have a plan. You shouldn't get involved.

855
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:22,759
Geez.

856
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:26,319
Yes, Grandma.

857
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,329
<i>Come to the coffee shop this afternoon.</i>

858
00:55:41,759 --> 00:55:43,299
Is this the security office?

859
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:44,959
Haven't you found the red marker woman yet?

860
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:46,199
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

861
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:49,489
<i>We still can't reach the customer she was visiting.</i>

862
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:56,099
This is all because of that crazy woman.

863
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,619
Just wait until I catch you.

864
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:13,339
<i>[One-year anniversary]</i>

865
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:17,079
Today was a one-year anniversary?

866
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:42,039
<i>Is it hard to cut?</i>

867
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:51,119
<i>You should just enjoy it.</i>

868
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,979
<i>I'll cut your meat for the rest of your life.</i>

869
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,429
<i>Isn't this place nice?</i>

870
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:05,129
<i>Let's come back here on our one-year anniversary.</i>

871
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:08,629
I came back.

872
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,449
Where...

873
00:57:12,139 --> 00:57:14,589
are you right now?

874
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,459
<i>[Voicemail]</i>

875
00:57:51,459 --> 00:57:53,899
<i>This is the first voicemail.</i>

876
00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:58,299
<i>Yeon Doo, why won't you answer my call?</i>

877
00:57:58,299 --> 00:58:00,829
<i>It's over.</i>

878
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:05,259
<i>It's over with you and that woman, too.</i>

879
00:58:05,259 --> 00:58:08,919
<i>Yeon Doo, I'm having such a hard time.</i>

880
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:11,169
<i>I miss you, Yeon Doo.</i>

881
00:58:11,169 --> 00:58:13,289
<i>To save your message...</i>

882
00:58:26,689 --> 00:58:28,819
This is why I'm meeting with him.

883
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:33,069
I'll just return this and come back.

884
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:56,279
Where's Grandma?

885
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:58,329
What's this about now?

886
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:08,329
Why are you calling instead of coming here?

887
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:10,479
<i>You're getting married next month.</i>

888
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:13,639
<i>Discuss it with your future bride.</i>

889
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,729
Future bride?

890
00:59:17,729 --> 00:59:19,119
What is she talking about?

891
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,699
Madam Eun wants you to get married.

892
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:28,559
To be exact, she wants you to marry me.

893
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,369
Tae Gyeong!

894
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:46,099
Both Chairman Gong and Madam Lee are worried about you a lot, Tae Gyeong.

895
00:59:47,259 --> 00:59:48,719
So?

896
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:53,039
Will you really marry me just because Grandma told you to?

897
00:59:53,959 --> 00:59:56,719
You're well aware of my position.

898
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:03,559
<i>[X]</i>

899
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:09,399
You must be shocked. I'll leave for now.

900
01:00:09,399 --> 01:00:11,659
Let's talk again later.

901
01:00:15,749 --> 01:00:18,069
You take care of this on your end.

902
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:23,669
Unless you want to see Grandma and me cut off our ties.

903
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,219
<i>I'm calling from the security office.</i>

904
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:39,439
- What is it? 
 - <i>She showed up in the parking lot again.</i>

905
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:05,509
How did you know I was here?

906
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:09,189
Get in for now.

907
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,369
I'm sorry for acting like a stalker.

908
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:28,209
I was near your office because I missed you,

909
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:31,569
but I saw your car coming out.

910
01:01:32,279 --> 01:01:34,259
I already told you that day.

911
01:01:34,259 --> 01:01:36,579
That I feel too much burden with you.

912
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:38,229
I won't ask you to marry me.

913
01:01:38,229 --> 01:01:40,319
I won't ask you to go to the US with me, either.

914
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,969
Whether it's Wall Street or whatnot, I won't go alone no matter how much they pay me.

915
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:47,129
Please... just don't say let's break up.

916
01:01:47,129 --> 01:01:49,749
You should go to the US.

917
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:52,729
I'm getting married.

918
01:01:52,729 --> 01:01:54,609
Married?

919
01:01:54,609 --> 01:01:56,689
That's what's going to happen.

920
01:01:56,689 --> 01:01:58,769
It's been decided already.

921
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:00,389
Don't lie.

922
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:01,999
You're trying to get rid of me.

923
01:02:01,999 --> 01:02:04,849
It's the son of the chairman I work for.

924
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:09,839
I want to be a part of that family, Joon Ha.

925
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:14,969
You think I'd let you get married?

926
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:18,769
- I'll barge into that house right now and— 
 - Go ahead if you wish.

927
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:21,899
- What? 
 - Why don't you go and see for yourself

928
01:02:21,899 --> 01:02:25,659
how powerful families take care of things like this?

929
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:32,689
How could you... do this to me, Se Jin?

930
01:02:38,779 --> 01:02:40,779
Let me kiss you goodbye.

931
01:03:38,049 --> 01:03:41,419
There you were, the red marker.

932
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:46,679
Do you know what happened to me because of you?

933
01:03:53,299 --> 01:03:55,919
Do you see? Do you see it right here?

934
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:58,839
There's no use trying to deny it.

935
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:01,389
It was all caught on the dash cam.

936
01:04:01,389 --> 01:04:03,839
Let's let the law take care of it.

937
01:04:13,589 --> 01:04:15,579
Are you acting?

938
01:04:18,949 --> 01:04:20,789
Hey.

939
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:23,509
Hey, what's wrong?

940
01:04:25,749 --> 01:04:29,159
Hey! Hey! Wake up! Hey!

941
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:33,059
There is a pulse.

942
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:35,009
Is it from exhaustion?

943
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:37,299
911.

944
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:40,589
No, the ER.

945
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:02,229
Excuse me!

946
01:05:02,229 --> 01:05:04,579
You can't just barge in like this!

947
01:05:04,579 --> 01:05:07,909
She had syncope, but there were no signs other than losing consciousness.

948
01:05:07,909 --> 01:05:10,409
I think she needs to be evaluated by a doctor.

949
01:05:11,009 --> 01:05:12,789
- What are you doing? Hurry! 
 - Guardian.

950
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:15,879
Go to the reception desk and get checked in first!

951
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:18,529

Ms. Oh Yeon Doo's guardian.

Yes!

956
01:05:47,749 --> 01:05:49,969
Are you her guardian?

957
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:51,829
Yes, I guess.

958
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:55,259
Her blood test came out normal.

959
01:05:55,259 --> 01:05:58,319

You're her husband, right?

962
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:07,549
Ms. Oh is pregnant.

963
01:06:08,629 --> 01:06:10,019
Pardon?

964
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:11,829
What do you mean, she's pregnant?

965
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:14,389
