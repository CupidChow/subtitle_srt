1
00:00:01,157 --> 00:00:02,166
I...

2
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:04,996
I'm not letting you go, Yeon Doo.

3
00:00:04,997 --> 00:00:07,497
Actually, I won't let you leave.

4
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:10,007
So if you wish to leave,

5
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:12,236
now is your chance.

6
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:14,437
This is...

7
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:18,777
the last chance you'll get...

8
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,387
to leave me.

9
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:26,186
The last chance.

10
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,787
I won't leave.

11
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:06,356
So don't worry anymore.

12
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,027
You can't leave.

13
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:12,236
I won't let you.

14
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:14,736
All right.

15
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:18,736
If you tell me to stay, I will.

16
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:21,447
In no way...

17
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:24,106
will I hurt you again.

18
00:01:37,186 --> 00:01:40,355
Hey! Why on earth are you back here?

19
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:41,897
Leave this instant.

20
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:44,497
It's been a while, Mother.

21
00:01:48,637 --> 00:01:50,136
What is the meaning of this?

22
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:51,576
I apologize for the intrusion.

23
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:54,905
What... Seriously?

24
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,376
What do you think you're doing?

25
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,546
How dare you barge into our house like this?

26
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,846
Darn it. Don't make me call the police.

27
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,987
I'll report you for trespassing.

28
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:06,617
Is Yeon Doo really not here?

29
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:08,357
Where did you hide her?

30
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:10,586
Are you here for Yeon Doo?

31
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:12,796
I told you I didn't know if she was dead or alive.

32
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:15,596
I may be looking for Yeon Doo, but I'm looking for my baby too.

33
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:18,366
Why are you looking for a baby here when we've never seen it before?

34
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,965
- Drag him out of here. - Come on.

35
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,535
- Let go of me! - Stop making a scene.

36
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:24,136
Tell her this if she ever calls.

37
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,535
She can keep on running, but I'll keep looking for her.

38
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:30,176
You're leaving. Get out!

39
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:31,815
- Go! - Grandma.

40
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,815
What's his problem?

41
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:34,816
He's scaring me.

42
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:37,215
It's all right, Soo Kyum.

43
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,987
I'm here for you. It's fine.

44
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:43,185
Get out of there.

45
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:45,195
- Get out. - How dare you come back here?

46
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:46,526
Let go of me!

47
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:47,596
(Episode 37)

48
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,896
What is that? Isn't it a baby shoe?

49
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:54,397
I found it in front of Yeon Doo's place.

50
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,035
It must belong to my child.

51
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:59,035
What? You were in Ilcheon?

52
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,475
Did you go to Yeon Doo's place?

53
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:01,646
Did you run into her?

54
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:04,815
Uncle, you knew where she's been living?

55
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:08,077
Of course. I knew she would be in contact with you.

56
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,886
What did you say to her?

57
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:13,916
Would I be here if I managed to see her?

58
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:16,026
Someone saw her in Seoul,

59
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,886
but I guess she didn't want to see her family.

60
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:20,095
I don't care though...

61
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:22,066
because I'll find her no matter what.

62
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:24,867
I'll get going, then.

63
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:32,636
How long have you known?

64
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:34,807
Why didn't you tell us?

65
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:37,005
Dong Wook, it's...

66
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:39,046
Mom!

67
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:41,117
Dong Wook, wait!

68
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:44,785
Who knows what?

69
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:47,886
Uncle knows where Yeon Doo lives.

70
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:50,486
The jerk didn't say where she was,

71
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:51,957
but he blurted out "Ilcheon."

72
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:53,626
You...

73
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:55,366
Bong Nim.

74
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:56,826
Don't "Bong Nim" me and give it to me straight.

75
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:59,367
Is that true? Is Yeon Doo in Ilcheon?

76
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,707
She called me right after giving birth.

77
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:06,036
She missed you dearly but couldn't reach out.

78
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,205
You can imagine how hard it was to give birth on her own.

79
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:10,547
That's why I visited her.

80
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:12,416
No one told her to run away from her family.

81
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,876
What could've been so hard for her?

82
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:15,416
Bong Nim, don't.

83
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,146
Yeon Doo had her reasons.

84
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:19,056
You saw how that jerk was.

85
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:21,056
He's coming for Yeon Doo's baby!

86
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:24,385
Even so, how could you fool us as well?

87
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:27,756
You knew how worried we were, so how could you?

88
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:28,867
I was worried...

89
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,765
she might sever contact with me too if I told you.

90
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,065
What if she moved to a more secluded place?

91
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:34,566
Enough. This is the last time...

92
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:38,107
you'll mention her in my house. Got it?

93
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:47,276
Hold on.

94
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:49,987
Is Yeon Doo really in Seoul?

95
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:53,756
There you go.

96
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:56,886
Did you eat it?

97
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:59,557
Look at you eat.

98
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:01,526
Here's another spoonful.

99
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,367
It's my uncle.

100
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,406
After I had Ha Neul,

101
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:16,477
I called him.

102
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:19,815
Take his call and let me feed her.

103
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:20,816
Here.

104
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:22,247
Thanks.

105
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:27,857
Hey, Uncle.

106
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:29,885
Yeon Doo, where are you?

107
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:30,956
Are you in Ilcheon?

108
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:34,057
No, I'm in Seoul.

109
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:37,526
Seoul? Where in Seoul?

110
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,036
Tell me right now!

111
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:40,136
Dong Wook?

112
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:43,936
Auntie, I miss you.

113
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:48,376
Yeon Doo, how could you do this to us?

114
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,307
Do we mean nothing to you?

115
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:53,146
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:55,686
I'm sorry, Dong Wook.

117
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:03,625
Go to your room,

118
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,695
and let me talk to her alone first.

119
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:06,756
Whatever.

120
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:09,226
She erased me from her life,

121
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:10,927
so I'll do the same.

122
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,097
Dad!

123
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:20,677
Yeon Doo, it's just that everyone's relieved.

124
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,446
Are you and Ha Neul someplace safe?

125
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:24,776
Yes, Uncle.

126
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:26,417
Then, all is well.

127
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:29,316
It's late in the night, so we'll talk face-to-face tomorrow.

128
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:30,917
Sure.

129
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:34,487
Can you meet me tomorrow morning at Hanguk University Hospital?

130
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:36,886
Why? Are you sick?

131
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:40,156
No, my roommate has been admitted there,

132
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:41,556
so I was going to visit her.

133
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:43,896
Are you talking about the one who helped you?

134
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:46,667
I'll head there, then. Maybe I can finally thank her.

135
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:47,997
Get some rest.

136
00:07:07,057 --> 00:07:08,117
What's this?

137
00:07:09,186 --> 00:07:11,126
Ha Neul, your niece.

138
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:13,026
What?

139
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:15,696
I won't look at it.

140
00:07:16,597 --> 00:07:17,766
Didn't you hear me?

141
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:20,196
I have no sister, so I have no niece either.

142
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:23,537
Will you let me have a look?

143
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,307
- Oh Soo Kyum. - Yes?

144
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:30,646
I won't look either.

145
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:34,016
I get that you're upset and hurt,

146
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:35,787
but don't let it last.

147
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:37,386
It's hard on Yeon Doo too.

148
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:39,756
Why do you think she had to do it?

149
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,997
I cannot and will not forgive her.

150
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,287
Bong Nim, this is Yeon Doo's kid.

151
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:13,316
It's a girl and her name's Ha Neul.

152
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:16,186
I know you're angry, but she's your granddaughter.

153
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:25,396
Hey.

154
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:28,837
You're Ha Neul.

155
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,176
You look just like Yeon Doo when she was young.

156
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:37,347
When you were born,

157
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:40,317
you didn't give your mom a hard time, right?

158
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,016
Your mom must've been...

159
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,487
so scared to give birth alone.

160
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:15,447
It's so tiny.

161
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:18,916
Dad will buy you anything.

162
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,987
Just show up.

163
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:38,266
- Is Ha Neul asleep? - Yes.

164
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:39,805
Sit and eat.

165
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,477
You didn't eat at all today.

166
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,747
Thank you.

167
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:48,687
Are you all right?

168
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,957
It must've been hard hearing their voices so suddenly.

169
00:09:58,026 --> 00:10:01,256
I guess I was wrong.

170
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:04,896
I thought all would be fine...

171
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:07,337
if I disappeared.

172
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:09,937
Because of me,

173
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:13,176
you and my family...

174
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:15,546
got hurt.

175
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:18,876
I didn't imagine so.

176
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:23,317
I thought you'd all be fine without me.

177
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:25,357
How could we be?

178
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:29,756
Don't you know what you mean to me and your family?

179
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:36,126
What do you want to do now?

180
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:39,497
I should see my family first.

181
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,696
I'll apologize for everything I did...

182
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:44,136
and introduce Ha Neul to them.

183
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,237
And then...

184
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:50,347
I'll convince them of my feelings...

185
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:51,906
for you.

186
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:57,117
Then...

187
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,717
What'll you do about Jun Ha?

188
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:04,857
I'll look into the legal matters...

189
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:07,896
and meet him to sort things out.

190
00:11:08,796 --> 00:11:09,896
Well,

191
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,697
I know it's shameless of me to ask,

192
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:16,707
but I'd like you to help me.

193
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,577
Why would I help you?

194
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:21,535
What?

195
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:25,207
This isn't just about you. It's about me too.

196
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,477
I won't be helping you.

197
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,546
We'll take care of matters together.

198
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:33,786
Okay.

199
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,327
The two of us can take care of it together.

200
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:38,587
I won't back down.

201
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,166
You're back to being the Yeon Doo I know.

202
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:50,837
Eat up.

203
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:52,237
I will.

204
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:58,376
Oh, dear. You woke again?

205
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:01,317
Go back to sleep.

206
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:04,146
Sleep here tonight.

207
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:06,957
I'll move the cot to our bedroom tomorrow.

208
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:10,385
Okay. You should sleep comfortably in your bed.

209
00:12:10,386 --> 00:12:11,386
I will.

210
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:14,926
It's so fascinating.

211
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:19,036
How can something so small have eyes, a nose, a mouth,

212
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:22,036
hands, and feet?

213
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,635
I gave birth to her, and I'm amazed each day.

214
00:12:27,636 --> 00:12:28,636
Right?

215
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,077
Lie down. I'll get the light for you.

216
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:34,676
Okay.

217
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:36,217
Sleep well, Ha Neul.

218
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:45,656
- Goodnight. - You too.

219
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:16,526
This face.

220
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,526
I haven't seen it in so long.

221
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:25,166
Thank you.

222
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:28,597
And...

223
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:30,737
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:34,337
The feeling's mutual.

225
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:41,577
You weren't asleep?

226
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:44,046
Why did you sleep out here where it's so uncomfortable?

227
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:45,587
It wasn't.

228
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,857
I haven't slept so well in ages.

229
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:51,087
Let's move the cot as soon as Ha Neul's awake.

230
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,556
Okay.

231
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,166
It's done.

232
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:01,396
The three of us can sleep together now.

233
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,466
Even if Ha Neul wakes during the night,

234
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:05,937
we can take turns with her.

235
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,577
You have to go to work.

236
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:10,876
I'll watch her.

237
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,617
I want to get close to her fast.

238
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,386
I missed out on a whole year.

239
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:19,816
Lucky you, Ha Neul.

240
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,526
You have two people to play with even if you wake up.

241
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:26,656
You're meeting your uncle later, right?

242
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:29,166
I have the morning off, so I'll drive you.

243
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:33,266
Thank you, Tae Kyung.

244
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,707
For what?

245
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,806
For not giving up on me.

246
00:14:57,786 --> 00:14:59,097
(Gong Tae Kyung)

247
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,697
(Real, Yeon Doo, Tae Kyung)

248
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,087
Hello, sir.

249
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,396
You're here early.

250
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:36,466
Give me a moment to get ready.

251
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,497
Sure. I'll say hi to Ms. Eun.

252
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:40,937
Okay.

253
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:04,256
Did you sleep well?

254
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,957
I have no reason not to.

255
00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:10,996
You used to hang out only with In Ok.

256
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,937
Why are you here to see me?

257
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:17,607
I'm busy, so get to the point.

258
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,337
Ms. Eun.

259
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:23,646
I'd like Yeon Doo's number.

260
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:25,347
What?

261
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,876
I saw you in the car outside the hospital that day.

262
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:31,617
You denied being there...

263
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,217
because of Yeon Doo.

264
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:37,587
I don't know what you're talking about.

265
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,796
I won't ask why you saw her.

266
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:45,666
If you give me her number, I'll turn a blind eye.

267
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,136
How would I know her number?

268
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:51,306
Do you really not know?

269
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,406
This is about what Yeon Doo needs.

270
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:57,606
I don't know. Go find out somewhere else.

271
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,816
If you keep being like this,

272
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:03,146
I will have no choice but to tell Ms. Lee about this.

273
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,116
I don't care if you tell her or not. I really don't know.

274
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:08,286
You'll regret this.

275
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:10,887
I should get going then.

276
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:18,467
How dare she...

277
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:23,266
I can't believe I was going to marry Tae Kyung to her.

278
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:24,967
My goodness.

279
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:29,576
By the way, she can't be serious about telling In Ok.

280
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,179
I'm Jang Se Jin.

281
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,250
Ms. Lee, I have something to tell you.

282
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,480
I'll be out in a minute. Wait a bit.

283
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,190
Yes, sir.

284
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,120
What's wrong?

285
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:47,591
Do you have a problem with Ms. Jang?

286
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:52,361
She's been a little unceremonious lately, so I feel uncomfortable.

287
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:56,301
I don't think she's completely over Tae Kyung yet.

288
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:58,900
That can't be right.

289
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,740
She's been working hard on her job.

290
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,590
Mom, I didn't know you were here.

291
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,000
The thing is, the room feels a little stuffy.

292
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,800
Ms. Jang, do you want to talk to In Ok?

293
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:30,930
Yes, sir.

294
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,439
I'm afraid it has to wait.

295
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,440
She's not feeling well, so I told her to rest.

296
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,270
I see.

297
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:41,710
Okay. I'll talk to her some other time.

298
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,351
Mom, I'm heading out.

299
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,080
Let In Ok get some rest.

300
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,891
- Okay. Have a nice day. - You too, Mom.

301
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm so glad to hear that In Ok is not feeling well.

302
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,371
Hey.

303
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,310
I'm going to the vice president's office.

304
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:16,381
Okay.

305
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:23,551
Why are you calling me so early in the morning?

306
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,391
How did it go?

307
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:28,460
Did you ask the old lady for Yeon Doo's phone number?

308
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:30,860
It was a complete failure.

309
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:32,430
She pretended to be innocent.

310
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:34,800
It's all right.

311
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:37,331
I'm going to the hospital again today.

312
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:41,440
I'll do whatever it takes to get my baby back.

313
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,210
"Do whatever it takes?"

314
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,979
Since when did you have such paternal love?

315
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,581
They say blood is thicker than water.

316
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:51,250
I can't stop thinking about it.

317
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,351
And I wonder what the baby looks like.

318
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,791
I'm flustered by how I've changed,

319
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,160
but I don't mind it.

320
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:03,091
You sound like a different person, so it baffles me.

321
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:06,631
Call me if you find out anything at the hospital.

322
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:16,111
I should start my day then.

323
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:22,351
Bong Nim, come on out.

324
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,719
I'm going out to see Yeon Doo.

325
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,081
Are you sure you don't want to come?

326
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,291
Mom is not going.

327
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,091
I bet she can't bear the sight of her just like me.

328
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:34,560
You should go and open the restaurant.

329
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,960
I'll be there after seeing Yeon Doo.

330
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,660
Soo Kyum is having a shoot today, so don't be late.

331
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,901
Let's go, Soo Kyum.

332
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,581
Bong Nim, I'm coming in.

333
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,020
Bong Nim.

334
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:05,321
Don't be like this.

335
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,990
Just hit me if it makes you feel any better.

336
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,159
I'm not a thug. Why would I hit you?

337
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,259
You can take it out on me.

338
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,699
But you should see Yeon Doo and hear her out.

339
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,929
Didn't you hear me?

340
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,239
I don't have a daughter.

341
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,300
Don't be ridiculous.

342
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:24,640
She's your daughter whom you gave birth to.

343
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:27,010
I don't want to hear it. Just go meet her if you want.

344
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:29,880
Yeon Doo is in Seoul.

345
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:31,249
Apparently, her friend is in hospital,

346
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,150
so she's taking care of her at Hanguk University Hospital.

347
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:36,291
We have to bring her before Kim Jun Ha finds her.

348
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,160
She didn't even come to see us when she was in Seoul?

349
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,429
It's not like that.

350
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,689
That's enough.

351
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,300
I don't care if Kim Jun Ha finds her or not.

352
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:48,101
Get out. I need to study.

353
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:50,170
Fine. I'm going by myself.

354
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:51,969
I'll go tell Yeon Doo...

355
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,570
that she should live as if she doesn't have a mom!

356
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:55,641
Happy?

357
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:08,520
I'll go see Hee first.

358
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,050
Give Ha Neul to me and go to work now.

359
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,989
No. I just need to get to work before the appointment.

360
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,190
Don't worry about me.

361
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,031
I'll take care of Ha Neul. You go ahead and see her.

362
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,770
Ha Neul, let's have fun without Mommy.

363
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,770
Give me that.

364
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:29,641
Let's go.

365
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,490
Where's Ha Neul? Didn't you bring her?

366
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,490
She's with Tae Kyung on the first floor.

367
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:54,660
So he came here with you.

368
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:56,170
It's you, right?

369
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,871
You told him about me.

370
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,170
What?

371
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,670
No.

372
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,010
I didn't do that.

373
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,541
Don't play dumb with me.

374
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:11,551
How would he know about what I only told you?

375
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,151
I'm sorry.

376
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:18,350
But even if I hadn't told him,

377
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,420
he would've found out anyway.

378
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:23,891
I know you two would still have had feelings for each other.

379
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:26,930
Thank you, Hee.

380
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:32,500
I've decided to be with him.

381
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,841
That's great. I'm so glad to hear that.

382
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:44,081
If I hadn't been in pain,

383
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,480
I would've celebrated it with some alcohol.

384
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:51,550
Yeon Doo, I'm in the lobby now.

385
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:54,620
I'm in Room 502 now.

386
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,331
Okay. I'll be right there.

387
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,960
Where are they?

388
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,440
(Kang Dae Sang)

389
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,770
(Kang Dae Sang)

390
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:15,581
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

391
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,420
I can't do this.

392
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:41,571
Mother.

393
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,450
Who is that baby?

394
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:52,651
I didn't know you had a baby.

395
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:54,720
- Well... - Don't tell me...

396
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:57,020
that's Yeon Doo's baby.

397
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,189
Please hear me out, Mother.

398
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,260
Answer me.

399
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:03,460
I asked if it was Yeon Doo's baby.

400
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:07,131
Yes.

401
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:10,000
She's Yeon Doo's daughter, Ha Neul.

402
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,909
Thanks, Yeon Doo.

403
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,940
By the way, who is coming?

404
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:21,480
Tae Kyung?

405
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,410
My uncle.

406
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,051
What? Your uncle?

407
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,591
Yes. He really wants to thank you.

408
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,259
No, that's not necessary.

409
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,560
You should call him and tell him to go back.

410
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,659
- What? - No.

411
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,160
You should go down...

412
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:43,371
Yeon Doo.

413
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,770
Uncle Dae Sang.

414
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,770
So this is the room.

415
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,041
I got lost looking for this room.

416
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:53,180
Uncle, just a second.

417
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:57,410
Hey, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

418
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,180
Is this that friend you told me about?

419
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,449
Is she not feeling well? Should I call a nurse?

420
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,490
Well...

421
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,249
Come on. You'll suffocate at this rate.

422
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,990
Let me see your face.

423
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,061
Uncle, she's the one who's been helping me.

424
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:16,801
Hee, this is my uncle.

425
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,470
Hello.

426
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,010
I heard a lot about you.

427
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,351
Yeon Doo, here.

428
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:37,220
Right. You must've bought it for Hee.

429
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,321
Thanks, Uncle.

430
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,631
We should talk downstairs.

431
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,470
Hee, what's wrong?

432
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:56,811
I...

433
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,041
I'm fine.

434
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,581
You should follow your uncle out.

435
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,490
(Hanguk University Hospital)

436
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,930
I apologize for not telling you sooner, Mother.

437
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:24,930
I told you not to call me that.

438
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:29,170
Why are you taking care of Yeon Doo's baby?

439
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,170
I heard she was in Seoul.

440
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:32,881
Has she been staying with you?

441
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,240
Yes.

442
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,111
Where exactly?

443
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,010
Text me the address this instant.

444
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,121
I will.

445
00:27:40,122 --> 00:27:42,419
We were hoping to see you together anyway.

446
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,920
Why would you when you two broke up?

447
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,361
Does your family also know about this?

448
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:55,301
Cut the nonsense and hand over the baby.

449
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:57,429
- Sorry? - Hand me the baby...

450
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,970
and go your own way.

451
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,670
I'll tell Yeon Doo what happened.

452
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:02,571
I can't.

453
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,240
We won't break up.

454
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,509
I won't let you two get back together.

455
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,610
If you do, I'll bite down on my own tongue and die.

456
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:10,680
Mother.

457
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:14,151
Ha Neul is as good as my own child.

458
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,891
I'm going to raise her.

459
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,121
What?

460
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,460
"She's as good as his child?"

461
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,061
"He'll raise her?"

462
00:28:25,391 --> 00:28:26,500
That jerk...

463
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,581
It's not like you're the actual father.

464
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:47,720
Can't you see that you look ridiculous right now?

465
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,301
I don't care if I look ridiculous.

466
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:03,670
Yeon Doo and I will raise Ha Neul together.

467
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,230
And I said you couldn't...

468
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,901
so cut the nonsense.

469
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,371
You told me...

470
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,841
that Yeon Doo had left me because her love for me...

471
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:13,381
wasn't great enough.

472
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,651
I was shocked by those words,

473
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:18,410
which is why I gave up on her.

474
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,851
I wasn't going to see her again,

475
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:24,851
and I knew I wouldn't waver even if we crossed paths.

476
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,190
So what?

477
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,831
But when I saw her again,

478
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:31,930
that determination...

479
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:34,000
went down the drain...

480
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,200
overnight.

481
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,571
I can't control what I'm feeling.

482
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:43,270
I can't live without her, Mother.

483
00:29:44,311 --> 00:29:45,910
So what if you can't?

484
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:48,510
I won't ask for your immediate approval.

485
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,351
I won't brazenly ask for your understanding either.

486
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,750
All I ask...

487
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:57,020
is that you give me a chance to let me show you...

488
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,591
how I care for Yeon Doo and Ha Neul.

489
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,260
What if I said no?

490
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:06,301
What if your mother stands against it too?

491
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:08,700
I'd rather sever ties with my mother...

492
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,071
than give up on Yeon Doo and Ha Neul.

493
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,541
Does severing ties with your mother come this easily to you?

494
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,710
I'm a parent myself.

495
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:21,180
Would I think fondly of you when I have children of my own?

496
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:24,151
That's how desperate I am, Mother.

497
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,750
I don't need anything if I can be with Yeon Doo.

498
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,450
Please just let the three of us...

499
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,490
be together.

500
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:35,020
Just like any ordinary family,

501
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,460
let us live together,

502
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,631
laughing and crying.

503
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,031
Please, Mother.

504
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,341
I'll pretend this conversation never happened.

505
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,180
Mother!

506
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,651
Uncle, you've been acting weird since you came.

507
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:05,121
What?

508
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:08,391
It's nothing. I'm fine.

509
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:12,801
Yeon Doo, let's go home first.

510
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:16,200
If I go home,

511
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,371
I won't be able to go back to him.

512
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:21,200
"Him?"

513
00:31:21,871 --> 00:31:23,270
As in Tae Kyung?

514
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:29,381
Bong Nim!

515
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,651
Mom?

516
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,720
- Mother! - Bong Nim!

517
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,460
You're not my daughter.

518
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,841
Tae Kyung...

519
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,311
What's going on?

520
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:01,611
We'll talk later.

521
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,680
Bong Nim, wait for me!

522
00:32:29,341 --> 00:32:30,510
That was my baby.

523
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,940
So this is how it feels to actually see her.

524
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,351
Bong Nim, wait.

525
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:39,151
Let go.

526
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:41,321
You knew, didn't you?

527
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,791
You knew they were back together, but you didn't tell me.

528
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:45,490
I just found that out myself.

529
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:48,560
Never did it occur to me that they'd get back together.

530
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:50,160
Don't lie to me!

531
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:52,860
Move out of my house too!

532
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:54,660
Fine, I'll move out.

533
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:57,770
But isn't this for the best?

534
00:32:58,571 --> 00:32:59,571
What?

535
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:02,000
The baby was born, and that can't be reversed.

536
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,570
Kim Jun Ha may be the biological father,

537
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:05,870
but he's nowhere near the man that Tae Kyung is.

538
00:33:06,181 --> 00:33:08,480
You of all people, know how decent Tae Kyung is.

539
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:10,451
Let's be honest here.

540
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,350
It makes more sense for her to raise Ha Neul with him.

541
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,550
Not all words should be spoken out loud.

542
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:18,491
But I'm right!

543
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,290
Right now, you're being driven only by your own emotions.

544
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,960
Whether you like it or not, you're Ha Neul's grandmother.

545
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,201
So think about what's best for her as her grandmother!

546
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,131
Set aside your selfish emotions and just think about the baby!

547
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:39,640
Mother.

548
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,451
We should talk.

549
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,761
When did you get her a car seat?

550
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:05,770
I had it purchased when setting up the nursery.

551
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:09,741
I believed you'd come back to me.

552
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,210
Little did I know it'd actually be used.

553
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:15,241
It was worth purchasing.

554
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,321
Ha Neul's a lucky girl.

555
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:23,250
There's someone who did a better job than me...

556
00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:25,591
buying things that you would need.

557
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:29,091
Your mother...

558
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,460
It must've been hard to see her in this way.

559
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,201
It must've been harder on my mom.

560
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:40,769
It was something I knew I had to face...

561
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,971
the second I decided...

562
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,971
to stay with you.

563
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,181
But for my mom, it was clearly unexpected.

564
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,810
I'll try harder with your mom,

565
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:56,721
so don't you go weak again and give in.

566
00:34:57,551 --> 00:35:00,960
I told you that I was going to stay strong this time.

567
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:03,690
I won't...

568
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:05,830
give up on...

569
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,330
my Ha Neul, you,

570
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,971
or my mom.

571
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,511
Mother.

572
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,310
Please don't tell me you were swayed...

573
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:25,111
by what Gong Tae Kyung had to say.

574
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:26,850
What?

575
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,991
Hold on. You heard us talking?

576
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,690
Yes. You're clearly aware that Yeon Doo and Tae Kyung...

577
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,721
can never be together.

578
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,031
Or maybe I should confirm that for you.

579
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,401
Yes, Chairman Gong.

580
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,841
It's been a while,

581
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,270
so I called to ask how you were doing.

582
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:53,940
I heard you were quite upset regarding the ordeal with your son.

583
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,080
Have you been well?

584
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,080
I see.

585
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:01,580
Has Ms. Oh Yeon Doo been in touch since?

586
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,119
Of course, she couldn't show her face.

587
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,890
She lied about her baby being Tae Kyung's when it wasn't.

588
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,360
What on earth are you doing?

589
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:11,930
Right. Well, I found a promising investment deal,

590
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:13,531
so I'll pay a visit sometime.

591
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:15,131
Have a good day, sir.

592
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,970
Why do you seem shocked?

593
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,939
This is me...

594
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,240
showing off my connections to my future mother-in-law.

595
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:27,639
How do you know Tae Kyung's family?

596
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,080
I used to work on sizeable projects for them.

597
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:34,550
If the chairman and his wife find out that I'm the baby's dad,

598
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:36,051
things will take an interesting turn.

599
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,520
If his family finds out...

600
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:40,560
that Tae Kyung and Yeon Doo are back together,

601
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:44,230
she'll get treated even worse.

602
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,030
Would his mother sit idly by...

603
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:50,270
and let his son raise Yeon Doo's baby?

604
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,440
You have no idea how cruel families like his...

605
00:36:54,741 --> 00:36:56,200
can be.

606
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:58,910
Are you blackmailing me?

607
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:01,181
No, this is me being worried.

608
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,850
You should sort this mess out yourself so that...

609
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,350
I don't have to break the news to his family.

610
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:12,320
Get the two of them to break up as soon as you can...

611
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:13,721
and return my baby to me.

612
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:17,190
That'll be all for now.

613
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:20,901
By the way,

614
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,901
I'll send you some wild ginseng.

615
00:37:23,301 --> 00:37:24,531
Good luck, Mother.

616
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:34,011
What now?

617
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,350
My poor Yeon Doo.

618
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:41,480
What do I do?

619
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:49,110
Great-uncle!

620
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,351
Where are Auntie and Ha Neul?

621
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,110
Soo Kyum, shouldn't you be on set?

622
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,921
It's a long story, so let's talk later.

623
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,751
What happened today that's so hard to talk about?

624
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,461
I'm exhausted as is, so get going, darn it!

625
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,530
There's no need to bite my head off.

626
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:07,961
Soo Kyum, let's go.

627
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,569
Come on. You'll suffocate at this rate.

628
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,311
Let me see your face.

629
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,211
Uncle, she's the one who's been helping me.

630
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,351
How could Hee...

631
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:34,391
have been helping Yeon Doo?

632
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,790
We're off.

633
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:42,030
- Have a good one, guys. - Sure.

634
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:46,930
Marriage, my foot.

635
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:50,601
I'm just seeing her briefly.

636
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,941
It's nothing serious.

637
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:58,711
(Dong Wook)

638
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,421
Hey, Soo Kyum. What is it?

639
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,600
Dad, Yu Myung agreed to meet us,

640
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:19,001
so apologize when you see her.

641
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:21,271
I'll handle it.

642
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:24,239
Yu Myung!

643
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,541
Soo Kyum, you're here.

644
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:29,180
- I'm here too. - So I noticed.

645
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:32,450
Let's go upstairs. There are snacks for you to enjoy.

646
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
Hey.

647
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,291
"So I noticed." Are you kidding me?

648
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:42,590
Whatever. You're not the only one who can sulk.

649
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,710
I'm going to place some orders.

650
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:04,211
What? Right now?

651
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,780
Welcome.

652
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:10,751
Can I get five iced Americanos and a watermelon juice?

653
00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:13,121
- To go, please. - Sure thing.

654
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:17,890
Are you the owner who makes good watermelon juice?

655
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:20,061
No, that's someone else.

656
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,930
Could I borrow a pen?

657
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,441
Dad, I thought you had left.

658
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,581
Watermelon juice!

659
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,080
- Is it from the café downstairs? - Yes.

660
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:42,921
Call me when you're done filming.

661
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:46,751
By the way, get this one to Yu Myung.

662
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:49,090
- I'll get going. - Sure.

663
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,300
You heard him, right? This one's yours.

664
00:40:57,601 --> 00:40:59,731
Why must it be this one I drink?

665
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:01,501
Does it taste different?

666
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,069
- It's just coffee. - Yu Myung,

667
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,609
something's written on this.

668
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,610
What?

669
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,910
I'm sorry.

670
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:15,680
Rather than it being casual, we'll go steady.

671
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:18,351
Allow me a date before my first day at work.

672
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:21,820
He has terrible handwriting.

673
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:23,860
What did it say?

674
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:26,090
Did Dad apologize?

675
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
Well, something like that.

676
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:36,901
Why are you smiling?

677
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:38,739
Because of the male customer who was here just now.

678
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,871
He must've upset his girlfriend.

679
00:41:42,271 --> 00:41:43,641
How would you know that?

680
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:46,651
He wrote what was an apology on a cup sleeve.

681
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:48,380
"Rather than it being casual, we'll go steady."

682
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:51,751
His childish handwriting had me giggling.

683
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,050
I see.

684
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:55,489
I'd like to order.

685
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,921
Coming.

686
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,641
(Dong Wook, Song Yi)

687
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:27,921
(Dong Wook, Song Yi)

688
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,159
Next, you'll be visiting the stores with the highest sales...

689
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,601
in the first half of the year.

690
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,530
You're set to leave in ten minutes.

691
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,000
Is it necessary for you to visit the stores yourself?

692
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:45,641
A monetary reward for the proprietors will do.

693
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,569
Consumers are reluctant to open their wallets these days,

694
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,550
so it'll encourage the proprietors if you visit the stores yourself.

695
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,711
Ms. Gong has a point.

696
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,679
They are the ones selling our products for us.

697
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,851
Meeting them in person is sometimes needed.

698
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,890
In the sales analysis of the first half of the year,

699
00:43:02,891 --> 00:43:06,731
stores that actively participated in the task force's events showed...

700
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,831
a noticeable increase in sales.

701
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,799
The task force did good work over the year.

702
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,401
Keep on working with the Sales Division...

703
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:17,041
to come up with promotional ideas.

704
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,800
Of course, sir.

705
00:43:19,871 --> 00:43:22,010
I should head out, then.

706
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,510
By the way, Ms. Jang,

707
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:30,021
have you been in touch with Mr. Kim lately?

708
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:31,651
Sorry?

709
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:34,351
I'm afraid we're not in touch anymore.

710
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,220
I only ask because he called me out of the blue earlier.

711
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,630
Why did you break up when you made a great couple?

712
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,830
Is he not working here anymore...

713
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,300
because you two broke up?

714
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,331
No, that's not the case.

715
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:58,180
(Executive Assistant Jang Se Jin)

716
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:04,851
What now?

717
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:07,891
I'm near your work.

718
00:44:08,191 --> 00:44:09,621
Let's grab lunch together.

719
00:44:10,421 --> 00:44:11,561
I'm not interested.

720
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,360
Where should I go?

721
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,041
What? Where is she?

722
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:26,010
Excuse me.

723
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,311
You must be Ms. Jang Se Jin.

724
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Sorry?

725
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,009
How do you know me?

726
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,850
I met you through your photo first.

727
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,751
I'm Kwon Young Sun, your blind date.

728
00:44:42,921 --> 00:44:44,461
I'm afraid you've wasted your time.

729
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:46,860
I'm not interested in a blind date.

730
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,760
From now on, you should check the women's interests in advance.

731
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:53,871
Goodbye.

732
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:55,630
Wait.

733
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,510
- Gosh. - What are you doing, Mom?

734
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,550
I said no to blind dates.

735
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,220
Why are you so desperate to marry me off?

736
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,461
I want you to meet and marry someone better than Tae Kyung.

737
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:19,791
Then I'll be free of my duties as a mom.

738
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:21,530
Am I an assignment you must be done with?

739
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,800
Will you please just leave me alone?

740
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:35,441
What does Ms. Lee want?

741
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,981
Give that back to me.

742
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,110
Hello.

743
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:44,550
I just heard from Madam Jung.

744
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:47,320
Ms. Jang refused to meet the man.

745
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,320
Why are you so quiet?

746
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,730
I asked you to talk to her...

747
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:57,030
so she'd give up on Tae Kyung.

748
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:01,630
Hello, Ms. Lee.

749
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:14,509
Why did you secretly arrange a blind date...

750
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,021
that I didn't ask for?

751
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:20,490
I just don't get why you'd go so far.

752
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,630
You're not interested in marriage because of Tae Kyung.

753
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:30,300
I knew your feelings but pretended I didn't know...

754
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:33,401
because I felt so betrayed by Yeon Doo.

755
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:35,330
I used you.

756
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:36,541
For that, I'm sorry.

757
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:40,171
But whatever you do, you can't ever...

758
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:42,570
marry Tae Kyung.

759
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:49,651
You're so cruel.

760
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,421
For the past year...

761
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,319
No, since I joined the company,

762
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,121
I served your every whim.

763
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,589
I was there for Tae Kyung too,

764
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,291
so how could you do this to me?

765
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:04,200
All this began...

766
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:07,371
because you tried to marry Tae Kyung.

767
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,441
So how could you two get back together?

768
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,481
You're slowly becoming like Ms. Eun.

769
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,050
You use people when needed...

770
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:21,811
and then discard them when you don't.

771
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:24,251
But guess what?

772
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,050
Ms. Eun is in touch with Yeon Doo.

773
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:32,461
So what?

774
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:35,331
What?

775
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,430
This is why I think you're too much.

776
00:47:40,231 --> 00:47:42,070
Don't care about our family anymore.

777
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:44,171
I believe...

778
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:47,441
you understood my point.

779
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,910
You can go now.

780
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,860
Are you done? Have some fruit.

781
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:10,760
I have work to do. Goodbye.

782
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:15,731
It felt a bit frigid.

783
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,970
Did Mother tell her off?

784
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,510
Mother, have some...

785
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,910
Mother, I'm coming in.

786
00:48:30,151 --> 00:48:31,251
Mother.

787
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,291
Why on earth are you doing this?

788
00:48:34,351 --> 00:48:37,121
What on earth are you doing?

789
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,730
My gosh. I might go deaf.

790
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:42,331
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?

791
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,961
Mother, you'd better tell the truth.

792
00:48:45,561 --> 00:48:47,771
Did you meet Yeon Doo?

793
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,171
What?

794
00:48:49,231 --> 00:48:51,170
Don't try to lie to me.

795
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:52,940
Tell me the truth.

796
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:55,541
Did you see Yeon Doo or not?

797
00:48:55,671 --> 00:48:57,980
Why would you say that, Mother?

798
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:00,311
Why would she ever meet Yeon Doo?

799
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,610
Right. Grandmother, you didn't, did you?

800
00:49:02,751 --> 00:49:03,950
Keep quiet, all of you.

801
00:49:05,581 --> 00:49:07,121
Why won't you answer?

802
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:10,490
Yes, I saw her.

803
00:49:11,421 --> 00:49:12,421
Grandmother.

804
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,890
I happened to see her,

805
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:16,600
so we talked and caught up.

806
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:17,901
What's wrong with that?

807
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,300
Where?

808
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,570
How did you meet her?

809
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:23,601
Why do you need to know?

810
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,110
Why would you question me?

811
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,310
Are you harassing your mother-in-law?

812
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:31,110
Am I obliged to tell you everything?

813
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:32,981
Why can't you tell me?

814
00:49:33,581 --> 00:49:36,319
What are you scheming that you'd meet up...

815
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,121
with someone I kicked out?

816
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:42,921
What? "Scheming?" How dare you say that?

817
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,121
Why?

818
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,260
Is it because you're trying to set her back up...

819
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,260
with Tae Kyung and ruin his life?

820
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,601
Are you that pleased that my son is a mess?

821
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,470
What did you say?

822
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,871
Mother, I think you should stop.

823
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,370
Come outside with me. Calm down and...

824
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:01,470
Let go!

825
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:03,740
Listen!

826
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:07,050
I can't live with you anymore.

827
00:50:07,651 --> 00:50:10,121
I'll leave, or you can leave.

828
00:50:10,581 --> 00:50:12,521
Let's decide that today!

829
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,791
My gosh. That darn...

830
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,290
- Grandmother. - Grandmother.

831
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:20,560
- Oh, dear... - Grandmother.

832
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:22,391
- Oh, gosh. - Grandmother.

833
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,030
You're doing great.

834
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,601
Thanks for keeping things going during the economic struggle.

835
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,740
Even more so...

836
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:33,171
for being a great example to other store owners.

837
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,909
I should thank you.

838
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,510
A visit from you in person gave me so much more energy.

839
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,880
How are the new designs doing?

840
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,920
Customers say they wear it...

841
00:50:44,921 --> 00:50:47,020
not just for sports but as everyday wear too.

842
00:50:47,021 --> 00:50:48,820
They're very satisfied.

843
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,819
We invest in products to no end.

844
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,461
That's our Finance Team's rule.

845
00:50:53,561 --> 00:50:57,430
How do new customers learn of our brand?

846
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,070
These days, it's usually word of mouth.

847
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,831
Excuse me.

848
00:51:03,641 --> 00:51:04,699
What is it, Soo Jung?

849
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,040
I have bad news.

850
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:09,311
Grandmother and Mother had a bad fight over Yeon Doo.

851
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,880
Grandmother almost passed out with high blood pressure.

852
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,010
What?

853
00:51:14,581 --> 00:51:16,251
"Grandmother almost passed out?" Why?

854
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:29,561
What happened? Why did Grandma pass out?

855
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,529
She's fine now.

856
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,030
Her blood pressure and pulse are fine.

857
00:51:33,601 --> 00:51:35,530
Honey, are you all right?

858
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:38,171
I'm fine.

859
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:40,110
So make up your mind.

860
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:42,570
Make up our minds about what?

861
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,581
I can't live with your grandmother anymore.

862
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,550
Decide if you'll live with me or your grandmother.

863
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:50,981
You too, honey.

864
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,220
Darling.

865
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:56,391
What's this about?

866
00:51:56,961 --> 00:52:00,029
It looks like Grandmother met with Yeon Doo in secret.

867
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,231
"She met Yeon Doo?"

868
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,759
Is Grandmother in her right mind?

869
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,671
Chun Myung. Watch your language.

870
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,101
It's true that Grandmother crossed the line.

871
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,141
How could she meet with Yeon Doo?

872
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,651
Grandmother. When did you get back in touch with Yeon Doo?

873
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,191
It hasn't been that long.

874
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:30,819
You said you thought you saw her at a hospital,

875
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,121
so I went looking.

876
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,061
Was it really Yeon Doo whom I saw that day?

877
00:52:37,001 --> 00:52:38,561
I should've run after her.

878
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,500
How is she doing?

879
00:52:41,501 --> 00:52:43,501
Did she give birth to the baby?

880
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,410
Yes, it seemed so.

881
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:48,711
That's good to know.

882
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,110
Do you know if Tae Kyung met with her too?

883
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,680
My gosh. Did Tae Kyung see her too?

884
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,720
Keep quiet.

885
00:53:02,021 --> 00:53:04,791
In Ok will freak out even more if she were to hear that too.

886
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,860
Right.

887
00:53:06,731 --> 00:53:08,859
He must've asked me about seven-month-old babies...

888
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,561
because of Yeon Doo's kid, then.

889
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:14,069
What should we do now?

890
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,800
We're to choose between you and Mother.

891
00:53:17,171 --> 00:53:20,510
Our family might end up splitting in two.

892
00:53:22,811 --> 00:53:26,041
Father must feel the worst out of us all.

893
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,980
(Sorry. Let's keep on dating, not just for a while.)

894
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:33,251
(Go on a date with me before I start my job.)

895
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:36,521
I'll let you off just this once because you were cute.

896
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,320
Don't you dare do it again.

897
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,760
I won't. Thanks for accepting my apology.

898
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,800
I'm treading on thin ice at home.

899
00:53:46,901 --> 00:53:49,300
Our house is a mess because of my brother.

900
00:53:50,771 --> 00:53:53,171
My family's upset because of my sister.

901
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:56,380
Why are our siblings such a pain?

902
00:53:57,211 --> 00:53:58,380
I wonder.

903
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:02,751
Talking to you cheered me up a bit.

904
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,351
Me too.

905
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,151
I don't feel as frustrated because I have someone to talk to.

906
00:54:08,421 --> 00:54:11,590
That's why we should treat each other better.

907
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:15,530
Okay. Let's have great fun on our date.

908
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,220
Why are you so late?

909
00:54:45,421 --> 00:54:46,989
What do you think you're doing?

910
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:48,630
Why are you drinking my drink?

911
00:54:50,231 --> 00:54:51,800
Actually, I needed a drink.

912
00:54:53,171 --> 00:54:55,001
I just got served today.

913
00:54:55,731 --> 00:54:58,541
I told Ms. Lee that Ms. Eun had been in touch with Yeon Doo,

914
00:54:58,871 --> 00:55:00,671
but she wouldn't even budge.

915
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,380
She's actually getting on my case instead.

916
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:07,280
Is she afraid that I'm after her son or what?

917
00:55:07,811 --> 00:55:10,750
Now I'm even sicker of her than Ms. Eun.

918
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:14,521
I mean, I'm disgusted with the whole family.

919
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:16,860
Do you know what I saw...

920
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,461
at the hospital earlier today?

921
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:21,730
Did you see Oh Yeon Doo?

922
00:55:21,731 --> 00:55:23,660
I saw Gong Tae Kyung, not Oh Yeon Doo.

923
00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:26,029
- "Tae Kyung?" - Yes.

924
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,970
He was holding my baby as if it was his.

925
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:33,041
He was acting like a dad.

926
00:55:33,771 --> 00:55:36,740
Why was Tae Kyung holding Yeon Doo's baby?

927
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,751
Does that mean they are together?

928
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,719
If that wasn't the case, why would he be holding her baby?

929
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,279
And you just sat back and did nothing?

930
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,621
So I made some threats against Yeon Doo's mom.

931
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,260
I told her to separate those two before I stepped up.

932
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,030
You should call Tae Kyung's mom now.

933
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,560
Tell her that they are seeing each other.

934
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,159
Do you think I'm crazy?

935
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,271
I don't want to be a puppet after what I had to go through.

936
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,271
I want to see Ms. Lee...

937
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:03,969
take hard blows from Yeon Doo...

938
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:07,110
and bitterly regret what she did to me.

939
00:56:07,871 --> 00:56:11,041
Those who act ungratefully should learn their lessons.

940
00:56:12,441 --> 00:56:14,351
She shouldn't have messed with Jang Se Jin.

941
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,021
I need that punk's address.

942
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,720
Tae Kyung's address?

943
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:21,691
For what?

944
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:24,191
I will bring my baby here.

945
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:26,291
I'll hold her when she cries,

946
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,831
and I'll feed her.

947
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,860
I'll take care of her all day.

948
00:56:40,671 --> 00:56:43,041
(Name: Kang Bong Nim)

949
00:56:49,711 --> 00:56:50,851
Hello?

950
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:53,421
Ho, this is Dae Sang.

951
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:54,851
I know.

952
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:58,061
It's been a while. How have you been?

953
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,291
I suddenly thought of you, so I called.

954
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,601
Do you want to go out for a drink with me?

955
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,800
I'd love to.

956
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,180
All right. Let me fill yours.

957
00:57:31,691 --> 00:57:35,331
This is Ha Neul. Isn't she lovely?

958
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,360
She's Yeon Doo's daughter.

959
00:57:39,901 --> 00:57:41,271
She's my grandniece.

960
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:43,671
She's adorable.

961
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:46,941
She looks just like her mom.

962
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,481
Bong Nim was worried sick of her.

963
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:55,280
I'm so glad that both your niece and grandniece are healthy.

964
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,021
Listen, Ho.

965
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:01,990
But Yeon Doo wants to live with Tae Kyung again.

966
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,690
That's why Bong Nim didn't come to school.

967
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:06,691
Right.

968
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:08,331
My sister says...

969
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,700
she will live as if she doesn't have a daughter.

970
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:16,530
She's well aware of how his family will react when they find out.

971
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:20,941
You know my sister, right?

972
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:23,140
She pretends to be strong,

973
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:26,080
but I bet she's sobbing alone in her room.

974
00:58:26,081 --> 00:58:27,581
Tell me about it.

975
00:58:29,581 --> 00:58:33,490
Not a single day goes by when Bong Nim feels at ease.

976
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,220
She worried about me when we were younger.

977
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:39,961
After she got married, she worried about her husband.

978
00:58:40,561 --> 00:58:42,490
And after her husband died, she worried about her children.

979
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,331
She went through all sorts of hardships.

980
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,311
Can't you...

981
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,450
move into our house again?

982
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,880
What?

983
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:06,351
We had a lot of fun when you lived with us.

984
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,550
My sister laughed a lot.

985
00:59:09,391 --> 00:59:11,660
You didn't go back to your family.

986
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,561
Then you can move in with us again.

987
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:15,690
I'm not going anywhere.

988
00:59:15,691 --> 00:59:18,101
I like the place I'm living in now.

989
00:59:19,731 --> 00:59:22,831
Then we should just drink together like this...

990
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,271
from time to time. You can do that, right?

991
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:28,441
I'd be grateful.

992
00:59:54,601 --> 00:59:56,200
If his family finds out...

993
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,299
that Tae Kyung and Yeon Doo are back together,

994
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,371
she'll get treated even worse.

995
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:03,839
Would his mother sit idly by...

996
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,109
and let his son raise Yeon Doo's baby?

997
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:10,279
Get the two of them to break up as soon as you can...

998
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,780
and return my baby to me.

999
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:26,731
I'm sending you the address of the place we are staying.

1000
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,271
I'll take good care of Yeon Doo.

1001
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,300
Please don't worry.

1002
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:37,840
Mom.

1003
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,081
Get up.

1004
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,151
What's the matter?

1005
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,151
Let's go bring Yeon Doo.

1006
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,351
"Yeon Doo?"

1007
01:00:52,021 --> 01:00:54,391
Who could it be so early in the morning?

1008
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:05,570
What?

1009
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,670
Oh Yeon Doo, where are you?

1010
01:01:09,671 --> 01:01:12,740
Yeon Doo, come on out this instant.

1011
01:01:15,151 --> 01:01:17,250
Mother, please don't be like this.

1012
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:19,080
Mom, what are you doing here?

1013
01:01:19,081 --> 01:01:20,920
What brings you here so early in the morning?

1014
01:01:20,921 --> 01:01:22,290
Dong Wook, go find Ha Neul.

1015
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:23,291
- Okay - Mother,

1016
01:01:23,292 --> 01:01:25,219
please calm down and talk with me.

1017
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,320
- What? - Please...

1018
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,231
That's the baby's room. He Neul must be in there.

1019
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,159
Dong Wook, please. Why are you being like this?

1020
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,370
I'm not your brother-in-law.

1021
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:36,101
Don't stand in my way!

1022
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,410
What?

1023
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:48,811
The room is full of baby products.

1024
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,320
When did you make up the room?

1025
01:01:52,021 --> 01:01:55,550
Tae Kyung did it while I was gone.

1026
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,360
What?

1027
01:01:58,191 --> 01:01:59,360
Are you saying...

1028
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:02,160
Tae Kyung did the whole thing without you?

1029
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,601
Yes.

1030
01:02:04,101 --> 01:02:07,231
I believed Yeon Doo and Real would come back.

1031
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,371
I was sure.

1032
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:12,070
And she did come back, Mother.

1033
01:02:14,871 --> 01:02:18,409
- Dong Wook, go and bring Ha Neul. - Okay.

1034
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,080
- Wait, Dong Wook. - Mother, please.

1035
01:02:20,081 --> 01:02:22,509
Yeon Doo, you should come with me.

1036
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:23,719
Mother.

1037
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,150
Move. I want to go with my daughter. You can't stop me.

1038
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:29,990
Don't try to stop me. Nothing can stop me now.

1039
01:02:30,461 --> 01:02:33,089
Mom, Ha Neul is here. Come out here.

1040
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,090
- Tae Kyung. - Mother.

1041
01:02:34,091 --> 01:02:35,659
Get away from me!

1042
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,830
- Mom. - Gosh.

1043
01:02:36,831 --> 01:02:39,259
Dong Wook, wait.

1044
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:42,000
Please don't be like this. Your sister will be hurt.

1045
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:43,270
What do you think you are?

1046
01:02:43,271 --> 01:02:45,739
Are you Ha Neul's biological dad? Are you Yeon Doo's husband?

1047
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,469
You're nothing.

1048
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:50,069
We will protect Yeon Doo and Ha Neul.

1049
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,940
You stay out of it now.

1050
01:02:51,941 --> 01:02:53,239
Dong Wook.

1051
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,509
- Mom. - Come on out.

1052
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,120
- Mom, let go of me. - Let's go!

1053
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:58,949
- Follow me out or see me die! - Mom.

1054
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,150
- Mother. - Mom.

1055
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,250
- Hurry on out. Go! - Dong Wook.

1056
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:02,320
Mother!

1057
01:03:13,901 --> 01:03:15,299
Mom, please.

1058
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,941
Just let go of me!

1059
01:03:21,441 --> 01:03:22,470
Yeon Doo.

1060
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:24,980
Are you really going to be like this?

1061
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:27,481
Mom, I can't go.

1062
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,780
I'm not going anywhere without Tae Kyung.

1063
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:32,779
Fine. Let's see it to the end.

1064
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,120
I will kill you and kill myself.

1065
01:03:34,121 --> 01:03:35,521
I'm not dying.

1066
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:38,720
I can't die leaving Tae Kyung and Ha Neul behind.

1067
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:41,891
Then let me take Ha Neul with me.

1068
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:44,299
You can live with Tae Kyung.

1069
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,231
I'll take your baby.

1070
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:50,030
Mom, how could you say such a thing?

1071
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,470
What?

1072
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,211
You told me to get an abortion at first.

1073
01:03:56,410 --> 01:04:00,450
You tried to take me to an obstetrician.

1074
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,610
Yeon Doo.

1075
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:02,610
Right.

1076
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:06,481
I'm not a good enough daughter to you.

1077
01:04:07,691 --> 01:04:10,590
The moment I decided to have a baby without a dad,

1078
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,691
I became a horrible daughter to you.

1079
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,700
I had to go through all that to have the baby.

1080
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,371
And what?

1081
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,970
You want me to give up on my baby?

1082
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:28,470
Fine. Take her if you want to see me die.

1083
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,840
Go ahead and take her!

1084
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:35,110
Then you should break up with Tae Kyung.

1085
01:04:35,251 --> 01:04:37,750
You can raise her with me at our home.

1086
01:04:37,751 --> 01:04:38,851
No, I don't want to.

1087
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,691
I don't want to break up with Tae Kyung.

1088
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:44,860
I promised him.

1089
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,759
I promised not to leave him without an explanation.

1090
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,061
Then what do you wish to do?

1091
01:04:49,961 --> 01:04:53,501
Mom, I know that I'm being brazen and selfish.

1092
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:57,840
Please, give us a chance.

1093
01:04:58,641 --> 01:05:01,870
Please accept and approve of us just this once.

1094
01:05:01,871 --> 01:05:04,109
I'm sorry.

1095
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:07,351
I'm so sorry, Mom.

1096
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,521
Mom, what now?

1097
01:05:49,351 --> 01:05:50,720
As if I would give up.

1098
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:54,430
Head home without me. I have someplace to be.

1099
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:57,660
Mom.

1100
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:08,811
Tae Kyung.

1101
01:06:10,611 --> 01:06:11,641
Yeon Doo.

1102
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,550
Why are you like this?

1103
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:18,451
I thought...

1104
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:20,951
that you and Ha Neul had left.

1105
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:23,991
I told you I wouldn't leave.

1106
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,830
I said I'd stay with you until the very end.

1107
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:31,800
I'm sorry.

1108
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:35,000
I'm sorry I hurt you again.

1109
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,851
My mom must be back.

1110
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,619
I'll handle her.

1111
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,250
- Can you take Ha Neul? - Sure.

1112
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:00,531
Tae Kyung!

1113
01:07:12,201 --> 01:07:14,710
Hey, open up while I ask nicely.

1114
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:16,510
Or I'm barging in.

1115
01:07:32,861 --> 01:07:34,130
But guess what?

1116
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:38,531
Ms. Eun is in touch with Yeon Doo.

1117
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:40,970
Yes, I saw her.

1118
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:42,901
Grandmother.

1119
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:45,299
I happened to see her,

1120
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,039
so we talked and caught up.

1121
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,411
What's wrong with that?

1122
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,550
Mother, you need to come out here.

1123
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,760
What...

1124
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:09,861
brings you by?

1125
01:08:11,101 --> 01:08:12,201
Are you aware...

1126
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,901
that my daughter and your son are back together?

1127
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:18,771
What?

1128
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,970
I'll handle my daughter, and you will handle your son.

1129
01:08:23,771 --> 01:08:26,111
What exactly do you mean by that?

1130
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:30,651
By any means necessary, we will tear them apart.

1131
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:11,391
(The Real Has Come!)

1132
01:09:11,861 --> 01:09:15,361
How long have you been fooling me?

1133
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:17,300
You're done being my son.

1134
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:19,701
I'll make you one last offer.

1135
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:21,271
Come to the US with me.

1136
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:24,540
I like how my Tae Kyung is staying strong.

1137
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,071
But I'm nothing compared to my Yeon Doo.

1138
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:28,771
Ha Neul has a high fever.

1139
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,411
Mom...

1140
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,880
Let's raise Ha Neul by ourselves.

1141
01:09:34,451 --> 01:09:36,550
We'll hide someplace where we won't be recognized.

1142
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:39,219
I'm the biological father of Yeon Doo's baby.

1143
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,249
- My gosh. - Grandmother.

1144
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,490
Give me a straight answer.

1145
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:42,720
Is it true or not?
