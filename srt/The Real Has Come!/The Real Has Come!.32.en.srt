1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,531
Oh Yeon Doo...

2
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:09,961
I'm taking her with me.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,031
What did you just say?

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,641
I'm here for my baby, you prick.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,110
Who says it's your baby?

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,481
Pack up the nonsense and get lost.

7
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,580
"Nonsense?"

8
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:29,620
I figured it all out.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,851
I know everything.

10
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,661
I'm the father of Yeon Doo's baby.

11
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:38,190
When you first met,

12
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:41,091
she was already pregnant with my baby.

13
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:43,461
So?

14
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:46,800
- What? - Let's say you're right.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,601
What does that change?

16
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,101
What game are you playing?

17
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,970
That baby's mine.

18
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,680
It has half of my DNA.

19
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:57,511
That doesn't matter...

20
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,310
because Real is my child.

21
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,750
How can it be yours?

22
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:03,981
It is my child.

23
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,891
I don't care whose DNA it has.

24
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,921
It is my baby whom I'll protect...

25
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:12,190
and raise.

26
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:15,130
What did you just say?

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,701
Yeon Doo.

28
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,731
Yeon Doo.

29
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,940
Don't you have any decency?

30
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,511
Why are you here causing a scene at this hour?

31
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,050
Yeon Doo,

32
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:38,050
I'm here to take you home.

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,849
Kim Jun Ha!

34
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,061
Tae Kyung, don't.

35
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,031
Follow me. We'll talk.

36
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,201
I'd like that.

37
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,231
I have a lot to hear from you and a lot to say.

38
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,270
Let me talk to him. Please wait here.

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,090
You heard me earlier.

40
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,261
So don't even bother lying.

41
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,060
I know the baby's mine.

42
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,530
So?

43
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,300
What do you want?

44
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,900
Have you no shame?

45
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:34,471
It's my baby, and I should take it with me.

46
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:39,680
Do you really think I'd let you have it after giving birth?

47
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:40,951
Yeon Doo,

48
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,550
come back to me.

49
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:45,690
- What? - There won't be any trouble...

50
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:46,821
if you come back to me.

51
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:49,060
I am the father, after all.

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,731
No, you're not the father.

53
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
What?

54
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:58,231
It was Tae Kyung who looked out for the baby all this time, not you.

55
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:00,830
It wouldn't have lived had it not been for him.

56
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,601
Tae Kyung is Real's true father.

57
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,370
Cut the nonsense, will you?

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,770
As if that would get me to back off.

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,881
I'll tell everyone.

60
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,280
I'll go to your family and Tae Kyung's...

61
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:15,251
and tell them the truth.

62
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,851
You're the one...

63
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,520
who wrote that online post.

64
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:24,191
What?

65
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:26,691
There's no one but you who'd accuse Tae Kyung...

66
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,731
of not being the father.

67
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,930
- That's not it. - Because of that,

68
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,900
we almost lost Real.

69
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,310
We almost lost the child!

70
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,580
You should've come to me directly,

71
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,851
not do something that cowardly.

72
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,650
Don't you care...

73
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:51,120
about what happens to me or the child?

74
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,550
And you call yourself the father?

75
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,391
What kind of father hurts his child just to feed his greed and ego?

76
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:03,601
- Yeon Doo... - You...

77
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,601
lost your right as the father the moment you told me...

78
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:10,770
to have an abortion.

79
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:14,970
Even if Tae Kyung wasn't in the picture,

80
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:17,741
I wouldn't go back to you.

81
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,321
- Yeon Doo... - Don't.

82
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,720
Don't even touch a hair on my body.

83
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,561
Don't you dare give my baby your attention.

84
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,670
Go.

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,571
Get lost!

86
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,641
Do you want to see me faint again?

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Yeon Doo.

88
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,790
Is your stomach pain gone?

89
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:38,061
Yes, I'm fine now.

90
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,131
It scared me.

91
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,761
I was worried that something would happen to Real.

92
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,371
You seem more concerned about Real than I am.

93
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,641
You and Real are one and the same.

94
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,641
It seems as though the jerk knows the truth.

95
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:57,410
Doesn't it scare you?

96
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,681
It does.

97
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:04,251
But I won't dwell on the past or go back in reverse.

98
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:07,590
You are the father of this baby,

99
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,121
and I will stay with you no matter what happens.

100
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,431
I'll tell your family about my wrongdoing...

101
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:18,201
and ask for their forgiveness.

102
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,900
Rather than avoiding them,

103
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:22,301
I will keep on begging.

104
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,941
We'll do it together, then.

105
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,240
You should head home in the morning.

106
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,181
That way, he won't be able to visit.

107
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,951
Sure.

108
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,020
(Gong Obstetrics and Gynaecology)

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,890
We did one last ultrasound,

110
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:49,160
and everything was fine.

111
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,260
We're heading home now, so you don't have to worry,

112
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:53,399
Mother.

113
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,670
What a relief.

114
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,769
Real is one lucky child.

115
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,241
No one gets to have a father like you.

116
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,681
I'll put Yeon Doo on.

117
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,580
Hey, Mom. It's me.

118
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,691
I'm sorry I made you worry.

119
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,121
That's okay.

120
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,491
Worrying about her kids is what a mom does.

121
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,219
A lot happened yesterday and today.

122
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,790
Go on home and get some rest.

123
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,160
Okay, we will.

124
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:24,600
I'll call again soon.

125
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,871
Bye, Mother.

126
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,840
You've become a much-loved son-in-law.

127
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,270
No one could love me more than my mother-in-law.

128
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,441
Yeon Doo's home.

129
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:41,681
Are you okay, Yeon Doo?

130
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,880
Tae Kyung wouldn't let me visit,

131
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,251
so all I could do was worry.

132
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,251
I'm fine now.

133
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,860
I came home sooner so I wouldn't worry you anymore.

134
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:53,430
You're back way too early in the morning.

135
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,991
You woke me up.

136
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,261
You never sleep in.

137
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:00,500
I sleep in almost every day now.

138
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,571
Okay?

139
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,801
Yeon Doo, I'm so glad Real's okay.

140
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:08,039
I prayed so much that Real would stay...

141
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,480
right in your tummy.

142
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:12,680
My wife really was so very worried.

143
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:14,451
She could barely sleep.

144
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,181
Thank you, Chun Myung, Soo Jung.

145
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:22,290
Where's Father?

146
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,990
I told him you'd be back early today,

147
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:26,530
but he was gone when I woke up.

148
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:28,530
Did he go to play golf?

149
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,299
We can have dinner together.

150
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,830
Go and get some rest.

151
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:34,471
Don't do anything today.

152
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:36,001
Yes, Mother.

153
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:49,351
I'm sorry I came in while you were out.

154
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:52,790
I thought we should talk away from the others.

155
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,690
It's okay, Father. We're listening.

156
00:08:57,891 --> 00:08:59,121
Are you all right?

157
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,631
Yes.

158
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,030
I'm sorry...

159
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:07,471
for causing you concern and displeasure.

160
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:17,481
The truth about you two.

161
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,881
I'll pretend I don't know a thing.

162
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,150
- What? - What?

163
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:24,950
The baby you're carrying.

164
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:28,190
To me, it's still Tae Kyung's baby.

165
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,991
Father...

166
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:34,060
It's not because I accept you wholeheartedly.

167
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:36,361
I disapprove,

168
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,160
but I'll give you a chance to ask the family for forgiveness.

169
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,341
Tell your mother as soon as possible and apologize.

170
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,211
I'll go with whatever she decides.

171
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:52,011
Thank you, Father.

172
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,020
Get some rest.

173
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,950
Well done, Tae Kyung.

174
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,221
What do you mean?

175
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,560
You called him "Father."

176
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,320
That's it?

177
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:43,501
I don't deserve to be praised for that.

178
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,300
That was me being sly...

179
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,131
so he'd accept us.

180
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:53,910
Who cares why you did it?

181
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,680
You said something you never could your whole life,

182
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,611
and Father...

183
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,751
heard something he never thought he would.

184
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,851
Yes.

185
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:10,160
What we've been through taught me that my father's...

186
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,761
a much greater man than I had realized.

187
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,430
We should...

188
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,670
tell your mother the truth soon too.

189
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,540
Let's tell the rest of the family as well.

190
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,881
Yeon Doo, you just got back from the clinic.

191
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:33,679
You shouldn't overdo it yet.

192
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,950
Let's see how you do for a few days before telling anyone.

193
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,891
Okay. Let's do that.

194
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:52,800
Is it you, Hyun Woo?

195
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:01,611
I won't have breakfast.

196
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:04,011
I'll sleep in.

197
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:07,150
Did Hyun Woo not come home last night?

198
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,310
Something has to be going on.

199
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:11,950
It's not serious.

200
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,891
I'd like to sleep.

201
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,621
What is it?

202
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,660
You said you'd tell me everything.

203
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,070
Ji Myung.

204
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:34,440
Don't hide anything. Tell me.

205
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:43,550
Hyun Woo wants a divorce.

206
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:45,981
What?

207
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:50,520
He said he couldn't live with me anymore.

208
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,991
So it came to that.

209
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:58,631
What do you want to do?

210
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:03,170
I don't think I can have the baby without him.

211
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:04,971
Why not?

212
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,141
I'm afraid to be a mom.

213
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:11,511
I never felt...

214
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,950
the love of my birth mom.

215
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:16,680
I'm not sure if I can raise a kid well.

216
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:17,950
I'm scared.

217
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,320
That was because your mother...

218
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,591
was very ill.

219
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:27,261
What if...

220
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,261
I don't know how to show my kid I love them?

221
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,131
What if I'm gruff and sensitive...

222
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,070
and hurt the child?

223
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,270
I should be kind and sweet like Hyun Woo.

224
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,081
I should love the child with my whole heart.

225
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:53,251
I didn't know...

226
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,361
that's what you were thinking.

227
00:13:57,391 --> 00:14:00,331
I should've shown you more love.

228
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,831
I should've approached you more, even when you had pushed me away.

229
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:06,930
I'm sorry...

230
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,430
for not realizing...

231
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,601
what you were thinking.

232
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,410
What you just told me...

233
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:23,679
Go to Hyun Woo and say it to him,

234
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,150
and stop him from leaving.

235
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:28,351
It won't do any good.

236
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,961
He always does what he sets his mind to.

237
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:33,659
Let's still try,

238
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,961
so we don't have regrets later on.

239
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:48,440
(Jang Se Jin)

240
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,981
- Yeon Doo... - Don't.

241
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,790
Don't even touch a hair on my body.

242
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:03,261
Don't you dare give my baby your attention.

243
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,831
You're in, aren't you? Come outside.

244
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,611
Why are you here? I never called you.

245
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,309
Your secretary's paying a visit to check on you...

246
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,081
because you hadn't called in so long.

247
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,920
Don't beat around the bush. Tell me why you're here.

248
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:39,520
I thought about it and just couldn't understand.

249
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,331
Why did you ask me about Tae Kyung's plate number yesterday?

250
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,631
Did I ask?

251
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,371
I'm being serious.

252
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,971
Oh, it was nothing, really.

253
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,040
I saw a car identical to mine in the company's parkade...

254
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,680
and wondered if it was Tae Kyung's.

255
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:59,040
I see.

256
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:03,050
You two drive the same make and model.

257
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,790
Were you here the whole time?

258
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,560
Yes. I was a bit tired.

259
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,961
If that's all, you can leave. I can't be bothered.

260
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,131
Yeon Doo went home.

261
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,731
Won't you pay her a visit?

262
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
You keep asking leading questions.

263
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:30,040
I'm playing the fool.

264
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,450
- What? - We're still on the same side.

265
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:35,810
Quit suspecting me.

266
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,091
Act appropriately if you don't want to be suspected.

267
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:51,800
Do you think you'll get your way?

268
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,920
Hey. Where's your wife?

269
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,221
She's taking a nap, so can you lower your voice?

270
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,820
- What? - Grandma,

271
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,260
if it isn't urgent, can you come back another time?

272
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,830
Am I not welcome here?

273
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:08,429
Why are you kicking me out?

274
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,470
Please, lower your voice.

275
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:11,501
What?

276
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:13,699
Grandma, when did you get here?

277
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,970
You woke Yeon Doo up!

278
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:19,680
I only said a few words. Why are you getting mad at me?

279
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,781
It's okay, Tae Kyung. I woke up because I had plenty of rest.

280
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,321
See? Why are you blaming me for no reason?

281
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,920
What did you do to yourself to bother so many people?

282
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:33,290
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,190
You didn't get to study because of me.

284
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,930
Exactly.

285
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,831
- Mr. Kim. - Yes, ma'am.

286
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,630
This is carp juice.

287
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,899
She checked the condition of the carp herself...

288
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,971
and got them juiced.

289
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,940
Thank you so much, Grandma.

290
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,511
I had no idea you'd worry about me so much.

291
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,241
Yeon Doo, you still don't know my grandma well.

292
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,619
This is probably just a bribe to get you to teach her better.

293
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,650
What?

294
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,291
Tae Kyung.

295
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,291
- You can wait outside, Mr. Kim. - Yes, ma'am.

296
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,590
Here.

297
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,761
Can you check my homework?

298
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,571
Okay.

299
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,471
Let's see.

300
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,471
You studied so hard.

301
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:27,380
You're a model student.

302
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,781
You're being too kind.

303
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,481
Gosh. This isn't good enough.

304
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:35,849
At this rate, how will you beat my mother-in-law?

305
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,721
- What? You little... - Hold on!

306
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,561
Let me check to see if you're ready for a pop quiz.

307
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,400
What is this?

308
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,830
- "Strawberry, I miss you." - What?

309
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,540
No. Don't read that.

310
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,510
- No. - What is this?

311
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,909
Gosh, no. Don't worry about this.

312
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,010
It's nothing, so don't worry about it.

313
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:04,280
Don't follow me out.

314
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:05,380
Grandma.

315
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,991
What's up with her?

316
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:12,090
"Strawberry?"

317
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,889
By the way,

318
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,090
is there a word you really want to learn?

319
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,500
Strawberry. I want to learn how to write strawberry.

320
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:25,399
It's about that writing contest.

321
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,640
Is something like a letter acceptable?

322
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,839
Strawberry must be a person, not the fruit.

323
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
What?

324
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:37,610
What did you say? Strawberry is a person?

325
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,721
Strawberry.

326
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,590
They almost found out about you.

327
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,089
(Strawberry, I miss you. I miss you every day.)

328
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,961
I miss you, Strawberry.

329
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
I miss you every day.

330
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,170
Will we meet when I die?

331
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,630
(Gong Obstetrics and Gynaecology)

332
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,880
Let's go out to talk.

333
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,481
What's left to talk about?

334
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,390
If you don't want to go out, I'll say it here.

335
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:54,461
I can't divorce you.

336
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:57,889
What?

337
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,490
I won't agree to a divorce,

338
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,961
so if you want to file a lawsuit, go ahead.

339
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:04,230
Why are you acting like this now?

340
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:05,971
Do we have to make things more complicated?

341
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,741
It's because of Olive.

342
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,210
You want to take Olive away from me?

343
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:12,211
No.

344
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,380
I want to raise Olive with you.

345
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:19,150
What are you talking about?

346
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,920
I don't think I can be a good mother.

347
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,461
That's why I need a good father like you.

348
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:30,491
I know I have a lot of flaws.

349
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,461
I also know you make up for all those flaws.

350
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,471
Why are you acting like this?

351
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,670
What if my child gets hurt because of my flaws?

352
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,070
What if she takes after me...

353
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:47,781
and has a hard time loving people and turns bad?

354
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,081
I need you.

355
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:52,581
Not for my sake, but for our child.

356
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,849
You don't have to look at me,

357
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,450
so please stay for our child.

358
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,821
As long as you love our child,

359
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,360
I won't expect anything more.

360
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:06,660
What are you so afraid of?

361
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,770
You're competent and smart,

362
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:12,370
so why are you already so afraid?

363
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,071
You're not a bad person.

364
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,071
You're just guarded because you're afraid.

365
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,281
I'm the only person who understands that about you,

366
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,110
so why do you put up a wall and hide your feelings?

367
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:31,521
Tell me everything. All the little details.

368
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,991
If you promise me this,

369
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,930
I'll reconsider the divorce.

370
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:10,630
Mother, dinner was so delicious.

371
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:13,699
I cooked to celebrate your release from the hospital,

372
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,160
so I'm glad to hear that.

373
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,731
Yeon Doo. Here.

374
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,930
What is this?

375
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:23,771
It's a welcome-back gift for Real. It's a rattle.

376
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,440
Thank you. I didn't expect this.

377
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,380
I'm one step late. I got a gift too.

378
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:34,821
Ta-Da.

379
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,349
What's this?

380
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,350
A hat.

381
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:40,360
It's so cute that I could die.

382
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,160
Real, this is from Aunt Yu Myung. Don't forget.

383
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:48,399
Thank you, Aunt Yu Myung.

384
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,430
- We're home. - Hey.

385
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:53,700
You guys came home together!

386
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,740
We did.

387
00:23:55,741 --> 00:23:57,970
We came just in time.

388
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:58,971
Honey.

389
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,940
Oh, right. Here.

390
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:03,981
It's nothing much.

391
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,649
What are you saying?

392
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,551
She spent an hour picking out this doll.

393
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,991
Thank you, Ji Myung, Hyun Woo.

394
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,859
What is this? We didn't even talk about it,

395
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,961
but everyone got her a gift.

396
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,900
By the way, Grandma, did you get them anything?

397
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,599
- Gosh. - That's a bit harsh.

398
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,129
What's with all the fuss?

399
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,501
Why would I give them a gift for almost losing the baby?

400
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,741
You gave me carp juice earlier.

401
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:33,071
"Carp juice?"

402
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:34,840
Grandma did?

403
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:37,649
Really? She gave you carp juice?

404
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,650
Yes.

405
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:41,521
She chose the carp herself before she got them juiced.

406
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,150
I can't believe it though.

407
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:44,889
Why don't you believe in people?

408
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,420
Do you know how picky I was choosing them for your wife?

409
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:52,760
Okay. Hold on. My turn's next.

410
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:54,230
Wait one second.

411
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,100
What? Gosh.

412
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:01,100
Okay. Here I come.

413
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,741
- Gosh. - Gosh!

414
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:06,169
This is Yeon Doo's favourite, carrot cake.

415
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,310
Let's blow out the candle together to celebrate...

416
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:09,581
Real's safe return.

417
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,890
What? Are you crying?

418
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,720
Yeon Doo.

419
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,360
What's wrong, Yeon Doo?

420
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,400
It's because I feel so welcomed.

421
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,071
I'll cherish this gratitude...

422
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:34,741
for the rest of my life.

423
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:38,610
Goodness, Yeon Doo. Don't cry.

424
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:47,251
Tae Kyung, you went through a lot taking care of Yeon Doo.

425
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:49,581
Thank you,

426
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:51,190
Father.

427
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,389
- What? - What? "Father?"

428
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,761
What has gotten into you?

429
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,230
I know.

430
00:25:57,231 --> 00:26:00,660
Did you have a change of heart because Real was safe?

431
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,331
Let's blow out the candle together.

432
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:07,470
Okay. Let's do that.

433
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:08,471
Right.

434
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:11,241
Right. Let's blow it out together.

435
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,409
Grandma, let's blow them out together.

436
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,610
- Yeon Doo, go ahead. - Come on.

437
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:18,711
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

438
00:26:20,521 --> 00:26:22,850
And applaud!

439
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,561
Honey.

440
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:39,271
What kind of magic did you work on Tae Kyung?

441
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,440
What are you talking about?

442
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:43,839
He addressed you as his father,

443
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,011
and I couldn't believe my ears.

444
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,680
He probably said it because it was about time.

445
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:52,481
I'm so happy...

446
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:55,521
that I'm shedding tears of joy.

447
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,261
You had it rough from the moment you married into this family.

448
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,930
And I will do my best...

449
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,160
so that you can be your happy self.

450
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:09,801
Thank you, honey.

451
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:12,801
There's nothing more that I want.

452
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:15,301
Once Real and Olive are born,

453
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,670
I'll live my life cherishing them.

454
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Wait.

455
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,200
Why are you fidgeting with Real's gifts?

456
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,740
Why put on a hat that doesn't fit?

457
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:51,741
Well, they're gifts from my family.

458
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,271
Hold on.

459
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,410
You just referred to them as your family.

460
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:03,051
I guess you look cute.

461
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:08,021
Real, we'll let this slide since he looks adorable.

462
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,461
Hey, Ji Myung.

463
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,630
Can you teach me how you made the bibimbap the other day?

464
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,640
How many spoons of gochujang and sesame oil do you need?

465
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,700
What?

466
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,340
Are you kidding me?

467
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:30,081
Gosh, what's burning in here?

468
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,481
Hey, you're here.

469
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,051
Ji Myung, what are you doing?

470
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:37,291
I want sunny side up eggs, but they keep on burning.

471
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,220
You're high-maintenance, aren't you?

472
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,491
Please stop torturing the eggs, and let me take over.

473
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,390
- Should I? - Yes.

474
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:54,400
The cravings must've started.

475
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:57,410
That must be it.

476
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,440
I had no idea bibimbap was this tasty.

477
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,211
Can't you slow down a little?

478
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,781
Was I also this ugly...

479
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,991
I mean, I must've seemed this natural as well.

480
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,761
So...

481
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,430
Yes?

482
00:29:20,231 --> 00:29:21,301
Thanks.

483
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,501
What?

484
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,340
I'm grateful for you making me bibimbap that day...

485
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,511
and how you came to my aid today.

486
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:34,940
I'm also grateful for how you told me...

487
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:36,340
to be honest.

488
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,521
Thanks to you, I got a lot off my chest.

489
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:43,721
Hyun Woo and I are in a better place as well.

490
00:29:46,221 --> 00:29:47,390
I'm glad to hear that.

491
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:50,761
And now,

492
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,930
I will also speak the truth.

493
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,031
About what?

494
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:57,771
About everything.

495
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:01,939
Can I also have a bite?

496
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,100
I'll get a spoon.

497
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,051
Why are you suddenly asking me to meet you?

498
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,561
It's important, so be there.

499
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,561
Has anything bad ever come out of listening to me?

500
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:26,130
I guess not. I'll head right out.

501
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,741
Mr. Kim, you're here.

502
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,620
I didn't know you'd be joining us, Mr. Kim.

503
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,420
Gosh, hello. It's good to see you, Ms. Lee.

504
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,389
Right. I don't know what this is about,

505
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,461
but please have a seat.

506
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,471
Ms. Jang, what did you want to say to me?

507
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:11,670
You said it was your last request...

508
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,110
and that the chairman shouldn't know about this.

509
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,610
It's why I kept our meeting a secret.

510
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,610
Actually,

511
00:31:19,081 --> 00:31:21,581
it was Mr. Kim who wanted to see you.

512
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,721
Mr. Kim?

513
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,321
What could Mr. Kim want to say to me?

514
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,961
It concerns Ms. Oh.

515
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:33,831
Ms. Jang...

516
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:36,301
In fact,

517
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,471
it's about Ms. Oh's baby.

518
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,170
Her baby?

519
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:44,271
Are you referring to Real?

520
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,711
What about Real?

521
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:52,211
Oh, well...

522
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,380
Just tell her the truth, Mr. Kim.

523
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,650
Down to the very last detail.

524
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:12,571
Well, I didn't want to say anything,

525
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:16,501
but I helped Ms. Oh and the baby.

526
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,011
Sorry?

527
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:22,981
I spotted her outside the office as she was fainting...

528
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:26,380
and helped Tae Kyung take her to the clinic.

529
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:29,781
My gosh. Did it happen that way?

530
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,490
Yeon Doo and Real were unharmed,

531
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:34,320
thanks to you, Mr. Kim.

532
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:36,320
You have no idea how grateful I am.

533
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,231
I'm not one to seek credit,

534
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,001
but Ms. Jang provided me with the opportunity.

535
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:44,770
But why...

536
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:46,900
did you call me here just to tell me that?

537
00:32:47,741 --> 00:32:48,771
Sorry?

538
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:50,571
It's odd, that's all.

539
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:55,010
I don't see how you helping my children...

540
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:56,440
is something to hide from the chairman.

541
00:32:57,211 --> 00:32:58,581
Don't you agree, Ms. Jang?

542
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:00,280
What?

543
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,990
Truth be told, Ms. Jang and I are dating.

544
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,421
What?

545
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,390
- Mr. Kim? - Honey, don't.

546
00:33:13,231 --> 00:33:15,231
I heard you weren't fond of her.

547
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,831
You aren't fond of her because she had feelings...

548
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:19,271
for your son.

549
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,739
Well, that...

550
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,600
I understand you would feel that way.

551
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,140
However,

552
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:28,811
I don't want the person I cherish to be misunderstood.

553
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:31,410
It's why I asked to see you.

554
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,950
Informing the chairman of our relationship...

555
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,921
seemed a bit embarrassing.

556
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,590
For a moment there,

557
00:33:38,591 --> 00:33:40,620
I thought something bad had happened.

558
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:44,160
I see you found the one for you, Ms. Jang.

559
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,691
I'm happy for you. Congratulations.

560
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,461
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

561
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,429
Anyway, I'm grateful.

562
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,171
A huge weight has been lifted off my chest.

563
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:56,240
I'll wish for your happiness.

564
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,940
Ms. Jang, Mr. Kim,

565
00:33:57,941 --> 00:33:59,570
I hope you'll give my children your blessing as well.

566
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,510
Enjoy your time together, then.

567
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,421
Unbelievable.

568
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:24,401
What? You met Ms. Jang and Mr. Kim?

569
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:26,000
That's right.

570
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,740
They called me out to announce their relationship.

571
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,200
Were you also aware of this?

572
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,541
Yes, we were.

573
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,010
I see.

574
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,441
Then was it really to hope...

575
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,780
that I no longer hold a grudge against Ms. Jang?

576
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,180
Anyway, I'm happy to hear that they're together.

577
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:44,550
Yes, they seem to adore one another.

578
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:47,361
Then I'll head home with a spring in my step.

579
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,861
See you at home.

580
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Sure.

581
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:07,680
Stop glaring at me like that.

582
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,280
It'll only hurt your eyes.

583
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,910
Why didn't you speak up when I gave you the chance?

584
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,050
Who said you could do something like this?

585
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:17,251
Are you trying to make me your puppet?

586
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:19,921
I see you still don't know me.

587
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,820
I lose interest in things when I'm being egged on.

588
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:24,331
Cut the nonsense...

589
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:26,131
and tell me the real reason.

590
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,660
It's not fun anymore, and I've lost my interest.

591
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:32,929
It's a tiring task...

592
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,271
to get in between a couple that is in love.

593
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,271
And I'm tired of your constant doubts and suspicions.

594
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,311
How dare you pin this on me?

595
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,410
You're doing this for Yeon Doo's sake.

596
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,279
You're worried that something...

597
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,550
will happen to her or the baby if you tell the family.

598
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,450
Your love for them is hilarious and horrifying.

599
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,619
What if the baby isn't yours?

600
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,921
It's my baby for sure.

601
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,160
Both Yeon Doo and Tae Kyung are aware of it,

602
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:00,930
and they admitted it to my face.

603
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:03,299
So? Are you going to just take the baby...

604
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,799
or get Yeon Doo back?

605
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,401
That's none of your concern.

606
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:08,401
What is it?

607
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,041
Does life seem meaningless now that Tae Kyung and I...

608
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,711
only have eyes for Yeon Doo?

609
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,981
Go ahead. Yap all the nonsense you want.

610
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,950
But from here on out,

611
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:22,021
you and Yeon Doo mean the same to me.

612
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,350
I'll end you as well.

613
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,720
That's too bad.

614
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,760
I still had some amicable feelings toward you,

615
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,430
but you just lost your only ally.

616
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,069
Take care.

617
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,070
Sure.

618
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:40,469
Good luck chasing Yeon Doo...

619
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,070
even though she'll never come back to you.

620
00:36:52,581 --> 00:36:55,851
It'll soon be the deadline for the writing competition.

621
00:36:56,621 --> 00:36:59,290
I'm already excited...

622
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,822
about the stories I'll get to read.

623
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:03,322
You're excited?

624
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:07,161
Could it be because you're dating someone?

625
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:09,561
My gosh.

626
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:13,002
That'll be all for today. Head home safely.

627
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:14,970
- Thank you, Mr. Jang. - Thank you, Mr. Jang.

628
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,672
Let's go home!

629
00:37:19,011 --> 00:37:21,981
You all worked hard on your writing,

630
00:37:21,982 --> 00:37:24,080
so let me treat you at my restaurant.

631
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:25,212
Let's all go.

632
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:26,350
Really?

633
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:28,120
Let's replenish our energy...

634
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,692
at Bong Nim's restaurant.

635
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:33,720
There won't be a limit as to how much we're allowed to eat?

636
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:36,290
That's enough, ladies. Let's go!

637
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,891
- Come on. - Off we go.

638
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:44,331
What? Everyone's gathering at the restaurant?

639
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:48,272
Grandma, I'm coming in.

640
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:50,002
Right.

641
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:53,911
It's your mom.

642
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:57,711
So? What do you want me to do?

643
00:37:57,712 --> 00:38:00,551
All students at Old School will be eating together,

644
00:38:00,552 --> 00:38:04,152
so play dumb and come by the restaurant.

645
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:06,291
Why would I go there?

646
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,720
I'd rather not,

647
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,732
and I don't even know where it is.

648
00:38:10,962 --> 00:38:13,091
Grandma, let me take you.

649
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:14,402
- What? - Okay?

650
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:15,962
Sure.

651
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:18,732
All right, then. Sure.

652
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:20,171
I don't want to be there,

653
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,701
but what can I do when you're insisting?

654
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:24,540
I have no other choice.

655
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,811
I should get ready, so hang up already.

656
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:29,910
Get ready so that we can head out.

657
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,052
Sure.

658
00:38:32,052 --> 00:38:34,120
- But Grandma... - Yes?

659
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:35,951
Who's Strawberry?

660
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:37,652
Strawberry?

661
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,720
That's the name of a fruit.

662
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:43,022
I don't know what you're getting at.

663
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,161
(Ilmiri Gold Braised Chicken)

664
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,871
I'm helping my husband at his restaurant.

665
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:55,741
Things are so busy here that I'm wishing for fewer patrons.

666
00:38:55,772 --> 00:38:56,901
I see.

667
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:58,971
For what reason did you call, then?

668
00:38:59,342 --> 00:39:02,510
Could we perhaps talk face-to-face?

669
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:04,011
I have something to say.

670
00:39:04,282 --> 00:39:05,282
Sounds good.

671
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:07,451
I'm home alone at the moment. Would you like to swing by?

672
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:09,652
To your place?

673
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:11,692
Sure.

674
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:14,221
I'll be there during my break.

675
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:16,221
Got it.

676
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,231
Please let me know if you need anything.

677
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:22,802
Enjoy.

678
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:26,100
Please sit.

679
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:27,801
Tell me if you need anything.

680
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:30,100
Bong Nim, sit and eat with us.

681
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,171
- Got it. - That's right.

682
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:33,371
Let's eat.

683
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,342
My gosh.

684
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,212
Ms. Eun, you're here.

685
00:39:38,112 --> 00:39:40,580
Ms. Oh, I see you came with her.

686
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:43,482
She got the call during our session.

687
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:45,620
I'm glad you're here, Ms. Oh.

688
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:47,522
Please escort her over there.

689
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:50,291
All right.

690
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:52,390
- Hey... - No!

691
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:53,930
Keep it down.

692
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:57,700
The ladies know Yeon Doo as a tutor and not my daughter.

693
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:58,701
Really?

694
00:39:58,702 --> 00:40:01,302
- Isn't that Tae Kyung's grandma? - They don't know that either.

695
00:40:01,672 --> 00:40:02,772
Got it.

696
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:05,511
Please enjoy.

697
00:40:06,411 --> 00:40:07,411
Right.

698
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:15,580
Ms. Eun, the food must be all right.

699
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,680
Yes.

700
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,022
I didn't have much of an appetite with it being summer and all,

701
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,261
but this is good enough.

702
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:26,531
I'm not saying this because it's Bong Nim's restaurant,

703
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:29,331
but the food here is delicious.

704
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:31,732
Of course.

705
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:36,140
In summer, one should replenish their energy with chicken.

706
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:37,540
- That's right. - Right.

707
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,910
It's so good that I want to be back here with my family.

708
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:41,442
Same here.

709
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:44,951
Ms. Eun, you should bring your family here sometime as well.

710
00:40:45,282 --> 00:40:47,822
Right. I'll think about it.

711
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:52,192
By the way, what did you submit for the writing contest?

712
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:55,220
Bong Nim, did you write about your daughter again?

713
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:58,132
Of course, I wrote about my daughter.

714
00:40:58,261 --> 00:41:00,431
I'm nothing without her.

715
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:02,561
This time around, I wrote about my daughter too.

716
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:04,600
Recently,

717
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:07,471
she paid for my trip to Southeast Asia.

718
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:12,510
My daughter has always been the cold and stoic type,

719
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,240
but she cried her eyes out when she visited recently.

720
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:18,451
She knows how I feel now that she has a daughter of her own.

721
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:21,051
You're all incredibly lucky.

722
00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:23,551
I only have sons, and that makes me lonely.

723
00:41:23,552 --> 00:41:25,450
Daughters are the best!

724
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:27,221
- Right. - That's right.

725
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:31,632
Daughters, my foot. Enough with that nonsense!

726
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:34,902
Ms. Eun, what's wrong?

727
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:36,561
Well...

728
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:42,172
I'll be treating you to your meal today.

729
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:45,711
My son's the chairman of a famous company,

730
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,910
so showing kindness is what I live for.

731
00:41:47,911 --> 00:41:52,811
That being said, enjoy as much as you want today.

732
00:41:54,282 --> 00:41:56,721
- Nice! - You're the best.

733
00:41:57,322 --> 00:41:58,850
Yes!

734
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,422
Nice.

735
00:42:09,502 --> 00:42:10,902
It's hot outside, isn't it?

736
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:13,501
Thanks for the beverage.

737
00:42:13,502 --> 00:42:14,541
Right.

738
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:18,140
Is the restaurant always packed?

739
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:19,942
We owe that to my husband's cooking skills.

740
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:23,981
Didn't you say you had something to say earlier?

741
00:42:23,982 --> 00:42:27,751
I might be stepping out of line,

742
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:30,451
but I wanted to ask just in case.

743
00:42:30,922 --> 00:42:32,022
What is it?

744
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:35,761
I told my husband about what you were going through.

745
00:42:36,422 --> 00:42:38,731
It must've reminded him of us...

746
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:40,391
because he related almost instantly.

747
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:44,002
What are you trying to say?

748
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:46,802
My husband said...

749
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,441
that it'd be nice...

750
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:51,311
to make a donation to people we knew.

751
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:55,881
Hold on. Are you offering us a donation?

752
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:58,651
My husband told me not to say anything...

753
00:42:58,652 --> 00:43:01,351
since it could offend you.

754
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:05,422
Why would we be offended by such a generous offer?

755
00:43:05,922 --> 00:43:09,161
I had no idea we could get this lucky.

756
00:43:10,362 --> 00:43:13,661
We're only sharing what we have to offer.

757
00:43:14,532 --> 00:43:17,001
I'll talk it over with my husband and get back to you.

758
00:43:17,002 --> 00:43:18,032
I promise.

759
00:43:18,532 --> 00:43:19,802
Sure.

760
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:32,950
- Grandma. - Yes?

761
00:43:32,951 --> 00:43:34,921
Why do you seem glum...

762
00:43:34,922 --> 00:43:36,882
when you just flashed your big fat purse around?

763
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:44,022
Money can't ever fully fill one's heart.

764
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:46,890
- Grandma. - Yes?

765
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:48,902
How about an outdoor session?

766
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:50,631
We could study at a café.

767
00:43:50,632 --> 00:43:52,402
It's a thing these days.

768
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:54,501
What? It's a thing?

769
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:55,502
Yes.

770
00:44:04,552 --> 00:44:08,152
So nowadays, people study at places like these?

771
00:44:08,351 --> 00:44:09,351
That's right.

772
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:12,051
Do you not like it?

773
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:15,721
I feel like a college student which is nice.

774
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:20,862
Can I read the letter you wrote to Strawberry?

775
00:44:21,632 --> 00:44:24,231
- What? - I won't ask about the content.

776
00:44:24,232 --> 00:44:26,402
Just let me correct your grammar.

777
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:29,970
You really won't ask about it?

778
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:33,911
I won't. I'm not that interested in your life, you know.

779
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:49,161
What goes here shouldn't be "B"...

780
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,060
but "P."

781
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:53,830
And the vowels used for this word should be "A" and "E"...

782
00:44:53,831 --> 00:44:55,961
- not just an "E." - I see.

783
00:44:55,962 --> 00:44:59,371
Meanwhile, this needs an "L."

784
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:03,402
- An "L" should be added right here. - I see.

785
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:07,140
"B," "P," "A and E," "E"...

786
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:10,482
"I miss you every day."

787
00:45:11,112 --> 00:45:12,611
"Will we meet..."

788
00:45:12,612 --> 00:45:15,220
Grandma, I need to use the restroom.

789
00:45:15,221 --> 00:45:16,282
Okay.

790
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:24,061
"Strawberry, I miss you."

791
00:45:25,032 --> 00:45:28,601
"I miss you every day."

792
00:45:29,331 --> 00:45:32,971
"Will we meet when I die?"

793
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:50,181
Spare me just 30 minutes. I have something to say.

794
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:51,991
Please, Yeon Doo.

795
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:57,791
(Husband Gong)

796
00:45:58,991 --> 00:46:00,491
Hi, Tae Kyung.

797
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,101
Is something wrong?

798
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:04,302
I called to see what you were doing.

799
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:06,632
Is everything okay?

800
00:46:10,272 --> 00:46:13,041
I was tutoring Grandma.

801
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:15,311
We're at a café.

802
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:16,741
"A café?"

803
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,911
My grandma is studying in a café?

804
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:23,482
Yes. We're at a café near your clinic.

805
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:26,791
Do you want to go home together when you're off work?

806
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:30,022
I'd be happy if only she weren't with you.

807
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,561
However, I'll still come by and pick you up later.

808
00:46:32,732 --> 00:46:35,632
Okay, I understand.

809
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,311
Where did Grandma go?

810
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:49,581
What is it? You can't find her?

811
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:53,051
Excuse me.

812
00:46:53,052 --> 00:46:56,120
Did you see where the grandma who was sitting here went?

813
00:46:56,121 --> 00:46:57,351
I didn't.

814
00:46:58,922 --> 00:47:00,592
I don't know where she went.

815
00:47:01,022 --> 00:47:02,661
Isn't she in the restroom?

816
00:47:02,962 --> 00:47:04,561
That's where I just was.

817
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:07,902
She left her bag and phone.

818
00:47:08,402 --> 00:47:11,201
Don't get too worked up. I'll come over.

819
00:47:11,772 --> 00:47:12,831
Okay.

820
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:22,782
Mr. Kim, did you leave with Ms. Eun?

821
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:24,851
No, I'm waiting in the car.

822
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:27,681
Okay.

823
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:31,192
Grandma.

824
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,221
No.

825
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:10,991
That's not Strawberry.

826
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:18,132
Where am I?

827
00:48:20,802 --> 00:48:23,601
Grandma!

828
00:48:25,311 --> 00:48:26,411
Tae Kyung.

829
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:28,310
Where's Grandma?

830
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:31,382
I can't find her anywhere. What should we do?

831
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:33,982
You can't get stressed out. Sit down.

832
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:36,382
I'll look for her.

833
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:43,891
Ms. Eun!

834
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:45,862
Ms. Eun!

835
00:48:46,962 --> 00:48:48,132
Ms. Eun!

836
00:48:50,002 --> 00:48:51,302
Ms. Eun!

837
00:48:54,402 --> 00:48:55,541
Grandma!

838
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:03,141
Grandma!

839
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:06,612
Why won't anyone call me?

840
00:49:09,422 --> 00:49:10,482
I can't just wait.

841
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:16,422
Grandma!

842
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:18,661
Grandma!

843
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:21,802
Grandma!

844
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,831
Where on earth is she?

845
00:49:26,302 --> 00:49:27,741
Tae Kyung!

846
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:30,172
Tae Kyung.

847
00:49:30,502 --> 00:49:32,640
- Grandma! - Tae Kyung.

848
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:33,641
Grandma.

849
00:49:34,942 --> 00:49:37,282
Grandma. What are you doing here?

850
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:39,112
I looked for you everywhere.

851
00:49:39,252 --> 00:49:40,411
You're sweating.

852
00:49:40,882 --> 00:49:42,482
I got lost.

853
00:49:43,252 --> 00:49:45,790
And I saw your name, so I stayed here.

854
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:46,851
(Taekyung Building)

855
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:49,891
I was so scared.

856
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:52,862
But then I saw your name, so I stayed here.

857
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:54,802
Grandma...

858
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:00,572
I was so scared.

859
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:12,752
Grandma.

860
00:50:13,112 --> 00:50:16,022
Why did you leave the café without telling me?

861
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:21,161
Grandma. What happened?

862
00:50:23,522 --> 00:50:27,161
I thought I saw Strawberry.

863
00:50:27,862 --> 00:50:28,931
"Strawberry?"

864
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:31,370
Yes.

865
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:34,902
I saw a woman with a baby on her back.

866
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:38,572
She reminded me of me and Strawberry.

867
00:50:39,612 --> 00:50:41,641
Then Strawberry is...

868
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,451
The newborn baby daughter I lost.

869
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:47,982
Not even your dad knows of her.

870
00:50:50,052 --> 00:50:53,620
I'd been writing the word "strawberry" a lot,

871
00:50:53,621 --> 00:50:56,391
and I'd been thinking of her.

872
00:50:57,991 --> 00:51:00,532
How did you lose her?

873
00:51:02,502 --> 00:51:03,931
We were poor,

874
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:06,132
and girls were a waste of food.

875
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:07,971
My mother-in-law...

876
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:11,511
gave her away without me knowing.

877
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,681
How could she...

878
00:51:15,112 --> 00:51:17,811
I looked for her like crazy for a few years,

879
00:51:18,052 --> 00:51:20,581
and then your dad got sick.

880
00:51:21,552 --> 00:51:25,522
I was afraid I'd end up losing my son too,

881
00:51:26,152 --> 00:51:27,891
so I decided to forget about her.

882
00:51:30,522 --> 00:51:33,862
I looked for her in secret for a few more years in vain.

883
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,561
I thought she'd died somewhere...

884
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:39,532
or was hiding from me out of spite.

885
00:51:40,632 --> 00:51:43,172
A corner of my heart broke and rotted away.

886
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,471
Grandma.

887
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,612
Go and rest.

888
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,581
I need a nap.

889
00:51:53,382 --> 00:51:56,552
An old woman thinking of the past is an ugly sight.

890
00:51:57,752 --> 00:51:59,752
Try to rest, Grandma.

891
00:52:00,152 --> 00:52:01,462
Let's go, Yeon Doo.

892
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:03,891
Thank you, Tae Kyung.

893
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,661
I hated your name all your life,

894
00:52:08,002 --> 00:52:10,462
but today, I was overjoyed to see it.

895
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:14,842
I'm just a nasty old Grandma.

896
00:52:17,172 --> 00:52:19,172
Thanks for looking for me.

897
00:52:36,661 --> 00:52:38,390
What if the baby isn't yours?

898
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:39,732
It's my baby for sure.

899
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,002
Both Yeon Doo and Tae Kyung are aware of it,

900
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,802
and they admitted it to my face.

901
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:57,411
These two will end it.

902
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,152
It'll ruin you all.

903
00:53:07,192 --> 00:53:08,322
It's me.

904
00:53:09,592 --> 00:53:10,961
Hey, so...

905
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:13,491
Is Ms. Lee's coming to tomorrow's launching party?

906
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:16,761
Okay. Thanks for confirming.

907
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:21,371
Why do you come in without knocking?

908
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:25,041
Se Jin, I did some thinking.

909
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:28,712
How about we introduce your boyfriend to your dad?

910
00:53:28,882 --> 00:53:29,942
What?

911
00:53:30,282 --> 00:53:33,052
Stop with the nonsense. We broke up.

912
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,950
- What? When? - Today.

913
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:38,652
You're not a kid. You can't break up just like that.

914
00:53:38,822 --> 00:53:42,560
Call and say you love him too much to leave him.

915
00:53:42,561 --> 00:53:44,791
Mom, will you leave me alone?

916
00:53:45,491 --> 00:53:47,161
Okay, don't yell.

917
00:53:53,672 --> 00:53:55,100
Has she lost her mind?

918
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,201
Why would she break up with such a catch?

919
00:53:58,172 --> 00:54:00,842
I shouldn't leave it to her.

920
00:54:07,212 --> 00:54:10,552
Mr. Gong? It's Se Jin's mom.

921
00:54:12,422 --> 00:54:16,922
Could you give me Kim Jun Ha's phone number?

922
00:54:18,161 --> 00:54:19,831
Mr. Kim's number?

923
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:23,232
Sure. I'll text it to you.

924
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:25,101
Goodnight. Bye.

925
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:30,241
Ms. Jang's mother asked me for Mr. Kim's number.

926
00:54:30,371 --> 00:54:31,541
Really?

927
00:54:31,672 --> 00:54:33,411
They must be getting really close.

928
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:38,252
Soo Jung. Hear me out and don't get upset.

929
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:40,382
What do you want to say?

930
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:44,282
I called a sperm bank in another region.

931
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,422
They don't have a sample that matches our blood type.

932
00:54:46,592 --> 00:54:48,092
I don't think it'll work out.

933
00:54:50,822 --> 00:54:52,732
Are you all right?

934
00:54:55,931 --> 00:54:57,132
Well, actually,

935
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,772
Sun Woo Hee came by today.

936
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:02,101
Did she?

937
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:04,541
They're so nice.

938
00:55:04,942 --> 00:55:07,741
She said her husband would be our donor if we wanted.

939
00:55:08,342 --> 00:55:09,842
I guess the deities blessed us.

940
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:12,782
How could such people show up in our lives at that exact moment?

941
00:55:14,252 --> 00:55:15,652
Then set up a meeting for us.

942
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,620
We only got to see her husband from a distance,

943
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:20,052
so let's meet him properly.

944
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:23,822
I hope things work out for us.

945
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:25,532
Me too.

946
00:55:31,232 --> 00:55:34,701
I didn't know something like that had happened to Grandma.

947
00:55:36,172 --> 00:55:38,212
I felt so bad for her.

948
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:40,411
I was shocked...

949
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:43,011
to see her crying like a child in the streets.

950
00:55:44,212 --> 00:55:47,782
She was always so big and scary to me.

951
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:53,152
She thanked us without any hesitation.

952
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,192
She seems to have opened up a lot.

953
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:58,061
I don't trust it.

954
00:55:58,462 --> 00:56:00,761
You never know when she's going to change again.

955
00:56:02,962 --> 00:56:03,962
Oh, right.

956
00:56:05,072 --> 00:56:08,002
Kim Jun Ha keeps contacting me.

957
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:11,811
It seems...

958
00:56:12,612 --> 00:56:16,442
Ms. Jang and Kim Jun Ha met my mom today.

959
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:18,152
What?

960
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:21,652
Don't worry. I don't think they said much.

961
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:28,221
He could show up at any time and any place,

962
00:56:28,491 --> 00:56:30,422
so we should prepare ourselves.

963
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,532
I'll meet my friend who's a lawyer and look into it.

964
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:36,100
I'll find out what we can do...

965
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,672
to protect Real once it's born.

966
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:44,740
I think we should tell them soon.

967
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:47,641
Let's tell the family everything tomorrow.

968
00:56:49,282 --> 00:56:51,882
Let's do that. I'm ready.

969
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:53,911
Okay.

970
00:57:09,161 --> 00:57:10,161
What is this?

971
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:11,402
Open it.

972
00:57:13,772 --> 00:57:16,802
Why did you get a guy who always fails his interviews a gift?

973
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:19,612
It's a necktie.

974
00:57:20,112 --> 00:57:21,712
I'm going to make a prediction.

975
00:57:21,811 --> 00:57:25,152
In a year, you'll wear that tie for your first day at work.

976
00:57:25,351 --> 00:57:26,511
"First day at work?"

977
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:30,181
I get excited just imagining it.

978
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:33,022
I have a condition though.

979
00:57:34,152 --> 00:57:35,962
You have to date me during that time.

980
00:57:37,161 --> 00:57:38,661
Let's date, Oh Dong Wook.

981
00:57:46,402 --> 00:57:48,002
Why do you like me so much?

982
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:51,101
I don't have any money, but I do have a kid.

983
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:54,712
I'm always failing interviews, and I have a humble background.

984
00:57:58,282 --> 00:57:59,681
Your looks are my style,

985
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:02,652
and I think it's admirable that you don't hide that you have a kid.

986
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:04,220
I also like you because...

987
00:58:04,221 --> 00:58:05,691
I think it's cute you're so guarded...

988
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:07,351
when it comes to women so you don't make the same mistake.

989
00:58:07,491 --> 00:58:09,391
You're quite interesting.

990
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,430
How long are you going to live like that?

991
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:16,430
Are you going to continue to lament about having a kid?

992
00:58:16,431 --> 00:58:17,600
What? "Lament?"

993
00:58:17,601 --> 00:58:18,671
Yes.

994
00:58:18,672 --> 00:58:21,741
That's why Soo Kyum cries that her dad struggles because of her.

995
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,171
You are a dad,

996
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:27,272
but you're also a healthy 25-year-old man looking for a job.

997
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:32,811
When you're with me,

998
00:58:33,351 --> 00:58:36,152
can't you just be 25-year-old Oh Dong Wook?

999
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:46,561
If you don't want to, forget it.

1000
00:58:47,192 --> 00:58:49,431
This is the last time I'm telling you how I feel.

1001
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:51,672
I'll get going.

1002
00:59:00,811 --> 00:59:02,442
What does this mean?

1003
00:59:03,442 --> 00:59:05,080
Are you going to date me or not?

1004
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:06,081
Tell me.

1005
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:09,282
I'm going to date you.

1006
00:59:14,391 --> 00:59:16,621
Hey. People are looking.

1007
00:59:16,822 --> 00:59:18,830
Forget it. You can't take it back now.

1008
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:20,331
Today's our first day as a couple.

1009
00:59:30,072 --> 00:59:32,212
Why is the table so empty?

1010
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:34,571
Chun Myung and Ji Myung...

1011
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:36,911
left early because of the launch party.

1012
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:38,681
You should come out later too.

1013
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,580
Of course. I went every year.

1014
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:42,621
- Hyun Woo left early too. - I see.

1015
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:46,022
Yu Myung, you look happy today.

1016
00:59:46,692 --> 00:59:49,822
Yes, I am. I'm no longer in a one-sided relationship.

1017
00:59:50,522 --> 00:59:53,331
Then are you dating now? Who is he?

1018
00:59:53,532 --> 00:59:55,161
I'll introduce you to him later.

1019
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:57,761
Well...

1020
00:59:58,232 --> 01:00:00,502
We have something to tell you.

1021
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:03,701
We'd like it if everyone came together tonight.

1022
01:00:04,072 --> 01:00:06,910
What is it? Tell us now.

1023
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:10,511
We want to tell you when everyone's together.

1024
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:14,351
Are you going to announce a surprise wedding?

1025
01:00:15,581 --> 01:00:16,882
No, it's not like that.

1026
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:18,891
Okay.

1027
01:00:19,322 --> 01:00:21,221
Let's all get together tonight.

1028
01:00:32,802 --> 01:00:34,571
But from here on out,

1029
01:00:34,572 --> 01:00:36,942
you and Yeon Doo mean the same to me.

1030
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:40,371
I'll end you as well.

1031
01:00:43,112 --> 01:00:44,382
I'm certain she knows something.

1032
01:00:45,181 --> 01:00:46,911
The Jang Se Jin I know wouldn't stay quiet like this.

1033
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:53,221
Whose number is this?

1034
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:55,261
They've been calling since yesterday.

1035
01:00:57,692 --> 01:00:58,791
Hello?

1036
01:01:00,092 --> 01:01:01,931
You finally picked up, Mr. Kim.

1037
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:04,661
I'm Se Jin's mom.

1038
01:01:05,471 --> 01:01:06,471
Pardon?

1039
01:01:09,902 --> 01:01:11,810
Your place is so nice.

1040
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:15,211
It's so luxurious and elegant.

1041
01:01:15,212 --> 01:01:17,041
Se Jin did the interior for me.

1042
01:01:18,212 --> 01:01:19,552
Can I have a seat?

1043
01:01:19,752 --> 01:01:21,411
Yes, over here.

1044
01:01:26,822 --> 01:01:28,522
What brings you here?

1045
01:01:29,522 --> 01:01:31,490
Did you guys get into a fight?

1046
01:01:31,491 --> 01:01:34,232
Se Jin told me you guys broke up.

1047
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:37,701
Yes, you know couples always get into fights.

1048
01:01:38,232 --> 01:01:41,201
I thought you guys were on the phone last night. Did you fight then too?

1049
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:44,002
Pardon? No, we didn't.

1050
01:01:44,141 --> 01:01:45,510
That's odd.

1051
01:01:45,511 --> 01:01:48,741
I'm certain I heard your voice coming from her room.

1052
01:01:48,811 --> 01:01:51,681
Really? What else did she do?

1053
01:01:52,351 --> 01:01:54,311
I need to make up with her,

1054
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:55,851
so I'd like to know.

1055
01:01:56,152 --> 01:01:57,881
Even though my daughter can come off as mean,

1056
01:01:57,882 --> 01:01:59,521
she's actually quite naive.

1057
01:01:59,522 --> 01:02:02,091
She doesn't know anything outside of work.

1058
01:02:02,092 --> 01:02:05,260
Last night, she kept double-checking...

1059
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:07,330
to see if Ms. Lee was coming to the show.

1060
01:02:07,331 --> 01:02:10,131
What kind of secretary goes that far?

1061
01:02:10,132 --> 01:02:11,402
"Ms. Lee?"

1062
01:02:11,802 --> 01:02:13,471
Yes. Why?

1063
01:02:14,002 --> 01:02:15,342
No, it's nothing.

1064
01:02:15,842 --> 01:02:18,871
I'm sorry. I forgot I had something urgent to do at work.

1065
01:02:19,172 --> 01:02:21,072
I'll take you out another time, Mother.

1066
01:02:22,482 --> 01:02:23,511
"Mother?"

1067
01:02:23,982 --> 01:02:25,580
Please keep it a secret...

1068
01:02:25,581 --> 01:02:28,081
that you came to my house and we talked.

1069
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,022
Se Jin might not want to see me again.

1070
01:02:34,192 --> 01:02:35,561
Of course.

1071
01:02:35,991 --> 01:02:38,261
Don't worry, Son.

1072
01:02:53,471 --> 01:02:54,541
Ms. Gong.

1073
01:02:58,382 --> 01:02:59,451
Good job.

1074
01:02:59,811 --> 01:03:01,311
Is everything going well?

1075
01:03:01,752 --> 01:03:03,221
- Yes, Father. - Good.

1076
01:03:03,882 --> 01:03:04,921
- Mr. Gong. - Yes?

1077
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:05,991
What do you think?

1078
01:03:06,692 --> 01:03:09,291
I think it looks good.

1079
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:18,830
What if the baby isn't yours?

1080
01:03:18,831 --> 01:03:20,132
It's my baby for sure.

1081
01:03:20,402 --> 01:03:22,540
Both Yeon Doo and Tae Kyung are aware of it,

1082
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:24,071
and they admitted it to my face.

1083
01:03:24,072 --> 01:03:25,971
(Executive Assistant Jang Se Jin)

1084
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,322
I just need to give Ms. Lee this.

1085
01:03:38,552 --> 01:03:40,152
Kim Jun Ha, Oh Yeon Doo.

1086
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:42,922
You guys are done for.

1087
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:50,760
Ms. Jang. Ms. Lee will arrive soon.

1088
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:53,072
Oh, really? Okay.

1089
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:01,910
I'll escort you.

1090
01:04:01,911 --> 01:04:03,181
Thank you, Ms. Jang.

1091
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:04,581
Ms. Lee.

1092
01:04:04,712 --> 01:04:06,652
I have something to give you.

1093
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:08,511
We meet again.

1094
01:04:09,621 --> 01:04:10,752
Mr. Kim.

1095
01:04:11,482 --> 01:04:12,951
It's good to see you.

1096
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,922
You guys look good together.

1097
01:04:16,692 --> 01:04:19,132
Thank you. I'll escort you.

1098
01:04:19,931 --> 01:04:20,962
Let's go inside.

1099
01:04:23,561 --> 01:04:26,772
Ms. Jang. Be sure to stay by my side.

1100
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:36,911
You're here.

1101
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:39,751
I'm here, honey.

1102
01:04:39,752 --> 01:04:40,811
Welcome.

1103
01:04:41,552 --> 01:04:42,720
You're here too, Mr. Kim.

1104
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:44,982
It's an important company event. I should be here.

1105
01:04:45,721 --> 01:04:47,290
Please go inside.

1106
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:48,351
Honey.

1107
01:04:53,592 --> 01:04:54,891
Why aren't you coming in with us?

1108
01:04:55,431 --> 01:04:56,802
Yes, sir.

1109
01:05:16,922 --> 01:05:18,790
For this year's summer capsule collection,

1110
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:21,591
we put together a line of clothes that provide comfort...

1111
01:05:21,592 --> 01:05:23,322
even while performing everyday activities.

1112
01:05:23,822 --> 01:05:25,931
Let the show begin.

1113
01:05:29,802 --> 01:05:31,160
Ms. Gong worked hard on this project.

1114
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,632
I can see that.

1115
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,681
The clothes are pretty.

1116
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,970
Yeon Doo, it seems as though...

1117
01:06:05,971 --> 01:06:09,001
Jang Se Jin will reveal something to Ms. Lee at the launching event.

1118
01:06:09,402 --> 01:06:11,942
Leave the house if you don't want to get kicked out.

1119
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:21,011
(Kim Jun Ha)

1120
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:46,242
(Yeon Doo's mom)

1121
01:06:47,772 --> 01:06:49,042
Honey, excuse me for a second.

1122
01:07:09,801 --> 01:07:11,702
- Let go of me. - No way.

1123
01:07:12,171 --> 01:07:13,402
What are you cooking up?

1124
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:21,241
What is this? Why are you trying to give this to Ms. Lee?

1125
01:07:21,242 --> 01:07:24,140
I told you I'd end both you and Yeon Doo.

1126
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:25,181
Give it here.

1127
01:07:27,452 --> 01:07:29,652
As if that will stop me from taking action.

1128
01:07:31,122 --> 01:07:32,192
Why you...

1129
01:07:33,692 --> 01:07:36,421
Ms. Kang, it's been a while.

1130
01:07:36,591 --> 01:07:38,560
It's nothing important,

1131
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:42,261
but I wanted to send you some pumpkin porridge and eel juice.

1132
01:07:43,761 --> 01:07:46,501
For Yeon Doo? That'd be great.

1133
01:07:50,572 --> 01:07:53,841
Ms. Kang, just a second. I'll call you back.

1134
01:07:56,141 --> 01:07:58,851
Yeon Doo, what are you doing here?

1135
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:13,992
Yeon Doo, what is all this?

1136
01:08:16,931 --> 01:08:18,631
I did the unthinkable.

1137
01:08:20,032 --> 01:08:23,101
"The unthinkable?" What...

1138
01:08:23,202 --> 01:08:24,742
The baby I'm carrying...

1139
01:08:27,112 --> 01:08:28,341
isn't...

1140
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:32,511
Tae Kyung's.

1141
01:09:16,492 --> 01:09:18,862
(The Real Has Come!)

1142
01:09:20,192 --> 01:09:22,301
You! Have you lost your mind?

1143
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:23,930
How dare you come back here?

1144
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:26,001
- You! - Please calm down.

1145
01:09:26,471 --> 01:09:27,500
I can't break up with her.

1146
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:29,942
We're not the issue. What about your mother?

1147
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:31,901
Considering what has happened,

1148
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:33,841
do you still think you can protect her and the baby?

1149
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,482
The baby Yeon Doo is carrying...

1150
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:39,652
isn't Tae Kyung's.

1151
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:41,211
- Mom. - Mother.

1152
01:09:41,452 --> 01:09:43,551
I'm to choose between you and Yeon Doo?

1153
01:09:43,952 --> 01:09:45,351
But I can't lose either one of you.

1154
01:09:45,751 --> 01:09:48,391
I need you both.
