1
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,592
Yeon Doo.

2
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:08,162
Yes.

3
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:09,692
Do you have...

4
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:12,462
feelings for me?

5
00:00:16,802 --> 00:00:17,802
I do have...

6
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:20,002
feelings for you.

7
00:00:21,142 --> 00:00:22,541
The one I'm in love with...

8
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:25,281
is you, Yeon Doo.

9
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:00,572
Yeon Doo!

10
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:04,542
I feel inferior?

11
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,382
That's why I bothered him?

12
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:08,211
My gosh. I don't believe it.

13
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:09,811
I'm rude?

14
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:11,621
I hurt others for fun?

15
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:13,482
What's wrong with her?

16
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:14,691
Stop it, all of you!

17
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:18,922
Once the babies are born,

18
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:20,792
you'll all get an equal part of the company.

19
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:24,332
But I must say you all disappointed me today.

20
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:27,061
That goes for you too, Mother.

21
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:30,802
Honey.

22
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:36,672
Why did you corner them when they did nothing wrong?

23
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:38,542
That's why they turned and bit you.

24
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:40,482
You're right.

25
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:41,811
- What? - What?

26
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:44,181
Are you all right, Grandma?

27
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:46,552
Yeon Doo must be out of her mind.

28
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:49,751
How could she talk about you like that too?

29
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:57,191
Wait.

30
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:58,702
Let's talk.

31
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:01,102
Let go of me.

32
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:02,702
What's there to talk about?

33
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:04,841
I said I liked you.

34
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:07,042
I said you were the person I liked.

35
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:10,871
Do you have nothing to say to me?

36
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:15,012
What do you want to do, then?

37
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:16,952
What?

38
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:20,781
We both acted out of impulse just now.

39
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:22,822
They were momentary, fleeting emotions.

40
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:25,091
Pretend it never happened.

41
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,172
What didn't you tell me?

42
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,012
What does he know that I don't?

43
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,001
Let's talk.

44
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:08,272
I have nothing to say.

45
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,642
You asked me something and wanted an answer.

46
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,012
I don't care anymore, okay?

47
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:17,471
Why don't you care anymore?

48
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:23,711
Do you have amnesia?

49
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:26,622
You told me not to care whatever you did with him.

50
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,421
You insulted your husband to his face...

51
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:30,992
and forgot already?

52
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,791
I said that because I was flustered.

53
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:34,992
But I had a point.

54
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:37,262
We're practically divorced.

55
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,301
We'll only raise the baby together.

56
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:44,372
Why did you even ask me to co-parent with you?

57
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,301
You're not a great husband,

58
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,012
but you'll be a great dad.

59
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:51,442
I know you like kids...

60
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,411
and will raise one with all seriousness.

61
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,252
Did you not care about me at all?

62
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,452
- What? - To be honest,

63
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:02,952
I had some hope...

64
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:05,622
that we could go back to how we were.

65
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:08,992
I thought that if we shopped for baby stuff,

66
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,502
went out for nice meals,

67
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,401
and went shopping together,

68
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,531
we could go back to how we were.

69
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:19,801
What got into you today?

70
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:22,971
I don't know.

71
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,182
I guess I was mistaken.

72
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,082
I don't want to get my hopes up...

73
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:30,312
only for them to be dashed.

74
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,921
Now I really won't care...

75
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:34,752
whom you go out with.

76
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:37,992
You won't?

77
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:41,361
I'm glad you came to that decision.

78
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:43,762
Let's not stop at this.

79
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:46,231
We can't just talk about it.

80
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,971
Let's draw a concrete line and write it down.

81
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:50,901
Sounds great.

82
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:52,702
That way, I won't have to waste any emotions.

83
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:54,841
I'll write up the contract.

84
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,911
You do that.

85
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,161
I do have...

86
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:18,062
feelings for you.

87
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:20,731
The one I'm in love with...

88
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,502
is you, Yeon Doo.

89
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:28,512
I can't actually be with Tae Kyung.

90
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:30,971
That's just crazy.

91
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:46,661
We both acted out of impulse just now.

92
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:48,661
They were momentary, fleeting emotions.

93
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,031
Pretend it never happened.

94
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:58,471
Even if that's how she feels,

95
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,841
how can we pretend it never happened?

96
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:05,742
How can she even sleep?

97
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:39,382
My goodness.

98
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:40,611
What are you doing?

99
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,812
Give it back.

100
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:45,921
Why are you drinking soju in the middle of the night?

101
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,492
What's wrong? Is it Tae Kyung?

102
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,762
Se Jin!

103
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:55,632
I didn't think I would, but I feel jealous.

104
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:58,832
I'm annoyed and disgusted that I feel jealous.

105
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:04,642
Mom.

106
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,742
What did I say?

107
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:11,711
I said you'd end up falling for him,

108
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:14,882
and you said that would never happen.

109
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:17,551
What'll you do now?

110
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:19,481
What's the point...

111
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:23,352
in waiting by the sideline when he doesn't care for you at all?

112
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:26,392
This won't work.

113
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:29,762
Give up on getting back with Tae Kyung.

114
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:31,191
I don't want to.

115
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,102
I won't lose him to her.

116
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:34,502
As if you won't.

117
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,602
He was never yours in the first place.

118
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:39,772
Stop acting like a fool and go to bed.

119
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:01,492
"One, Cha Hyun Woo and Gong Ji Myung..."

120
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,931
"remain a couple for the sole purpose of co-parenting."

121
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:06,602
"Two,"

122
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:09,732
"they never meddle with each other's personal lives."

123
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:11,401
"Three,"

124
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:13,102
"make childcare the utmost priority."

125
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:14,502
"Whoever fails to do so..."

126
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:17,612
"gives up custody and parental rights."

127
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,212
I signed it. You should too.

128
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:29,122
(Cha Hyun Woo, Gong Ji Myung)

129
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:33,661
We good now?

130
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:36,331
I'm going to the clinic.

131
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:37,691
It's a holiday.

132
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:40,801
"Never meddle with each other's personal lives."

133
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,401
Get to and from work on your own now.

134
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:48,941
And be on time for your appointment.

135
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:06,362
Yeon Doo, are you not up yet?

136
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:19,671
Yeon Doo.

137
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,852
The person is unable to answer the phone.

138
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:34,951
Why won't she pick up?

139
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:37,191
Did she...

140
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:40,421
Yeon Doo!

141
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:47,462
Tae Kyung.

142
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:49,502
Did you see Yeon Doo?

143
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:53,372
You're here. Come and sit down.

144
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:55,671
- I thought you'd left! - My goodness.

145
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:59,012
How dare you yell at the breakfast table?

146
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,081
I'm sorry, Grandma.

147
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:04,882
Where would I go?

148
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,122
What's wrong, Tae Kyung?

149
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:11,722
I think it's because I came over without telling him.

150
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:13,791
Sit down.

151
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:15,962
My gosh.

152
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:19,502
You're such a doting husband.

153
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:22,431
You don't want to be apart even for a second?

154
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,272
I can't stand watching you two.

155
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,311
Apologize to Tae Kyung, everyone.

156
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:29,772
- What? - What?

157
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:32,181
Everything Yeon Doo said was true.

158
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:35,781
Apologize for being mean to Tae Kyung so far.

159
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,382
Only then will the baby...

160
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:40,321
be born into a happy family.

161
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:43,022
Chun Myung.

162
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,321
You go first.

163
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,921
Go ahead.

164
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:51,762
I'm sorry that I told you to move out. I apologize.

165
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:55,372
Ji Myung, your turn.

166
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:58,002
- Dad. - Come on.

167
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:01,811
I was way out of line.

168
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:04,071
I won't say things like that again.

169
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:06,811
All right. Let's just eat now.

170
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:07,811
No.

171
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:11,852
Mother, you should apologize to Tae Kyung.

172
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,122
In Ok, are you getting old?

173
00:12:14,122 --> 00:12:15,892
The soup is too salty.

174
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:16,951
Mother.

175
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:19,722
Grandmother.

176
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:23,392
I got a job.

177
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:26,031
What? What did you say?

178
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,502
I don't go to work every day.

179
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:31,901
I will teach an old lady how to read after class.

180
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,041
And it turns out she is...

181
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,411
All right. That's enough.

182
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:39,382
Fine. I'm sorry about the other day.

183
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:41,081
I apologize.

184
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:44,281
Okay, Grandmother.

185
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:47,451
Tae Kyung and Yeon Doo.

186
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,892
Don't say that you'll move out ever again.

187
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:52,821
Well... That's...

188
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:56,031
Okay. We promise.

189
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,061
Yeon Doo, you heard him, right?

190
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:02,801
Yeon Doo, don't worry about us and focus on your work.

191
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,571
Don't worry about the housework.

192
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,842
Okay. Thank you, Mother.

193
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,051
My gosh.

194
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,122
What are you doing?

195
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,992
Why are you avoiding me?

196
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:24,421
I'm not avoiding you.

197
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:28,161
Move over. I'm tired from doing things in the morning.

198
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,762
I can't let you go until you talk with me.

199
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,571
Fine.

200
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:37,102
If you have something to say, go ahead and say it.

201
00:13:38,571 --> 00:13:40,372
I want to thank you first.

202
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:43,071
For taking up for me in front of my family.

203
00:13:43,671 --> 00:13:46,612
And you made them apologize. Thank you for everything.

204
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,382
They should've done it sooner.

205
00:13:57,151 --> 00:14:00,722
If you're done, I'll be in my room.

206
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:02,362
Wait. About yesterday...

207
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:03,531
Let's pretend...

208
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:06,502
nothing happened yesterday.

209
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:08,531
How can I do that?

210
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,872
I've finally realized how I feel.

211
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:13,541
That doesn't matter anyway.

212
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:16,171
What we have here is a contractual relationship.

213
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:17,972
Did you forget that this is fake?

214
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,642
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

215
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,181
Don't you like me?

216
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:26,982
Don't you have feelings for me?

217
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:31,992
No, I don't. Okay?

218
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:41,031
Does she not like me?

219
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:49,171
"Don't you like me?"

220
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:54,642
How could he ask me that without a change of expression?

221
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:12,331
Who's calling me on a holiday?

222
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:17,401
Hey, Soo Kyum.

223
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:20,102
Yu Myung, what's with your voice?

224
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:21,372
Are you still sleeping?

225
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,041
No.

226
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,712
I woke up and was waiting for your call.

227
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:27,642
Are you bored again?

228
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:32,622
You said I could get more than 100 dollars the other day, right?

229
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:37,092
If I sign the contract, can I hang out with you every day?

230
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:39,992
I want to sign it, then.

231
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:43,191
Hello?

232
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:47,102
How could you make a kid talk about contracts and money?

233
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:49,301
Stop giving her false hope.

234
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:54,171
Great-uncle, why are you doing this?

235
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:58,272
She's my friend.

236
00:15:58,272 --> 00:15:59,742
Soo Kyum.

237
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:02,482
She's not your friend. She's a fraud.

238
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:04,112
I swear I've been there.

239
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:06,982
Those who offer you money can't be real friends.

240
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:13,061
It's so noisy that I can't study.

241
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:16,061
Uncle Dae Sang, why did you make her cry?

242
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:18,962
Dad, I want to sign a contract with her.

243
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:21,161
I want to hang out with her.

244
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:23,472
Don't cry, Soo Kyum.

245
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:26,671
I'll meet and talk with her first.

246
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:28,441
Are you crazy?

247
00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:31,411
What if she makes Soo Kyum do strange things?

248
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,142
We can check the terms carefully before signing.

249
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:37,451
No. Why would they offer her money for taking some photos?

250
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:39,022
You're so old-fashioned.

251
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:40,722
I had a job interview at the company.

252
00:16:40,722 --> 00:16:42,151
It's a decent place.

253
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,992
I should go study, so keep quiet.

254
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:51,831
Gosh, Dong Wook. You know nothing of the world yet.

255
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:58,371
Soo Kyum, you should call her.

256
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,541
Now?

257
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:06,512
It's loud in there. Don't you think you should go in?

258
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:10,252
Don't let it bother you. They are always like that.

259
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,581
By the way, why do you buy flowers?

260
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:16,851
I thought the yard looked so empty.

261
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,061
It would look pretty with some flowers.

262
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:21,762
We can't even eat them, and they will wilt soon.

263
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:22,932
Why bother?

264
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,672
Gosh, you startled me. What's wrong with you?

265
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:33,202
Try to smell them. They are flowers.

266
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,301
Get it away from me.

267
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,571
I'm not interested in flowers.

268
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:40,512
Ms. Kang Bong Nim, you're a practical person.

269
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:43,012
Did your daughter give birth yet?

270
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:44,982
She's not even due yet.

271
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:47,022
My daughter is...

272
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:50,992
loved by her husband and mother-in-law.

273
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,492
So I often forget about her.

274
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,061
By the way,

275
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,732
how is your daughter doing? Is she fine?

276
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:00,932
I just hope she's doing fine.

277
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:05,402
Bong Nim, I'll be out in a little while.

278
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:06,841
Grandma, I'm going with him.

279
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:09,712
Hey, where are you going?

280
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:16,081
Thank you for the drink.

281
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:19,922
Thank you for calling me, Mr. Oh.

282
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:21,752
I'll make sure Soo Kyum will...

283
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:24,851
I won't let Soo Kyum sign the contract.

284
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,861
- Pardon? - I made myself clear,

285
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:29,361
so I don't want you to see her again.

286
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:33,262
Mr. Oh, I think there's a misunderstanding.

287
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,202
We are not a fraud.

288
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:38,272
We won't let her do anything that's not agreed on.

289
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:40,571
And we will respect her opinion on her channel.

290
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:43,611
We will also take good care of her mental health with counselling.

291
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:47,081
Forget it. Stop giving her false hope.

292
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:50,381
I respect Soo Kyum.

293
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:52,121
What?

294
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,422
Soo Kyum uploads her video clips...

295
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:58,152
to help kids without a mom dress well.

296
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,121
It's so sweet of her...

297
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:03,692
to care about other kids in the same situation.

298
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:07,561
Our company isn't looking for something entertaining.

299
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:11,232
We respect creators who create videos with a sincere heart.

300
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,772
Is that so?

301
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:17,141
I didn't know about Soo Kyum's intentions.

302
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,081
So I was wondering, Mr. Oh...

303
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:22,212
Stop calling me like that.

304
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,811
I'm not her dad.

305
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:26,522
What? Then who is...

306
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:27,522
Uncle Dae Sang.

307
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:34,222
Dong Wook, what are you doing here?

308
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:36,791
I installed a location-tracking app on Soo Kyum's phone.

309
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:38,361
Uncle Dae Sang.

310
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:41,162
I know I'm young, but I'm still Soo Kyum's dad.

311
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:43,131
I make decisions about Soo Kyum.

312
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:44,472
What?

313
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,801
I know that, but...

314
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:50,012
I fed her powdered milk...

315
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:52,412
and changed her diapers more than you did.

316
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:54,641
I'm her great-uncle, but I've been like her dad.

317
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:56,551
- Can't I make decisions like this? - You can't.

318
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:58,581
It's not like I'm signing the contract right away.

319
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:00,422
I just want to talk...

320
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:02,351
with...

321
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:04,652
Crazy Girl?

322
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:12,662
Soo Kyum, is he your dad?

323
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,361
Yes.

324
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:21,442
Uncle Dae Sang, go home with Soo Kyum now.

325
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:23,672
I need to talk to her.

326
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:30,482
It seems like they know each other, right?

327
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,381
I'm 100 percent sure.

328
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:34,222
I mean, 1000 percent.

329
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:35,821
Or 10,000 percent.

330
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:39,321
I bet he got caught lying that he didn't have a kid.

331
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:40,992
He lied?

332
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:43,861
It's nothing. Let's go, Soo Kyum.

333
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:53,301
I'll get going.

334
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:56,611
But if we cross paths again, you'll date me.

335
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:07,682
Are you Gong Yu Myung?

336
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:10,422
What? You didn't even know my name?

337
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:13,692
By the way, you are honest.

338
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:16,762
It's true that you have a kid.

339
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:20,432
I'm not sure what kind of coincidence this is,

340
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:22,301
but I can't let you take care of Soo Kyum's business.

341
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:25,272
I never know what a crazy girl like you will do to my kid.

342
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:28,371
Don't ever come near Soo Kyum again.

343
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,912
- Wait. - No, I don't want to.

344
00:21:31,472 --> 00:21:33,012
What is it you don't want?

345
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:35,781
Since we met again, you want to date me, right?

346
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:37,752
Are you crazy?

347
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:40,081
- Why would I date a dad? - What?

348
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:42,551
I hate marriage and having kids.

349
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,121
That's why I broke up with Jay.

350
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:47,192
Now that I know you actually have a child,

351
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:49,432
there's a zero percent chance I'll be interested in you.

352
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:50,861
That's great.

353
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:54,202
Don't tell me you're hurt.

354
00:21:54,462 --> 00:21:56,232
No. Not at all.

355
00:21:57,402 --> 00:21:59,002
Other women...

356
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:01,141
were quick to make a run for it after finding out I had a kid.

357
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:03,811
I'm used to them having a change of heart.

358
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:07,641
Really? Then, I'll talk business.

359
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:13,351
I'm highly interested in signing Soo Kyum.

360
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:17,492
There are a few projects we'd like to take on with her.

361
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,821
She used to be a YouTuber.

362
00:22:20,162 --> 00:22:22,531
So it's not a terrible offer if that's what she wants to be.

363
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:24,262
You just said you hated kids.

364
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:27,131
If it were you, would you put your child's care...

365
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:28,361
in a person who said that?

366
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:31,232
I see Soo Kyum as a business partner and not a kid.

367
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:34,801
If I make you uncomfortable, I'll have someone else be her agent.

368
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:36,111
Think about it and give me a call.

369
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:45,012
This isn't how she acted when she followed me around.

370
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,321
Yeon Doo, why are you following me around?

371
00:22:55,561 --> 00:22:58,831
I was wondering if I could be of help.

372
00:22:59,031 --> 00:23:00,732
It's the housekeeper's day off.

373
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,371
But Tae Kyung's at the annex.

374
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:04,702
You two should spend quality time together.

375
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:06,871
That's all right, Mother.

376
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:08,841
Why are you startled by the suggestion of...

377
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,242
going on a date with your husband?

378
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:14,012
I prefer keeping you company.

379
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:15,311
- What? - In Ok.

380
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:16,611
Yes?

381
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:18,252
Are you ready to make the yakbab?

382
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:20,621
Right. It won't be long, Mother.

383
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:23,591
Well, don't cook the rice in plain water.

384
00:23:23,722 --> 00:23:26,492
Drain the water after boiling the jujube,

385
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,222
and cook the rice in it.

386
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:29,391
That makes it tastier.

387
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:30,932
Right, of course.

388
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,702
I'd like some spicy stir-fried octopus...

389
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,262
with a generous amount of chilli powder.

390
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:36,172
And I'd like some refreshing mukbab.

391
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,232
It goes really well with stir-fried octopus.

392
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:39,641
Really?

393
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:41,871
I don't know if we have all the ingredients.

394
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:43,472
Let me look for them.

395
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,071
No, I should see what we have.

396
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:47,212
Do we have any abalones?

397
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:49,051
My stomach's acting up and would like some porridge.

398
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:51,152
You're not feeling well?

399
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:52,781
Then, of course, I should make it.

400
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,452
I'll do that.

401
00:23:54,452 --> 00:23:55,952
No, it should be me.

402
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:58,922
Hold on a second. I should clean the abalones first.

403
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:00,522
Just a moment.

404
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:02,762
- Let me see. - Hold on.

405
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:08,462
- Yeon Doo, what is this? - Let's go, Mother.

406
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:09,601
What are you doing?

407
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:12,502
Mother, go on a strike today.

408
00:24:12,672 --> 00:24:14,841
- What? "A strike?" - What?

409
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:18,071
That's right. You should also rest when it isn't a workday.

410
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,982
Why don't you call a strike and go on a date with me?

411
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:26,051
You can order in whatever it is you want to eat.

412
00:24:26,452 --> 00:24:29,591
Yakbab, stir-fried octopus, mukbab, and abalone porridge.

413
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:32,091
There isn't anything you can't order in these days.

414
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:33,422
- What... - What?

415
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:35,662
Store-bought yakbab isn't the real deal.

416
00:24:35,861 --> 00:24:38,791
And Mother's stir-fried octopus is better than Grandma's.

417
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:41,301
Then, make yourselves some instead.

418
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:44,772
Mother is going to go out with me.

419
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:47,801
Yeon Doo, don't. My gosh.

420
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:49,212
You should go with her, honey.

421
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:52,942
Having the right person join our family...

422
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,381
has been a great help in setting the right order.

423
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:56,811
- What? - Yeon Doo,

424
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:59,781
take the car and enjoy a date with your mother-in-law.

425
00:25:00,422 --> 00:25:02,621
- Yes, Father. Mother, let's go. - What?

426
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:04,391
- My gosh. - Goodness.

427
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:05,621
Goodness. Hold on.

428
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:07,561
What on earth...

429
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:11,791
Unbelievable.

430
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:19,242
Shouldn't she be back by now?

431
00:25:20,272 --> 00:25:21,502
Maybe I should go get her.

432
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,712
Yeon Doo.

433
00:25:27,341 --> 00:25:28,381
Mom?

434
00:25:28,742 --> 00:25:30,252
What's with that face?

435
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:33,182
Are you disappointed that I walked through the door with her?

436
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,422
Of course not.

437
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:36,952
Mom, are you heading somewhere?

438
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,262
Your mom and I are going out on a date.

439
00:25:39,522 --> 00:25:41,162
I'll quickly go get my purse.

440
00:25:41,162 --> 00:25:42,192
Sure thing.

441
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:44,732
- You're going on a date? - That's right.

442
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:47,962
We're going for a drive and a tasty meal.

443
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:50,031
I'd like to join you.

444
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:51,301
- Really? - Yes.

445
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:54,071
Yeon Doo, should I tell Tae Kyung to get ready as well?

446
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:56,641
Gosh, no.

447
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:58,871
- What? - Why not?

448
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:02,752
It'll just be your mom and me today.

449
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:04,482
Mother, let's go.

450
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:07,152
I'm sorry about this, Tae Kyung. We'll get going.

451
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:08,281
But Mom...

452
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:13,662
Seriously?

453
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:18,861
Why should I be home alone?

454
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,152
Mother, it's Tae Kyung.

455
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,190
Are you having fun?

456
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,361
Yes, this is great.

457
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:42,101
It's been a while since I enjoyed a day off like this.

458
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,430
Real, your mom...

459
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,531
saved me from being a kitchen maid today.

460
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,871
Actually, it was Father's doing.

461
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,440
He must've been feeling guilty about it.

462
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,710
It's why he massages my legs at night...

463
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,680
and helps me apply facial masks.

464
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:02,480
You saw Tae Kyung frown earlier.

465
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,920
Kids are useless after they grow up,

466
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:09,321
so have fun with him after Real is born.

467
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,900
Mother, is there someplace you've been wanting to go?

468
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,371
Yes, of course, there is.

469
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,011
I came out since you asked.

470
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,910
But what is this about so suddenly?

471
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,650
I wanted to take you out on a date.

472
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,220
"A date?" Just the two of us?

473
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,680
Sure. Hop in.

474
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,490
Then,

475
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:41,390
get me this door instead.

476
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,021
It wouldn't be a date if we didn't sit side by side.

477
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,791
Of course, Mother.

478
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:52,101
Goodness.

479
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,781
She said her son-in-law called.

480
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:11,650
They must be headed someplace nice.

481
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,041
Goodness. Yeon Doo, check this out.

482
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,071
Aren't they adorable?

483
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:36,880
Yes, they're really pretty.

484
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:42,781
Is this where you've been wanting to come?

485
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,751
Yes, I've been hoping to learn...

486
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,291
since I wanted to make them for Real.

487
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,561
I'll learn how to crochet today...

488
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:53,490
and make them for Ji Myung's child as well.

489
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:57,230
Why don't you make the feet wraps, then?

490
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,771
I'll make the hand wraps.

491
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,831
- Should we do that? - Yes.

492
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,710
This goes in here and then comes out.

493
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,341
And then...

494
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:11,380
So after this goes in here, it goes here next.

495
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:14,710
Gosh, I'm doomed. Look at this mess!

496
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,920
You can start over.

497
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,690
This surely is tricky.

498
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:21,220
- Like this. - And these...

499
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,821
- Like this. - Yours is taking shape.

500
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:25,460
- Let's see yours. - I did about this much.

501
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,460
Goodness.

502
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:29,561
- Look. - Gosh, this is adorable.

503
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,660
I'm going to learn harder techniques...

504
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,670
and make items for Real.

505
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:34,831
This is just as pretty.

506
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:35,940
- It's adorable. - It is.

507
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,970
- Should it go back in here? - Like this.

508
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,410
And then we start a new line.

509
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:44,880
Right.

510
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:49,081
So tell me.

511
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,581
Didn't I correctly guess what you enjoy?

512
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:54,390
How did you know I loved stationery?

513
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,390
You're a student who studies.

514
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,321
Anyway, pick whatever you want.

515
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,531
I'll open my wallet wide for you today.

516
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:04,900
Really? Maybe I should shake you for every penny.

517
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:06,170
- Go ahead. - Nice.

518
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:07,900
Let me see.

519
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:09,771
I want this one.

520
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,710
My gosh!

521
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,880
Mother, what about this?

522
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,111
This is so pretty. I've never seen anything like it.

523
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:20,180
Thank you so much.

524
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,380
This, this, and this.

525
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,220
Thank you. Gosh, what a treat.

526
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,390
Look at all these well-made accessories.

527
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,730
Mother, should we get something for Soo Kyum as well?

528
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,061
That'd be great.

529
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,930
That one's pretty.

530
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,031
- This one? - Yes.

531
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,801
Then, we'll take this and this.

532
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:41,601
Mother,

533
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:43,541
why don't we get matching key rings?

534
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,101
Nice. I'd love that.

535
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,511
He's my son-in-law,

536
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:50,210
and he's buying them all for me.

537
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,351
Isn't he sweet and handsome?

538
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,980
I guess he is.

539
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:03,420
This is absolutely adorable,

540
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:05,930
and I think I'm about to cry.

541
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Mother.

542
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,831
It reminds me of Tae Kyung back when he was young.

543
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,700
We weren't financially well-off,

544
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,571
so I couldn't buy him things like this.

545
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,140
I dressed him in clothes I got from others...

546
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,470
and fed him food I got for free.

547
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,180
I'm exhilarated to be able to give Real everything and anything.

548
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,980
I know you had it rough...

549
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,291
raising Tae Kyung all on your own.

550
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:35,920
Why are you making me cry?

551
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,591
Anyway, it seems like he suffered the heartache...

552
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,430
all because he was going to meet you.

553
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,831
For the first time after marrying into the family,

554
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:48,001
I've been able to sleep peacefully at night.

555
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:50,200
I owe that all to you.

556
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:52,740
That's hardly true.

557
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,011
Anyway, this place reminds me of your mother.

558
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:00,281
We came here together the day...

559
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,811
you were going to register your marriage.

560
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:03,121
Right.

561
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,521
Gosh, Ms. Kang!

562
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,031
My goodness. Ms. Lee, it's you.

563
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,900
Goodness.

564
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:25,341
Yeon Doo and Tae Kyung must really be meant to be.

565
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:27,710
How else would you explain this encounter?

566
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,980
Tell me about it.

567
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,450
I remembered the cake we had and asked her to bring me here.

568
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,111
Never did I expect you to walk through the door.

569
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,751
We were actually talking...

570
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:37,680
about the day they were going to register their marriage.

571
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:41,121
That reminds me. Did you get it done?

572
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:45,291
Of course, Mother.

573
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,130
Tae Kyung, why were you with my mom?

574
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:52,531
You took my mom on a date,

575
00:32:52,531 --> 00:32:54,430
so I asked your mom out on a date too.

576
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,871
That's how much he adores Yeon Doo.

577
00:32:57,871 --> 00:32:59,840
Look at him being nice to you.

578
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,171
That's ridiculous.

579
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:03,881
Yeon Doo's the one who adores him more.

580
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:07,910
By the way, please look at these.

581
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,050
They're feet wraps and hand wraps. Did you and Yeon Doo buy them?

582
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:13,890
Gosh, no. We made them ourselves.

583
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,890
They're for Real.

584
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,921
Really?

585
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,890
Gosh, look how adorable they are.

586
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,401
Right?

587
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,561
What did you and Tae Kyung do today?

588
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:29,200
We got matching key rings,

589
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,371
and he bought me a heap of stationery...

590
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,510
for me to study with.

591
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,881
Who knew that my son...

592
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:39,410
had such a sweet side to him?

593
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,680
It's why he's fun to have as company.

594
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,881
That's how it is with Yeon Doo. Time flies.

595
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:48,151
Ms. Lee, it seems like we get along really well.

596
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,390
We should go on a trip sometime with the kids.

597
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,760
That sounds great.

598
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,461
Yeon Doo, where would you like to go?

599
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,001
I haven't been able to travel much,

600
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:02,840
but car camping or regular camping has been on my mind.

601
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:04,740
That sounds nice.

602
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,711
We should go camping together when Real is older.

603
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:09,280
Wouldn't you like that, Ms. Kang?

604
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:10,740
Of course.

605
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,081
Why don't we leave them to enjoy the day together?

606
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,651
Mom, that's not necessary.

607
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:19,751
Yeon Doo, it's all right.

608
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:22,791
I'll make sure she gets home safe and sound.

609
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,490
- Shall we? - Sure.

610
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,160
- Right. - Take care.

611
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,160
Sure.

612
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,800
Shall we?

613
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Ms. Lee,

614
00:34:36,601 --> 00:34:39,070
there isn't a son-in-law quite like Tae Kyung.

615
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:41,610
Thank you for accepting Yeon Doo.

616
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,711
Gosh, that's nonsense.

617
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:46,510
I'm the one grateful for a daughter-in-law like her.

618
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:50,521
She's the one who freed me from domestic chores today.

619
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,851
And thanks to her,

620
00:34:51,851 --> 00:34:55,050
the family actually apologized to Tae Kyung.

621
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:56,320
Really?

622
00:34:57,191 --> 00:34:59,890
That's her. She doesn't stand by after deciding to take action.

623
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:04,331
Anyway, I'll stop by your restaurant sometime.

624
00:35:04,331 --> 00:35:07,300
I'm sorry I haven't visited since you opened it.

625
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,970
There's no need to apologize.

626
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,200
Still, I promise that the dish will be absolutely delicious.

627
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,300
Shall we get going, then?

628
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,941
Sure. I'll drive you home safely.

629
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,851
Why did you take my mom out?

630
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,660
Tae Kyung, please keep your distance from my family.

631
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,030
If this continues, they'll hurt even more...

632
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,200
after we split.

633
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,871
Why did you take my mom out on a date, then?

634
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:43,871
Well, that...

635
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,470
I wanted to free her from kitchen duties today.

636
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,740
Who are you to offer that?

637
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,651
Why do you care about the mother of a man you don't even like?

638
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:58,351
I'd rather not speak about this with you anymore.

639
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,621
Come on. Let's go home.

640
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:07,831
She's avoiding me again.

641
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:11,700
Car-camping?

642
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:14,771
Car-camping...

643
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,240
Why are you also against it?

644
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:19,771
I want to sign with the agency.

645
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,581
Soo Kyum, not with her.

646
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,780
I'll look for another agency if this is what you want.

647
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:28,780
No! She's who I like.

648
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,881
She's the one I want to sign with.

649
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:33,291
Dong Wook,

650
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,160
what she said made a lot of sense.

651
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,860
You said it was a decent company, so think it over.

652
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,831
Why are being this way again?

653
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,561
I'm her father, remember?

654
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:43,831
I should ask you the same thing.

655
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,501
You said there wouldn't be issues as long as the contract was solid.

656
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:47,530
Dad, I hate you.

657
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:51,740
Even Great-uncle agreed, so why won't you allow it?

658
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,711
I like hanging out with her.

659
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,840
Who on earth made Soo Kyum cry?

660
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,981
Goodness. Soo Kyum, would you like to try some?

661
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:05,421
Here.

662
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,390
Wait. It's delicious.

663
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:12,320
What is it?

664
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,360
It's royal tteokbokki.

665
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:17,860
I used to make it for my daughter when she was little.

666
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:19,401
But that was a long time ago,

667
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:20,901
so I don't know if it still tastes good.

668
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,240
Talk about it being moreish.

669
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:30,410
Yours is nothing compared to his.

670
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,711
- What? - He's right.

671
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,711
It's better with a soy sauce base.

672
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:37,651
Enjoy, then.

673
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,200
Well, it's nothing special.

674
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,430
Great-uncle, are you upset because we said his was better?

675
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:57,140
Of course not.

676
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:11,950
Ho, what are you up to?

677
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,291
Who's that?

678
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,220
My daughter.

679
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,061
I see.

680
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,490
I sense you have your own story.

681
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,260
But Ho,

682
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:29,101
please don't go around cooking for the family.

683
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,640
I'm the resident cook here.

684
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,970
Sorry about that.

685
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:39,351
I felt guilty about only entering the kitchen to eat.

686
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:42,510
It's fine. You can repay us by eating well.

687
00:38:45,081 --> 00:38:46,191
Still, you're lucky...

688
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,320
to have a daughter you can see even if she's only in a photo.

689
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,590
Meanwhile, this is how I'm going to grow old.

690
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,660
Actually,

691
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:59,831
a fortune teller told me recently that I might have a child.

692
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:03,200
I wondered if someone...

693
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,171
could be raising my child without me knowing...

694
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,871
which made me think of my first love.

695
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:12,510
Nothing happened between us back in the day,

696
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,610
but I began to miss her like crazy.

697
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,050
But then,

698
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,791
just like magic, she came back into my life.

699
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,320
Goodness.

700
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:25,390
You're meant to be.

701
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,831
Right? How else could I interpret this?

702
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:31,731
Anyway, Hee...

703
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:38,601
Hee?

704
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:41,110
Hee, it's me.

705
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,481
Wait. You don't sound well.

706
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,510
Right now?

707
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,081
Got it. I'll be right there.

708
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:03,760
What is it?

709
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:06,671
Ho,

710
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:11,800
Se Jin has been in her room all day.

711
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,271
She hasn't even eaten anything.

712
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:17,441
Can't you come back home?

713
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:21,110
I don't know what to do without you here.

714
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,581
I'm not going back.

715
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:27,151
Se Jin's issues are yours to handle.

716
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:30,521
Then, let's meet.

717
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:32,961
I'll come to you.

718
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,530
Se Jin, I'm going out for a while.

719
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:43,300
Tae Kyung...

720
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,371
is mine now.

721
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,140
If you try to steal him once more,

722
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:49,640
I will fight back.

723
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,510
Because I love him too.

724
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,651
Why can it be her...

725
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,751
and not me?

726
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:16,070
I won't break up.

727
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,671
What?

728
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,711
Do what you want about how you feel.

729
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,740
I'll handle my emotions.

730
00:41:26,581 --> 00:41:28,280
I like you,

731
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,320
and I won't stop here.

732
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:34,691
We're no longer friends or in a contractual relationship.

733
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:38,461
From now on, I'll be a man and make advances...

734
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,430
to the woman I like.

735
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,401
Pull over.

736
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:48,331
- What for? - Pull over right now.

737
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,550
I told you not to. We can't do this!

738
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,720
Why can't we?

739
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,760
Do you really not get it?

740
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,430
What are you doing?

741
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:16,731
I'm pregnant.

742
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,871
I'm carrying another man's baby.

743
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,171
Who the dad is, how we met and broke up,

744
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:24,901
you know everything.

745
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:26,410
How can we...

746
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,371
remain a normal couple?

747
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,280
I'm not just any woman. I'm an actual mom.

748
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,711
That's why...

749
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:38,251
I decided to get into a contractual marriage with you.

750
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:41,590
You never wanted to marry yourself.

751
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,760
This is just a phase.

752
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,561
What about how I feel, then?

753
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:48,490
Do my feelings mean nothing?

754
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,501
That's pity and compassion.

755
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,671
Don't mistake it for love.

756
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:56,901
Stop wavering and go back to...

757
00:42:58,048 --> 00:42:59,077
how you were.

758
00:43:34,974 --> 00:43:37,145
I was just thinking about you...

759
00:43:38,085 --> 00:43:40,755
and you called. Isn't that amazing?

760
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,025
Is that so?

761
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:48,195
You were...

762
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:50,965
the only person I could think of.

763
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:53,434
I'm shameless, aren't I?

764
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:57,465
I humiliated you for asking me out on a date.

765
00:44:02,505 --> 00:44:04,275
Don't ask what's going on.

766
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,344
I can't tell you.

767
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,384
Let's go.

768
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:13,554
Where to?

769
00:44:14,384 --> 00:44:15,514
Let's just go.

770
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:29,904
You're on your feet all day.

771
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,404
I wanted to buy you a comfy pair of shoes.

772
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:33,875
Try them on.

773
00:44:43,585 --> 00:44:45,545
They're really pretty.

774
00:44:46,485 --> 00:44:48,014
They're a perfect fit.

775
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:49,654
And they're comfy.

776
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,755
Thanks a lot, Dae Sang.

777
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,904
You can be shameless around me.

778
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:04,965
What?

779
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:08,175
Be as inconsistent as you want.

780
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:11,275
Push me away or call me whenever you wish.

781
00:45:12,204 --> 00:45:14,645
Why are you so understanding?

782
00:45:15,884 --> 00:45:18,645
I'm nothing but handsome.

783
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,284
I had a tough life, and I learned...

784
00:45:21,715 --> 00:45:22,824
to be understanding.

785
00:45:25,085 --> 00:45:26,125
Yes.

786
00:45:26,954 --> 00:45:29,695
I liked your handsome face.

787
00:45:30,824 --> 00:45:33,695
But more than your looks,

788
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:35,465
I liked your heart.

789
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:38,605
You were docile, sweet,

790
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:41,375
gullible, and generous.

791
00:45:44,605 --> 00:45:47,574
You're the only one who thinks highly of me.

792
00:45:48,275 --> 00:45:50,344
That's why I liked you.

793
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,184
Back then and even now.

794
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:57,284
What?

795
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,494
I don't want to put pressure on you.

796
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:02,594
I'll keep work apart from pleasure.

797
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,934
How much are the shoes?

798
00:46:15,204 --> 00:46:18,675
You should eat too or your stomach will ache later.

799
00:46:20,474 --> 00:46:23,485
You care about me only after we got divorced.

800
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:26,514
You used to have no time for me...

801
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:28,915
because you had a school to care for.

802
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:32,895
Quit with the nonsense and talk about Se Jin.

803
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:36,824
Honey. I'm scared.

804
00:46:37,224 --> 00:46:40,335
I'm scared something bad will happen to Se Jin.

805
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:42,034
What do you mean?

806
00:46:43,264 --> 00:46:44,665
You're not making sense.

807
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:50,005
Se Jin said she could get back with Tae Kyung,

808
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:51,775
so I did as she said.

809
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:54,114
But I don't think it worked.

810
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:57,945
And she still can't give up on him.

811
00:46:58,045 --> 00:46:59,215
Let her be.

812
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,815
She must go all the way to come back.

813
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:06,094
And don't come to see me again about this.

814
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:10,094
Where are you staying these days?

815
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:11,965
Not at the school, right?

816
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:14,895
You don't need to know.

817
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:35,884
Mr. Jang.

818
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:39,224
What's the matter? Why are you hanging your head?

819
00:47:42,454 --> 00:47:43,764
Are you in a bad mood?

820
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,295
If you are, let it all out before you come inside.

821
00:47:48,695 --> 00:47:50,904
I don't allow negativity indoors.

822
00:47:52,264 --> 00:47:53,605
Fine.

823
00:47:54,434 --> 00:47:57,145
I guess I won't be gloomy as long as I'm here.

824
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:01,145
You made the kids tteokbokki but left without having any.

825
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:04,085
There's food in the kitchen. Eat before you go to bed.

826
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:05,585
Thank you.

827
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:09,654
Will you skip rope some more?

828
00:48:09,824 --> 00:48:11,784
It's best to exercise under the moon.

829
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:13,824
Go on inside. It's not good to eat too late.

830
00:48:15,454 --> 00:48:16,494
Oh, dear.

831
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:27,434
Who's that?

832
00:48:32,005 --> 00:48:34,415
Who are you?

833
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:39,654
Hello.

834
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:44,824
Oh, you must be the landlady.

835
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:47,094
Who am I?

836
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,594
I'm...

837
00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:51,364
the wife of Jang Ho,

838
00:48:51,525 --> 00:48:55,295
the man who just went inside.

839
00:48:56,235 --> 00:48:58,904
I followed him out of concern.

840
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:05,175
Please take good care of my husband.

841
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:11,645
He knows nothing about how the world works.

842
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:17,925
I'll be back.

843
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:20,755
Oh, dear...

844
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:26,494
These are your belongings.

845
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:29,764
These are the divorce papers.

846
00:49:29,764 --> 00:49:31,335
Sign it sooner than later.

847
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:34,275
Don't think of crawling back home.

848
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:38,005
Your daughter said she wouldn't live with you anymore.

849
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,255
Divorce?

850
00:49:52,384 --> 00:49:54,855
She's the one who asked him for a divorce.

851
00:49:59,895 --> 00:50:01,735
There's no closure for conjugal affection.

852
00:50:18,945 --> 00:50:20,784
I like you,

853
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,454
and I won't stop here.

854
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:26,954
We're no longer friends or in a contractual relationship.

855
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,864
From now on, I'll be a man and make advances...

856
00:50:31,565 --> 00:50:32,795
to the woman I like.

857
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:36,565
Gosh, why do I keep thinking about it?

858
00:50:39,574 --> 00:50:40,974
I bet he went out to work.

859
00:50:44,404 --> 00:50:46,474
Tae Kyung.

860
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:49,645
Tae Kyung?

861
00:50:53,514 --> 00:50:54,654
He's out.

862
00:50:56,824 --> 00:50:57,824
What?

863
00:51:02,094 --> 00:51:04,895
I need to talk to you. Come to my office later today.

864
00:51:06,634 --> 00:51:08,364
Why does he want to see me?

865
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:14,775
Welcome...

866
00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:16,844
Hello.

867
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:18,704
Hello.

868
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:23,244
Thank you for this. I washed it clean.

869
00:51:23,985 --> 00:51:25,614
You don't have to return it.

870
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,954
The kid isn't here today.

871
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:30,884
He went to the daycare to tell the other kids...

872
00:51:30,884 --> 00:51:32,154
that he could ride a bike.

873
00:51:32,784 --> 00:51:35,125
Thank you. I owe it to you.

874
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,764
You're welcome.

875
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:40,065
I need a hangover drink. I'm having an office dinner tonight.

876
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:43,434
(Hanareum Pharmacy)

877
00:51:49,645 --> 00:51:52,244
What is he doing here?

878
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:55,315
Welcome.

879
00:51:57,945 --> 00:51:59,445
Eye drops, please.

880
00:51:59,445 --> 00:52:01,715
The one for pregnant women.

881
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:04,184
I'll give you one without preservatives.

882
00:52:04,184 --> 00:52:05,384
How much do you need?

883
00:52:05,384 --> 00:52:06,525
A month's worth.

884
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:26,045
What are you doing here?

885
00:52:27,175 --> 00:52:28,715
I was wondering when you'd talk to me.

886
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:32,545
Mr. Cha, do you know her?

887
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:34,715
She's my wife.

888
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:37,054
Nice to meet you.

889
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:42,125
Here are your eye drops and hangover drink.

890
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:44,425
I'll pay for them together.

891
00:52:53,275 --> 00:52:54,275
Here.

892
00:52:54,275 --> 00:52:55,304
Thank you.

893
00:52:57,804 --> 00:53:00,275
What are you doing? Let's go see a sonogram.

894
00:53:00,474 --> 00:53:01,474
What?

895
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:03,945
Okay.

896
00:53:07,215 --> 00:53:08,614
- Mother. - Yes.

897
00:53:08,614 --> 00:53:10,025
Are you going to the calligraphy meeting?

898
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:11,554
Yes.

899
00:53:12,824 --> 00:53:14,594
Yeon Doo, you're going to work.

900
00:53:15,094 --> 00:53:16,125
This works out great.

901
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,125
I'll get Mr. Kim to give you two a ride.

902
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:19,324
- No. - No.

903
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:20,594
It's all right.

904
00:53:21,594 --> 00:53:24,134
All right then.

905
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,634
- Mother, have a nice day. - Thanks.

906
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:27,375
Yeon Doo, don't strain yourself.

907
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:28,835
Okay.

908
00:53:28,835 --> 00:53:30,275
- I'll see you later, Mother. - Bye.

909
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:38,445
Why do you have to leave when I go out?

910
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:41,954
And why do you have to leave right on time?

911
00:53:43,255 --> 00:53:44,425
You should wait a while.

912
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:46,755
And don't act like you know me at school.

913
00:53:47,054 --> 00:53:48,895
Okay, Ms. Eun Geum Sil.

914
00:53:58,465 --> 00:53:59,534
You know...

915
00:53:59,665 --> 00:54:02,704
the school presidential election is upcoming, right?

916
00:54:02,704 --> 00:54:04,074
- Yes. - Yes.

917
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,915
Anyone can run for election.

918
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,985
If you want to put up for election,

919
00:54:09,985 --> 00:54:12,184
make sure not to be late.

920
00:54:13,014 --> 00:54:14,014
That's it for today.

921
00:54:14,014 --> 00:54:16,114
- Thank you. - Thank you.

922
00:54:16,114 --> 00:54:18,985
- Thank you. - Thank you.

923
00:54:19,324 --> 00:54:22,054
I'm going to hang out with my kids.

924
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,895
The school president?

925
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:29,565
What?

926
00:54:29,735 --> 00:54:31,835
Ms. Eun Geum Sil, you're early.

927
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,404
Oh, hey.

928
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:36,175
No, I mean...

929
00:54:36,175 --> 00:54:38,505
Yes, Mr. Jang.

930
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:41,844
Your teacher is coming soon. Have a nice time.

931
00:54:42,614 --> 00:54:43,684
Okay.

932
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:47,884
Bong Nim, you should be the school president this year.

933
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,525
You lost by the narrowest margin last year.

934
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:51,724
Right.

935
00:54:51,724 --> 00:54:54,525
There's no one who should be the president other than you.

936
00:54:55,195 --> 00:54:56,625
We will help you.

937
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,465
Gosh, you don't have to do that.

938
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:00,134
Someone who deserves it will win.

939
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:02,994
It doesn't have to be Bong Nim.

940
00:55:03,264 --> 00:55:05,634
There might be an unexpected candidate.

941
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:09,275
My gosh.

942
00:55:09,675 --> 00:55:11,175
You're here, Ms. Eun.

943
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:14,375
I heard about the new teacher. How is she?

944
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:17,614
I don't like her. She's a horrible teacher.

945
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:19,545
You're being like that again.

946
00:55:19,744 --> 00:55:21,554
Try to learn a lot from your teacher.

947
00:55:22,215 --> 00:55:23,384
- Let's go. - Okay.

948
00:55:23,384 --> 00:55:24,784
See you.

949
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:27,895
My goodness.

950
00:55:28,054 --> 00:55:29,824
She doesn't even know it's her daughter.

951
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:32,665
I'll give my teacher a hard time.

952
00:55:32,994 --> 00:55:38,934
(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K...)

953
00:55:43,804 --> 00:55:45,474
Will you keep going on like this?

954
00:55:45,744 --> 00:55:48,545
When I read it, repeat after me.

955
00:55:52,114 --> 00:55:55,085
It's so complicated. How can I memorize them all?

956
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:08,994
(Poop)

957
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:18,775
(Poop Geum Sil)

958
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,775
What does it say?

959
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:26,184
I know the last two letters mean Geum Sil.

960
00:56:26,755 --> 00:56:28,614
But what about the first one?

961
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:31,585
Poop. It's Poop Geum Sil.

962
00:56:31,684 --> 00:56:32,954
What did you say?

963
00:56:33,395 --> 00:56:34,395
What?

964
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:39,125
I know you're smart.

965
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:41,395
That's why you memorized your name right away.

966
00:56:41,795 --> 00:56:43,404
Since you're a smart person,

967
00:56:43,404 --> 00:56:45,864
you should be able to tell when someone insults you.

968
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:53,875
I'll teach you the words you want to read.

969
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,215
- What do you say? - What do I want to read?

970
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:07,625
(Son)

971
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,695
Look.

972
00:57:08,824 --> 00:57:10,195
"Son."

973
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:12,395
I wrote "son."

974
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:13,494
What?

975
00:57:14,594 --> 00:57:15,835
Son?

976
00:57:17,565 --> 00:57:20,275
You can't live without your son.

977
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:30,244
(Eun Geum Sil)

978
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:32,945
"Eun Geum Sil. Son."

979
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:36,315
You can learn a lot from these two words.

980
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:40,094
G as in Geum.

981
00:57:40,525 --> 00:57:42,954
N as in Eun.

982
00:57:43,465 --> 00:57:45,864
S as in Son.

983
00:57:46,224 --> 00:57:48,764
L as in Sil.

984
00:57:49,364 --> 00:57:52,465
G, N, S, and L.

985
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:55,074
You should learn only these four letters.

986
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:56,744
What did you say?

987
00:57:57,105 --> 00:57:58,574
It's G.

988
00:57:58,574 --> 00:58:00,445
Repeat after me. G.

989
00:58:00,715 --> 00:58:01,815
"G."

990
00:58:02,474 --> 00:58:03,614
"G."

991
00:58:05,045 --> 00:58:06,045
N.

992
00:58:06,654 --> 00:58:08,255
We're done inspecting Kim Jun Ha.

993
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:11,025
He is deemed fit to convince the shareholders in the US.

994
00:58:11,985 --> 00:58:13,085
Have you reached him yet?

995
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:15,895
I sent an email because of the time difference.

996
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:18,895
He replied that he would contact us.

997
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:21,134
If you get a call from him, make an appointment right away.

998
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:22,335
Okay.

999
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,904
I'll meet him as soon as possible.

1000
00:58:24,804 --> 00:58:25,804
Yes.

1001
00:58:29,904 --> 00:58:31,775
You should attend the meeting of the Textile Society.

1002
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:34,215
Is it the same restaurant we always go to?

1003
00:58:34,215 --> 00:58:35,215
Yes, sir.

1004
00:58:37,085 --> 00:58:38,545
You should meet him...

1005
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:40,514
and tell me if he seems to be the right man.

1006
00:58:40,514 --> 00:58:41,755
Yes, Mr. Gong.

1007
00:58:41,954 --> 00:58:43,014
Let's go.

1008
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:45,384
(Gong Obstetrics and Gynaecology)

1009
00:58:45,384 --> 00:58:47,195
We will have the blood test in two days.

1010
00:58:47,195 --> 00:58:49,425
If there's no problem with the hormone levels,

1011
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,824
we will harvest your eggs as scheduled.

1012
00:58:53,264 --> 00:58:56,395
You should get a shot 48 hours before the test.

1013
00:58:56,395 --> 00:58:59,304
So I'll prescribe Decapeptyl and Ovidrel.

1014
00:58:59,735 --> 00:59:01,735
I'll see you in two days.

1015
00:59:01,735 --> 00:59:02,804
Okay.

1016
00:59:09,974 --> 00:59:11,244
Why isn't she coming?

1017
00:59:12,844 --> 00:59:14,054
Team dinner?

1018
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:17,125
It's almost time. Come with us if you have some time.

1019
00:59:17,585 --> 00:59:19,425
It's a restaurant Father told us about.

1020
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:21,594
They have great meat, so come and eat with us.

1021
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:24,165
You should give up.

1022
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:26,895
I bet Dr. Gong doesn't even know about the office dinner.

1023
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:32,034
If Tae Kyung doesn't go, I can't go, either.

1024
00:59:33,235 --> 00:59:34,275
Yeon Doo.

1025
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,145
Why didn't you come into my office? What are you doing here?

1026
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:42,375
We were trying to get her to come to dinner today...

1027
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,684
so that you'd also join us.

1028
00:59:44,645 --> 00:59:45,645
A team dinner?

1029
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:47,855
We didn't tell you since we knew you wouldn't come.

1030
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:50,654
Your wife is also here, so join us today.

1031
00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:52,454
It won't work.

1032
00:59:52,824 --> 00:59:54,295
You're not coming, are you?

1033
00:59:55,654 --> 00:59:56,795
I'll go.

1034
00:59:56,895 --> 00:59:57,965
- What? - What?

1035
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:03,335
You asked me out because you had something to say.

1036
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:06,505
You guys can always talk after dinner.

1037
01:00:06,505 --> 01:00:07,574
Please join us.

1038
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:08,835
Join us.

1039
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,645
Please help the staff form a better relationship.

1040
01:00:12,974 --> 01:00:15,415
Well, I...

1041
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:19,315
I'll briefly stay for dinner, then.

1042
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:30,824
- Let us all drink. - Right.

1043
01:00:30,824 --> 01:00:32,724
Good job, everyone.

1044
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:42,204
So how did you two meet?

1045
01:00:43,275 --> 01:00:44,275
- Sorry? - What?

1046
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:46,505
We're curious, that's all.

1047
01:00:47,074 --> 01:00:48,074
Director Cha, do you know the story?

1048
01:00:48,915 --> 01:00:51,014
I only heard they fell in love at first sight.

1049
01:00:51,784 --> 01:00:53,085
Where exactly did you two meet?

1050
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:01,094
But car camping or regular camping has been on my mind.

1051
01:01:02,695 --> 01:01:03,764
Car camping.

1052
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:06,965
We bumped into each other while car camping.

1053
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:09,094
"Car camping?"

1054
01:01:09,434 --> 01:01:10,465
"Car camping?"

1055
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:11,904
Do you actually do things like that?

1056
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:14,434
I went to get some fresh air,

1057
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:17,304
and she was also there alone.

1058
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:20,445
We got talking and gazed at the stars...

1059
01:01:20,474 --> 01:01:22,744
which all led to this.

1060
01:01:23,815 --> 01:01:25,884
Gosh, that's so romantic.

1061
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:28,355
It must've been great for you as well.

1062
01:01:30,085 --> 01:01:32,355
Right, I guess.

1063
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,094
Don't forget to chew, or you'll have indigestion.

1064
01:01:40,895 --> 01:01:41,994
Gosh.

1065
01:01:42,795 --> 01:01:46,105
I can eat by myself just fine.

1066
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:49,704
I had no idea Dr. Gong could be this sweet.

1067
01:01:49,974 --> 01:01:51,145
Tell me about it.

1068
01:01:51,145 --> 01:01:53,005
The cold-hearted and prickly Gong Tae Kyung...

1069
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,215
just cooled down a piece of meat for her.

1070
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:59,145
They say personalities can change when you meet the right person.

1071
01:01:59,384 --> 01:02:01,614
You guys must be meant to be.

1072
01:02:04,525 --> 01:02:06,054
Are you sure about that?

1073
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:07,755
What?

1074
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:10,565
Do you have any idea how much we argue?

1075
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:13,364
Yeon Doo, what are you saying?

1076
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:16,764
We shouldn't lie just because we have company.

1077
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:18,904
We got into a huge argument yesterday,

1078
01:02:18,904 --> 01:02:20,804
and I took the cab home.

1079
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:24,545
Our personalities clash like crazy.

1080
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:29,014
Should I stay married to him or not?

1081
01:02:29,275 --> 01:02:32,884
I seriously ask myself that a few times every day.

1082
01:02:35,415 --> 01:02:39,355
I guess that's how married life is.

1083
01:02:41,755 --> 01:02:44,025
- Director Cha. - Father?

1084
01:02:45,565 --> 01:02:46,594
Father.

1085
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:48,994
The staff came here for a team dinner.

1086
01:02:49,195 --> 01:02:50,835
I appreciate the recommendation.

1087
01:02:52,204 --> 01:02:53,775
Tae Kyung and Yeon Doo are here as well.

1088
01:02:54,235 --> 01:02:56,005
I have dinner plans here myself.

1089
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:58,844
Anyway, please enjoy your meal.

1090
01:02:59,204 --> 01:03:00,204
Sure.

1091
01:03:03,275 --> 01:03:04,284
Let's sit.

1092
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:11,724
Hold on.

1093
01:03:12,284 --> 01:03:15,395
Have Director Cha pay for dinner with this...

1094
01:03:15,824 --> 01:03:16,994
and head home.

1095
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:19,065
Yes, sir. I'll see you tomorrow.

1096
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,335
Sure.

1097
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:24,105
I'm sorry about yesterday.

1098
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:26,634
I got carried away with my own excitement...

1099
01:03:26,634 --> 01:03:28,235
without considering your feelings.

1100
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:31,645
So please...

1101
01:03:33,244 --> 01:03:35,645
Here. Can you stop being angry with me?

1102
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,945
What on earth? You said you argued,

1103
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:40,514
but I see it was just a lovers' quarrel.

1104
01:03:40,514 --> 01:03:41,755
Gosh, my eyes.

1105
01:03:41,755 --> 01:03:44,025
Seeing him this way is hurting my eyes.

1106
01:03:45,724 --> 01:03:47,954
Has he always been this way with you, Ms. Oh?

1107
01:03:48,295 --> 01:03:50,154
This is a first for us.

1108
01:03:50,824 --> 01:03:52,425
Right, well...

1109
01:03:53,324 --> 01:03:54,735
It's because I like her more.

1110
01:03:56,534 --> 01:03:58,804
The one with bigger feelings is the loser in the relationship.

1111
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:01,974
After I met Yeon Doo,

1112
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:04,275
I became a loser for the first time in my life.

1113
01:04:05,605 --> 01:04:06,744
Tae Kyung...

1114
01:04:07,014 --> 01:04:09,275
Are you close to dying? What is with you today?

1115
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,585
Ms. Jang is back.

1116
01:04:14,355 --> 01:04:15,384
Director Cha.

1117
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,554
Chairman Gong said you should pay for dinner with this.

1118
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:18,925
Gosh, thank you.

1119
01:04:23,454 --> 01:04:26,364
It was nice getting to know you. I'll get going.

1120
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:28,534
I'll get going too.

1121
01:04:28,534 --> 01:04:30,235
What? Dr. Gong!

1122
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:35,005
I guess yesterday's argument was pretty serious.

1123
01:04:36,775 --> 01:04:38,244
Anyway, let's enjoy the barbecue.

1124
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:48,384
Yeon Doo!

1125
01:04:49,855 --> 01:04:51,184
Yeon Doo!

1126
01:04:57,295 --> 01:04:58,295
Yeon Doo.

1127
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:01,165
- Yeon Doo. - Let go of me.

1128
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,295
Why did you insist on coming to the team dinner today?

1129
01:05:03,534 --> 01:05:05,364
What were you doing in front of your colleagues?

1130
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:08,804
I wanted them to know that I liked you.

1131
01:05:10,235 --> 01:05:13,445
I don't want to hide my feelings in front of others.

1132
01:05:13,815 --> 01:05:15,815
Didn't I make myself clear yesterday?

1133
01:05:15,815 --> 01:05:19,145
I'm an actual mother which is why we can't be together.

1134
01:05:19,244 --> 01:05:20,755
I don't get what you're saying.

1135
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:22,514
Actually, I don't want to get it.

1136
01:05:23,554 --> 01:05:25,125
- What? - You're right.

1137
01:05:25,585 --> 01:05:28,255
I was never interested in marriage or having children.

1138
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:31,864
Having a family of my own was a horrifying concept for me.

1139
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:35,434
But if I had said because I liked you...

1140
01:05:35,864 --> 01:05:37,404
and wanted to take care of your baby,

1141
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:40,404
would you have believed me?

1142
01:05:43,034 --> 01:05:44,675
This is my life on the line,

1143
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:46,945
and it isn't easy for me.

1144
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:49,344
So please give me a chance.

1145
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:51,384
Give me a chance...

1146
01:05:51,384 --> 01:05:52,915
so that I can seriously think about...

1147
01:05:53,585 --> 01:05:54,884
a future with Real.

1148
01:05:55,755 --> 01:05:57,525
In what way can I give you a chance?

1149
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:00,925
The baby is why you're pushing me away.

1150
01:06:01,895 --> 01:06:04,324
First, tell me how you feel about me.

1151
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:08,595
I must know that first if I'm to take Real seriously.

1152
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,965
How can I think of a future with Real...

1153
01:06:11,064 --> 01:06:14,204
when I don't know if you like me or not?

1154
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:18,604
So let's be honest with our feelings...

1155
01:06:18,805 --> 01:06:19,944
and navigate the issue together.

1156
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:24,644
I'm being serious in a way that might even alter...

1157
01:06:25,144 --> 01:06:26,244
what I once believed.

1158
01:06:27,045 --> 01:06:30,154
But I will still need some time to figure out...

1159
01:06:30,885 --> 01:06:32,625
whether I can do this or not.

1160
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:36,024
I'm not worthy enough for you to change your beliefs.

1161
01:06:36,324 --> 01:06:38,524
- So don't. - I say otherwise.

1162
01:06:43,765 --> 01:06:46,465
Fine. Have at it if you want.

1163
01:06:46,465 --> 01:06:48,305
I won't budge,

1164
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:49,635
but do as you please.

1165
01:07:04,555 --> 01:07:05,885
It's because I like her more.

1166
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:09,524
The one with bigger feelings is the loser in the relationship.

1167
01:07:10,665 --> 01:07:12,194
After I met Yeon Doo,

1168
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,635
I became a loser for the first time in my life.

1169
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:31,415
(Kim Jun Ha)

1170
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:37,225
Why aren't you picking up?

1171
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,385
Pick up, darn it!

1172
01:07:46,265 --> 01:07:49,894
(Se Jin)

1173
01:07:57,604 --> 01:07:59,574
(Se Jin)

1174
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:01,015
(Missed call: Se Jin)

1175
01:08:02,814 --> 01:08:05,644
Jang Se Jin, why are you desperately trying to contact me?

1176
01:08:06,814 --> 01:08:08,654
Weren't you the one who kicked me to the curb?

1177
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:52,665
(The Real Has Come!)

1178
01:08:52,965 --> 01:08:54,234
I'm going house hunting today.

1179
01:08:54,234 --> 01:08:55,564
We'll still stick to the schedule.

1180
01:08:55,835 --> 01:08:56,894
You should watch out for me.

1181
01:08:56,894 --> 01:08:58,635
Who knows what I might do?

1182
01:08:59,064 --> 01:09:00,104
What do you mean by that?

1183
01:09:00,104 --> 01:09:01,574
Please hear me out just once.

1184
01:09:01,574 --> 01:09:04,904
Gong Yu Myung said she respected Soo Kyum.

1185
01:09:05,444 --> 01:09:06,505
You're here.

1186
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:08,644
Gosh, no.

1187
01:09:08,715 --> 01:09:10,614
How could she live in a unit this tiny?

1188
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,614
The living room's facing west, so over my dead body.

1189
01:09:13,515 --> 01:09:15,515
The neighbourhood has bad air quality. Pass!

1190
01:09:16,354 --> 01:09:19,225
Why would Jang Se Jin be asking about the father?

1191
01:09:19,454 --> 01:09:21,055
Just answer the question.

1192
01:09:21,055 --> 01:09:23,225
Are you the father of Oh Yeon Doo's baby?
