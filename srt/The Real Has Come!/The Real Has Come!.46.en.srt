Did you receive the DNA test result back already?

Get over here.

What?

That's right.

19
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:03,783
I told Jun Ha about it. Didn't he call you?

20
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:06,283
What's going on?

21
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:09,753
Could he have not told me on purpose?

Whatever. Just answer my question.

26
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:28,843
Did you submit the samples properly?

27
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:30,173
What?

28
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:33,512
What do you mean "did I submit the samples properly?"

29
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:34,912
Just answer the question!

30
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:37,683
Did you mess with anything?

31
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:39,112
What are you...

32
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:43,722
It can't be.

33
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:55,033
"No match?"

34
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:57,903
What does this mean?

35
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:02,343
Your DNA isn't a match to Ms. Eun's?

36
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:04,102
No.

37
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:06,213
The result is wrong.

38
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,312
You did something.

39
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:09,942
Why are you blaming me?

40
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,852
I handed in exactly what you gave me.

41
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,312
Did you mess up?

42
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:15,851
Was that Ms. Eun's toothbrush?

43
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,452
I checked with her multiple times before taking it.

44
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:21,653
What's going on?

45
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:27,033
Does this mean you're not Ms. Eun's grandson?

46
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:31,503
No. That can't be.

47
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,102
That's impossible.

48
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:37,172
Ask your sister.

49
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:39,912
If these results are accurate,

50
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:42,312
she might know something.

51
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:43,442
Call her right now.

52
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:46,952
What's wrong?

53
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:48,352
Are you afraid?

54
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:51,083
That the results might be right?

55
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:55,023
I'm tired. You should leave.

56
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:57,792

Stop avoiding me and let me in.

60

Ha Neul.

61
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,192
What if the test results are right?

62
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,533
They're not, right?

63
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:40,033
They can't be.

64
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:44,903
I told you to leave.

65
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:47,542
I'm annoyed, so get out.

66
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:52,553
Your sister's here, Mr. Kim.

67
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:59,993
I'll see myself out so you can talk.

68
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,892
You're really hard to meet.

69
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:08,332
Why did you ignore my calls?

70
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:11,563
I was busy.

71
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,233
I was going to call tomorrow.

72
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,202
I heard about Mom's memorial ceremony today.

73
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:19,973
- What? - Grandma called.

74
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,312
Why didn't you tell me about it?

75
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:24,082
I just said I'd been busy.

76
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:26,613
I forgot.

77
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:30,622
Okay. Did the ceremony go smoothly?

78
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:32,252
Are the people nice to you?

79
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:33,793
Grandma's especially nice to me.

80
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:37,123
We're family, after all.

81
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,932
Why do you look so sullen?

82
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,262
Is something wrong?

83
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:45,003
(The DNA maternity test...)

84
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:46,532
(does not prove a maternal blood relationship.)

85
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,842
Nothing's wrong. I'm just tired.

86
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:53,442
Stop bothering me and leave.

87
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,382
Okay, I'll leave. Get some rest.

88
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:01,313
What's all this?

89
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,122
What?

90
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:05,223
Why do you have so much baby stuff?

91
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:06,952
Oh, these?

92
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:10,322
An acquaintance stayed a few days with their kid.

93
00:05:10,663 --> 00:05:11,822
They're still moving out.

94
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,192
I see.

95
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:16,862
I fly out soon,

96
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:18,631
and I'll be away for a really long time.

97
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,202
I'd called to tell you that.

98
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:21,632
Okay.

99
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:24,243
Let's eat out with Grandma before you leave.

100
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,642
You now say "Grandma" with a more natural ease.

101
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:30,582
It'll be nice to eat out. See you.

102
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:04,313
Why did she come over?

103
00:06:12,382 --> 00:06:14,192
- Hello. - My sister just left.

104
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:16,992
Why did you let her in?

105
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:19,331
It was an opportunity to check the facts.

106
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:20,692
Did you ask her about it?

107
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:23,702
No. Not yet.

108
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:25,032
Why not?

109
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:29,003
Are you still mistakenly thinking I messed with the samples?

110
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:30,342
I'm not.

111
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:33,072
Until I get another test done,

112
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:34,842
don't tell anyone about it.

113
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:38,413
Quit wasting your time worrying and take another test.

114
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,012
Bye.

115
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:47,293
Jun Ha's not her real grandson?

116
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:50,522
(Sister Eka)

117
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,733
I was surprised that you called.

118
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,772
Why did you want to see me?

119
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,542
I had a lot of things to ask Jun Ha,

120
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:06,543
but I couldn't ask him in person.

121
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:08,072
What did you want to ask about?

122
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:13,183
Can I ask how you two met?

123
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:16,723
We met at work.

124
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:19,853
We got close while working together,

125
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,993
and we grew to trust each other.

126
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,192
I see.

127
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:29,162
Did you see the baby stuff...

128
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:30,702
in Jun Ha's guest room?

129
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:33,331
Yes, I did.

130
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:35,973
Do you know who they belong to?

131
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:39,103
Are they yours?

132
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:41,942
No, you guessed wrong.

133
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:45,113
Sorry. That was rude of me.

134
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:48,151
You knew his door passcode,

135
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:50,081
and you were there often.

136
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:52,592
So, I thought you were more than just colleagues.

137
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,522
I told you that we help each other out.

138
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:59,863
Jun Ha's a great business partner.

139
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:02,702
I'm sorry if I offended you.

140
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:06,103
I'll ask just one more thing.

141
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,071
Is Jun Ha close to...

142
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,503
any woman in particular?

143
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:14,942
I don't know that much.

144
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:19,082
We don't share details about our personal lives.

145
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:20,853
I see.

146
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:24,682
Why, Sister?

147
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,892
Did Jun Ha do something wrong?

148
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,262
He didn't do anything wrong,

149
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:32,693
but I'm bothered.

150
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:38,102
How much older than Jun Ha are you?

151
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:40,833
We're six years apart. It's a big age gap.

152
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:43,073
It is.

153
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:47,641
Then you must remember what he was like as a baby.

154
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:48,911
I do.

155
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:51,782
I still clearly remember the day I first saw him.

156
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:54,483
My parents were overjoyed.

157
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,782
I guess your brother was much loved.

158
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:00,552
Yes.

159
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:03,692
I should get back to the church.

160
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:05,462
Thanks a lot for your help.

161
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,931
I'll call before I fly out.

162
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:10,432
Okay. You can go ahead.

163
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:21,343
Does she know something or nothing at all?

164
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:41,733
Stop crying.

165
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,772
What are you two doing?

166
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:03,182
Is the café owner Soo Kyum's mom?

167
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:09,623
Is that why you asked me...

168
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:12,363
if Soo Kyum talked about her mom?

169
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,662
- Yu Myung. - Yes?

170
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:19,032
Let's break up.

171
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,603
What? Why would you say that?

172
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:24,343
Soo Kyum's struggling a lot with mom issues.

173
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:26,373
I'm her dad.

174
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:29,682
I need to focus on her for now.

175
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,012
We can work on that together.

176
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,582
Why would you want to break up with me first?

177
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,652
I don't want to put any pressure on you.

178
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,892
- Pressure? - Yes.

179
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:43,792
These are issues you wouldn't have...

180
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:45,892
if you had dated an ordinary guy.

181
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:50,062
You can meet someone better than I am.

182
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:54,032
You don't have to get bogged down and struggle with stuff like this.

183
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:56,973
- Oh Dong Wook. - Our families too.

184
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,412
You might be cool about being in-laws twice over,

185
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:01,812
but I'm not.

186
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:06,782
I don't want to complicate our family situation even more.

187
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:10,152
Dong Wook.

188
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:13,593
As you said,

189
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:16,463
I wanted to try...

190
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:19,932
being a 26-year-old Oh Dong Wook and not someone's dad.

191
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:24,203
I wanted to find work as an ordinary guy in his 20s,

192
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:26,203
find a girlfriend,

193
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,333
and live normally.

194
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:34,343
Thanks to you, I was able to live like that for the last year.

195
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,483
I'm thankful to you, Yu Myung.

196
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:40,812
Stop talking.

197
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:43,652
I'll get mad if you say anything more.

198
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:46,453
I'm going back to living as Soo Kyum's dad.

199
00:11:49,223 --> 00:11:50,593
This is where it ends for us.

200
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:14,682
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,282
I'm sorry, Yu Myung.

202
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,922
Soo Kyum, sit down. I have something to say to you.

203
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:32,432
Soo Kyum.

204
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:35,932
I'm sorry I wasn't mature enough. I didn't think it through.

205
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:39,103
Instead of waiting for your mom, who will never come back,

206
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,812
I thought it would be better to think of her as dead.

207
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:46,152
But that was just my opinion.

208
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:48,312
It was not what you wanted.

209
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,323
I'm sorry for lying to you.

210
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:56,093
Forget it.

211
00:12:57,562 --> 00:12:59,223
I went to see your mom today,

212
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:03,103
and she told me there was something she really wanted to tell you.

213
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:06,672
You can decide if you want to see her or not.

214
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,672
You don't have to if you don't want to.

215
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:10,503
By chance,

216
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,573
if you feel like seeing her, let me know anytime.

217
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:15,142
I'll take you to her.

218
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,642
Did you cry because of Mom?

219
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,412
Mom and I are not in such a relationship.

220
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:23,182
Let me go take a shower.

221
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:37,363
Gosh.

222
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:41,932
Gosh.

223
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:44,443
Gosh.

224
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:48,743
I will raise her as Tae Kyung's child.

225
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:52,912
I came here to tell her that.

226
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:07,693
And I won't ever change it.

227
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:11,532
Father, if you won't submit the paperwork, I will.

228
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,373
Mother.

229
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,172
Why are you leaving?

230
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:24,382
Do you feel awkward around me?

231
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:28,782
Of course not. What's there to be awkward about?

232
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:30,483
You should head to bed.

233
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:31,922
Mother.

234
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:36,392
I was thankful when you apologized to Tae Kyung.

235
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:39,493
I was happy because it felt like you accepted him as your grandson.

236
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,062
That's why I don't understand why you're acting like this.

237
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:46,103
I understand your grandson showed up,

238
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,932
but Tae Kyung is your grandson too.

239
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:51,802
What are you trying to get at?

240
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,672
Both Mr. Kim and Tae Kyung are your grandkids.

241
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:56,812
It feels unfair.

242
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:00,811
If you accept Mr. Kim,

243
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,583
I can't stop Tae Kyung from leaving the family.

244
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:05,922
Why should Tae Kyung leave?

245
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,623
Could you reconsider...

246
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:11,863
accepting Mr. Kim?

247
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,562
If you don't change your mind,

248
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,363
I'll have to hold back my tears...

249
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:22,573
and remove Tae Kyung from the family register.

250
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:26,573
I'll have no choice but to sever ties with my own son.

251
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,943
Must you make that happen?

252
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:40,093
Gosh.

253
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,603
Honey, what's the matter?

254
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:54,902
Did something happen?

255
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:59,243
Mother is firm.

256
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,642
No matter how much I beg,

257
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,142
she won't budge.

258
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:06,483
Honey.

259
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,083
Let's...

260
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:13,392
do what Tae Kyung wants.

261
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,922
What? What do you mean?

262
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:21,762
We should let Tae Kyung do as he wishes.

263
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:23,032
You should...

264
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,272
allow him to be removed from the family register.

265
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,602
No. I won't allow it.

266
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:30,743
Please let him be free...

267
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:33,473
from this family.

268
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:37,242
Let's allow him to live freely and happily,

269
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:38,882
just as he wants.

270
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:42,182
No, Honey. I can't allow it.

271
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:43,583
Stop hurting him...

272
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:47,521
while trying to keep him around.

273
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:49,922
We should be the ones...

274
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:52,623
to endure the pain.

275
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:17,983
Yeon Doo,

276
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:20,193
do you want to move to Canada?

277
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,223
I told you I'd go anywhere if you want.

278
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,163
Why Canada?

279
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:30,933
It's easy for doctors to emigrate.

280
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:34,102
I already know some doctor friends who settled down there.

281
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:35,832
It'd be easier to get help.

282
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:37,473
I see.

283
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,041
That sounds good.

284
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,913
I'll have all the maple syrup I want.

285
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,183
That sounds delicious and sweet.

286
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:48,052
We should have smoked salmon and ice wine too.

287
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:53,393
I'm already in Canada.

288
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:54,822
Don't wake me up.

289
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,262
Since Canada is cold, I'll tuck you in to keep warm.

290
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:45,473
(We give you our blessing.)

291
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:28,253
It must make you upset thinking about leaving your family.

292
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:30,522
No...

293
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:33,322
I just couldn't fall asleep, so I came here.

294
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:37,923
You should ask me to sing you a lullaby.

295
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:40,332
No way.

296
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:42,532
We don't want to wake Ha Nuel up after barely putting her to bed.

297
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:44,463
What did you say?

298
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,312
Are you sure you're all right?

299
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,242
If we leave Korea,

300
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:00,582
you won't be able to see your family either.

301
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:03,883
I'll speak to your mother tomorrow...

302
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:05,453
and ask for her permission.

303
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:08,923
Let's leave...

304
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:11,993
with happy hearts.

305
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:38,182
If you don't change your mind,

306
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:39,982
I'll have to hold back my tears...

307
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:43,113
and remove Tae Kyung from the family register.

308
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:47,883
I'll have no choice but to sever ties with my own son.

309
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:03,603
Morning, Grandmother. Are you up already?

310
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:06,001
I'm not just awake.

311
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:08,001
I even had my breakfast.

312
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:09,073
What about you?

313
00:21:09,212 --> 00:21:11,783
I'm on my way to ask you for breakfast.

314
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:14,141
I got up this morning...

315
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:15,853
craving for your food.

316
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:19,252
Then hurry over here. I'll have breakfast ready for you.

317
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:20,383
Sure thing.

318
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:21,822
By the way,

319
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,922
how did it go with my toothbrush you took yesterday?

320
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,462
Jun Ha, why are you suddenly not saying anything?

321
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:34,333
Well, I'm driving at the moment.

322
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:37,002
Anyway, I haven't been able to submit the DNA test.

323
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:39,873
I'll let you know right away as soon as I get the result.

324
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:42,812
Sure thing. Drive safely, then.

325
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:43,972
I'm hanging up.

326
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:48,982
Don't be nervous, Jun Ha.

327
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:51,113
No one knows yet.

328
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:08,033
Serve the marinated abalone and shrimp in the fridge.

329
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:11,602
Who are you cooking for with such love and care?

330
00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:14,242
Please don't tell me it's for Mr. Kim.

331
00:22:22,412 --> 00:22:24,583
Grandmother, we have a guest.

332
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:27,182
Gosh, is my Jun Ha already here?

333
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,692
I was right. It is for Mr. Kim.

334
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:32,862
It's not him. Sister Eka is here.

335
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:35,462
What? Eka's here?

336
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,032
I thought you were busy with the church.

337
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:41,103
I'm surprised you made the time to come here.

338
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,501
I wanted to see you,

339
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:45,902
and there was something I needed to ask.

340
00:22:46,672 --> 00:22:49,542
I hope you haven't been crying just because you missed me.

341
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:52,012
Of course, I cried.

342
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:54,312
Not a lot, but tears welled up in my eyes.

343
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:57,053
However, Jun Ha was kind enough to keep me company.

344
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,252
Grandmother,

345
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,852
did everything go well with Mom's memorial ceremony yesterday?

346
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:04,122
Of course.

347
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:06,661
It was a joy to have...

348
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:08,892
the entire family greet her.

349
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,533
To be honest,

350
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:14,902
I didn't know you had put it together for her.

351
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:18,872
What? Didn't Jun Ha call you?

352
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:22,273
No, he didn't tell me anything.

353
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:24,641
That's peculiar.

354
00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:27,742
He told me you couldn't come because you were busy at the church.

355
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:29,982
Grandmother.

356
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,422
- Yes, dear? - I have something to ask,

357
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:35,651
and I need you to be honest with me.

358
00:23:35,652 --> 00:23:37,352
Sure thing.

359
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:40,263
I wouldn't dare lie to a nun and end up in a fire pit.

360
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:44,132
The family's response...

361
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,401
when they met Jun Ha seemed odd to me.

362
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:48,732
It also seems like he's not telling me everything.

363
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:52,671
Did something happen between him and this family...

364
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,442
that I don't know about?

365
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,513
You must not know about Ha Neul.

366
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,911
- Ha Neul? - Yes.

367
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:04,052
As in Yeon Doo's child?

368
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:08,252
I see he couldn't find it in him to tell his sister about it.

369
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:15,093
Jun Ha is Ha Neul's biological father.

370
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:17,192
What?

371
00:24:17,232 --> 00:24:19,633
Ha Neul is his daughter.

372
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:24,073
What on earth are you talking about?

373
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:28,872
Yeon Doo's living with Tae Kyung...

374
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:32,343
while raising the baby she had with Jun Ha.

375
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:36,152
Both he and Tae Kyung wish to raise Ha Neul,

376
00:24:36,252 --> 00:24:38,922
which is causing a problem for us.

377
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:57,333
Why did you ask me here instead of coming to the clinic?

378
00:24:59,343 --> 00:25:00,472
I didn't...

379
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,242
want us to be interrupted.

380
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:06,542
Right. You can tell me whatever it is.

381
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:07,712
I'm all yours.

382
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,883
- Tae Kyung. - Yes, Mom.

383
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:15,252
Are you serious about being removed from the family register?

384
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:22,133
I won't hold your honesty against you.

385
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:26,333
Would being taken off the family register put you at ease?

386
00:25:27,432 --> 00:25:29,432
Yes, and I apologize for that.

387
00:25:34,043 --> 00:25:35,043
Mom.

388
00:25:35,044 --> 00:25:37,313
Your father and I talked.

389
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:41,343
We agreed to remove you from the family register.

390
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:43,452
Mom!

391
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:45,652
Don't annoy me by being happy about it.

392
00:25:49,222 --> 00:25:51,652
At first, I thought it was preposterous.

393
00:25:52,523 --> 00:25:55,892
I asked your father to treat you as his own,

394
00:25:56,833 --> 00:26:00,263
so I hesitated when you asked to be taken off the family register...

395
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:02,833
for Ha Neul's sake.

396
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:04,902
However,

397
00:26:06,002 --> 00:26:09,642
how could I have the last word when this is what you want?

398
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,043
You care for Ha Neul...

399
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:16,113
in the way I care for you,

400
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:17,912
so who am I to stop you?

401
00:26:20,853 --> 00:26:22,422
Just like how you're my priority,

402
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:26,623
Ha Neul is also your priority,

403
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:29,662
so how could I...

404
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:38,232
I'm all right.

405
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:41,603
I'm going to stay strong and send you on your way.

406
00:26:42,172 --> 00:26:44,613
What matters to me...

407
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:48,113
is that you're free and happy.

408
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:08,332
You brat.

409
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,971
You're only taking my hand...

410
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:11,502
now that I'm giving you what you want.

411
00:27:13,642 --> 00:27:14,742
(Self Photo Studio)

412
00:27:15,543 --> 00:27:16,711
Mom, wait.

413
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:18,543
Let's take photos before grabbing our meal.

414
00:27:19,242 --> 00:27:20,343
Photos?

415
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,452
Upon reflection, we don't have any photos of just the two of us.

416
00:27:25,323 --> 00:27:27,283
Sure, let's do that.

417
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:41,033
Do you just take photos by yourselves these days?

418
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:43,833
Yes. Why don't you have a seat?

419
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:50,142
Here we go.

420
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:51,843
In 1, 2, 3.

421
00:27:52,742 --> 00:27:53,742
Gosh.

422
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:56,052
This is awkward, you know.

423
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:57,682
I'm here for you, so don't worry.

424
00:27:58,283 --> 00:28:00,652
All right. I'll put my faith in my son.

425
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:03,093
Mom, let's take one together.

426
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:04,222
Sure.

427
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,133
Didn't you tell me to smile?

428
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,002
Don't you dare make me cry.

429
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:21,972
Got it, Mom.

430
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:23,972
Here we go, then.

431
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:25,682
In 1, 2, 3.

432
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:28,912
One more.

433
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:34,922
In 1, 2, 3.

434
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:46,202
Hello, I'm back.

435
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:48,672
As if we could be happy to see you.

436
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:52,543
You're the only one in this family who can put on a smile.

437
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:54,472
Is that so?

438
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:57,813
I apologize for being an unwanted guest.

439
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:01,843
Is that Won?

440
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,353
He and Ha Neul must only be a few weeks apart.

441
00:29:04,982 --> 00:29:06,782
They're about two months apart.

442
00:29:06,783 --> 00:29:08,583
I see you don't care much about children.

443
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:12,023
Fatherhood is a first for me, so I'm trying to adapt.

444
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:13,992
I'd appreciate your guidance.

445
00:29:15,593 --> 00:29:18,932
Jun Ha, if you're here, come in for your meal.

446
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,363
Yes, Grandmother.

447
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,572
Hello, Chun Myung.

448
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:27,272
Hey, Soo Jung. What's up?

449
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:29,072
Can you please do something?

450
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:31,012
Mr. Kim is back here!

451
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:34,543
Your grandmother had me serve him marinated abalone and shrimp too.

452
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:37,783
What? Mr. Kim is back at the house?

453
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:40,823
Grandma served marinated abalone and shrimp too?

454
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:44,522
Okay, I get it.

455
00:29:44,523 --> 00:29:47,722
I'm in a meeting with Ms. Gong right now.

456
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:54,162
That punk is trying his best to wiggle his way into this family.

457
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:55,773
Mr. Kim's back at the house?

458
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:58,302
What if the paperwork comes next?

459
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:01,343
Maybe he'll insist on legally becoming a part of the family.

460
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:04,972
That little brat.

461
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:10,553
My sister dropped by?

462
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:13,252
Don't just sit there and scoop up some rice.

463
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:15,053
Sure, Grandmother.

464
00:30:16,353 --> 00:30:17,353
Here.

465
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:24,063
Eka wasn't aware of your mom's memorial ceremony.

466
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:27,161
Is that what she said?

467
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,103
Did you lie to me?

468
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:33,242
Of course not. I just forgot to ask her.

469
00:30:33,402 --> 00:30:36,513
Then why did you tell me she was too busy to come?

470
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,482
I was flustered, and that excuse came flying out.

471
00:30:41,212 --> 00:30:43,212
If you had known I had forgotten to ask,

472
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:45,783
you would've been disappointed.

473
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:47,452
I see.

474
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:50,491
Still, it's wrong to lie,

475
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:54,093
so be honest with me in any case from now on.

476
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:55,492
Sure.

477
00:30:57,093 --> 00:31:00,133
But I really wasn't lying about her being busy.

478
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:02,302
Things are hectic since she'll soon fly abroad.

479
00:31:02,303 --> 00:31:05,133
Yes, I know. She told me about it.

480
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:13,912
What else did you and Eka talk about?

481
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:17,152
Your relationship with Ha Neul.

482
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:19,951
- What? - Why are you startled?

483
00:31:19,952 --> 00:31:21,583
Your sister should know.

484
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:24,722
I didn't want to worry someone who was going abroad,

485
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:26,293
so I kept it from her.

486
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:30,793
But come to think of it, you're absolutely right.

487
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,363
I should've told my sister sooner.

488
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:36,472
When you see her, you should apologize.

489
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:38,373
Sure, Grandmother.

490
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:42,343
What did she say about it?

491
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:45,982
Right. She wanted to see Ha Neul,

492
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,742
so I gave her Tae Kyung's address.

493
00:31:48,383 --> 00:31:49,412
What?

494
00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:56,553
May I ask what brought you by?

495
00:31:57,152 --> 00:31:59,462
I was surprised to receive your call.

496
00:32:00,662 --> 00:32:03,563
All this time, I knew nothing about it.

497
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:05,333
I'm sorry, Yeon Doo.

498
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:07,232
What?

499
00:32:07,462 --> 00:32:11,303
I heard about Jun Ha and Tae Kyung just today.

500
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:15,773
I only found out today that Jun Ha is...

501
00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:17,212
Ha Neul's biological father.

502
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:20,883
Are you here on Kim Jun Ha's behalf?

503
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,783
Please don't take this the wrong way.

504
00:32:22,912 --> 00:32:24,613
Jun Ha isn't the one who told me.

505
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:28,652
Grandmother told me. The shock was too great,

506
00:32:29,353 --> 00:32:31,293
and I came by because I couldn't turn a blind eye.

507
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:34,722
I'm also curious about...

508
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:37,162
your plans for Ha Neul.

509
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:41,263
Jun Ha went behind my back...

510
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:43,932
and registered Ha Neul as his daughter,

511
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:45,573
naming her Kim Ha Neul.

512
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:49,113
However, her surname was Oh, just like mine.

513
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:53,212
Also, Tae Kyung is the one who named her Ha Neul.

514
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:58,383
I have no intention of raising this child with Jun Ha.

515
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:01,183
I want to raise her with Tae Kyung.

516
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,792
You don't want Jun Ha in your life,

517
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:08,493
but he's being selfish and greedy.

518
00:33:09,993 --> 00:33:10,993
That's right.

519
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:14,402
It must be hard for you to be stuck in the middle.

520
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:17,672
The ordeal has been uncomfortable for Grandmother and the family,

521
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:20,143
which is why Tae Kyung made a big decision.

522
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,042
He's going to be removed from the family register,

523
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:24,573
and we'll be emigrating.

524
00:33:25,312 --> 00:33:26,442
Removed from the family register?

525
00:33:56,772 --> 00:33:58,442
If you have anything to say, just say it.

526
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:00,212
I'm busy as is.

527
00:34:01,712 --> 00:34:04,053
Why did you show up at Grandmother's house...

528
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:06,482
when you were adamant about not coming?

529
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:10,852
Did you do so to get Ha Neul back...

530
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:12,962
after finding out she was Mr. Gong's grandmother?

531
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:15,022
I thought grandmother told you everything.

532
00:34:15,993 --> 00:34:17,133
Why do you ask when you know the answer?

533
00:34:17,393 --> 00:34:19,703
Mr. Gong and Ms. Oh...

534
00:34:20,462 --> 00:34:21,732
are leaving the country.

535
00:34:22,772 --> 00:34:23,772
What?

536
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:26,902
Mr. Gong is willing to be taken off his family register for this.

537
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:28,643
That's how serious they are.

538
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:31,712
Ha Neul...

539
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:34,482
Couldn't you give up on her?

540
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,113
Why should I have my child taken away from me?

541
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:40,582
Why are you telling me to give up on my child...

542
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:42,183
without hearing me out?

543
00:34:42,953 --> 00:34:44,723
- Jun Ha... - Why?

544
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:47,093
Because I'm not related to them by blood?

545
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:53,562
So you know!

546
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:55,133
"So you know?"

547
00:34:56,772 --> 00:34:58,402
I can't believe you knew about this.

548
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:02,372
You knew everything.

549
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:07,812
How can this be?

550
00:35:08,712 --> 00:35:10,453
How did I end up as your brother?

551
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,082
When you were a baby,

552
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,453
Mom and Dad adopted you.

553
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:20,823
I was adopted?

554
00:35:27,402 --> 00:35:28,703
Why didn't you tell me?

555
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:31,872
I found out yesterday, and I...

556
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:34,042
Why didn't you ever tell me?

557
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,542
Why did this never come up?

558
00:35:36,712 --> 00:35:38,272
Because it wasn't important.

559
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:41,613
- What? - How we met...

560
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:43,582
was never important to us.

561
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:46,283
Mom, Dad, you, and me.

562
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:47,953
We were a family,

563
00:35:48,223 --> 00:35:49,692
and you were my brother.

564
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:52,722
We ate, slept, cried, and laughed together.

565
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:54,122
We got into arguments and then reconciled.

566
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:56,692
That's how we were.

567
00:35:56,832 --> 00:35:57,893
Are you sure?

568
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:01,232
Are you certain...

569
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,402
that I'm your brother?

570
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:07,102
Then, this won't be an issue.

571
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:09,441
I may not be related to you by blood,

572
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:11,013
but I'm still Mom's son.

573
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:12,783
So I'm Grandmother's grandson.

574
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:16,352
- Jun Ha... - I'm going to be her grandson.

575
00:36:16,812 --> 00:36:19,422
I'll push Tae Kyung out and get Ha Neul back.

576
00:36:19,522 --> 00:36:21,122
Please don't do this, Jun Ha.

577
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:24,122
Let's not lie to the family...

578
00:36:24,352 --> 00:36:26,022
and tear them apart.

579
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:29,093
I only introduced you to them,

580
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:32,462
hoping that you'll finally feel the love a family can provide.

581
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:34,663
But I should've given it more thought.

582
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:38,102
So come with me and tell them the truth.

583
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:39,243
No.

584
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:40,941
I won't get Ha Neul back...

585
00:36:40,942 --> 00:36:42,303
if they find out I'm not blood-related.

586
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:43,843
All I need is for you...

587
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:45,942
to keep your mouth shut.

588
00:36:46,712 --> 00:36:49,152
- What? - If I'm truly your brother,

589
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:51,582
you'll turn a blind eye.

590
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,452
Because you're my brother,

591
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:55,993
I can't look the other way.

592
00:36:57,192 --> 00:36:58,622
If you don't tell them,

593
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:01,062
I'll tell them myself.

594
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:03,633
Go ahead...

595
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:05,902
if you wish to see how far I'll go.

596
00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:10,303
Jun Ha.

597
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:23,413
As if that would waver me.

598
00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:25,383
I won't back off.

599
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:27,582
I will see the end of it.

600
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:33,163
Father,

601
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:35,493
Mr. Kim came to see Grandma again.

602
00:37:35,893 --> 00:37:36,932
He's trying to use her...

603
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:39,093
to drive Tae Kyung out of the family.

604
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:42,573
What if he wants to be on the family register himself?

605
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:45,602
I had enough, darn it.

606
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:48,501
I told you they were in a meeting.

607
00:37:48,502 --> 00:37:49,942
This is hardly appropriate.

608
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,513
I'm the chairman's nephew.

609
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:53,812
Mr. Gong and Ms. Gong's cousin.

610
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:56,113
- Sorry? - You may leave us.

611
00:37:56,712 --> 00:37:57,752
Sure.

612
00:38:01,852 --> 00:38:03,122
I apologize for the commotion.

613
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:05,453
It's just that I had something to say.

614
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:07,962
Go ahead, Mr. Kim.

615
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:09,792
Let me...

616
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:11,863
take Ha Neul.

617
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:14,502
What?

618
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:17,002
Look at you showing your true colours.

619
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:19,872
If you don't give Ha Neul to me, I'll register myself...

620
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:21,973
as Grandmother's grandson.

621
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:24,812
I'll submit to a DNA test if necessary.

622
00:38:25,113 --> 00:38:27,843
See? What did I tell you, Father?

623
00:38:29,982 --> 00:38:30,982
So?

624
00:38:31,383 --> 00:38:33,852
If you don't want me as your nephew,

625
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:35,783
give Ha Neul to me.

626
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,593
I'll stay away from the family...

627
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:40,421
and live quietly.

628
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:41,461
Mr. Kim!

629
00:38:41,462 --> 00:38:43,893
You won't have to remove Tae Kyung from the family register,

630
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:45,792
which benefits the family.

631
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:49,062
How can I be sure...

632
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:51,073
that you'll never show yourself?

633
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:53,502
I'll sign any document you want.

634
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:55,843
I mean it.

635
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:57,772
So let me know as soon as possible.

636
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:04,311
We can't give Ha Neul to him...

637
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:05,682
nor remove Tae Kyung from the family register.

638
00:39:05,683 --> 00:39:06,683
This is crazy.

639
00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:08,582
What do we do, Father?

640
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:16,197
(Old School)

641
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:20,402
The baby that Bong Nim brought to school the other day.

642
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:22,973
Who did she say the father was?

643
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:24,902
You saw her son-in-law.

644
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:28,372
The gynaecologist whom we saw working at the restaurant.

645
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:31,281
No, the fool who dragged us...

646
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:33,642
to the police station is the baby's dad.

647
00:39:33,643 --> 00:39:37,822
He even showed us a document saying the baby was his.

648
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:40,882
The headmaster's here.

649
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:44,991
Mr. Jang.

650
00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:49,032
Do you know who the dad of Bong Nim's granddaughter is?

651
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,901
Is it the gynaecologist...

652
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:53,802
or the police station jerk?

653
00:39:54,163 --> 00:39:58,302
Stop gossiping about others and go home.

654
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:05,242
(Teachers' Office)

655
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:07,282
Does he not know either?

656
00:40:08,012 --> 00:40:09,282
I don't know.

657
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:11,623
- Let's finish the cleaning. - Okay.

658
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:38,682
(Contacts)

659
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,342
(My Daughter)

660
00:40:46,983 --> 00:40:49,793
The call cannot be connected.

661
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:53,361
(Contacts)

662
00:40:53,362 --> 00:40:54,362
(Wife)

663
00:40:57,902 --> 00:40:58,933
Honey.

664
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:01,502
Is Se Jin back home yet?

665
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,732
No.

666
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:03,932
She asked me to bring her stuff to her hotel,

667
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:06,203
so I'll go see her in a bit.

668
00:41:06,543 --> 00:41:08,711
She won't come home?

669
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:11,483
She might if we tell her you're not well.

670
00:41:11,842 --> 00:41:13,011
Should I?

671
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,913
No, forget it. I have to go.

672
00:41:26,223 --> 00:41:28,132
(Studying abroad)

673
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:36,203
Judging by your looks, I guess the test results are right.

674
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:38,203
My sister knew all along.

675
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:41,313
So did Mom and Dad.

676
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:43,712
They lied to me my whole life.

677
00:41:44,643 --> 00:41:45,942
What'll you do now?

678
00:41:46,442 --> 00:41:48,413
You're not Ms. Eun's grandson.

679
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:50,683
How am I not?

680
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:53,953
I am and will continue to be Eun Geum Sil's grandson...

681
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:55,322
and the chairman's nephew.

682
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:56,953
What?

683
00:41:58,523 --> 00:42:01,292
Are you going to continue deceiving the whole family?

684
00:42:01,293 --> 00:42:02,691
What's with you?

685
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:04,761
You wanted to get back at them.

686
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:06,632
You wanted to harass Tae Kyung.

687
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:12,773
Are you happy things are...

688
00:42:13,773 --> 00:42:14,873
going your way?

689
00:42:18,712 --> 00:42:20,382
You can do whatever you want.

690
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:23,552
I don't care about them anymore.

691
00:42:23,913 --> 00:42:25,421
What got into you?

692
00:42:25,422 --> 00:42:27,652
They're suffering enough already.

693
00:42:28,322 --> 00:42:29,623
Seeing that...

694
00:42:30,023 --> 00:42:33,393
made me feel uncomfortable, not exhilarated.

695
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:36,663
I'll get on with my own life now.

696
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:41,433
So don't call me again to talk about them.

697
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:45,643
I'll take your calls if you need a friend.

698
00:42:50,043 --> 00:42:51,682
What are you doing?

699
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:52,813
"Studying abroad?"

700
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:55,913
You'll back out now?

701
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,683
I want to start over.

702
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:01,692
Where no one knows me.

703
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:05,163
Fine. Do whatever you want.

704
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:15,833
Se Jin.

705
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:33,253
Why follow me when you could just give me my stuff?

706
00:43:35,453 --> 00:43:36,523
What is it?

707
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:39,563
Jun Ha and I aren't seeing each other.

708
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,793
Okay, fine.

709
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:44,663
It is what you say it is.

710
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:48,873
Here's some royal tteokbokki. You loved it as a kid.

711
00:43:49,203 --> 00:43:50,932
I'm not sure if you still do,

712
00:43:50,933 --> 00:43:52,103
but eat it before it gets cold.

713
00:43:57,942 --> 00:43:59,083
I'll be back.

714
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:45,622
Your father donates to us every year.

715
00:44:45,623 --> 00:44:47,262
We're always grateful.

716
00:44:47,422 --> 00:44:49,532
You do all the good work.

717
00:44:50,092 --> 00:44:52,461
About the thing I asked...

718
00:44:52,462 --> 00:44:54,671
I had someone look into it.

719
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:57,503
The boy's mother is yet to pay a year's worth of medical bills.

720
00:44:58,302 --> 00:44:59,841
If you don't mind me asking,

721
00:44:59,842 --> 00:45:03,143
can you tell me how you know the patient?

722
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:05,441
We met while I was volunteering.

723
00:45:05,442 --> 00:45:07,612
I want to help him in any way I can.

724
00:45:07,782 --> 00:45:09,511
It's my wife's personal endeavour,

725
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:12,782
but our company's interested in supporting the disadvantaged.

726
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,692
I'd like to get involved if there's a good program.

727
00:45:16,652 --> 00:45:17,921
Very well, then.

728
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:19,723
You're a lovely model couple.

729
00:45:23,063 --> 00:45:25,933
It's not that much, and they couldn't pay it in over a year.

730
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:28,632
Hong Jun's family must be really poor.

731
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:31,032
To some, it's a large amount.

732
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:34,603
Soo Jung, I must rush. I have a meeting.

733
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:36,313
Have fun with Hong Jun.

734
00:45:36,413 --> 00:45:38,242
Okay, you go ahead.

735
00:45:38,712 --> 00:45:39,842
Bye.

736
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:49,452
(Registration, Payment)

737
00:45:49,453 --> 00:45:50,821
Hello.

738
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:51,822
Hey.

739
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:54,692
You don't have any volunteer work today.

740
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:56,962
I need a favour.

741
00:45:57,192 --> 00:45:59,662
Could you pass my number...

742
00:45:59,663 --> 00:46:01,973
to Im Hong Jun's guardian?

743
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:04,503
Can I ask why?

744
00:46:04,773 --> 00:46:07,442
I have something to tell them about Hong Jun.

745
00:46:07,802 --> 00:46:09,972
If they don't mind, I'd like to...

746
00:46:09,973 --> 00:46:12,782
discuss the bills that are in arrears.

747
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:16,382
I'll call Hong Jun's mother.

748
00:46:17,012 --> 00:46:18,012
Okay.

749
00:46:18,223 --> 00:46:19,322
Ma'am.

750
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,991
I was about to come and see you.

751
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:26,722
Are you in a better mood today?

752
00:46:26,723 --> 00:46:28,962
Yes, because I saw you.

753
00:46:29,462 --> 00:46:32,433
That's good to hear. I missed you too.

754
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:36,373
Hey, Mom.

755
00:46:49,282 --> 00:46:52,782
Are you really Hong Jun's mom?

756
00:46:54,382 --> 00:46:57,953
Yes. But how do you...

757
00:46:58,393 --> 00:47:00,723
know my son?

758
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,893
We met while I was volunteering.

759
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:07,203
The nurses told me...

760
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:10,103
someone was looking after Hong Jun.

761
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:12,802
I didn't know that it was you.

762
00:47:13,543 --> 00:47:15,143
It's such a coincidence.

763
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:18,913
Anyway,

764
00:47:19,413 --> 00:47:22,413
thank you for looking out for my son.

765
00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:30,422
Then let's say you have a son,

766
00:47:30,992 --> 00:47:32,692
and he's seriously ill.

767
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:36,592
If you had to do something bad for your son, would you do it?

768
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:43,233
Hong Jun's a lovely boy.

769
00:47:43,672 --> 00:47:44,672
Yes.

770
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:48,942
He means everything to me.

771
00:47:49,712 --> 00:47:52,043
He was a test tube baby,

772
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:56,051
but my husband left us as soon as he was born.

773
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:57,453
I raised him on my own.

774
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:00,152
I did as best I could,

775
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:01,821
but to him...

776
00:48:01,822 --> 00:48:04,962
He knows you tried to con us, doesn't he?

777
00:48:05,962 --> 00:48:06,962
What?

778
00:48:07,962 --> 00:48:09,761
How do you know that?

779
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,603
How could you break that sweet boy's heart?

780
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:15,873
Why should he get hurt because of the bad things his mom did?

781
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:18,901
What do you mean?

782
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:22,512
Hong Jun asked me to be his mom.

783
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:25,111
"His mom?"

784
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:28,483
He thought he was the reason you did bad things,

785
00:48:29,012 --> 00:48:32,183
and he cried, asking me to be his mom.

786
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:34,023
So...

787
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,552
straighten yourself out, for your kid's sake.

788
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:39,692
I have to go.

789
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:36,212
(Mother-in-law)

790
00:49:39,853 --> 00:49:40,953
Hello, Mother.

791
00:49:41,953 --> 00:49:43,253
I have something to discuss with you.

792
00:49:43,822 --> 00:49:44,992
Where are you?

793
00:49:45,623 --> 00:49:47,023
What are you talking about?

794
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:49,032
What do you mean you're getting disowned?

795
00:49:49,893 --> 00:49:51,262
Do you mean...

796
00:49:51,563 --> 00:49:53,663
you won't be a part of that family anymore?

797
00:49:54,302 --> 00:49:57,203
Yes. Yeon Doo and I agreed to move forward with it.

798
00:49:57,773 --> 00:49:59,941
It'll take some time to process,

799
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:01,603
and there's a chance the paperwork might get rejected,

800
00:50:01,942 --> 00:50:03,342
but I must make it happen.

801
00:50:04,473 --> 00:50:06,143
What do your parents say?

802
00:50:06,413 --> 00:50:08,853
My mother approved, and so did my father.

803
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:13,052
What? What are they thinking?

804
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:15,753
This is all because of Jun Ha, isn't it?

805
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:18,461
It's because he's trying to steal Ha Neul,

806
00:50:18,462 --> 00:50:19,922
saying he's the grandson of your grandmother.

807
00:50:20,623 --> 00:50:22,262
That's not the only reason.

808
00:50:22,762 --> 00:50:25,602
I would like to live carefree away from Korea.

809
00:50:25,603 --> 00:50:27,401
Stop talking nonsense!

810
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:29,432
Mother! Where are you going?

811
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:31,873
Bong Nim, calm down!

812
00:50:31,973 --> 00:50:33,042
Let go.

813
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:35,072
I must go see Tae Kyung's parents and stop them.

814
00:50:35,273 --> 00:50:36,571
I have to tell your grandmother...

815
00:50:36,572 --> 00:50:39,142
not to remove you from the family register.

816
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:40,143
Move!

817
00:50:40,313 --> 00:50:41,782
Please don't go.

818
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:44,652
It wasn't easy for my parents to make that decision.

819
00:50:44,913 --> 00:50:46,151
If I don't go,

820
00:50:46,152 --> 00:50:48,792
I'll have to watch you get torn apart from your family.

821
00:50:48,793 --> 00:50:50,321
I can't do that.

822
00:50:50,322 --> 00:50:51,861
I can't allow you to ruin your life...

823
00:50:51,862 --> 00:50:54,122
for the happiness of my daughter.

824
00:50:54,123 --> 00:50:55,293
Mother!

825
00:50:58,563 --> 00:51:02,103
You're only making it hard on me by doing this.

826
00:51:03,632 --> 00:51:04,632
I don't have the energy...

827
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:08,773
to persuade you any longer.

828
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:10,942
Could you just trust us...

829
00:51:11,742 --> 00:51:13,043
and give us the permission?

830
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:15,413
Won't you tell us it's a good decision...

831
00:51:16,012 --> 00:51:17,552
and let it go?

832
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:19,882
Tae Kyung...

833
00:51:20,353 --> 00:51:21,453
Gosh.

834
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:24,052
Gosh, Tae Kyung.

835
00:51:24,822 --> 00:51:26,921
I'm so sorry. I really am.

836
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:29,833
Tae Kyung, I'm so sorry...

837
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:34,362
I'm so sorry, Tae Kyung. I'm sorry...

838
00:51:37,203 --> 00:51:40,372
- You poor thing. - How can this happen?

839
00:51:40,373 --> 00:51:41,742
My goodness.

840
00:51:42,672 --> 00:51:44,813
Gosh...

841
00:52:24,012 --> 00:52:26,353
You should drink a lot today.

842
00:52:26,453 --> 00:52:27,623
Have your fill.

843
00:52:28,592 --> 00:52:29,893
I will.

844
00:52:34,092 --> 00:52:37,462
It's hard to find people like you these days.

845
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:40,102
If Ha Neul ever fails to understand you,

846
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:42,132
let me know. I'll give her an earful.

847
00:52:48,913 --> 00:52:52,183
It's given children will never understand their parents.

848
00:52:52,413 --> 00:52:54,112
I was the same.

849
00:52:55,983 --> 00:52:58,982
Please visit us when we're in Canada.

850
00:52:58,983 --> 00:53:00,953
Of course, I will.

851
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:04,223
Our family will visit every year.

852
00:53:04,992 --> 00:53:06,822
No. Every season.

853
00:53:07,563 --> 00:53:09,333
You'll beg us to stop visiting.

854
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:14,531
We'll put you up and feed you too.

855
00:53:14,532 --> 00:53:15,833
Please make sure you visit us.

856
00:53:24,712 --> 00:53:26,882
Hey, Uncle Dae Sang.

857
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:28,652
What is it?

858
00:53:29,183 --> 00:53:33,282
Do you know what I envied the most about Yeon Doo?

859
00:53:34,723 --> 00:53:35,822
What was it?

860
00:53:36,253 --> 00:53:39,862
Having family members like you and her mother.

861
00:53:40,862 --> 00:53:42,893
I always considered myself alone,

862
00:53:42,992 --> 00:53:44,592
so I never envied anyone.

863
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:47,862
But whenever I saw Yeon Doo and her family,

864
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:51,072
I always got jealous.

865
00:53:51,703 --> 00:53:53,043
I see.

866
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:55,342
But you're our family now.

867
00:53:56,242 --> 00:53:59,012
Yes. That's the best part.

868
00:53:59,842 --> 00:54:03,212
Starting today, I'm not on her side. I'm on your side.

869
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:05,552
- Got it? - Uncle Dae Sang...

870
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:08,023
I got it.

871
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:12,192
Gosh.

872
00:54:12,523 --> 00:54:14,063
My family was only beginning...

873
00:54:15,262 --> 00:54:17,233
to feel like one too.

874
00:54:18,703 --> 00:54:19,862
Tae Kyung.

875
00:54:21,032 --> 00:54:23,603
Uncle Dae Sang, I better get going.

876
00:54:23,703 --> 00:54:26,941
You're drunk. I'll take you home.

877
00:54:26,942 --> 00:54:30,242
No. There's a place I want to go.

878
00:54:31,373 --> 00:54:32,413
Uncle Dae Sang,

879
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:34,543
I'll see you again soon.

880
00:54:38,052 --> 00:54:39,052
Gosh.

881
00:54:43,893 --> 00:54:46,123
Is he drunk or sober?

882
00:54:53,362 --> 00:54:54,402
Hee?

883
00:54:57,632 --> 00:54:58,672
Hee.

884
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:01,043
What is it? Did something happen?

885
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:04,172
Dae Sang, I think I'm getting punished...

886
00:55:04,672 --> 00:55:06,813
for my sins.

887
00:55:07,382 --> 00:55:09,012
I hurt you,

888
00:55:09,212 --> 00:55:10,913
Soo Jung and Chun Myung too.

889
00:55:11,813 --> 00:55:13,452
That's why Hong Jun...

890
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:16,422
What do you mean? I don't understand.

891
00:55:18,422 --> 00:55:21,992
Soo Jung was volunteering at the hospital...

892
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:24,563
when she met Hong Jun.

893
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:25,902
What?

894
00:55:26,632 --> 00:55:28,462
How...

895
00:55:29,103 --> 00:55:32,103
Hong Jun asked Soo Jung...

896
00:55:33,603 --> 00:55:35,572
to become his mom.

897
00:55:35,813 --> 00:55:38,413
What? What did he ask?

898
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:40,382
To become his mom.

899
00:55:41,183 --> 00:55:42,212
"Mom?"

900
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:43,882
Hong Jun must hate...

901
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:48,083
an incompetent and difficult mom like me.

902
00:55:48,623 --> 00:55:50,853
He must want a mom like Soo Jung.

903
00:55:51,523 --> 00:55:53,462
I should ask,

904
00:55:53,663 --> 00:55:55,862
but I'm too scared to ask.

905
00:55:56,762 --> 00:55:58,862
What do I do if he really does say he hates me?

906
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:02,032
All I have is Hong Jun.

907
00:56:19,983 --> 00:56:21,822
I'm home, Grandmother!

908
00:56:23,523 --> 00:56:24,893
Grandmother!

909
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:29,733
What?

910
00:56:30,092 --> 00:56:31,393
Grandmother!

911
00:56:32,163 --> 00:56:35,003
What? What is that sound?

912
00:56:35,402 --> 00:56:37,532
Is that Tae Kyung?

913
00:56:41,473 --> 00:56:44,071
Why did you drink so much?

914
00:56:44,072 --> 00:56:45,412
You can hardly stand up...

915
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:47,182
No, I'm not drunk.

916
00:56:47,183 --> 00:56:48,711
- Hey, your slippers. - Hey.

917
00:56:48,712 --> 00:56:50,452
- I don't want it. - Hey.

918
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:52,353
My goodness. Grandmother is here.

919
00:56:53,822 --> 00:56:55,492
Mom, I'm home.

920
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:57,123
Father.

921
00:56:58,453 --> 00:56:59,563
I'm here.

922
00:57:00,822 --> 00:57:02,992
Grandmother!

923
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:05,801
- What? Why is she... - Tae Kyung.

924
00:57:05,802 --> 00:57:07,302
Keep it down, will you?

925
00:57:07,862 --> 00:57:10,103
Hyun Woo.

926
00:57:10,373 --> 00:57:12,172
I love you.

927
00:57:12,373 --> 00:57:14,442
- I love you, Hyun Woo. - Tae Kyung!

928
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:16,741
- What is it? - What's with you?

929
00:57:16,742 --> 00:57:18,442
- Come to your senses. - Hey.

930
00:57:18,612 --> 00:57:20,542
- Don't come to me. - Gosh.

931
00:57:20,543 --> 00:57:22,511
- I said get off me! - Stop it.

932
00:57:22,512 --> 00:57:23,752
- Why are you trying to hug me? - Come on.

933
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:25,152
I don't want to be hugged!

934
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:27,651
- Ji Myung. - Gosh! What are you doing?

935
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,551
- I love you, Ji Myung. - Move away.

936
00:57:29,552 --> 00:57:30,892
- Why? - What's with you?

937
00:57:30,893 --> 00:57:32,321
I love you, Tae Kyung.

938
00:57:32,322 --> 00:57:35,393
Yu Myung. Thank you. I love you too.

939
00:57:36,992 --> 00:57:38,163
Father.

940
00:57:38,762 --> 00:57:40,233
Will you give me a drink?

941
00:57:40,563 --> 00:57:42,973
The strongest and the most expensive one you have.

942
00:57:49,373 --> 00:57:50,413
Gosh.

943
00:57:51,112 --> 00:57:52,413
My goodness...

944
00:57:54,212 --> 00:57:55,612
Gosh.

945
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:00,652
Mom.

946
00:58:01,282 --> 00:58:02,322
Father.

947
00:58:02,853 --> 00:58:06,592
I'm going to emigrate to Canada with Yeon Doo.

948
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,532
I spoke to my mother-in-law already.

949
00:58:10,293 --> 00:58:11,792
When I get there,

950
00:58:11,793 --> 00:58:14,902
I'll send you a lot of delicious ice wine.

951
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:18,632
All right. You should go to bed now.

952
00:58:19,543 --> 00:58:20,773
No.

953
00:58:21,342 --> 00:58:24,773
I need to take in the faces of my family tonight.

954
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,143
What's with you?

955
00:58:28,313 --> 00:58:31,051
Will we not get to see you and Yeon Doo anymore?

956
00:58:31,052 --> 00:58:33,083
Of course, you will.

957
00:58:33,353 --> 00:58:36,393
You'll see us when Ha Neul is all grown up.

958
00:58:37,492 --> 00:58:38,991
You should tell me you love me...

959
00:58:38,992 --> 00:58:40,492
before she grows up.

960
00:58:41,262 --> 00:58:42,591
I'm so sleepy.

961
00:58:42,592 --> 00:58:44,393
- I should sleep. - Sleep? Where are you going?

962
00:58:44,893 --> 00:58:47,762
Where are you going? You should tell me you love me.

963
00:58:58,112 --> 00:58:59,382
Grandmother.

964
00:59:00,742 --> 00:59:02,551
- Gosh. - Grandmother.

965
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:06,483
What's with you?

966
00:59:06,683 --> 00:59:08,822
I want to sleep with you tonight.

967
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:10,052
What?

968
00:59:10,692 --> 00:59:13,192
I'm going to sleep here with you.

969
00:59:14,322 --> 00:59:16,531
You better go home. Yeon Doo must be waiting for you.

970
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:17,991
No.

971
00:59:17,992 --> 00:59:21,162
I have no energy to go home. I'll just stay here like this.

972
00:59:21,163 --> 00:59:24,672
My goodness.

973
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:26,042
- Gosh. - Tae Kyung.

974
00:59:26,043 --> 00:59:28,171
I'm sorry, Mother. He's absolutely wasted.

975
00:59:28,172 --> 00:59:29,312
- Hey. - Don't just stand there.

976
00:59:29,313 --> 00:59:30,841
- Let's go. - Tae Kyung.

977
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:32,342
Let go of me!

978
00:59:32,942 --> 00:59:35,382
This is where I'm sleeping today.

979
00:59:36,813 --> 00:59:38,182
For the first and last time,

980
00:59:38,183 --> 00:59:40,623
I'm staying with Grandma for the night.

981
00:59:43,552 --> 00:59:46,392
Sure. Just leave him be.

982
00:59:46,393 --> 00:59:47,462
What?

983
00:59:48,262 --> 00:59:50,632
Let him sleep here.

984
01:00:02,873 --> 01:00:04,273
Gosh.

985
01:00:05,273 --> 01:00:08,082
Thanks for this. You can both go to bed now.

986
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:09,152
Sure.

987
01:00:09,712 --> 01:00:11,813
But I'm going to have him say he loves me before he leaves.

988
01:00:13,023 --> 01:00:14,623
- Good night, Mother. - Right.

989
01:00:15,223 --> 01:00:17,623
That's some drinking habit.

990
01:00:49,992 --> 01:00:51,092
Tae Kyung.

991
01:00:51,253 --> 01:00:53,023
It's me, your Grandmother-in-law.

992
01:00:53,663 --> 01:00:55,192
Gosh, Grandmother.

993
01:00:55,663 --> 01:00:57,761
Tae Kyung's drunk and is in my room.

994
01:00:57,762 --> 01:00:59,163
I'll let him sleep here for the night.

995
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,762
Okay.

996
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:05,603
Is this taking a huge toll on him?

997
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:14,043
I'll hang up, then.

998
01:01:51,612 --> 01:01:52,782
Grandmother.

999
01:01:55,552 --> 01:01:57,623
I don't want to leave.

1000
01:01:59,922 --> 01:02:02,692
I want to stay, Grandmother.

1001
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,163
Grandmother.

1002
01:02:21,882 --> 01:02:23,152
Gosh.

1003
01:02:51,612 --> 01:02:52,612
What...

1004
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:54,583
Where am I?

1005
01:02:56,953 --> 01:02:57,953
Is this Grandmother's room?

1006
01:02:58,652 --> 01:03:00,022
You can hardly stand up...

1007
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:01,722
No, I'm not drunk.

1008
01:03:01,723 --> 01:03:03,292
- Hey, your slippers. - Hey.

1009
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:04,591
- I don't want it. - Hey.

1010
01:03:04,592 --> 01:03:07,023
I love you, Hyun Woo.

1011
01:03:07,123 --> 01:03:09,433
- Don't come to me. - Gosh.

1012
01:03:09,992 --> 01:03:11,662
- Ji Myung. - Gosh! What are you doing?

1013
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:13,162
Let go of me!

1014
01:03:13,163 --> 01:03:15,603
This is where I'm sleeping today.

1015
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:17,401
For the first and last time,

1016
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:19,802
I'm staying with Grandma for the night.

1017
01:03:25,572 --> 01:03:27,913
Tae Kyung, it's about time you got up.

1018
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:31,913
Darn it.

1019
01:03:33,322 --> 01:03:34,882
Unbelievable.

1020
01:03:35,822 --> 01:03:36,953
My gosh.

1021
01:03:40,092 --> 01:03:42,191
Yeon Doo, why are you here?

1022
01:03:42,192 --> 01:03:44,433
I called her over to tell her something.

1023
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:46,302
How's the hangover?

1024
01:03:46,663 --> 01:03:48,301
I bet he's still hungover.

1025
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:50,671
He was drunk to the point...

1026
01:03:50,672 --> 01:03:52,802
where he claimed his love for everyone.

1027
01:03:53,342 --> 01:03:55,912
That's enough, guys. I'm embarrassed as is.

1028
01:03:55,913 --> 01:03:57,511
Keep at it, guys.

1029
01:03:57,512 --> 01:03:59,842
Bad drinking habits should get kicked out of one's system.

1030
01:04:00,413 --> 01:04:01,983
Yeon Doo, please don't.

1031
01:04:03,183 --> 01:04:05,512
By the way, where's Grandmother?

1032
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:07,983
She left early this morning with the driver.

1033
01:04:18,663 --> 01:04:20,103
Grandmother.

1034
01:04:21,362 --> 01:04:23,473
I don't want to leave.

1035
01:04:24,672 --> 01:04:27,672
I want to stay, Grandmother.

1036
01:04:32,983 --> 01:04:33,983
Mr. Kim.

1037
01:04:35,043 --> 01:04:36,953
Take me there.

1038
01:04:37,152 --> 01:04:38,313
Yes, Ms. Eun.

1039
01:04:51,063 --> 01:04:52,961
My passport isn't here.

1040
01:04:52,962 --> 01:04:55,301
How could you not pack what's most important?

1041
01:04:55,302 --> 01:04:56,671
That's odd.

1042
01:04:56,672 --> 01:04:58,973
I'm pretty sure I packed it.

1043
01:04:59,902 --> 01:05:02,302
It isn't here though. Look for it on your end.

1044
01:05:02,543 --> 01:05:05,172
I'm doing that, but I can't see it anywhere.

1045
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,882
Is Dad home?

1046
01:05:09,143 --> 01:05:11,313
He went out for a morning walk.

1047
01:05:12,882 --> 01:05:14,282
Stay put. I'm on my way.

1048
01:05:19,762 --> 01:05:22,262
Why are you suddenly looking for your passport?

1049
01:05:22,462 --> 01:05:24,063
Are you going abroad?

1050
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:29,873
What...

1051
01:05:46,353 --> 01:05:49,152
I told you to come home quickly. What took you so long?

1052
01:05:50,953 --> 01:05:53,192
Se Jin, for how much longer will you keep this up?

1053
01:05:53,322 --> 01:05:54,922
Stay for a meal with your dad.

1054
01:05:55,592 --> 01:05:56,592
I'm leaving.

1055
01:05:57,793 --> 01:05:59,433
I'll go out instead.

1056
01:06:01,733 --> 01:06:03,333
Stay and enjoy your mom's meal.

1057
01:06:03,603 --> 01:06:04,903
Forget it.

1058
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:06,342
Se Jin, please.

1059
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,982
My gosh. Honey!

1060
01:06:16,983 --> 01:06:18,082
Se Jin!

1061
01:06:18,212 --> 01:06:20,653
Honey, wake up!

1062
01:06:20,723 --> 01:06:23,591
Honey, what's happening?

1063
01:06:23,592 --> 01:06:25,522
Se Jin!

1064
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,363
Please wake up, honey.

1065
01:06:28,622 --> 01:06:32,462
Se Jin, call for an ambulance!

1066
01:06:32,903 --> 01:06:36,572
Honey, please.

1067
01:06:36,573 --> 01:06:38,332
Dad?

1068
01:06:38,403 --> 01:06:41,273
Why aren't you waking up?

1069
01:06:45,842 --> 01:06:46,842
Mom.

1070
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:48,943
Why didn't you tell me?

1071
01:06:54,853 --> 01:06:56,523
(Big sister)

1072
01:06:59,052 --> 01:07:01,091
(Contacts)

1073
01:07:01,092 --> 01:07:03,592
(Jang Se Jin)

1074
01:07:06,462 --> 01:07:08,132
I'll get on with my own life now.

1075
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:12,743
So don't call me again to talk about them.

1076
01:07:33,393 --> 01:07:36,893
Mother, what did you want to say that involved having Yeon Doo over?

1077
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:40,962
Your mother and I...

1078
01:07:42,002 --> 01:07:45,073
have agreed to remove Tae Kyung from the family register.

1079
01:07:51,712 --> 01:07:53,812
What on earth are you saying?

1080
01:07:53,813 --> 01:07:56,712
There's no going back if you approve of this.

1081
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:58,153
Mother,

1082
01:07:58,813 --> 01:08:00,122
are you sure about this?

1083
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:05,892
What are we supposed to do if you agree to this?

1084
01:08:05,893 --> 01:08:07,762
Could you possibly reconsider it one more time?

1085
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:11,192
It wasn't an easy decision for us,

1086
01:08:11,193 --> 01:08:12,693
so don't be too upset about it.

1087
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:15,162
Are you kidding me?

1088
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:25,172
Yeon Doo and I will raise Ha Neul well.

1089
01:08:26,613 --> 01:08:27,613
Thank you...

1090
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,952
for everything.

1091
01:08:55,143 --> 01:08:56,172
What do you think, Grandmother?

1092
01:08:56,943 --> 01:08:58,412
Isn't it a pretty room for Ha Neul?

1093
01:08:58,712 --> 01:09:00,541
Gosh, it is.

1094
01:09:00,542 --> 01:09:03,483
I see you went out of your way to decorate it nicely for her.

1095
01:09:08,252 --> 01:09:09,252
Jun Ha.

1096
01:09:09,853 --> 01:09:12,993
For some reason, I felt lonelier than usual today.

1097
01:09:13,993 --> 01:09:15,863
You're the one I wanted to see,

1098
01:09:16,493 --> 01:09:17,962
so it's odd that you actually came.

1099
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:20,733
Jun Ha.

1100
01:09:21,762 --> 01:09:22,832
Yes, Grandmother.

1101
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:28,603
Can't you...

1102
01:09:29,342 --> 01:09:31,872
give up on raising Ha Neul?

1103
01:10:12,882 --> 01:10:15,183
(The Real Has Come!)

1104
01:10:15,523 --> 01:10:17,792
I'm your one and only maternal grandson.

1105
01:10:18,223 --> 01:10:21,193
Tae Kyung may not be of my blood, but he's also my grandson.

1106
01:10:21,863 --> 01:10:23,792
If you adore that lady so much,

1107
01:10:23,993 --> 01:10:25,592
go and live with her instead.

1108
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:27,631
I may not be of huge help,

1109
01:10:27,632 --> 01:10:29,733
but I can make sure you never go hungry.

1110
01:10:30,073 --> 01:10:32,032
I'm sure it's nothing big.

1111
01:10:32,033 --> 01:10:33,302
Nothing's going to happen.

1112
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:37,342
I have something to tell you about my brother.

1113
01:10:37,573 --> 01:10:38,642
What?

1114
01:10:38,643 --> 01:10:39,683
Jun Ha...

1115
01:10:40,342 --> 01:10:42,483
Grandmother!
