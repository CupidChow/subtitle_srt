00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,430
Hello.

2
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:17,541
It's me, Kim Jun Ha.

3
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,740
You darn prick. How dare you show yourself here?

4
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:23,111
I'm here to collect what's mine.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,750
Your grandson took Yeon Doo and my baby from me.

6
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:29,980
You little rascal.

7
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,979
You told Yeon Doo to get an abortion.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,490
No one took anything from you.

9
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:35,519
Now, stay away from Yeon Doo!

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,620
Stay away from Ha Neul too.

11
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:38,890
What is this?

12
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:42,431
You deserve every beating you get! You deserve it.

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,170
- Darn rascal. - Grandmother?

14
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:48,600
Goodness.

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,700
Don't just stand there.

16
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,041
You should get involved if you witnessed an assault.

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,981
Are you overjoyed your grandma's on your side?

18
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,409
Are you an accomplice?

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,510
What?

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,780
What did you call my grandson?

21
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:04,149
What did you say to him?

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,650
You good-for-nothing fool.

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,050
Get out of my grandson's sight before I really turn nasty.

24
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:11,120
I'll crush every bone...

25
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,530
in your darn body if you don't get lost.

26
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,790
You darn scoundrel.

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,861
Keep this up and I won't let you off just because you're old.

28
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,429
I'll sue you.

29
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,600
Go ahead!

30
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,140
When you're my age,

31
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:25,099
nothing scares you. I'm fearless.

32
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,870
Calm down, Grandmother. Let's go upstairs.

33
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:28,009
Let go of me.

34
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,239
So that he can't hurt Yeon Doo or Ha Neul,

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,640
I must keep him down here.

36
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,580
- They're not at home. - What?

37
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,951
He can't hurt them, so don't worry.

38
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,621
Don't you dare mention Tae Kyung again.

39
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,489
If you do, I'll cut you in half.

40
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,420
You darn dirtbag.

41
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,891
Let's go, Grandmother.

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,871
How is she so strong?

43
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,341
Where did Yeon Doo take Ha Neul?

(Episode 41)

45
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,920
Are you all right?

46
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:12,950
Did you sprain your neck or shoulder?

47
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:14,151
No.

48
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:16,289
I will not die before my time,

49
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,760
so don't worry.

50
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,961
Why are you here this early?

51
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,531
Did you come to see Yeon Doo?

52
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,630
Grandmother.

53
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,341
I came to see you, not Yeon Doo.

54
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,371
To see me? Why?

55
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,880
Go on, Grandmother.

56
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,551
I came to apologize to you.

57
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:47,751
To apologize?

58
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,191
I was cruel to you...

59
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:55,931
because I missed my daughter.

60
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,301
I had no idea if my Strawberry were dead or alive,

61
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,669
or if she was living with another family...

62
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,070
that mistreated her.

63
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,270
So I couldn't stand seeing you...

64
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,570
enjoying all the luxuries in life.

65
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,781
That's why I gave you such a hard time.

66
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:18,051
Still, this is all just an excuse.

67
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,320
I blame it on my shortcomings and mean nature.

68
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,221
I'm all twisted.

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,330
So don't ever...

70
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:29,191
forgive your grandmother.

71
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
I came here...

72
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,471
to say that.

73
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:41,871
It's worse than asking me to forgive you.

74
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,640
What kind of an apology is that?

75
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,950
- What? - You hated me for ten years...

76
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,521
and now you tell me not to forgive you and that's it?

77
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,450
I resented you and cursed you out so much.

78
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,820
What about me? How do you think I felt?

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,061
- Tae Kyung. - Whether I forgive you or not...

80
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,390
is up to me.

81
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:05,130
How could you think of deciding that for me?

82
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:07,700
Why are you always like this?

83
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,770
I'm sorry, Tae Kyung.

84
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,611
It's done.

85
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,840
For all you did to mistreat me, you can make it up to Ha Neul.

86
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,911
Live a long time and make up for it.

87
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:24,051
Okay. I'll do that.

88
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:27,491
I'll make up for what I did before I die.

89
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,520
Good grief...

90
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,231
Grandmother.

91
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:40,030
Do you still want to find Strawberry?

92
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:44,501
She's my child.

93
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,510
She was my firstborn.

94
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,340
I want to find her.

95
00:04:58,051 --> 00:04:59,351
Get up, Grandmother.

96
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,191
Let's go find Strawberry.

Yes. I found this place when doing research...

after you told me about Strawberry.

If you go to the police and register your DNA,

they'll look for people who are a match.

106

How will registering my DNA...

107
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,060
help find Strawberry?

108
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:41,329
If she registers her DNA to find her family,

109
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,430
we'll hear from them.

110

No.

When I last tried to find Strawberry,

I heard a rumour that she was dead.

113

We're not sure she is.

What's wrong? You don't want to go?

No. I'm too nervous to go inside.

And then...

131
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,560
there's this letter I wrote to her.

132
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:49,860
My grandson's wife corrected the spelling for me,

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,720
Did she tell you that too?

172
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,651
Oh, no.

173
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,661
Having and raising a baby on my own...

174
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,830
made me think of you even more.

175
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,031
I'm so amazed and full of respect for you.

176
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:10,100
Whenever I saw Ha Neul, I thought of Tae Kyung,

177
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,570
and I cried.

178
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:17,710
I thought no one knew how I felt.

179
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:19,541
I found someone.

180
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:23,051
I guess that's why I was never able to...

181
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,021
hate you completely.

182
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,061
Hi, Tae Kyung.

183
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,730
Grandmother?

184
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,770
I was hoping to treat you to a nice meal.

185
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,470
Can't you stay?

186
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:46,670
Yeon Doo has to see my mother-in-law,

187
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,271
so I'll leave with her.

188
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,381
- You're meeting Ms. Eun? - Yes.

189
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,210
Tae Kyung called.

190
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:55,349
I'll take good care of Ha Neul. Don't worry.

191
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,949
Will you look after her for me?

192
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,950
Sure.

193
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:13,161
Wait.

194
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,271
What was that woman doing here?

195
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:26,609
What is it you want to ask me?

196
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,511
You told me to take the baby away.

197
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,580
What were you doing visiting Yeon Doo's family?

198
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,791
- What? - Hadn't you kicked her out?

199
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,360
I know why you're asking all this.

200
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:39,920
There's no point in lying,

201
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,860
so I'll tell the truth.

202
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:45,061
Our family has decided to...

203
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,070
accept Yeon Doo.

204
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,171
She had my baby.

205
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,671
And you want to take her in as your son's spouse?

206
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,640
As long as you generously accept it.

207
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,180
"Generously accept it?"

208
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,281
Please let...

209
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:05,151
Yeon Doo and Tae Kyung raise Ha Neul.

210
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,551
We will help them raise her well with all our hearts.

211
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,960
I can't understand your family.

212
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:18,000
You have no right to say that you'll raise her well.

213
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:21,131
Forget it. I'm not giving up on my daughter.

214
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,141
Go tell your son what I said.

215
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:36,249
My grandson is as good-looking as a fashion model.

216
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,920
Don't you have anything better than this?

217
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:41,620
Get him something elegant and more expensive.

218
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:45,619
Grandmother, I've tried on so many.

219
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,959
I said I didn't need new clothes.

220
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,160
Just keep trying them on.

221
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:49,630
I want to buy you a new suit.

222
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,830
Gosh, please...

223
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,160
Yeon Doo.

224
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:56,901
You must be happy that Grandmother buys you new clothes.

225
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,700
If I were you, I wouldn't mind trying them on.

226
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:03,941
Actually, I have something for you.

227
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:05,980
Bring it in.

228
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,661
That's pretty. Try it on.

229
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:28,630
- Grandmother. - Yes?

230
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:30,030
That's enough shopping for today.

231
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,940
He's right. I've got enough.

232
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:36,271
Gosh, I was having fun spending some money.

233
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,880
Fine.

234
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:40,651
Let's go eat something delicious then.

235
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,210
Come here.

236
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,949
I'll see you there. Okay?

237
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,391
Okay. I get it.

238
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,820
Yeon Doo, you take Grandmother and go on ahead.

239
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,520
- Give me that. - What?

240
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,521
Well...

241
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,391
Where are you going?

242
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm hungry. Let's go.

243
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:00,631
- Okay. - Let's go.

244
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,950
It must've been hard for you to keep changing clothes.

245
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:17,921
I'm just grateful that you were there to buy us things.

246
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:22,521
I don't think you ever got to enjoy a luxury like this.

247
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:25,619
You were just busy changing diapers...

248
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,560
and tiptoeing around both families...

249
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:30,031
in tears every day.

250
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,460
Thank you, Grandmother.

251
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:35,600
All right. Oh, dear.

252
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,940
I need to go to the restroom.

253
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:41,011
Don't follow me.

254
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,740
I don't want you to follow me.

255
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,161
What?

256
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,600
Thank you.

257
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:07,401
By the way, what's with all the flowers?

258
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:09,870
I'm running an errand for Grandmother.

259
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,709
Did she go somewhere?

260
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,710
She's in the ladies' room.

261
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,119
I'm going home.

262
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,290
I already paid for the meal.

263
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,819
You guys have fun.

264
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,360
What? Did Grandmother go home?

265
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,859
I think she left early so we can have a date.

266
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,931
Is she really the Grandmother I used to know?

267
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,901
I feel like she's a different person.

268
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,570
Grandmother apologized to me today.

269
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,339
She did?

270
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,080
For having been so mean to me because I'm not Father's son.

271
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,810
She said she couldn't take me in...

272
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:58,681
because she felt bad about losing her own daughter.

273
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,190
Before I got here,

274
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:06,521
I went to the police station and had her genes registered.

275
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:10,391
She's hoping to find Strawberry.

276
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:12,700
I see.

277
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,840
It's been quite a day, one way and another.

278
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:21,610
You've been through a lot, Yeon Doo.

279
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,141
You gave birth to the baby all alone...

280
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,281
and tried so hard to get permission to raise her with me.

281
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,651
It's you who've been through hard times.

282
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:34,390
You looked for me everywhere...

283
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,120
and forgave me even when you were upset.

284
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:38,720
And you took in Ha Neul.

285
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,691
We both endured a tough time.

286
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,830
I think so.

287
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:52,271
I still can't believe that we got permission from our families.

288
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,381
Let's go register our marriage tomorrow.

289
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,680
Tae Kyung.

290
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:03,209
We should register our marriage and wait a year...

291
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,921
for me to adopt Ha Neul.

292
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:07,790
I'll legally adopt Ha Neul...

293
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,291
after a year.

294
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:11,191
So she can live as my daughter.

295
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,500
Then we will become a real family.

296
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:23,330
A real family.

297
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:32,781
Hello, Hee.

298
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,350
I'm so glad to hear that. Congratulations, Yeon Doo.

299
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:42,490
Thank you.

300
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,360
So what's your plan now?

301
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,561
I'll come back to Seoul.

302
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,999
As soon as I leave the hospital tomorrow morning,

303
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,700
I'll go to Ilcheon and move out.

304
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,671
I'll send you the money once I get the deposit back.

305
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,769
Come on.

306
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,310
Why are you acting as if we won't see each other again?

307
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:05,381
I won't get to see you again.

308
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,310
What are you talking about?

309
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,381
Hee.

310
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,191
I once told you...

311
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:21,060
that I did something terrible because of Hong Jun's hospital bill.

312
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,331
My first love whom I cheated back then...

313
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,101
is your uncle.

314
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,030
What did you say?

315
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm sorry. I should've told you sooner.

316
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:36,910
When Ha Neul was born,

317
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:40,310
he came to the hospital to see you, and that's when I found out.

318
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,321
Back then, I couldn't bring myself to tell you that.

319
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,180
What about Uncle Dae Sang? Does he know?

320
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:48,990
He came here the other day.

321
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,090
He just pretended not to know me and left.

322
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:54,331
I guess that's because you were there.

323
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,260
He doesn't want to see me again.

324
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,601
Hee.

325
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,030
That's why I called you over.

326
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:06,700
I don't think we should keep seeing each other.

327
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:10,571
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

328
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:17,381
I have a lot to thank you for.

329
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,651
You did help me and Ha Neul with a sincere heart.

330
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:25,391
And it's you who helped me get back together with Tae Kyung.

331
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,831
I can't believe this is happening.

332
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,831
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:35,331
What is my uncle supposed to do after you leave like this?

334
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,769
Instead of shutting me off because of my uncle,

335
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,641
you should keep trying to make him feel better.

336
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:49,750
I think it will only make things worse for him.

337
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:03,331
I have a weight off my mind after apologizing to Tae Kyung.

338
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,759
I didn't think...

339
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,831
you would take Tae Kyung in before I died.

340
00:19:09,831 --> 00:19:10,941
This is unbelievable.

341
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:15,210
And I feel light-hearted after seeing Yeon Doo and Ha Neul.

342
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:18,809
You are a much bigger person than I am.

343
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,081
I know it's not easy to take in Yeon Doo and Ha Neul.

344
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,921
What? Is there something bothering you?

345
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,190
Mr. Kim is the problem.

346
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:33,420
He even came to Yeon Doo's family's place.

347
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:34,490
What?

348
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:38,760
Actually, I met him in front of Tae Kyung's place today.

349
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,570
You did? What do we do?

350
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:45,100
We should support them at a time like this.

351
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,769
Call Yeon Doo's mother.

352
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,770
Okay.

353
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:55,980
Ms. Eun did?

354
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm just grateful that she said that, Ms. Lee.

355
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:01,650
That's what Mother wants,

356
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,520
so I'll see you at the restaurant soon.

357
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,121
Okay. Bye.

358
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,459
Gosh.

359
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,199
Now you have a grandma and a great-grandma.

360
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,430
Oh, dear. Ha Neul, is there anything you don't like?

361
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:18,239
I'm here. Peekaboo.

362
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,140
I'll get you up. All right.

363
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,709
You don't want to stay laying down?

364
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,709
My dear girl.

365
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,581
All right.

366
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:36,651
I want some cool watermelon juice.

367
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:41,131
Dad told me not to go to the café again.

368
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,841
Hi, this is Soo Kyum.

369
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,910
- Soo Kyum? - Yes.

370
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,610
I go there all the time with Yu Myung...

371
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:58,510
for watermelon juice.

372
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,210
Don't you remember me?

373
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:02,480
Of course, I do.

374
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,050
How did you get this number?

375
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,480
I searched the café online.

376
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:09,591
I called to ask for a favour.

377
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,759
What is it?

378
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,030
I'm dying for your watermelon juice,

379
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:18,030
but my dad told me not to go there anymore.

380
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,831
Could you...

381
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,101
tell me how to make your watermelon juice?

382
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:29,210
So your dad told you not to come here.

383
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,980
Sorry about that.

384
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,410
He said that having a lot of cold drinks...

385
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:34,710
could give me a stomachache.

386
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:37,750
You should listen to your dad.

387
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,220
I'll text you the recipe, then.

388
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:44,120
But it's for your eyes only...

389
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:45,260
since it's my secret recipe.

390
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,490
Really? Thank you so much!

391
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:59,601
Once I get the recipe, I'll ask Great-uncle to make it for me.

392
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:05,611
Wait. She kept her promise.

393
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:08,881
I should save her number.

394
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:13,220
Hold on. SS_2?

395
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,990
Why does that name ring a bell?

396
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:20,960
(Comments)

397
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,161
Enjoy your lunch.

398
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:25,901
Was she a follower?

399
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,970
But why did she act like she didn't know me?

400
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:38,510
Why did you come all the way here...

401
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:40,010
during your short lunch break?

402
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:42,449
I missed you, that's why.

403
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,710
Why? Don't you like it?

404
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:46,881
Of course, I do. I love it.

405
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:48,950
Give me your hand.

406
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:50,720
Why?

407
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,621
No, the other hand.

408
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,841
Yu Myung, what the...

409
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,770
Slide mine on as well.

410
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:09,970
Go on.

411
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,480
Why did you buy these without asking me first?

412
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,851
Why? Don't you like having matching rings?

413
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,480
I feel guilty, that's why.

414
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,979
Then make up for it by sliding mine on.

415
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,151
My finger's on the verge of being humiliated.

416
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:35,601
There.

417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,770
You're to keep that on at home and at the office.

418
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Got it.

419
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:42,441
Thanks.

420
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,381
Hey.

421
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:48,880
A lot of my co-workers come here, you know.

422
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:50,410
That was for them to see.

423
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:52,321
I was marking you as mine.

424
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:56,950
Let's head out. Lunch break is almost over.

425
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,020
I don't want to go back to work. Five more minutes?

426
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,790
Let's stay here for five more minutes.

427
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:13,341
You little rascal.

428
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:15,140
You told Yeon Doo to get an abortion.

429
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:16,611
No one took anything from you.

430
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:18,880
Now, stay away from Yeon Doo!

431
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:20,540
Stay away from Ha Neul too.

432
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:24,309
Please let Yeon Doo and Tae Kyung...

433
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,651
raise Ha Neul.

434
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,989
We will help them...

435
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,220
raise her well with all our hearts.

436
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:36,861
It's not just Gong Tae Kyung and Yeon Doo.

437
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,161
Their families have also lost their minds.

438
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:43,200
Fine. Let's see who wins this war.

439
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:51,138
How's Ha Neul?

440
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,638
Got it, Mom. We'll be right there.

441
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:57,308
See you.

442
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:01,618
We're to drop by the restaurant for dinner.

443
00:25:05,348 --> 00:25:06,487
I knew...

444
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:09,717
that your uncle was fond of the single mother.

445
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:12,527
Never did I think it could be your friend.

446
00:25:14,227 --> 00:25:15,628
It must've been hard for him.

447
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:20,767
I see that he mentioned her to you.

448
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,538
Uncle rarely tells us about what's bothering him...

449
00:25:25,707 --> 00:25:27,477
so that we wouldn't worry.

450
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:31,408
Why don't you talk to your uncle today?

451
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,977
I will.

452
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:45,027
- Wait. - Why are the lights off?

453
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:46,727
Did we come by too late?

454
00:25:47,658 --> 00:25:49,227
- Let's head inside for now. - Sure.

455
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,737
(Ilmiri Gold Braised Chicken)

456
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:02,737
Guys, go on and have a seat.

457
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:12,348
Tae Kyung, Yeon Doo,

458
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:14,858
congratulations on winning everyone's approval.

459
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:17,787
- Father. - Father.

460
00:26:17,788 --> 00:26:21,158
Yeon Doo, Tae Kyung, I'm truly happy for you two.

461
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:23,058
Look at me tearing up.

462
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:27,538
You two obviously look like a bride and groom,

463
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:31,006
so let's introduce ourselves to one another...

464
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,538
as if this is a formal gathering.

465
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:36,477
I'm Tae Kyung's grandmother.

466
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,707
I'm Tae Kyung's father.

467
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:40,777
And I'm Tae Kyung's mother.

468
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:42,417
I'm Tae Kyung's older sister.

469
00:26:42,578 --> 00:26:44,747
Our older brother and his wife went to see his in-laws.

470
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:46,247
I'm Tae Kyung's brother-in-law.

471
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:48,058
Their younger sister is at work and couldn't make it.

472
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,686
I'm Yeon Doo's mom,

473
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:52,887
and my son's at the office.

474
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:55,196
I'm Yeon Doo's uncle. I hope we get along.

475
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,627
- Gosh. - And I'm...

476
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,367
Auntie and Uncle's niece...

477
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,727
as well as Ha Neul's cousin.

478
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:02,496
I'm going to play with her the most.

479
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:03,568
Goodness.

480
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:07,237
We should also introduce Ha Neul.

481
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:10,007
She...

482
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:13,108
is Ha Neul, my daughter who I named.

483
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:16,318
Thank you for accepting her.

484
00:27:17,947 --> 00:27:20,657
I never thought this day would come,

485
00:27:20,658 --> 00:27:23,358
so I thank you once again.

486
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:28,026
We actually agreed to register our marriage tomorrow.

487
00:27:28,027 --> 00:27:30,057
- What? - Are you sure...

488
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:31,697
this isn't another scam?

489
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:34,067
Ms. Lee, we should join them...

490
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:35,966
and see to it that they submit the form.

491
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:37,638
They can't be trusted.

492
00:27:37,707 --> 00:27:38,737
Sure thing.

493
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:41,077
And in a year from now,

494
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:42,937
just like you did with me,

495
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,548
I'll officially adopt Ha Neul...

496
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:46,747
as my daughter.

497
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:48,878
Good.

498
00:27:49,777 --> 00:27:53,247
Real has now become my real granddaughter.

499
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:58,087
Then let's talk more while enjoying the food.

500
00:27:58,088 --> 00:27:59,857
- Dinner will soon be served. - Goodness.

501
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:01,098
Uncle, let me help.

502
00:28:01,128 --> 00:28:03,358
- I'll also help. - Goodness.

503
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:05,667
- But this isn't necessary. - It's no big deal.

504
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:16,737
Ji Myung, let me pour you a glass.

505
00:28:26,717 --> 00:28:28,756
- May I? - Gosh, thank you.

506
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:29,757
Is it good?

507
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:33,756
Thank you again for welcoming Yeon Doo back.

508
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:35,398
There's no need to thank me.

509
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:41,767
- May I? - Thank you.

510
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:50,177
Yeon Doo, what is it?

511
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:51,977
Did you have something to say to me?

512
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:55,378
- Uncle. - Sure, go ahead.

513
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:00,658
I met with Hee today.

514
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:02,618
She'll be discharged from the hospital soon.

515
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:08,328
I heard about how she took advantage of you.

516
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:11,167
It must've been upsetting.

517
00:29:11,628 --> 00:29:13,598
She has nothing to do with me now,

518
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:15,466
so don't be bothered by this.

519
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:17,808
She's going to sever contact with me as well...

520
00:29:17,937 --> 00:29:20,408
since there's no way you'll forgive her.

521
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:25,447
She helped me through child-birth. When I raised Ha Neul alone,

522
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:27,717
she laid a bridge between Tae Kyung and me...

523
00:29:27,947 --> 00:29:29,878
so that we'd get back together again.

524
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:33,487
It's why I feel terrible...

525
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:35,358
about how she treated you.

526
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:39,287
She clearly regrets her actions and...

527
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:40,288
Yeon Doo.

528
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:42,697
I'd rather not talk about her.

529
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:45,467
Gosh, this sobered me right up.

530
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:46,868
I'm heading back inside.

531
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:54,176
I hope we're not late.

532
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:55,276
Yeon Doo.

533
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:56,607
- Hey. - Gosh.

534
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,506
We came by too late, didn't we?

535
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,347
We were visiting my in-laws today.

536
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:01,416
Where are the parents?

537
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:03,317
They're enjoying their dinner. Please head inside.

538
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:05,348
- Come on. Shall we? - Sure.

539
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:15,057
Why do the three of you look so alarmed?

540
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:16,298
Do you know each other?

541
00:30:16,957 --> 00:30:18,427
Gosh, no.

542
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:21,838
He just looks a lot like someone I know.

543
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,266
Right, same here.

544
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:28,776
Introduce yourselves to each other, will you?

545
00:30:28,777 --> 00:30:29,777
Sure.

546
00:30:30,277 --> 00:30:33,207
Hello, I'm Tae Kyung's older brother.

547
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:35,216
And I'm Tae Kyung's sister-in-law.

548
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:38,417
I'm Yeon Doo's uncle.

549
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:42,658
This is my sister, and she's my grandniece.

550
00:30:43,017 --> 00:30:44,027
Right.

551
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:46,827
Please have a seat.

552
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:49,597
My uncle went out of his way to cook for everyone.

553
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,727
It's all right, Yeon Doo. We had a good meal at my parent's.

554
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:55,298
We only dropped by to greet everyone.

555
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:58,466
Yeon Doo's mother must be exhausted anyway,

556
00:30:58,467 --> 00:30:59,907
so let's call it a night.

557
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,276
We greeted each other...

558
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:04,407
and enjoyed a delicious meal. It's time we parted ways.

559
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:06,176
- That sounds about right. - Good.

560
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:08,147
I'll take Ha Neul for the night,

561
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:09,577
so rest in peace today.

562
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,788
Thank you, Mother.

563
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:13,486
Ms. Kang, we'll meet at the borough office.

564
00:31:13,487 --> 00:31:14,757
Sure thing, Ms. Lee.

565
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:17,328
- We should head out, then. - Sure.

566
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:20,327
All right. Thank you for this evening.

567
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:22,828
- I appreciate it. - Same here.

568
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:29,538
Talk about a twist of events.

569
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:32,567
Who knew you were my sister-in-law's uncle?

570
00:31:32,568 --> 00:31:35,878
I'm just as flabbergasted by this.

571
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:41,177
Are you still in contact with that woman?

572
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:42,878
No, I'm not.

573
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,416
I told you this back then,

574
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:47,217
but I didn't know what was happening.

575
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:49,787
Please don't think less of Yeon Doo for this...

576
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:51,187
or harass her in any way.

577
00:31:51,987 --> 00:31:53,587
Gosh, what do you take us for?

578
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:56,127
We're not monsters, you know.

579
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:58,327
Besides, Yeon Doo and I are close.

580
00:31:58,328 --> 00:31:59,527
Please don't take it the wrong way.

581
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:01,436
I only asked because...

582
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:03,598
you're better off not being in contact with her.

583
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:07,338
I'm still a little shocked, but we're a family now.

584
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:08,808
Sure.

585
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:11,706
By the way, would it be possible...

586
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:15,548
to keep this a secret from both our families?

587
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,788
It's a bit scandalous considering we're in-laws now.

588
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:22,017
Of course, it is. It's absolutely scandalous.

589
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:23,986
What if my dad found out?

590
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:26,226
The thought of it sends shivers down my spine.

591
00:32:26,227 --> 00:32:29,157
My grandmother could've written us off.

592
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:32,526
What about your sister? She would've taunted us to no end.

593
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:35,868
My sister would beat me to death if she finds out,

594
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:38,737
and I don't want to be an embarrassing uncle to Yeon Doo.

595
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:40,977
Of course, this should be kept a secret.

596
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:43,038
I'm glad to hear that.

597
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:46,446
Since we agreed on that, we'll keep our word.

598
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:48,516
Especially with Tae Kyung and Yeon Doo.

599
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:50,987
We'll take this secret to the grave. Got it?

600
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:52,788
Of course.

601
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:55,417
Soo Jung, you too.

602
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:24,447
It feels awkward not having Ha Neul around.

603
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:26,887
Tell me about it.

604
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:30,987
The baby's cries must've been like background music to us.

605
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:35,228
Yeon Doo.

606
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:37,626
- Yes? - Is it awkward...

607
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:38,797
to be alone with me?

608
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:41,697
Of course, not.

609
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,607
Why can't you look at me though?

610
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:49,038
That's hardly the case. There. Happy now?

611
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:54,848
I'm exhausted, so I'll head to bed first.

612
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,408
What are you doing?

613
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:30,716
What is this?

614
00:34:30,717 --> 00:34:31,888
It's the ring.

615
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:34,587
The ring you returned.

616
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,586
You kept this all this time?

617
00:34:39,587 --> 00:34:41,228
How could I throw it away?

618
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:51,138
Can you put mine on too?

619
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:52,868
Here.

620
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,018
I cried my eyes out on the day I took off that ring.

621
00:35:02,478 --> 00:35:05,748
Never did I think that this day...

622
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:07,817
would come.

623
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:11,087
Thank you, Yeon Doo,

624
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:13,828
for coming back to me.

625
00:35:14,558 --> 00:35:17,768

00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:14,777
- Why? - I grew sick of it.

667
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,176
I'll get my GED instead.

668
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:18,777
That's more up my street.

669
00:38:19,578 --> 00:38:22,276
If you ever get overwhelmed while studying,

670
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:24,517
send a distress signal. I'll help in any way.

671
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:26,417
Your words alone are supportive enough.

672
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:27,958
Go on. You should get going.

673
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:32,557
Tae Kyung, what is this?

674
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:33,827
Yeon Doo, what is this?

675
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:37,527
Thank you for having Tae Kyung, Mother.

676
00:38:38,197 --> 00:38:39,998
Thank you for having Yeon Doo, Mother.

677
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:41,667
Gosh, get going already.

678
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:44,296
Or I'll change my mind about babysitting Ha Neul.

679
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:47,066
You know what? I'll drive your mother home.

680
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:48,506
- Shall we? - Sure.

681
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:50,736
- Let's go, Ha Neul. - Let's go. Gosh, it's hot outside.

682
00:38:50,737 --> 00:38:53,207
- The weather sure is hot. - It's hot outside.

683
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,208
- It's hot. - Shall we?

684
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:55,748
Gosh, our Ha Neul.

685
00:39:00,147 --> 00:39:01,257
You registered your marriage?

686
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:04,728
Fine. Do as you want.

687

(Family Relation Registration)

688
00:39:08,558 --> 00:39:10,356
I'm here to file for parental rights.

689
00:39:10,357 --> 00:39:12,197
Is it for your biological child?

690
00:39:14,598 --> 00:39:16,097
Please fill out this form.

691
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:18,668
Regarding the mother's information, just write down what you know.

692
00:39:18,808 --> 00:39:20,167
If I file for parental rights,

693
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:21,907
will the child take my last name?

694
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:24,207
Yes, if a separate file isn't submitted,

695
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,208
the child will take the father's last name.

696
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:35,957
You must think it'll all go your way.

(Parental Rights Application)

698
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:38,388
Absolutely not.

699
00:39:39,058 --> 00:39:41,527
Daddy's coming for you, Kim Ha Neul.

(General Service Center)

702
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:55,208
Is there anything you want to do?

703
00:39:55,507 --> 00:39:56,677
To celebrate our marriage registration?

704
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:00,107
What about you, Tae Kyung?

705
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:01,518
"Tae Kyung?"

706
00:40:02,018 --> 00:40:03,447
I'm your husband now.

707
00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:05,447
Say, "What about you, darling?"

708
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:07,817
Gosh.

709
00:40:07,918 --> 00:40:10,158
I can't. It's so corny.

710
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:14,058
There's really nothing you want to do?

711
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,668
There is just one thing.

712
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:20,527
What is it?

713
00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:35,191
This is what you wanted to do?

714
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:37,531
Yes.

715
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:41,330
Lying flat in bed and doing nothing.

716
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:44,571
It's our first day as a married couple.

717
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,269
I bet you're the only person...

718
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,870
who wants to lie in bed and do nothing.

719
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,881
I can't help that this is what I wanted to do the most.

720
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,580
Diapers, formula, baby food.

721
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:59,750
Not having to worry about any of that...

722
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:01,191
and doing nothing.

723
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:04,991
This is my first time doing this since I had Ha Neul.

724
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:09,230
I feel so happy.

725
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,071
Are you upset?

726
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,841
Was there something you wanted to do?

727
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:24,881
No. I like this too.

728
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:28,350
I get to look at you and do nothing else.

729
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,080
Rest well. Don't think of anything else.

730
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:36,120
You can nap too.

731
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,961
Right, Yeon Doo.

732
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:05,421
- Hello. - Hello.

733
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,849
Ms. Bong Nim isn't here yet?

734
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,861
She's missing yet another class.

735
00:42:16,531 --> 00:42:19,060
Why does she keep skipping class?

736
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,930
It has been days.

737
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,539
Why don't you call and ask when she'll be back?

738
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,700
Yes.

739
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,841
Wash your...

740
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:40,250
- Hello? - Hey.

741
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,620
- Bong Nim. - Bong Nim.

742
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,320
Why do you keep missing class?

743
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:48,890
Studying's no fun without a rival.

744
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:51,860
I decided to quit school.

745
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,801
I told the headmaster too.

746
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,200
- What? - What?

747
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,400
What's the matter?

748
00:42:57,401 --> 00:43:00,170
The headmaster's worried about you too.

749
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:02,240
Yes. Bong Nim.

750
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:04,309
I'm let down that you suddenly quit.

751
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,179
Come over so we can talk.

752
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,579
Bong Nim.

753
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,381
I have nothing more to say. Bye.

754
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,890
This won't do.

755
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,421
I should drop out officially...

756
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,421
by handing in the form.

757
00:43:22,591 --> 00:43:24,000
Where are you, Mother?

758
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,699
I'm headed to your place with some good news.

759
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,540
Why would you come here? Don't. I'm busy.

760
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:32,000
And don't call again.

761
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,870
Don't upset me now.

762
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,870
I'm a dad looking to get his child back.

763
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,350
Hello.

764
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,619
Let's get in the car, Princess.

765
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,850
Slam.

766
00:43:56,961 --> 00:43:59,301
Where is she taking my daughter?

767
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:06,301
Gosh. It's so hot.

768
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,910
Hey. Bong Nim.

769
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:11,640
Who's that baby?

770
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:13,680
Did you give birth?

771
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:16,810
We're old enough to wear diapers, not change them.

772
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,450
Is that your grandchild?

773
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,850
- Gosh. - How cute.

774
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:26,721
Good evening.

775
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,290
Nice to meet you.

776
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,500
Nice to meet you.

777
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:34,600
It's no fun.

778
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:38,500
Yeon Doo's back. I want her as my tutor again.

779
00:44:38,741 --> 00:44:41,770
Nice to meet you. I'm Geum Sil.

780
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,040
Repeat after me.

781
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:58,520
What are you doing here with Ha Neul?

782
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:02,230
I'm here to submit my drop-out form.

783
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,330
A drop-out form?

784
00:45:04,631 --> 00:45:07,600
You'll quit coming to school?

785
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,640
You finish reading the page.

786
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,241
Ms. Kang, let's have a chat.

787
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,551
The baby's so quiet and sweet.

788
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,490
Let's not talk about anything else.

789
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:29,950
Give me the form to fill in.

790
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,261
It's time to feed the baby.

791
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:36,761
Why do you want to drop out?

792
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,730
I don't want to tell you.

793
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:42,930
I need to know if I'm to give you the form.

794
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,800
You of all people want to drop out.

795
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:49,870
What headmaster would allow it so easily?

796
00:45:50,171 --> 00:45:51,309
What am I like?

797
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:54,950
You'd refuse to quit even if the rest of the class did.

798
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,950
Your daughter came to see me.

799
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,191
What? You mean Se Jin?

800
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:08,930
She seems to have the wrong idea about us.

801
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,830
Or maybe it's not the wrong idea.

802
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:16,930
There was a time when I wanted to lean on you...

803
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:19,941
when I didn't know who you were.

804
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,070
Ms. Kang.

805
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:25,310
I know how your daughter felt about Tae Kyung.

806
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:27,881
She and my daughter had a few altercations too.

807
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,281
My Yeon Doo...

808
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,281
finally got accepted by Tae Kyung's family.

809
00:46:33,651 --> 00:46:35,820
I can't keep coming here to study...

810
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:37,961
knowing that I will be seeing you.

811
00:46:53,241 --> 00:46:54,410
What is this place?

812
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,040
Why are all the students grannies?

813
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,479
- Gosh. Bong Nim. - Bong Nim.

814
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,580
Ms. Kang.

815
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:05,320
If you won't let me drop out, there's nothing I can do.

816
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:07,420
I'll just leave. Thanks for everything.

817
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:10,720
For whatever reason, you can't quit studying.

818
00:47:10,721 --> 00:47:12,619
I won't quit studying.

819
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,360
I'm going to take the GED.

820
00:47:14,361 --> 00:47:15,861
Why are you doing this?

821
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:17,860
Talk it out with us.

822
00:47:17,861 --> 00:47:19,330
I have a personal issue.

823
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Mother.

824
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:23,031
What?

825
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,040
What are you doing here?

826
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:30,840
"Mother?"

827
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:32,381
That's odd.

828
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,180
This isn't Bong Nim's son-in-law.

829
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,479
Right.

830
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,079
Bong Nim's son-in-law is a kind doctor.

831
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,080
Right.

832
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,991
I'm here for my child.

833
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,389
Give Ha Neul to me.

834
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,120
What are you talking about?

835
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,131
Why would I give her to you?

836
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,700
- What's that? - A family relation certificate.

837
00:47:55,401 --> 00:47:57,770
I registered Ha Neul as my daughter today.

838
00:47:58,971 --> 00:47:59,971
What?

839
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,910
Look right here. "Kim Ha Neul."

840
00:48:05,211 --> 00:48:06,781
She's a Kim, like me,

841
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,710
and she's registered as my child.

842
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:09,750
(Child, Kim Ha Neul, DOB Nov. 18, 2023)

843
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:11,821
That's nonsense.

844
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,691
Ha Neul is Yeon Doo's child. She's Oh Ha Neul.

845
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:22,361
It's too late now. Hand her over.

846
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,761
What are you doing?

847
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,631
I'm taking my child. What's the problem?

848
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:31,500
Hand her over.

849
00:48:32,341 --> 00:48:33,699
No, I won't.

850
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,341
Give me the baby.

851
00:48:36,711 --> 00:48:39,511
You darn piece of raw sewage.

852
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:43,111
I told you never to show yourself before Yeon Doo or Ha Neul again.

853
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,619
Get away from the child!

854
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,890
If you don't, I'll...

855
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,090
I won't let you get me twice.

856
00:48:50,091 --> 00:48:52,961
Let go of it, you brat. Let go!

857
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:54,960
- How dare... - Ladies.

858
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:58,059
Don't get yourselves hurt and make your children worry.

859
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,699
- Just give me my baby. - I won't.

860
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,100
Ha Neul is my granddaughter.

861
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,070
You're old and weak ladies. What can you do?

862
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:06,869
- Give me the baby! - I can't take this anymore. What?

863
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,470
Do you think we're weak?

864
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:12,139
You have no idea how strong grandmas can be.

865
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,849
Will you let the grandmas teach you a lesson?

866
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,010
Bring it on!

867
00:49:16,011 --> 00:49:17,480
- Come here. - You brat!

868
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,420
- Hey! - How dare you...

869
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:21,849
Do you want to see how weak I am?

870
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,191
- Darn it! - Gosh.

871
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,360
Have you lost your minds?

872
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:27,659
If you keep being like this, I won't go easy on you.

873
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,660
I'll call the police.

874
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:31,599
Fine. Go ahead and call the police.

875
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,471
I'm going to put a gag on you.

876
00:49:38,971 --> 00:49:40,071
Are you up?

877
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,211
Why do you stare at me while I'm asleep? I'm shy.

878
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,980
You don't have to feel shy around me.

879
00:49:50,211 --> 00:49:51,281
Still...

880
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:56,390
Not again. This is so embarrassing.

881
00:49:57,051 --> 00:49:58,420
Are you hungry?

882
00:49:58,421 --> 00:50:00,390
I knew you would be, so I prepared something.

883
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:01,691
Come on out.

884
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
What?

885
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:09,870
Here.

886
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:15,071
It's...

887
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,611
kimchi fried rice again.

888
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,140
Do we have some ramyeon?

889
00:50:20,211 --> 00:50:23,111
Just have one bite. Here.

890
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,921
Try this once.

891
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,620
Come on. You can't pass over what I cooked for you.

892
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,160
All right. I'm eating it now.

893
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,600
It's actually good.

894
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,869
Are you sure you made it?

895
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:45,070
Of course.

896
00:50:45,071 --> 00:50:47,400
I wanted to make you good fried rice when we meet again,

897
00:50:47,401 --> 00:50:48,910
so I practiced really hard.

898
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:50,910
You don't understand how I feel.

899
00:50:54,211 --> 00:50:55,250
What?

900
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:58,680
Why do you keep touching my heart?

901
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:02,350
How can you be so consistent like that?

902
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,721
You know I'm being like that only to you.

903
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,631
Oh, right. Only to you and Ha Neul.

904
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,930
I can't stop thinking about Ha Neul.

905
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,071
Let's finish this and go pick her up.

906
00:51:15,971 --> 00:51:17,071
Okay.

907
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,240
- Go ahead and eat. - I have my spoon.

908
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:21,471
Wait. My phone is ringing.

909
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:24,580
Who is this?

910
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:25,881
Hello?

911
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,950
Police?

912
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,750
I'm the victim of a unilateral assault.

913
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,990
The ladies attacked me as a group.

914
00:51:35,991 --> 00:51:37,321
I want to sue them all.

915
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,560
Mr. Kim.

916
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:41,790
Please don't be like that and go easy on them.

917
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:45,059
No good can come from making a big thing out of this.

918
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,631
It's not me who made a big thing of this.

919
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,801
I just want to take my baby with me.

920
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:51,100
It has nothing to do with the ladies I've never met.

921
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,171
The other students and Mr. Jang did nothing wrong. Deal with me.

922
00:51:55,941 --> 00:51:57,171
After all this?

923
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,840
It's me who beat him up.

924
00:51:58,841 --> 00:52:00,740
So arrest me, officer.

925
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:02,111
I can't believe this.

926
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,849
That's not true. All these ladies are assailants.

927
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,480
Put them all in jail.

928
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,120
Fine.

929
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:10,720
Now that I'm going to jail, I'm taking you with me.

930
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:12,290
Please stop it, ma'am.

931
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:13,790
What?

932
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:18,860
Mom. Grandmother. What is going on here?

933
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:20,260
Are you all right, Grandmother?

934
00:52:20,261 --> 00:52:21,369
Mother, what about you?

935
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:24,639
Tae Kyung, this brat suddenly showed up at my school...

936
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,800
and tried to take Ha Neul from me.

937
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:28,410
I just want to take my baby. What's the big deal?

938
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:33,410
Take a look.

939
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:37,721
Daughter Kim Ha Neul?

940
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,119
So you registered your parental right.

941
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,450
I did. Because I'm the father.

942
00:52:44,221 --> 00:52:45,761
Anyway, I got beaten up for no good reason.

943
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:47,961
I will never settle. You'll see.

944
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:50,090
If you don't like it, give me my baby back.

945
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:52,000
You idiot, are you seriously...

946
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:55,670
Are you making all this fuss to take Ha Neul from me?

947
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:56,700
Yes.

948
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,171
You guys went crazy and stole my baby.

949
00:52:59,941 --> 00:53:01,241
I don't even care how old they are.

950
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,571
I won't forgive anyone who gets in my way.

951
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:09,410
You can take Ha Neul if you want her so badly.

952
00:53:10,151 --> 00:53:11,151
What?

953
00:53:11,152 --> 00:53:12,220
- Yeon Doo. - Yeon Doo.

954
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:13,250
Yeon Doo.

955
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,520
It's all right.

956
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,551
I'll do as you wish.

957
00:53:17,191 --> 00:53:20,321
But you have to stop bullying those who have nothing to do with this.

958
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:22,059
Are you serious?

959
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,060
Yes.

960
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:25,599
I'll go with Ha Neul as well.

961
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,600
Yeon Doo.

962
00:53:27,261 --> 00:53:28,401
Don't worry.

963
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,540
Yeon Doo, are you sure about this?

964
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,140
I'll be all right.

965
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,910
Please take care of this for me.

966
00:53:44,051 --> 00:53:45,250
What are you doing, Yeon Doo?

967
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:46,721
Aren't you coming?

968
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,450
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

969
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,980
- Is Ha Neul going to be okay... - Do you think Ha Neul will be...

970
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:16,211
I think I've seen him before.

971
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,980
- Mother. - Hey.

972
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,191
Did Yeon Doo and Ha Neul really go with that brat?

973
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,059
Where does he live?

974
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,590
We all should barge into the house.

975
00:54:26,591 --> 00:54:28,429
I'll go take them later.

976
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,691
Please don't worry and go home now.

977
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:34,730
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

978
00:54:35,301 --> 00:54:38,971
Things can happen in life.

979
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,210
She's going to sever contact with me as well...

980
00:54:47,211 --> 00:54:49,910
since there's no way you'll forgive her.

981
00:54:50,211 --> 00:54:53,249
She clearly regrets her actions and...

982
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,250
Yeon Doo.

983
00:54:58,691 --> 00:55:00,160
Grandma!

984
00:55:02,961 --> 00:55:05,499
Bong Nim, what's wrong? Are you ill?

985
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,031
What's with your face?

986
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:09,870
Grandma, where's Ha Neul?

987
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,740
The self-acclaimed father took her.

988
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:14,971
- What? - What?

989
00:55:16,011 --> 00:55:17,540
What about Yeon Doo and Tae Kyung?

990
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:18,909
What can we do?

991
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,980
I can't believe this is happening after registering their marriage.

992
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,680
Even her grandmother-in-law knows everything. What do we do?

993
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Gosh.

994
00:55:31,191 --> 00:55:34,889
What? Mr. Kim is taking Ha Neul away?

995
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,460
What about Tae Kyung? Is he all right?

996
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:39,860
How could he be okay? Even Yeon Doo went with him.

997
00:55:39,861 --> 00:55:41,599
Call Yeon Doo.

998
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,870
Okay.

999
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:49,941
(Mother)

1000
00:56:05,421 --> 00:56:07,591
Here. You carry her.

1001
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:15,300
She's your daughter you've been waiting for. Good luck.

1002
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:16,570
I'll just watch.

1003
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:17,941
Do you think I can't handle this?

1004
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,971
I'll be a lot better than Gong Tae Kyung, that jerk.

1005
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,140
Let's go, Ha Neul.

1006
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,860
Yeon Doo, what should I do?

1007
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:42,660
This is my first time. You should tell me what to do.

1008
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,730
You're holding her the wrong way.

1009
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:47,699
You should support the neck and make her comfortable.

1010
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,671
Why is it so difficult?

1011
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:51,941
She's still crying.

1012
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:54,341
What is it now? What's the problem?

1013
00:56:54,741 --> 00:56:56,640
I guess it's time to change her diaper.

1014
00:56:57,111 --> 00:57:00,179
Here. There's diaper in the bag.

1015
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,410
Try changing it yourself.

1016
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,051
Diaper?

1017
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:06,350
You should do it on the bed, not the sofa.

1018
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,401
Darn it.

1019
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:40,950
Hurry and go in.

1020
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,790
Why?

1021
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:45,261
You know why. You're the mom.

1022
00:57:45,721 --> 00:57:46,991
Do something.

1023
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:49,960
My hands and suit are covered with her poop.

1024
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:52,500
It's your baby's poop. Do you find it dirty?

1025
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:53,829
Hey, Oh Yeon Doo.

1026
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,870
You said you'd be a lot better than Tae Kyung.

1027
00:57:56,631 --> 00:57:58,769
Tae Kyung can change the diapers with his eyes closed.

1028
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,941
Can't you do it even with your eyes wide open?

1029
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:08,310
Darn it.

1030
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,350
It's all right.

1031
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:19,821
Thank you for waiting.

1032
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:28,631
All right.

1033
00:58:29,531 --> 00:58:30,930
There, easy.

1034
00:58:34,401 --> 00:58:35,441
Gosh.

1035
00:58:43,381 --> 00:58:45,721
Yeon Doo, where are you going?

1036
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:47,950
I asked where you were going.

1037
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,460
- Can you make her a bottle? - No.

1038
00:58:53,461 --> 00:58:55,261
Do you know what baby food is?

1039
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,729
Of course, I don't.

1040
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,200
Do you really believe you're ready to care for her?

1041
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,769
You can't change her diapers, make her a bottle,

1042
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,229
and you don't even know what she should eat.

1043
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:04,801
So how are you going to raise her?

1044
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,000
There's a simple solution to that.

1045
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,571
I can find myself a babysitter.

1046
00:59:10,441 --> 00:59:11,711
A babysitter?

1047
00:59:13,511 --> 00:59:14,781
What do you call yourself, then?

1048
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:16,850
Aren't you claiming to be her dad?

1049
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,520
What exactly can you do for her as her dad?

1050
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,690
Babies should be raised by their mom and dad,

1051
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:28,560
not by a babysitter.

1052
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:31,289
Think long and hard...

1053
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:33,301
to see if you're ready to take care of her.

1054
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,500
When you're ready, ask for visitation rights.

1055
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:38,270
I'll get going.

1056
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:39,941
Hey.

1057
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,651
Ha Neul, I'm sorry I put you through that.

1058
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:54,580
Yeon Doo.

1059
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:58,659
How long have you been waiting for me?

1060
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,091
For a while since I didn't know when you'd be out.

1061
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:02,631
Let's get going.

1062
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:04,801
Sure.

1063
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,761
Tae Kyung picked you up?

1064
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:08,769
I'm happy to hear that.

1065
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,700
Hurry on home, feed the baby, and put her to sleep.

1066
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,671
Sure, I'll stop worrying. Take care.

1067
01:00:16,111 --> 01:00:18,211
- Gosh. - Tae Kyung picked her up?

1068
01:00:18,941 --> 01:00:20,080
Yes.

1069
01:00:20,281 --> 01:00:22,910
He waited for her even though he didn't know when she'd be out.

1070
01:00:23,011 --> 01:00:25,480
I'm sure he would've barged in there after some time.

1071
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,850
Uncle's the best.

1072
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,591
Uncle is Ha Neul's real father.

1073
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:32,261
My gosh.

1074
01:00:32,821 --> 01:00:34,929
Why are you sighing when things worked out?

1075
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,290
What happened today doesn't worry me.

1076
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:38,700
That punk...

1077
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,031
registered Ha Neul as his daughter.

1078
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:43,770
What?

1079
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:55,850
You must've been shocked.

1080
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:57,850
I sure was.

1081
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,280
The name Kim Ha Neul...

1082
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,151
made her seem like a different person.

1083
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:04,551
I asked a lawyer friend of mine...

1084
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:06,261
who said it'd be a long battle.

1085
01:01:06,691 --> 01:01:09,031
Even if I had registered her as my child,

1086
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:12,801
Kim Jun Ha would've sued me.

1087
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,031
I would've been forced...

1088
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,531
to take a DNA test and everything.

1089
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,040
I feel bad that we had our parents get involved in this...

1090
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:25,140
on the first day of our marriage.

1091
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,441
It's all right.

1092
01:01:26,741 --> 01:01:29,580
We can go to them together and apologize.

1093
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:42,730
He seemed awfully familiar.

1094
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:46,600
I'm taking my child. What's the problem?

1095
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,600
Hand her over.

1096
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:51,700
I'm Jang Se Jin's ex-boyfriend.

1097
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:53,639
She dumped me...

1098
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,941
to marry a jerk like him.

1099
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,410
Gong Tae Kyung, that scumbag needs to be put to shame.

1100
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,941
I'm going to ruin his life.

1101
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,350
What on earth is going on?

1102
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:06,080
Why is Se Jin's ex-boyfriend...

1103
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,200
I don't appreciate you calling me over when drunk.

1104
01:02:18,261 --> 01:02:19,901
I have enough of a headache.

1105
01:02:20,631 --> 01:02:23,971
Just a while ago, Ha Neul and Yeon Doo were here.

1106
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,140
What?

1107
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,611
How did you get them here?

1108
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,111
And where are they now?

1109
01:02:31,841 --> 01:02:33,741
They registered their marriage,

1110
01:02:34,241 --> 01:02:35,580
so of course I took action.

1111
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:37,011
They registered their marriage?

1112
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,280
I registered myself as the biological father...

1113
01:02:39,281 --> 01:02:40,551
and rained on their parade.

1114
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:45,091
She's Kim Ha Neul now, not Oh Ha Neul.

1115
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,361
Do their parents know?

1116
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,560
Yes.

1117
01:02:50,091 --> 01:02:51,861
I watched as both of their mothers laughed...

1118
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,060
while they filed their marriage.

1119
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:57,930
How could this be?

1120
01:02:58,671 --> 01:03:00,440
How could they have accepted Oh Yeon Doo...

1121
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:01,770
after the huge lie she told?

1122
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:04,810
Both families are out of their minds.

1123
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:06,910
They must be stoned or something...

1124
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,711
because everyone adores Ha Neul.

1125
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:10,809
They care for her even though she's my child.

1126
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,850
What does Oh Yeon Doo have that I don't?

1127
01:03:13,721 --> 01:03:15,450
I was never enough for Tae Kyung,

1128
01:03:15,651 --> 01:03:17,921
but how could they accept Yeon Doo when she bore another man's child?

1129
01:03:17,991 --> 01:03:20,461
Why? I want to know why!

1130
01:03:37,211 --> 01:03:38,579
Where were you at?

1131
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,580
Whatever.

1132
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,350
Se Jin, is it true?

1133
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:47,381
Is it true that your dad is dating Oh Yeon Doo's mom...

1134
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,290
while aware of everything?

1135
01:03:49,821 --> 01:03:51,421
It's not true, right?

1136
01:03:51,591 --> 01:03:53,591
He'd never do that.

1137
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:57,059
He may not care for me, but he absolutely adores you.

1138
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,631
You think Dad adores me?

1139
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,700
And stop mentioning Oh Yeon Doo to my face.

1140
01:04:04,901 --> 01:04:07,540
If you're that curious, meet her mom yourself.

1141
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:20,449
Mr. Kim took Ha Neul?

1142
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:21,651
Exactly!

1143
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,750
That little piece of trash...

1144
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:26,920
tried to steal the baby away...

1145
01:04:26,921 --> 01:04:28,729
while all the others were watching.

1146
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,030
Him being polite and generous...

1147
01:04:31,031 --> 01:04:32,631
was all a façade.

1148
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:34,901
How could we ever let him take the baby?

1149
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,769
I'm shocked to know what kind of a man he really is.

1150
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,640
I knew something like this would happen. What now?

1151
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,011
What else? We must protect Ha Neul at all costs.

1152
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:44,170
Of course.

1153
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:47,140
Imagine how worried Tae Kyung and Yeon Doo must be.

1154
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,611
- Yeon Doo. - Gosh.

1155
01:04:50,051 --> 01:04:51,479
Yeon Doo, are you all right?

1156
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,821
- I hope nothing happened. - I'm good.

1157
01:04:56,051 --> 01:04:59,020
I'm sorry for bringing the family all this trouble.

1158
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,290
I'm too ashamed to say anything.

1159
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:05,930
An apology like that is only meant for strangers.

1160
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:07,729
Grandmother.

1161
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,171
Your grandmother's right.

1162
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:12,441
We should try to figure out a way to fight Mr. Kim.

1163
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:14,370
There's no need to apologize.

1164
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,111
Mr. Kim worked at the company, remember?

1165
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,080
We might be able to find some leverage.

1166
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:23,310
I know that punk well, so I'll look into it.

1167
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:25,950
Thank you.

1168
01:05:27,151 --> 01:05:30,850
It's as if Ha Neul finally has a real family.

1169
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,031
Gosh.

1170
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:38,460
Why don't you both have a seat?

1171
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:39,901
Yes, sit over here.

1172
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,730
Here. Careful.

1173
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:44,071
Goodness.

1174
01:05:44,131 --> 01:05:45,471
My gosh.

1175
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,770
She's asleep. Hush.

1176
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:52,211
Can you excuse me for a second?

1177
01:06:01,651 --> 01:06:02,790
Hello?

1178
01:06:03,091 --> 01:06:04,991
This is the Missing Persons Family Support Center.

1179
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,921
Are you Ms. Eun Geum Sil's grandson?

1180
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:08,760
Yes, this is he.

1181
01:06:08,761 --> 01:06:11,290
I'm calling about the DNA that was registered.

1182
01:06:11,631 --> 01:06:14,631
We found a DNA match for Ms. Eun.

1183
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:16,671
Really?

1184
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,940
As a baby, her nickname was Strawberry.

1185
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,240
You found Strawberry?

1186
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,681
(The Real Has Come!)

1187
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,280
Thank you.

1188
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,351
Thank you, Tae Kyung.

1189
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:11,521
So it wasn't the police who contacted you.

1190
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:13,960
Be honest with me.

1191
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:16,030
Soo Kyum's mom is alive, isn't she?

1192
01:07:16,261 --> 01:07:17,930
Ms. Jang and Mr. Kim.

1193
01:07:17,931 --> 01:07:20,101
What did they do to you?

1194
01:07:20,431 --> 01:07:21,800
I won't let you have Ha Neul.

1195
01:07:21,801 --> 01:07:22,801
You punk!

1196
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:24,430
That's enough.

1197
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:25,940
We'll see who eventually wins.

1198
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:27,900
We have a registered mail from the court.

1199
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,040
A child custody application?
