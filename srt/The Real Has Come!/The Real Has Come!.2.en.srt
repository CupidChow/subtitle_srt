he would end things with me?

around your finger...

you lent her as soon as possible.

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,110
I want them gone.

187
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,250
I'm a fertility specialist,
so I don't do that.

188
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:32,179
- What?
- I don't do surgeries.

189
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:35,220
If you need to, find another doctor.

190
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:44,860
The bill for my car repairs.

191
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,659
Wire it to the account there.

192
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,829
You can go now.

193
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,829
Okay.

194
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,439
It costs 3,000 dollars?

195
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,110
What? Is it too expensive?

196
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,679
After what you did to my car,

197
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,480
you're worried
now that you got the bill?

198
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,350
Do you know the kind of humiliation
you put me through?

199
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,650
I was mistaken as a cheater...

200
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,720
Whatever. It's just 3,000 dollars.

201
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,459
I don't need it. Get out.

202
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,659
Did I say I wouldn't pay you?

203
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,770
My gosh.

204
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,299
Book Ms. Oh an appointment
with the director.

205
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,809
Will that do?

206
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:32,779
Stop bothering me and get out.

207
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,350
Ms. Oh, what are you...

208
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,549
It's almost done.

209
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:51,630
Here. I wired you the 3,000 dollars.

210
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,100
See that?

211
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I won't visit you again.

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,909
Someone canceled, so you can come
at 3 p.m. the day after tomorrow.

215
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,650
- Is that okay with you?
- Yes, it's fine.

216

Your lecture's in 20 minutes.
Why aren't you here yet?

219
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,370
I must've lost my mind. I forgot.

220
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,829
I'll be right there.

221
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,439
Director!

222
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:40,539
Ma'am.

223
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,380
There was blood. I bled.

224
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,679
What if my baby went wrong?

225
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,480
Call the director for me.

226
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:49,850

You don't have to worry.

229
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,260
You said you only bled a little
and just once.

230
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:59,829
It's likely implantation bleeding
that happens during attachment.

231
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,329
Are you sure, Doctor?

232
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,970

Thanks, Dr. Nam.

Take good care of Ms. Yeom for me.

Yes, Director.

238
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:25,990
I feel much better now.

239
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:28,529
Thank you.

Shall we call my husband
and your wife over for lunch?

No. My wife is very busy these days.

She sure is.

243
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,640
Ji Myung must not be interested
in having kids though.

244
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,140
- Sorry?
- The company...

245
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,439
will be my husband's
since he's the eldest son.

246
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:47,340
Wouldn't it be nice for her...

247
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,980
to quit her job
and focus on having children?

248
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,919
I know it has been hard on you.

249
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,189
Living with
your in-laws is one thing,

250
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,159
but your wife's a workaholic.

251
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,260
It's not just about having kids.
She isn't the most attentive wife.

252
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,459
You not even mentioning
the idea of a divorce...

253
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:07,600
speaks to your generous character.

00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:09,929

256
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,669

- Bye.

Our divorce
is right around the corner.

260
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,429
Mr. Gong, not again.

261
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,370
What's wrong with
online influencer marketing?

262
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,470
We should consider the lifestyle
of the MZ generation...

263
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,110
who are now beginning to enjoy golf.

264
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,279
Ms. Gong, will classy golfers...

265
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,750
pick out and buy golf balls...

266
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,250
marketed by young influencers?

267
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,880
Do you even hear yourself?

268
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,250
The average age of golfers
has been lowering.

269
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,319
We should target customers
in their 20s and 30s...

270
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,020
and upgrade our brand image
to a youthful one.

271
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,159
It's only a trend
that'll slowly fade away.

272
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:11,689
What can we make off chump change
spent by youngsters?

273
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,929
Do you have any idea
how challenging it was...

274
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,830
to get the investment
for functional fabric?

275
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,469
Who are you to spend it
on something stupid?

276
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,269
You don't have the right
to shut me down.

277
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,969
That money belongs
to the company, not you.

278
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:23,840
You always shut down ideas
from the PR Team.

279
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,610
This company has more
than just the PR Team.

280
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,479
See the bigger picture here!

281
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:30,080
This is exactly why you still
aren't Senior Executive Director.

282
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,509
What?

283
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,919
That's enough.

284
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,419
Mr. Gong, Ms. Gong,
meet me in my office.

285
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,929
Dad, I'm sorry that
we raised our voices in the meeting.

286
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,140
Chun Myung's keeping me
from doing my job.

287
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,499
He won't allocate us
any of the funding.

288
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:56,140
You were being greedy.

289
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,239
Why waste the investment
that I worked hard to get?

290
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,280
A waste, did you say?

291
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,280
You went to your father-in-law
for that investment.

292
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,880
Do you need his permission
to spend it?

293
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,780
How dare you speak ill of him.
Have you lost it?

294
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,590
Do you work for his company or ours?

295
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,860
As if a man in his position...

296
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,620
would've invested all that money
without an ulterior motive.

297
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,689
An ulterior motive, you say?

298
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,060
How dare you speak ill
of his goodwill?

299
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,229
Quiet!

300
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,400
Ms. Gong, execute your idea...

301
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,269
and prove that the money
will not go to waste.

302
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,870
Yes, sir.

303
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:30,640
And Mr. Gong, stop asking
for your father-in-law's aid...

304
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,909
regarding company business.

305
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:34,040
Only relying on your connections
won't get you anywhere.

306
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:35,249
Got it, Dad.

307
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,249
Hurrah!

308
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:45,459
- Dad!
- What the...

309
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,159
Dad...

310
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,989
Soo Jung didn't miscarry.

311
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:51,030
The bleeding was
only a part of the process.

312
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,030
You'll finally welcome
your first grandchild.

313
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,530
Why you...

314
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,030
You should work even harder
if you want to be a proud father.

315
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,469
Of course.
I'll devote my life to this job...

316
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:02,340
so that your grandchild
can inherit your company.

317
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:03,870
My gosh.

318
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,909
Goodness.

319
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,509
Gosh.

320
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:11,479
Come on.

322
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,519
It's okay. Please stay seated.

323
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,090
First your in-laws and now
the baby your wife's carrying.

324
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,159
Can't you do your job unless
you use your family as leverage?

325
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,199
If you're jealous,

326
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,999
marry into another family
who has power...

327
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,969
or quit your job and have a child.

328
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,900
Are you kidding me?

329
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,969
Why do you think Dad took my side?

330
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:36,969
Because unlike you,

331
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,280
I do good work without
any help from my connections.

332
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,679
What about you, then?

333
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:43,509
Could you have come this far
if you weren't Dad's daughter?

334
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:45,249
I will inherit the company from him,

335
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:46,979
and it will be passed down
to my child.

336
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,890
Talk about being old-fashioned.

337
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,550
Being his son
doesn't make you next in line.

338
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,689
What else, then?

339
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,689
Would you be willing to give up
the company to Tae Kyung?

340
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,159
What? Why would you even
bring up that punk?

341
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm sorry, but I'd appreciate it
if you lower your voices.

will soon arrive.

Who are you to butt in?

344
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,640
Is it because
the chairman adores you?

345
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,179
My grandma being fond of you
doesn't make you her granddaughter.

346
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,550
I'm sorry, sir.

347
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,519
You. Know your place.

348
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:23,489
Only speak up
when you're allowed to be heard.

353
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:11,000
Gosh, Mother.
I must really be pregnant.

354
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,100
The smell of meat is making me sick.

355
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:16,709
I grilled some steak
because you were craving it.

356
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,770
Should I make something else?
What would you like?

357
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,439
It's all right.

358
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:23,379
You cooked this for me,
so I shouldn't make a fuss.

Mother, what will you get me
once I have the baby?

of yourself again.

00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:34,419
You thought you were pregnant
at the end of last year,

363
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,990
but it didn't happen.

364
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,959
It's not common
for women to bleed down there,

365
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,730
so always be careful.

366
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:42,230
It's just bleeding
that comes with embryo attachment.

367
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,230
How do you think it'll be
to have your first great-grandchild?

368
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,439
I wouldn't
put it down for a second...

369
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,570
and will cover it with gold.

370
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:54,540
Think of it as a gift
for your 80th birthday.

371
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,080
You'll get to hold
a pretty great-grandchild.

372
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,810
- Sure.
- Soo Jung!

373
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,550
Gosh. Grandma, Mother, I'm home.

374
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,590
Right.

375
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,820
Could I steal Soo Jung away
for a second?

376
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
- Sure.
- What?

377
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,859
- Chun Myung...
- Goodness. Those childish brats.

378
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,530
How can they still
be head over heels for each other?

379
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,879
Honey, I almost died today...

380
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,350
worrying about your well-being.

381
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:35,780
And I missed you all day today.

382
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,020
Don't run. Don't even walk.
Don't do anything for that matter.

383
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,189
Until Chalttuk arrives,
don't lift a finger.

384
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,929
Honey, ta-da.

385
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:49,399
My gosh. I'm touched.

386
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:53,169
I'm going to have a son
who looks just like you.

387
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:55,199
No!

388
00:22:57,439 --> 00:23:00,639
I want a daughter
who resembles my Soo Jung.

389
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,449
I love you, Chun Myung.

390
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:06,480
I love you more.

391
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,419
That reminds me.

392
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:15,419
Dad took Ji Myung's side today
at the office.

393
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,389
What if she ends up
pushing me out of the way?

394
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:22,260
Don't worry about it.
You have my dad looking out for you.

395
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,869
Your father won't be able
to dismiss my dad's opinion.

396
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,899
Just get ready to move in
to the chairman's office someday.

397
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:36,949
Chalttuk, that's how wise
your mother is.

398
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,010
I'll keep working hard, all right?

399
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,350
That's right, Chalttuk.
Stick to my womb like glue.

400
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,619
Your dad and I
will stick together as well.

401
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,359
I love you.

402
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:57,669
I love you more.

403
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,100
Right. Thanks.

404
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,350
Hey. You did it!

405
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,649
See? There you go.

406
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,119
I didn't think
you'd be better at this than me.

407
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:22,919
Only you got Dad's good vision.

408
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:24,889
Sew the patch on for me, will you?

409
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,260
I'm going to film my next video
with that upcycled t-shirt.

410
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,629
I heard you,
so get on with your studies.

411
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,270
Your grandma is already at it.

412
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:35,939
My name, M, A...
Is Bong Nim. N, A, M...

413
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:38,510
Ga. Na.

414
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,209
Ha.

415
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:43,209
- Ha.
- Yeon Doo. Did you just get back?

416
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,780
Have you eaten?

417
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,980
What's wrong with Auntie?

418
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,050
Leave her be.

419
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,419
Both her body and heart
must be hurting.

420
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,320
Gosh. I feel like I'm dying.

421
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:56,889
You should be looking for a job.
Why are you drinking so much?

422
00:24:56,889 --> 00:24:58,129
- Look at you.
- Gosh.

423
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,730
You won't have time to study
once the store renovation starts.

424
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,129
I don't know. I'll study somehow.

425
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,469
I'm only letting you stay
because of your daughter.

426
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:08,540
Don't even date.

427
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,939
Should I skip dating
and get married?

428
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,240
Go ahead.

429
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,810
But if you have another kid
before you get married,

430
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,080
I'm going to kill myself.

431
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,590
- Yeon Doo. What are you doing?
- What?

432
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,359
Why do you look so bad?
Did you not get any sleep?

433
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,359
Do you want me
to prepare a foot bath?

434
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:34,699
I'm fine. I'm just going to sleep.

435
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:41,240
Hello?

436
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:44,939
Yes. I'm Oh Yeon Doo.

437
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,580
Why? Who is it?

438
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,149
What? Me?

439
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,419
Oh, no.

440
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,389
I never even thought about that.

441
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,260
Stop it.

442
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,490
Oh, okay. I understand.

443
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:05,990
I'll see you then.

444
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:10,730
Mom.

445
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,830
Who is it? What's wrong?

446
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,669
They want to scout me.

447
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:18,709
What? Where?

448
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,040
A competing academy.

449
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:25,109
They want to hire me
as their head instructor.

450
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:26,379
Oh, my gosh!

451
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,050
Oh, my gosh!

452
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,490
- What's going on?
- What is it?

453
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,850
- What is it?
- Look.

454
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,590
Yeon Doo is going to become
a star instructor.

455
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,429
I'm going to become
the mother of a star instructor.

456
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,159
- A star instructor?
- Oh, my!

457
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:40,959
- Come here!
- A star instructor!

458
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:46,669
- Star instructor!
- Star instructor!

459
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:48,439
- Star instructor!
- Star instructor!

460
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,409
- Is this real?
- Star!

461
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,810

are such early risers.

Since my daughter's
a star instructor,

468
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,080
I'm going to be the best too.

469
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,679
Oh, my.

470
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,820
Stop right there!

right now!

My butt got here first,
so it's mine.

- Hello, Mr. Jang.

509

We start a new semester

is already so strong.

but they won't listen.
Please scold them.

We'll do eye exams on the first day
of class, just to be fair.

00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,010
How is that fair?

522
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,510
I stayed up all night and ran here.
This isn't fair.

Our students all have...

524
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,409

80th birthday party with Mom.

537
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,419
Don't wear some shabby clothes.

538
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:31,949
Wear the suit I sent yesterday.

539
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:10,889
This is Ms. Jang.

540
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,790
I picked up the hanbok.
I'll head to the hotel.

541
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,869
Please place them
so the spacing is even.

542
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:20,939
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,300
We'll check the screen.

544
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:32,810
Please give one bag
to each person as they exit.

545
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:33,810
Yes, sir.

546
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:38,350
Please take special care
of the center.

547
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,320
This is very important,
so please set things carefully.

548
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,359
Yes, ma'am.

549
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:47,230
Oh, my.

550
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,909
(Happy 80th birthday, Grandma.
Love, your family.)

551
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,780
Look.

552
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,429
Oh, my. How long has it been?

553
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,399
I used to come to this hotel so often,
it felt like my house.

554
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:27,570
It has changed so much.

555
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,770
It wasn't this hotel.

556
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,510
Gosh. You scared me.

557
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,439
The hotel we used to go to
was a different one.

558
00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:39,510
Gosh. Look at you.
Didn't Se Jin send you clothes?

559
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:41,550
Why did you come here
looking like this?

560
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,419
Do you want to tell everyone
that you lost everything?

561
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,619
Mr. Jang.

562
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,790
It must've been a long trip.

563
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,959
Thanks for coming.

564
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,859
There's no need to thank us.

565
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:56,560
We used to be like family.
Of course, we should come.

566
00:33:57,199 --> 00:34:00,000
How's the school?
Is it still struggling?

567
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,869
It's doing okay, thanks to you.

568
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,939
I always feel sorry.

569
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,669
Sorry?

570
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm sorry I can't help more.

571
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:13,109
Gosh, In Ok. You look so luxurious.

572
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,819
People must think you were married
to a rich man from the start.

573
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,560
You're still the same.

574
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,330
You should go and say hi to Mother.

575
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,029
- Yes.
- Let's go.

576
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,130
Congratulations, Ms. Eun.

577
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,500
We're honored that you invited us.

578
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:35,339
There are so many guests.

579
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,940
Please live long until 100, Ms. Eun.

580
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,069
Don't say that.

581
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:42,580
My son's successful,
so I don't mind dying this instant.

582
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,150
You can't say that.

583
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,179
You should watch
your great-grandchild grow.

584
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,719
Oh, will you have
a great-grandchild soon?

585
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,520
That's even more great news.

586
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,989
What about you, Ji Myung?

587
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,029
No, I don't plan to have children.

588
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:01,560
I don't see your youngest grandson.

589
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,270
I'd love to see the charm that
seduced a news presenter.

590
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,299
Oh, hello. You made it.

591
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,440
We haven't met in a while.

592
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,339
You still look so lovely
and you're 80?

593
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:18,509
I don't believe it, Ms. Eun.

594
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:21,520
My son's friend and his wife.

595
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,380
Thanks for coming.

596
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,219
Let's all sit down.

597
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,100
I know you're not sleeping,
so get up.

598
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,270
It's Grandma's 80th birthday party.

599
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,170
At least come downstairs to say hi.

600
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,779
You can go. I can't be bothered.

601
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,960
Seeing my mother from up here...

602
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,089
makes me even more emotional.

603
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,060
Today, I'm here not as a chairman...

604
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,770
but as my mother's son.

605
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,100
Myself and the company are
what we are now...

606
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,770
thanks to my mother's devotion.

607
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:25,949
Let me introduce the woman
who fought and survived 80 years.

608
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,889
Please applaud my mother,
Ms. Eun Geum Sil.

609
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,259
My gosh.

610
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:48,400
Looking good, Tae Kyung.

611
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:55,210
You talk too much, Chan Sik.

612
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,580
The biggest nuisance at a party
is giving a long speech.

613
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,719
I ended up
getting spoiled later in life...

614
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,130
only because
my son became successful.

615
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,400
I got through some rough times...

616
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,830
thanks to my children.

617
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,799
And to be able to celebrate
my 80th in such fashion,

618
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,469
I guess I'm a very lucky
and blessed woman.

619
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,639
They served you only the best,

620
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,980
so enjoy the food,

621
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,719
and instead of wishing me well,
I'd like you to bless...

622
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,549
my children and grandchildren.

623
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,159
I don't think I'll be able to
forget them even in death.

624
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,420
Come on, Grandma.

625
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,630
Darn it.

626
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:55,569
Will you hurry?
We might miss the whole thing.

627
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,980
Let's go.

628
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,080
Hyun Woo.

629
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,449
No, we have to go. Come along.

630
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:08,119
I'll buy you something nice.

631
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:15,389
What?

632
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:17,659
Tae Kyung!

633
00:38:18,989 --> 00:38:20,029
Tae Kyung.

634
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,730
Go to her.

635
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,239
He has a tiny face and he's so tall.

636
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,150
He is handsome.

637
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,319
Ms. Eun seems to adore him.

638
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:46,290
You made it, sweetie.

639
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,659
Do you know how much I missed you?

640
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,630
Smile brightly.

641
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,069
You look beautiful.

642
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,569
I can't breathe. Let go.

643
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,009
Happy birthday, Grandma.

644
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:12,549
Yes, thank you.

645
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:14,650
Oh, silly me.

646
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,219
You should greet your in-laws.

647
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,790
What?

648
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:21,860
What?

649
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,889
His in-laws?

650
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,799
Mother.

651
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:38,069
What are you talking about, Ms. Eun?

652
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:41,540
How are we his in-laws?

653
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,940
Oh, right.

654
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:49,219
My grandson Tae Kyung
made a huge decision...

655
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:52,290
as a gift to celebrate
my 80th birthday.

656
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,659
Ladies and gentlemen,
he'll be married soon.

657
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,400
- Grandma.
- Oh.

658
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,940
His future bride's here.

659
00:40:10,000 --> 00:41:40,000
(hallyusubs.com)

660
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,709
Honey.

661
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:47,879
I guess our Se Jin's
really going to marry Tae Kyung.

662
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,779
Wait, Mother.

663
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:56,120
Young people these days say
some people have a similar look.

664
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,549
You look lovely together.

665
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,470
Please.

666
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,640
It's a love spat.

667
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,620
Couples squabble a lot
before marriage.

668
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,020
I hope you understand.

669
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,750
Grandma,
Ms. Jang can't marry Tae Kyung.

670
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,060
How can we accept a woman
who has nothing in our family?

671
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,629
How dare you? Shut your mouth.

672
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,399
I apologize, Mr. Jang.

673
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,899
I raised my kids terribly.

674
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,169
Let's talk about this later.

675
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:49,910
How about we have dinner first?

676
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,009
Ms. Eun.

677
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:01,180
You can't ever take this back, okay?

678
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,149
Do you think I could...

679
00:43:04,589 --> 00:43:08,060
speak more casually
now that we'll be in-laws?

680
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,009
I told you to sort it out.

681
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,540
What are you up to?

682
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:31,509
I told you,
there's nothing I can do.

683
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,419
Quit the nonsense.

684
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:35,790
You're a secretary, not a slave.

685
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,290
If you want to marry,
look elsewhere...

686
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:39,919
because I'm not interested.

687
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:41,819
Wait.

688
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,529
Can't you consider it
just this once?

689
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,899
Put our history aside,

690
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,569
and think of the possibility...

691
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,770
of taking me...

692
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:59,339
as your partner.

693
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:12,689
Shameless, aren't you?

694
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:22,470
Tae Kyung,
Donggeul's mom's water just broke.

695
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,370
- I'll head there first.
- I'm right behind you.

696
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,120
I'm going to be a star instructor.

697
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,259
Let's go.

698
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,989
Why are you here on your day off?

699
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:55,560
I had a few embryos to observe
among other things.

700
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,169
But why are you...

701
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:00,370
The mom's water just broke...

702
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:01,739
and she had no one
to babysit the little one.

703
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:03,140
Director Cha is in surgery.

704
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,509
Nurse Kim,
you're to join in on the surgery.

705
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,680
Got it.

706
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,350
What do I do?

707
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,080
Get going.

708
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,189
I'll look after this menace.

709
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,549
Thank you.

710
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:19,959
I just changed her diaper.

711
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:22,660
She stops crying
at the sight of you anyway,

712
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,759
so you'll be fine.

713
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:24,930
Sure.

714
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,439
I thought you stopped crying
at the sight of me,

715
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,739
so why won't you stop?

716
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:40,239
You don't want your rattle
or any water.

717
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:42,910
The nurse just changed
your diaper as well,

718
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,580
so why...

719
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,350
Why won't you stop crying?

720
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,419
This was crazy of me.

721
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,160
I'm here on my day off
and haven't been able to eat.

722
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,430
Hey, are you hungry?

723
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:09,310
What the...

724
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:26,859
This is cramping my style.

725
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,189
A diaper bag of all things?

726
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,359
And where am I supposed
to feed the baby?

727
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:38,029
Darn it.

728
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:47,080
Excuse me. Are you Ms. Oh Yeon Doo?

729
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:48,839
Yes, that's me.

730
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,350
Hello. I'm Director Han Chang Soo...

731
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,149
at Gtoos Education.

732
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:55,890
Hello.

733
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,149
I appreciate you
making the time for me.

734
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,359
Open up.

735
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:09,200
There you go.

736
00:47:13,669 --> 00:47:15,069
Who knew I would babysit?

737
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:17,509
What am I even doing?

738
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,580
What's this smell?

739
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:30,489
Ma'am, you've got to be kidding me.

740
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:32,720
A restaurant
shouldn't smell this way.

741
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:34,520
Unbelievable.

742
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:38,830
Actually, it's your baby who pooped.

743
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:42,560
She pooped?

744
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,200
What the... You pooped?

745
00:47:51,509 --> 00:47:52,980
It's better to be
in letters than words.

746
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,250
Your signing bonus is negotiable,

747
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:58,310
so please consider the offer.

748
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,419
If you agree to be on board,

749
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,850
I will use every trade secret
that I know...

750
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:06,390
to create a curriculum
designed just for you.

751
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,790
I appreciate that.

752
00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:12,359
Gosh.

753
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,970
I won't make you wait too long
for an answer.

754
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,970
I'd highly appreciate that.

755
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:23,069
By the way, do you plan on marrying?

756
00:48:24,209 --> 00:48:25,239
Sorry?

757
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,310
You see,
one of our head instructors...

758
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,450
came down with a serious illness.

759
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,819
I contacted you because we needed...

760
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:35,419
someone to fill in
as soon as possible.

761
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:38,350
It's why I was wondering about...

762
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,160
your plans to marry
or have children.

763
00:48:45,029 --> 00:48:49,029
I don't plan on marrying
or having children any time soon.

764
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:53,140
Are you all right?

765
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,439
I'm fine.

766
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:07,520
(Occupied)

767
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,160
Where am I supposed
to change your diaper?

768
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,899
What am I going to do?

769
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:25,569
Darn it.

770
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,739
What did you eat?

771
00:49:27,739 --> 00:49:29,540
Your poop smells worse
than an adult's.

772
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:32,810
Hold on.

773
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,239
Yes, that.

774
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,980
A diaper deck.

775
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:39,649
In the women's restroom.
Right, Donggeul?

776
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,020
Let's go.

777
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:44,220
What the...

778
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,500
- What?
- What? Ms. Oh?

779
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,680
No. The baby isn't mine.

780
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:10,950
The mother is a patient.

781
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,779
Ms. Oh, wait.

782
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,020
I need to change her diaper,

783
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,089
but the diaper deck is in there.

784
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:27,600
I'm sorry about this,
but could I ask for a favor?

785
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,970
I'll owe you one.

786
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,870
You told me not to bother you again,

787
00:50:32,669 --> 00:50:34,100
but you're bothering me instead.

788
00:50:38,439 --> 00:50:39,439
But...

789
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,879
There's nothing I can do!

790
00:50:50,419 --> 00:50:51,989
Should I head back to the clinic?

791
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:53,520
Hey.

792
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,830
Don't you worry.

793
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:08,669
I'm a pro at this
thanks to having a niece.

794
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,140
You're a sweet one.

795
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,470
There.

796
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:14,810
All right.

797
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:35,560
All right. There you go.

798
00:51:35,899 --> 00:51:37,870
I bet you feel refreshed.

799
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:53,720
Are you still not done?

800
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,850
We're done!

801
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,220
Come on. Let's go.

802
00:52:08,029 --> 00:52:09,730
I apologize for bothering you.

803
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,230
How can I repay you?

804
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,299
It wasn't you who I helped.

805
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:16,370
I helped the baby in need.

806
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Thank you.

807
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,450
When you come by the clinic...

808
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:38,790
Ms. Oh.

809
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,660
Are you all right?

810
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,069
Gosh.

811
00:52:58,149 --> 00:52:59,379
Are you feeling better?

812
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,520
I haven't had
morning sickness before,

813
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:04,919
so it threw me off.

814
00:53:06,759 --> 00:53:07,989
I appreciate this.

815
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:11,629
When will you
be seeing Director Cha?

816
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,529
Tomorrow afternoon.

817
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,060
I see.

818
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,330
The steps we take at our clinic...

819
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,169
are stricter than those
at other facilities.

820
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:23,270
To have the surgery you want,

821
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,669
a guardian must be present.

822
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:32,180
Won't you allow it without one?

823
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,419
You said you didn't have
any friends or family to talk to.

824
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,319
Are you sure you won't tell anyone?

825
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,529
When you want to say it later on,
you might not be able to do it.

826
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,470
If the person who needs to hear it
is gone.

827
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,540
What's that supposed to mean?

828
00:53:56,609 --> 00:54:00,310
"If the person who needs to hear it
is gone?"

829
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:02,379
Didn't he call you?

830
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,379
Your boyfriend said
he'd go to the US.

831
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,279
He told you to forget about him
and move on.

832
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:10,549
I don't think he will come back.

833
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:19,160
No. He didn't call me.

834
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,799
You should meet him and face it.

835
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:27,339
Whatever conclusion you come to.

836
00:54:36,379 --> 00:54:38,149
How docile she is.

837
00:54:38,549 --> 00:54:40,020
How old is she?

838
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,379
She's 11 months old.

839
00:54:43,049 --> 00:54:46,419
She's so neat and adorable.

840
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,189
She's got the mom's eyes
and the dad's nose.

841
00:54:48,189 --> 00:54:51,330
She takes after both her
mom and dad.

842
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,500
- I'm not the mom...
- I'm not her dad.

843
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
What?

844
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,629
I should get going.

845
00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:29,700
It feels like I smell like poop.

846
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:32,870
Is it the smell of a baby?

847
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,970
You should meet him and face it.

848
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,470
Whatever conclusion you come to.

849
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:44,750
Who am I to talk?

850
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,660
(Gong Tae Kyung)

851
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,109
I was right about that.

852
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,680
I knew I would get
to use this cabinet...

853
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,919
imported straight from Italy.

854
00:56:24,919 --> 00:56:25,950
Hang on.

855
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,959
Why am I wiping
this 15-year-old thing?

856
00:56:28,959 --> 00:56:30,390
I should get a new one.

857
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,700
Gosh, the head of the family
gave way,

858
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,970
but the daughter restored
the family's fortunes.

859
00:56:39,669 --> 00:56:41,339
My goodness.

860
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,739
My dear daughter. You're home.

861
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:47,080
Why did you not tell me?

862
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,580
If I knew, I would've gone
to a salon to get my hair done...

863
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,649
and got myself a designer bag...

864
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:53,680
Mom.

865
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,250
All right. I get it.

866
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:00,220
I was just carried away.
I'm so happy.

867
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:02,520
Hang on.

868
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:07,230
So this is why
Ms. Eun got you a fancy car...

869
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,899
and paid off our debt.

870
00:57:09,899 --> 00:57:14,069
When Ms. Eun lent me the money,
she said she'd consider it a gift.

871
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:18,140
If you mess things up again,
the marriage will be called off.

872
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:20,509
Fine. I'm not a fool.

873
00:57:20,509 --> 00:57:23,350
I'll keep a low profile...

874
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,279
until you get married.

875
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,790
Just looking at him
is a real buzz kill.

876
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:41,029
Leave Se Jin alone.

877
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,350
I'm coming in.

878
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,759
You're getting married
all of a sudden?

879
00:58:12,629 --> 00:58:16,330
If you were curious,
you should've asked Ms. Eun.

880
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:18,569
I'm tired.

881
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,970
Things wouldn't go your way.

882
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:26,209
What does that mean?

883
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,540
A match made out of greed
wouldn't end well.

884
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,549
As your dad, I really don't want...

885
00:58:34,779 --> 00:58:37,049
this marriage to take place.

886
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,919
Just get ready
to walk me down the aisle.

887
00:58:41,189 --> 00:58:43,959
That's the last thing you can do
for your daughter as a dad.

888
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,600
And we won't need your tacky suit.

889
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,339
My in-laws will get you a nice one
for the wedding.

890
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,100
Just look forward to it.

891
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,410
What?

892
00:59:42,419 --> 00:59:45,120
Who are you? Who's there?

893
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:49,290
You should be careful.
Aren't you hurt?

894
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:52,689
- Grandma.
- What's going on?

895
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,160
Gosh, Mother.

896
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,930
- Tae Kyung.
- You...

897
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:59,669
That thing was sitting over there
like a ghost.

898
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,339
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm sorry.

899
01:00:03,339 --> 01:00:05,140
Don't be absurd!

900
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,739
- Grandma, step back.
- Okay.

901
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:10,049
What are you doing here?
You hate to be here.

902
01:00:10,049 --> 01:00:12,250
Why did you come here
so early in the morning?

903
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,450
I was so curious
that I couldn't fall asleep.

904
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,189
Grandmother, why did you do that
to me earlier today?

905
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,489
Tae Kyung, let's go out.

906
01:00:19,489 --> 01:00:21,089
Let go of me.

907
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:23,060
I said I wouldn't get married.

908
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,330
I didn't want to deal with you,

909
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,660
so I told Ms. Jang
about how I was feeling.

910
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,799
But how could you do such a thing
in front of other people...

911
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:32,069
What did I do wrong?

912
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:35,339
What's wrong with getting
my grandson a good spouse?

913
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,310
A good spouse?

914
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,509
Do you think I don't know
what you're up to?

915
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,810
You don't want me
to marry into a family...

916
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,850
that's better
than the in-laws of my siblings.

917
01:00:44,279 --> 01:00:46,049
You're just afraid...

918
01:00:46,049 --> 01:00:48,720
I'd go after the money
or the company of our family.

919
01:00:49,419 --> 01:00:51,850
I earn just enough to live on.

920
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:54,989
I will never ask you for money!

921
01:00:55,689 --> 01:00:58,660
So please leave me alone!

922
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,529
Fine. Then you should get married.

923
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:04,700
If you marry Ms. Jang as I say,

924
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,399
I'll believe what you say.

925
01:01:06,399 --> 01:01:07,899
Why would I get married
against my will?

926
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:11,209
And it's Ms. Jang
who is basically your slave.

927
01:01:11,439 --> 01:01:13,040
That's not going to happen.

928
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:16,109
All right then.
Get out of this house.

929
01:01:16,109 --> 01:01:18,049
Mother, please.

930
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,109
I will.

931
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:20,720
What?

932
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,419
That's what you want me to do.

933
01:01:23,149 --> 01:01:26,319
I will get out and cut ties
with everyone in this family.

934
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,459
Take good care of Mom.

935
01:01:33,529 --> 01:01:35,459
Wait, Tae Kyung.

936
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:36,870
- That insolent...
- My gosh.

937
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,500
- Mother.
- What's wrong?

938
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,669
- Come hold your grandma.
- Mother.

939
01:01:40,669 --> 01:01:42,040
Take her to her room.

940
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,310
- Mom.
- Mother.

941
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:46,069
Gosh.

942
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:55,879
The franchise contract.

943
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,919
And the exclusive contract
of an instructor.

944
01:01:57,919 --> 01:02:02,660
I can't believe
I have two contracts in my hands.

945
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,560
The business will go well,

946
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,989
and Yeon Doo will be
a star instructor.

947
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,730
Things are really going well
for our family.

948
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:08,959
It will be a big success.

949
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:10,930
- A big success.
- A big success.

950
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:14,500
Then you should get me
my own laptop.

951
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:16,299
If Auntie's salary...

952
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,169
Don't say an exact amount.
I don't want to jinx it.

953
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,879
No matter how much it is,
It's all Yeon Doo's money.

954
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:22,540
Don't you dare ask her for money.

955
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:23,549
Maybe...

956
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,549
- I could ask her for a penny.
- My gosh.

957
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:29,649
- Just a penny.
- Not even a penny.

958
01:02:29,649 --> 01:02:30,950
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Just a penny.

959
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,919
- Just a penny.
- Just a penny.

960
01:02:32,919 --> 01:02:35,290
- Not a penny.
- Just a penny.

961
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,930
We should get a maid.

962
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,290
And we should buy a clothes dryer.

963
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:41,600
I do all the household chores.

964
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,000
- That's crazy.
- We should spend some money.

965
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,069
You have an appointment with
Director Cha Hyun Woo at 3 p.m. today.

966
01:02:48,669 --> 01:02:51,270
Your boyfriend said
he'd go to the US.

967
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,709
You should meet him and face it.

968
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,509
Whatever conclusion you come to.

969
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:24,970
Why do you...

970
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,939
look so haggard?

971
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:30,009
I'm tired.

972
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,080
I saw you with her at the hotel.

973
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,489
Are you going to the US with her?

974
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,220
Yes.

975
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:45,160
Did I...

976
01:03:47,299 --> 01:03:48,859
mean nothing to you?

977
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:51,470
You said you loved me.
You said that all the time.

978
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:52,470
I did love you.

979
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,339
It's just that
a bigger love found me.

980
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,609
Then why did you
send me the voice message?

981
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,339
What voice message?

982
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,989
Yeon Doo. Why won't you pick up?

983
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,120
It's all over.

984
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,620
It's over with you...

985
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,459
and with that woman.

986
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,359
It's embarrassing.
What are you doing?

987
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,830
You said it was over with her.

988
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,529
- Isn't it?
- I just talked nonsense drunk.

989
01:04:28,339 --> 01:04:29,439
What did you...

990
01:04:30,069 --> 01:04:31,839
expect from this voice message?

991
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:33,879
Where's your pride?

992
01:04:34,009 --> 01:04:36,009
Why are you being pathetic?
That doesn't sound like you.

993
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:37,750
What?

994
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,379
I came here
to have the least of decency.

995
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:41,850
Stop leaning on false hope.

996
01:04:57,529 --> 01:04:58,629
What if...

997
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:02,439
I'm pregnant?

998
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,669
Would things be different?

999
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:10,980
I'd tell you to get an abortion.

1000
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,069
Gosh.

1001
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,709
That brat totally flipped out.

1002
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,439
He said
he'd cut ties with my family.

1003
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,180
There won't be
a wedding or anything.

1004
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,580
Forget about it.

01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,509
Excuse me.

1007
01:06:51,009 --> 01:06:52,379
You can throw it away
after using it.

until you come down.

1010
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:20,680
Welcome...

1011
01:07:24,509 --> 01:07:27,220
Ma'am, are you all right?

Ms. Oh Yeon Doo.

1013

Well...

1014
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:39,890
I want...

1015
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:42,000
an abortion.

with another patient...

1018
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,870
No. I want it now.

1019
01:07:50,509 --> 01:07:51,509
Right now.

1020
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:53,410
I can't wait.

Ms. Oh.

1022
01:07:54,939 --> 01:07:57,009
We need to do an ultrasound first.

1023

You can check the monitor here.

1024

Are you sure
you don't need to see it?

1025
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:15,129
I don't want to see it.

1026
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:19,399
I'll start the ultrasound.

and start the operation.

1028

What?

1029

Hang on.

That doesn't matter!

If you keep being like this,
your mother will suffer.
