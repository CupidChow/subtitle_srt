2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,401
Hey. I told you
not to touch Auntie's laptop.

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,340
Hold on.

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,711
This pink sweatshirt is on sale.

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,251
- Come on.
- Wait.

6
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:30,181
Dad.

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,591
What is premarital pregnancy?

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,061
What? Wait.

9
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,000
What is this?

10
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:53,110
- Pregnancy?
- Oh, my!

11
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:55,710
What is all of this?

12
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,650
It says Oh Yeon Doo is pregnant.

13
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:01,451
I guess Auntie's pregnant.

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,591
I'm home. Where is everyone?

15
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,161
- Grandma!
- Hey, Oh Soo Kyum!

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,531
Grandma!

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,960
Hey.

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,230
Auntie...

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,301
What? Auntie what?

20
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:18,900
Right. Yeon Doo went to her academy.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,471
I'll go see the interior designer.

22
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:22,501
You still haven't gone? Hurry.

23
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:23,700
Okay. I will.

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,611
- Let's go, Dong Wook.
- Let's go.

25
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:33,551
I can't work at such a dirty
and cheap place like this.

26
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,381
No. I'm not doing it!

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,471
Are you really pregnant?

28
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,010
Why aren't you saying anything?

29
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,781
Are you really pregnant?

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Yeon Doo.

31
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:12,950
Whose kid is it?

32
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,761
Do you not know whose it is?

33
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:17,421
I know.

34
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:20,690
Tell me.
Is it someone you're going to marry?

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,930
Let's talk later.

36
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,130
Answer me right now.
Is it someone you're going to marry?

37
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,470
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,741
Did I ever interrogate you like this
when you brought home Soo Kyum?

39
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,210
You never did.

40
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,340
You tried to throw Soo Kyum away.

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,611
Now, I know how you feel.

42
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:42,180
The baby hasn't even been born,
but I want to throw it away.

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,521
Dong Wook.

44
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:46,321
Fine. I became a dad at 18,
so I have nothing to say.

45
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,891
But you're not the same as me.

46
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,361
You're such an important daughter
to Mom.

47
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:52,261
You're everything to Mom.

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,660
You asked if it was a sin
to get pregnant earlier, right?

49
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,831
It is.

50
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:58,530
It's not to other people,
but it is to Mom.

51
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,000
Get rid of it right away.

52
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,641
I was going to.

53
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:08,410
Give me some time to think.

54
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,180
What do you need to think about?
Why do you need to think?

55
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:14,780
Figure it out before Mom finds out.

56
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:16,880
We'll head back first.

57
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,021
Come home after working hours
so Mom doesn't notice.

58
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,601
(Episode 4)

59
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,171
This is Ms. Jang.

60
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:40,771
How is Ms. Eun feeling?

61
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:43,481
She hasn't said a word all day.

62
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,880
Anyway, you can't get married.
What will you do?

63
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:50,851
I'm not sure.

64
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,021
Please take good care of Ms. Eun.

65
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:55,620
I'll be there soon.

66
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,801
(Cashier's check, 1,000 dollars)

67
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,071
Hello?

68
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:14,241
I'll pay you back.
I told you I will.

69
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,541
Hey! I told you who my in-laws were.

70
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,310
As soon
as my daughter gets married...

71
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,981
Hello?

72
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,081
What are you doing?

73
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,421
Oh, my.

74
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:30,961
"Happy and Capital?"

75
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,361
Se Jin. The thing is...

76
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,661
Where did you borrow from this time?

77
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:38,630
How much did you borrow
from how many places?

78
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,570
Three places, but it's not much.

79
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,370
I had to sign for the new apartment.

80
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,810
We need to match their level.

81
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,211
- What if your husband comes over?
- Mom.

82
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:49,640
Hey. What were those checks earlier?

83
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:51,551
Let me use those.

84
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:55,421
No. I need to pay Ms. Eun back.

85
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,180
Why would you pay her back?

86
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,091
She gave it to you
as a wedding gift.

87
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,890
I don't even know
if we're going to get married yet.

88
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,921
What wedding gift?

89
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:06,560
Do you want me to mooch off of them
even before I get married?

90
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,961
Mooch off of them?

91
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:10,760
Their money is our money now.

92
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,971
- Give it to me.
- What's wrong with you?

93
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:14,971
Give it to me!

94
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:18,341
Do you want me to suffer
because of this petty change?

95
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,250
I'm not getting married.

96
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,880
What?

97
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:31,791
I'm tired. I'm exhausted.

98
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,361
If you keep doing this,
I will not get married.

99
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:42,301
Mom.

100
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:46,130
Oh, Se Jin.

101
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:48,500
I must've gone insane.

102
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,700
I must've gone crazy.

103
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,211
I'm sorry, Se Jin.

104
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,950
But...

105
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:02,851
you're my only hope.

106
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,450
You must...

107
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,461
not want to live like this
anymore either, do you?

108
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,591
That family
used to borrow money from us.

109
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,130
You can't live
as their slave forever.

110
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,671
So...

111
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:23,601
don't say
you won't get married, okay?

112
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:28,411
I will never borrow money
from other people anymore.

113
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:31,351
Okay? Please, Se Jin.

114
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,180
What are you two doing?

115
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,101
Did something happen to Se Jin?

116
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,031
You don't need to know.

117
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:53,430
Whose fault do you think
all of this is?

118
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,101
Who was the one...

119
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:58,411
who lost us all of our money?

120
00:06:58,411 --> 00:07:00,770
Oh, goodness!

121
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,491
What is this?

122
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:17,120
This is the money you gave me
to pay off Mom's debt.

123
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,491
Sorry I'm returning it so late.

124
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,361
Did you think
I would ask you for money...

125
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:24,601
since the wedding is off?

126
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,671
No. I had no other way
to show how sorry I felt.

127
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,440
I wasn't able to win
Tae Kyung's heart.

128
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,310
Ms. Lee left the house.

129
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,351
I made you worried.

130
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,880
It's all my fault.

131
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,880
Please forgive me, Ms. Eun.

132
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,651
I'm glad you know.

133
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:51,291
You seem better than I expected.

134
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,731
Why shouldn't I be okay?

135
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:56,630
Did you think
something like this would shake me?

136
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,830
If they don't like my house,
they can all leave.

137
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,870
I won't even blink an eye.

138
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:05,440
Will you really be okay?

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
About what?

140
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,741
Chairman Gong has been caring...

141
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:12,411
about Tae Kyung more recently.

142
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,151
He went to the hospital
to see Tae Kyung today.

143
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
What?

144
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:22,190
Are you really okay
with this wedding not happening?

145
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,830
Chairman Gong leaning
toward Tae Kyung must worry you.

146
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:30,830
If you give me more time,

147
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm confident
I can convince Tae Kyung.

148
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,711
So you should get Ms. Lee
to come back home.

149
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:41,780
What if Chairman Gong also leaves?

150
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:06,201
Why aren't you picking up
Chairman Gong's calls?

151
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,670
Why did you drink?

152
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,870
Why would you drink alcohol
just because someone made you,

153
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,040
when you know you can't drink?

154
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,441
No one made me drink.

155
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:15,441
I drank because I wanted to.

156
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:19,451
The young lady
didn't force you to drink?

157
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,451
She didn't drink
because she's pregnant.

158
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,150
That's right! I drank!

159
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,160
I tried, but I couldn't swallow it.
I spit it out like a fool.

160
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:31,760
How tormented must she be...

161
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
if she were at a bar
when she can't drink?

162
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,660
Thanks to her, I badmouthed you
until I felt much better.

163
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,400
That young lady...

164
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:42,741
reminded me of us long ago.

165
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,510
I wish I had her number.

166
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,311
I'd have Ms. Jang
send her something.

167
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,910
Could she have left her number
with the food cart?

168
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:55,520
If not, should I leave my number?

169
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,780
Tae Kyung.

170
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,790
Didn't you see her
when you went to get my bag?

171
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:12,030
What's this?

172
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:14,841
Is it her business card?

173
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:17,670
Yes. We met outside the food cart.

174
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,471
I must wash my hands.

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,620
Ms. Jang, can you
do something for me?

176
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,111
Why are you back so late?

177
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,811
You're usually in bed by now.

178
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,150
Why are you home now?

179
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,321
So you could avoid me?

180
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,890
You're so mistaken.

181
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,491
Why would I avoid you?

182
00:11:57,471 --> 00:11:58,471
What's this?

183
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,870
- Sleep on the floor.
- Why should I?

184
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:03,481
I can't sleep on hard surfaces.
You sleep on the floor.

185
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,650
Why should I? Get the light.

186
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,851
Darn it.

187
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,250
I couldn't sleep a wink
because of you.

188
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,620
Why did you toss and turn?

189
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,290
I'd like to ask
why you kept making noises.

190
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:52,130
I told you to sleep on the floor.

191
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,561
I told you I can't sleep
on hard surfaces.

192
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:57,000
Keep it down.

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Do you want everyone to know
we're divorcing?

194
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,000
You keep it down.

195
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:06,270
Are you going to sneak off
like you did yesterday?

196
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:08,140
Wait.

197
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,181
Were you awake?

198
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,510
You pretended to be asleep?

199
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:15,420
Were you that embarrassed
that you threw yourself at me?

200
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:18,491
Why would I be embarrassed
about a drunken kiss?

201
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,550
You're the one who built up
what should've been just a kiss.

202
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,020
It was a mistake!

203
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,790
What? "A mistake?"

204
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:28,701
It was a mistake on both our parts,
so let's pretend it never happened.

205
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:32,000
But tell the family
we're getting divorced...

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,300
and move out.

207
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,941
Is kicking out non-family members
a family tradition?

208
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,910
Fine. I'll pack up and leave.

209
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,170
Let's tell everyone today!

210
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,481
Do you think I won't?

211
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,750
Are you protesting?

212
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,020
When will you start talking to me?

213
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,961
When you apologize to her.

214
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,790
What did I do to apologize for?

215
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,861
I hear you've been busy...

216
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:04,300
visiting your wife and her son.

217
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,101
Why? Do you want to leave too?

218
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:10,471
- Dad.
- Gosh.

219
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:16,140
What is it
this early in the morning?

220
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:19,981
Father, Grandmother.
We have news for you.

221
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,750
What could be so serious?

222
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:26,491
Dad, Grandma, don't be too shocked.

223
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,851
- We're...
- Father.

224
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
What's this?

225
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:33,760
Father.

226
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,931
Soo Jung...

227
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:39,000
- is pregnant.
- What?

228
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:40,800
We're having Chalttuk.

229
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,741
Is that true?

230
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:44,571
Is it confirmed?

231
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:47,741
There are two clear lines.

232
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,081
- I'm pregnant.
- My gosh.

233
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,750
Father. I'm going to be a dad.

234
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,181
Grandmother. I'm going to be a dad.

235
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:58,351
Yes, good. Well done.

236
00:14:58,351 --> 00:14:59,550
Good for you.

237
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,351
I'm proud of you.

238
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:04,091
Good for you, Soo Jung.

239
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,831
Thank you.

240
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,861
I'm proud of myself too.

241
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,030
You should be. Now, hang on.

242
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:15,071
What were you about to say?

243
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,201
It's nothing.

244
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,870
Congratulations, you two.

245
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,410
We have to celebrate.

246
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,380
Let's have lunch together.

247
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,681
You should come too.

248
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:27,081
Okay.

249
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,150
Well done.

250
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,361
Bring your mother to lunch.

251
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,731
Let's eat together.

252
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:48,500
Mom. Spend time with me today.

253
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:51,170
We'll go shopping
and have a nice meal.

254
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:56,941
Well, okay. Let's do that.

255
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,861
Stop staring at your spoon and eat.

256
00:16:13,861 --> 00:16:15,731
Giving lectures makes you hungry.

257
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:17,361
Okay.

258
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:21,101
Yeon Doo, how about
going on a blind date?

259
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,701
- A blind date?
- Yes.

260
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,640
Now that you're a star instructor,

261
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,410
I'm getting so many offers.

262
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,481
A conglomerate employee,
a dentist, a lawyer.

263
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:32,250
Take your pick.

264
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,481
Forget it.
She's too busy to go on dates.

265
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:36,851
You stay out of it.

266
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,150
Meet the guys first.

267
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:40,951
Shall we start
with the conglomerate guy?

268
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:43,221
Yeon Doo, you said
you have an early start.

269
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,321
Aren't you running late?

270
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,030
I am.

271
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,831
You should go, Auntie.

272
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,931
To save the peace of the family.

273
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:51,601
- See you later.
- Yeon Doo.

274
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:54,071
If you don't like him,
how about the lawyer?

275
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:57,071
Mom, forget about the lawyer.

276
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,581
Yeon Doo.

277
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:11,050
What's this?

278
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,520
A list of gynecologists.

279
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:17,820
I looked up some good places.
Take your pick.

280
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,030
If you need a guardian, call me.

281
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,401
You have to go, okay?

282
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,881
(Obstetricians and gynecologists)

283
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:53,790
Hello?

284
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,560
Is this Ms. Oh Yeon Doo?

285
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,500
When did you get this made?

286
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,040
I called one of our suppliers.

287
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:05,971
I had to do something.

288
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,741
Aren't you pleased
you'll be an aunt?

289
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:12,381
I expect an expensive gift.

290
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,151
The giver decides on the gift.

291
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:16,921
I'll get something appropriate.

292
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,090
I'll give you something.

293
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,121
Spend it on your prenatal care.

294
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,860
Thank you.

295
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,560
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Sure.

296
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,590
(Congratulations on having Chalttuk)

297
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,461
How much is this?

298
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,270
I'll look after this baby
as best as I can.

299
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,840
Thank you, Grandmother.

300
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,181
How did you know I like this place?

301
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:52,491
Let's go inside.

302
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,500
(Congratulations on having Chalttuk)

303
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,431
Are we expecting someone else?

304
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,600
Did you order for Chalttuk too?

305
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,580
We're here.

306
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,610
I see.

307
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,421
Mom, come on in.

308
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
(tteokbokkisubs.com)

309
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,410
- Tae Kyung.
- What...

310
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,679
How dare you show yourself here?

311
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,939
Get out this instant!

312
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,949
Mom, please calm down.

313
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:47,920
Are you suggesting
that I eat with those two?

314
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,019
I'll leave if they won't.

315
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,789
Please don't get angry
on a good day like this.

316
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,759
Mother, please have a seat.

317
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,130
Everyone gathered
to congratulate us on our pregnancy.

318
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,830
Gosh, I'm sorry to have come here
completely clueless.

319
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,130
Why don't you take your seats?

320
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,969
Mom...

321
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,689
Why don't we enjoy our meal first?

322
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:34,929
Mom, please.

323
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:43,939
Here.

324
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,670
- Let's enjoy.
- Sure.

325
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,959
My gosh.

326
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:07,259
Are you all right?

327
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,660
Please excuse me.

328
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,469
Chan Sik, sit back down.

329
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:24,110
Let me see. Are you all right?

330
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:27,179
Mom.

331
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,420
Is this why you drove me around
doing things you don't normally do?

332
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,420
I'm sorry I brought you here
under false pretenses.

333
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:36,820
Chairman Gong
made an earnest request.

334
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,830
As for Grandmother,
he promised to persuade her.

335
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,699
So when she forgives you,

336
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:46,400
take a step back and head home.

337
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:48,870
What then? Are you going to stay...

338
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:51,310
out of my life forever?

339
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,810
Of course, I won't.

340
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,979
We can see each other
somewhere other than at the house.

341
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,810
As long as I'm not in there,

342
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,910
there won't be any problems.

343
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,719
What?

344
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:06,420
They'll be more at ease,
and so will I.

345
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,390
So don't let yourself be intimidated
for being my mom.

346
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,130
Lift your chin up
and live a good life...

347
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,360
as the chairman's wife.

348
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,340
Consider your troublemaker of a son
gone...

349
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:24,110
and be happy.

350
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:33,509
Since when have
you been this wicked?

351
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:35,920
Why would you invite her here
when she left on her own accord?

352
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,949
Mom, please.

353
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,090
Speak.

354
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,249
Apologize to her.

355
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,820
Why should I? Over my dead body.

356
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,459
If you don't apologize,

357
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,459
I'll leave with her.

358
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:48,429
What?

359
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:51,600
Dad, what are you saying?

360
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,539
I invited them here
saying that I'd be their shield.

361
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,800
Shouldn't I keep my promise?

362
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,209
Are they the only family
that matters to you?

363
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,979
What about us?

364
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,910
You call yourself family?

365
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,550
Are you actual siblings?

366
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,880
Watching you growl over...

367
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,420
the ownership of the company
stings enough,

368
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,080
and the last thing I want are issues
between you and Tae Kyung.

369
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,920
Mom.

370
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,630
Help me love and adore my children.

371
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,060
I love all four of them equally.

372
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,360
You're being absurd.

373
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,499
How can they be the same
as Tae Kyung?

374
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:28,640
I won't give Tae Kyung
a job at the company.

375
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,310
- What?
- I know where this is coming from.

376
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:34,939
Caring for the children
in my absence...

377
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:37,610
put a toll on you.

378
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,080
Of course, you adore them
since you raised them yourself.

379
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,949
I'll make sure that you won't have
anything to worry about.

380
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:48,560
Besides, Tae Kyung isn't interested
in the company.

381
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,689
Would it be too much to ask...

382
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:54,090
to be like a normal family...

383
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,929
who eats together
and enjoys each other's company?

384
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:56,929
- Dad.
- Dad.

385
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:57,969
Hold it.

386
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,100
Can I hold you to that promise?

387
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,509
You promised not to give Tae Kyung
a job at the company.

388
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,209
Can you keep your word?

389
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,310
Yes, I can.
I won't ever go back on my word.

390
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,449
In Ok.

391
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,880
What I said was uncalled for.

392
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,420
As the elder,
I will apologize first.

393
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,890
You and your son can come back home.

394
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,489
That isn't necessary, Mother.

395
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,289
That isn't necessary?

396
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,459
I'm filing for divorce.

397
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:05,499
Mom!

398
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,229
- What the...
- Honey.

399
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:08,239
You...

400
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,939
My lawyer will deliver
the paperwork.

401
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,039
You can throw out all my belongings.

402
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,179
I don't need anything
in that household.

403
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,580
- Honey!
- I appreciate...

404
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,979
all that you have done for me.

405
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,459
What the...

406
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,890
My gosh.

407
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,929
Mom?

408
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:33,429
- Grandma.
- My gosh.

409
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:35,729
- Grandma!
- Grandmother...

410
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,600
Mom, what has gotten into you?

411
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,199
Grandmother apologized!

412
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:47,209
Her apology doesn't change anything.

413
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,410
- What?
- She's not the reason.

414
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,550
You are.

415
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:55,949
How dare you tell me...

416
00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:58,390
to live my life without my son?

417
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,390
From the moment
I got pregnant with you,

418
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:04,360
I chose to live my life
as your mother.

419
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,689
I gave birth to you...

420
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,529
because I wanted to
live and die as your mother.

421
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:11,699
But here you are telling me
to live without my own son.

422
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:16,269
You want me to live my life
as the wife of a rich chairman?

423
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,880
I can't live without you,

424
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,350
so don't you dare
tell me what to do.

425
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,979
Mom.

426
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,650
I could live...

427
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,890
without a foot or even a leg.

428
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:35,289
But...

429
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,789
I couldn't possibly
live without you.

430
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:43,259
That's what you mean to me.

431
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,719
Hello?

432
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:14,529
Hello?

433
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,830
Excuse me.

434
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:19,130
You can throw it away
after using it.

435
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,939
You may speak. Hello?

436
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,769
Are you Ms. Oh Yeon Doo?

437
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,519
What is this?

438
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,949
She didn't want to pressure you
by asking to meet in person,

439
00:27:40,949 --> 00:27:42,489
so she sent her gratitude.

440
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,360
These are department store
gift certificates.

441
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,529
I didn't know what you'd like,

442
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:48,360
so I got something universal.

443
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:52,969
But she's the one
who paid for my meal.

444
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:54,699
You don't have to feel burdened.

445
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,340
Talking to you
must've brought her comfort.

446
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:01,179
She wishes only good things for you.

447
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:03,880
I'm grateful.

448
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,719
But please tell her
that I'll accept her gratitude...

449
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:12,320
and let our time together
be a fond memory.

450
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:15,060
Unlike her son...

451
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,390
she seems...

452
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,289
like a warm-hearted person.

453
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:24,199
Do you know Gong Tae Kyung?

454
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,840
You're so indifferent.
No wonder you don't have a friend.

455
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,739
You have no one around you...

456
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:32,539
because of the petty life
you've led.

457
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,249
No. I don't know him well.

458
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:43,120
I just met him briefly
at the food cart that day.

459
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:48,519
- Hello?
- Ms. Jang.

460
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,289
Grandma passed out.

461
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:52,660
What? Ms. Eun?

462
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:54,860
Okay. I'll be there right away.

463
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:57,300
Sorry.

464
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,800
This is my business card.
I'll contact you again later.

465
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,170
Wait.

466
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,580
(Executive Assistant Jang Se Jin)

467
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,090
Chairman Gong.

468
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:26,060
Oh, Ms. Jang.

469
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:29,660
Ms. Eun. I'm here.

470
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,870
Ms. Lee isn't answering her phone.

471
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,739
I'm afraid you're going
to pass out as well, at this rate.

472
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,009
I'll stay here,
so you should head in.

473
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,920
I'll be back soon.
Take care of her in the meantime.

474
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,350
Yes, sir. Don't worry and go ahead.

475
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,350
Okay.

476
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:25,590
- Ms. Eun.
- Why did you come here?

477
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,489
How brazen of you.

478
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:29,959
You told me to bring In Ok back.

479
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,529
This happened because of you.

480
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:34,090
Get out of my sight.

481
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:36,630
Get out of my home and office.

482
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,070
Get out now!

483
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:40,429
I'll wait outside.

484
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,570
Call me if you need me.

485
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,209
Oh, my head.

486
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:50,739
Oh, my head.

487
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:17,469
Mom.

488
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,179
I guess Mom's not here.

489
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,320
Did you have a drink too?

490
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,420
Yes, Chairman Gong.

491
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,249
Chairman Gong?

492
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,860
Father.
That's what you should call me.

493
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:41,060
Please come in.

494
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:43,660
It's okay.

495
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,370
Your mom
really must've made up her mind.

496
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,539
It's my fault.

497
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,439
I ignored the fact that my mother...

498
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,110
was giving her a hard time.

499
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,850
I was being so greedy.

500
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,650
I wanted
to keep her by my side forever.

501
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:12,590
It's all my fault.

502
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:16,300
Sorry, Tae Kyung.

503
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,170
But...

504
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,070
I can't live without your mom.

505
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:29,479
Living without In Ok isn't living.

506
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,150
I'll drive you back, Chairman Gong.

507
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,179
No.

508
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:40,550
Don't take one step out of here.

509
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,390
Wait for your mom.

510
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,499
I'll go back to my mom,

511
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,070
who passed out.

512
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:12,189
What is this?

513
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:14,689
Buy yourself a meal.

514
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,120
It's 10 dollars from me
and 20 dollars from Soo Kyum.

515
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,459
I make more money
than Dad or Grandpa...

516
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:21,830
through YouTube.

517
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,699
It's okay. I have money.

518
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,370
You must be bored
since you can't go to work.

519
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:30,340
Go and eat something tasty.

520
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:34,640
I'm not so great,
but I want to help you just once.

521
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,779
Take it before your mom sees.

522
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,949
Kang Dae Sang. Are you
borrowing money from Yeon Doo again?

523
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:44,620
It's not that, Mom.

524
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,890
Yes, he is. Gosh.
Taking money from your niece.

525
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,459
When will you grow up?

526
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:51,090
Gosh. That's not it.

527
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:52,560
Yeon Doo. Get some rest.

528
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,759
Why are you embarrassing me
in front of my nieces?

529
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,360
Soo Kyum. Let's go.

530
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,499
- Come on.
- Should I hit Yeon Doo instead?

531
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:00,830
I never even laid a finger on her.

532
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:02,340
Gosh. Mom.

533
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:04,170
It's only morning,
and he's already making me angry.

534
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,969
Wait. What did I come here for?

535
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:09,279
- Right. Yeon Doo.
- Yes?

536
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,810
You should wear this today.

537
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:14,679
A rehearsal for becoming
a star instructor. It's nice.

538
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,519
Right.

539
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
How nice.

540
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,740
What?

541
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:40,110
I heard from Father.

542
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:41,479
I heard Mother was gone.

543
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,240
Grandma passed out.

544
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,510
I know.

545
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,420
I'm tired, so hang up
if you have nothing to say.

546
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,820
Things got out of hand.
We can't take it back.

547
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,189
- So what?
- I'll say it how it is.

548
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:58,329
You're the only person
who can resolve this, Tae Kyung.

549
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,700
Sorry I can't help.

550
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,829
Don't look for Mother.
Just wait for her.

551
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,099
Give her some time.

552
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,240
I'll go to the event today,
so you should get some rest.

553
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,240
It's okay. I should work.

554
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:17,909
I have a lot on my mind.

555
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,709
I'll go.

556
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,650
Bye.

557
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:34,930
I'll take out the hotel luggage
within a few days,

558
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,659
and I'll let you know
the departure date later.

I'm going to leave Korea
for a while.

560
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:53,849
Right. I also sent you
the conditions of the accommodation.

561
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:55,479
I want it by email.

562
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,689
Okay. I'll call you back.

563
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,430
Excuse me.

564
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,590
Why do you keep staring?

565
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,829

before wearing something.

from my perspective
and from my baby's,

649
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,350

what others would think,

if you really want the baby.

perhaps because you are.

685

You treated me like utter trash,

686

You wear 280mm shoes, right?

704
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:42,970
They should be your size...

put these on yourself...

00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,229
As if. Nothing about this is fun.

726
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,439
Come on.
I know you're having a blast.

727
00:49:53,669 --> 00:49:55,470
Why don't we speed up a little?

728
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:58,109
No, please don't.

729
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,620
I'm a little hungry.

730
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:12,789
Ramyeon.

731
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:15,359
Let's grab some ramyeon.

732
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:17,499
Sounds good.

733
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:19,059
Right.

734
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:29,979
What the...

735
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,479
I dare you to catch me!

736
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:40,220
Move, lady.

737
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,590
- Get out of the way.
- Watch out!

738
00:50:44,019 --> 00:50:45,519
Lady, move!

739
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:17,919
Mr. Gong, please get up.

740
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,200
- Are you all right?
- I'm not.

741
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:26,629
I'm dying.

742
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,800
Oh, dear.

743
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,800
Let me see.

744
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,140
You're not bleeding though.

745
00:51:37,209 --> 00:51:38,240
What?

746
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,649
Are you taking it lightly
since it's not you who's injured?

747
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,390
Unbelievable.

748
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:50,019
You're fine.

749
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:57,399
(Meat Jjamppong)

750
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,769
Coming here made me feel
a whole lot better.

751
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,300
It did blast away
some of the stress.

752
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,979
Can I ask
why you attended that event?

753
00:52:17,249 --> 00:52:18,749
I figured...

754
00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:21,590
I'd get to see
a lot of people like me.

755
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:25,260
It was a bad choice on my end.

756
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,559
Why is that?

757
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:29,530
Because you ran into someone
you didn't want to see?

758
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,269
Why on earth...

759
00:52:37,939 --> 00:52:40,970
did I hide at the sight of him?

760
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,140
It's not like I did anything wrong.

761
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:46,680
Why am I avoiding the situation...

762
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,050
without being able
to make up my mind?

763
00:52:54,419 --> 00:52:57,890
To keep having a life,
I have to get rid of the baby.

764
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:00,129
But if the baby lives,

765
00:53:01,689 --> 00:53:03,289
my life will be in trouble.

766
00:53:08,129 --> 00:53:09,329
At first,

767
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:12,970
I thought abortion was the only choice
I could make.

768
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,609
But?

769
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,410
But...

770
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,780
I keep seeing myself in this child.

771
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:30,090
It's hanging on for dear life...

772
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,620
which is the story of my life.

773
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:42,430
I'm sure there will be a reason
behind whatever you decide.

774
00:53:44,539 --> 00:53:47,370
Just make up your mind
once you have thought enough.

775
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:50,070
But after you make a decision,

776
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:52,309
don't look back.

777
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,010
Don't regret it
and don't blame yourself.

778
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:09,689
Why am I the only one
who has to clean?

779
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:11,899
Forget it.

780
00:54:13,499 --> 00:54:14,669
Are you done cleaning?

781
00:54:14,999 --> 00:54:16,070
My gosh.

782
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,100
Goodness me.

783
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,169
My back was killing me.

784
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:22,410
I was just about to get back on it.

785
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:26,079
I heard you dozed off in class
and woke up from a dream.

786
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:31,050
Would you like to listen
to this dream of mine?

787
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,490
My daughter is a star instructor.

788
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,590
She must be coming
into a lot of money...

789
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,689
because I kept pulling out
wads of cash from my desk.

790
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:44,859
Did you perhaps
grab those wads of cash?

791
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,269
Yes. Why is that?

792
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,999
That doesn't mean
you'll come into a fortune.

793
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,300
It could be a conception dream.

794
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:54,439
A conception dream?

795
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,840
I'm offended, Mr. Jang.

796
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,249
How could I have a conception dream
at this age?

797
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,850
It could be for someone
in your family.

798
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,019
My family?

799
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:08,390
Why do you keep
messing with my family?

800
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,990
No one in my family
is trying to get pregnant.

801
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:15,490
I'm done cleaning.

802
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:18,200
Expel me for all I care.

803
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,100
(Old School)

804
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,709
Hello?

805
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,109
Honey, it's bad.

806
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,850
In Ok announced a divorce,

807
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,550
and Ms. Eun fainted from the shock.

808
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:41,450
What if this hinders
Se Jin's wedding plans?

809
00:55:41,649 --> 00:55:43,490
Can you see how things are
with the family?

810
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,129
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

811
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,879
By the way,
how did you know it was him?

812
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,749
We're staying at the same hotel,
we drive the same car,

813
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,180
and his name is Kim Jun Ha.

814
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,120
It was obvious.

815
00:56:12,879 --> 00:56:14,519
How about
we stop talking about him...

816
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:17,689
and you thank me
for not letting him spot you?

817
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:20,459
I'm not grateful though.

818
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:24,430
You admitted to the skating
being a stress buster.

819
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,700
You should be the one thanking me.

820
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,370
How shameless of you.

821
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,809
I should've let you
fall flat on your back.

822
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:44,120
Hold on.
I have something else to ask.

823
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,390
You said I caused
a lot of trouble for you.

824
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,959
What do you mean by that
and what is the damage I caused?

825
00:56:53,729 --> 00:56:55,090
You'll regret hearing this.

826
00:56:55,459 --> 00:56:56,490
What is it?

827
00:56:57,959 --> 00:56:59,129
At least let me hear it.

828
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:04,640
My family was blown to shreds.

829
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,669
Someone moved out of the house,

830
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,470
someone buried himself in alcohol,

831
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,780
and someone fainted.

832
00:57:11,979 --> 00:57:12,979
What?

833
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,410
Forget it.

834
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:17,419
I was just joking. Go ahead and eat.

835
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:24,320
What was that?

836
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:43,240
You're the only person
who can resolve this, Tae Kyung.

837
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,379
About from earlier,
you weren't joking, were you?

838
00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:52,280
- What?
- That your family is...

839
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,519
suffering problems.

840
00:57:58,919 --> 00:58:02,090
Can I ask you what the problems are?

841
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,470
That's something personal.

842
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,910
And I should
take care of them myself.

843
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:19,910
Once I decide what to do,

844
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,510
it will be over.

845
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:39,129
Thank you so much for today.

846
00:58:40,499 --> 00:58:42,300
As you suggested,

847
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,470
I will decide what to do.

848
00:58:46,669 --> 00:58:49,809
So you should
make up your mind as well.

849
00:58:50,169 --> 00:58:51,579
Don't hesitate.

850
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:56,979
See you.

851
00:59:16,229 --> 00:59:17,399
Hey, Tae Kyung.

852
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,200
Which hospital is Grandma in?

853
00:59:31,919 --> 00:59:33,149
What are you doing here?

854
00:59:33,149 --> 00:59:34,519
Is Chairman Gong in there?

855
00:59:35,149 --> 00:59:36,490
I need to talk to him.

856
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:38,590
What are you trying to say to him?

857
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:40,490
Chairman Gong is having
a hard time now. Please leave.

858
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,629
Hey.

859
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:44,800
- What?
- Hey.

860
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,100
You don't have to come
all the way here.

861
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,129
Well...

862
00:59:49,129 --> 00:59:51,340
Ms. Jang, you're still here.

863
00:59:51,939 --> 00:59:53,970
You don't have to be like this.

864
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,309
I don't mind.

865
00:59:55,669 --> 00:59:57,340
I heard your mother was sick.

866
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,539
Can I talk to you for a moment?

867
00:59:59,539 --> 01:00:00,709
Sure.

868
01:00:02,149 --> 01:00:05,079
I'll stop by the office
after talking to your father.

869
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,919
Don't stay here. You can go home.

870
01:00:07,919 --> 01:00:09,090
Yes, sir.

871
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,220
- Shall we?
- Yes.

872
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,570
I heard about In Ok.

873
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:24,570
Are you all right?

874
01:00:25,939 --> 01:00:27,100
No, I'm not.

875
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,140
I'm afraid she might not come back.

876
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,240
I'm shivering inside.

877
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:35,249
Is it because of
our children's marriage?

878
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,979
It's not about Ms. Jang.
It's our family issue.

879
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,149
The age-old problem
finally came to a head.

880
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:49,930
Let's call the marriage off.

881
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:51,760
I believe
it will be better that way.

882
01:00:52,229 --> 01:00:53,700
Are you sure we can do that?

883
01:00:55,229 --> 01:00:58,669
Actually, I didn't think
it was fair for Ms. Jang,

884
01:00:58,669 --> 01:01:00,200
so I was feeling bad.

885
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,539
I will talk to Se Jin.
You don't have to worry about her.

886
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,609
They are not meant to be together.

887
01:01:11,249 --> 01:01:12,249
I get it.

888
01:01:13,919 --> 01:01:16,519
Once the whole thing is settled,
we can meet up again...

889
01:01:17,149 --> 01:01:18,519
and have a meal together.

890
01:01:43,249 --> 01:01:44,749
What did you say to Chairman Gong?

891
01:01:44,979 --> 01:01:46,350
What did you tell him?

892
01:01:46,479 --> 01:01:48,320
I told him to call off the wedding.

893
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:51,120
And just so you know,
Chairman Gong agreed.

894
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:54,390
Who are you to say that?

895
01:01:55,229 --> 01:01:57,629
Who are you to call off my wedding?

896
01:01:57,629 --> 01:01:58,629
Se Jin!

897
01:01:58,629 --> 01:02:00,829
Do you realize what you just ruined?

898
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,600
Do you even know what I had to do
for this marriage to work?

899
01:02:04,169 --> 01:02:06,300
I lied that I was infertile.

900
01:02:07,439 --> 01:02:08,970
I told Tae Kyung...

901
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:11,410
that I didn't mind paper marriage
because I couldn't have a baby.

902
01:02:12,439 --> 01:02:15,680
- What?
- You can never stand in my way.

903
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,550
I'll only do things
that you don't want me to do.

904
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:21,649
You should remember that.

905
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:52,149
Welfare benefits are
not reaching single mothers...

906
01:02:52,149 --> 01:02:54,320
who desperately need help.

907
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:58,519
Will Auntie Yeon Doo
be a single mother like them...

908
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:00,390
and raise a baby all alone?

909
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:03,890
They are worried sick about
how they will raise their babies.

910
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:08,399
I can't concentrate on my studies
because of Yeon Doo.

911
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,039
Why are you watching that?

912
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:15,740
- Gosh. Come on and take this.
- Okay.

913
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,709
What's all this, Mom?

914
01:03:18,709 --> 01:03:20,640
I'm so tired.

915
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,820
Because of Mr. Jang,
my eyes are sore and my back aches.

916
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,350
That darn geezer.

917
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:30,350
What? It could be
a conception dream?

918
01:03:30,859 --> 01:03:32,789
What's wrong with you? That's gross.

919
01:03:34,859 --> 01:03:38,459
You didn't get anyone pregnant,
did you?

920
01:03:38,459 --> 01:03:40,999
What are you talking about?

921
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,329
How would an incompetent man
like me do such a thing?

922
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:44,570
I'll just go cook.

923
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,910
Let's go.

924
01:03:53,439 --> 01:03:55,709
Hey, are you sure it's not you?

925
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:58,079
What's with them?

926
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,899
I have nothing to say to you.
Get out.

927
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,970
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

928
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:18,499
For what?

929
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:21,609
It was imprudent of me to say
I'd cut ties with the family.

930
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,140
I wasn't thinking straight.

931
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:27,479
No. You didn't do anything wrong.

932
01:04:27,479 --> 01:04:28,850
What you did was right.

933
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,220
You and your mom should never
show up in front of me again.

934
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,120
What should I do
to make you forgive my mom?

935
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,760
Well... It's too late.

936
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:41,829
Once I leave this room,

937
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,329
I will have my son divorce her.

938
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:03,280
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

939
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,050
Just because
you got on your knees...

940
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,789
doesn't mean you've
turned over a new leaf.

941
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,519
What should I do
to make you believe me?

942
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:14,559
Do whatever I say.

943
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:17,729
Live as I please and move as I want.

944
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,530
Do exactly what I tell you to do
no matter what.

945
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,169
Then I will believe you.

946
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,479
- Isn't Yeon Doo coming yet?
- No.

947
01:06:07,609 --> 01:06:08,709
She's not answering the phone?

948
01:06:08,709 --> 01:06:09,709
No.

949
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:11,850
Where on earth is she?

950
01:06:12,249 --> 01:06:13,879
Do you think
something happened to her?

951
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,990
Did she go to a doctor?

952
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,760
Or is she crying alone somewhere?

953
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,019
Why would she cry?

954
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,160
Is my cousin gone?

955
01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:23,959
Your cousin?

956
01:06:23,959 --> 01:06:24,959
What...

957
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:29,669
Soo Kyum, say that again.

958
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,039
Soo Kyum.

959
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:35,709
Your cousin?
Whom are you talking about?

960
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:37,910
- Bong Nim.
- Mom.

961
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,180
Stay quiet.

962
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,010
I thought you were being suspicious.
Did I have a conception dream?

963
01:06:42,379 --> 01:06:44,519
Who is that darn dream for?

964
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:46,749
- Me.
- It's me.

965
01:06:46,749 --> 01:06:47,990
Are you guys kidding me?

966
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:49,820
Which one of you is it?
Tell me the truth!

967
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,919
It's me.

968
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:53,590
Mom.

969
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:56,329
- Yeon Doo.
- Yeon Doo.

970
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:57,660
You...

971
01:06:59,399 --> 01:07:00,800
What did you just say?

972
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:12,079
Gosh. Don't...

973
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,050
I'm pregnant.

974
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,680
Mom.

975
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:45,910
A perfunctory marriage...

976
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:48,979
without children and love.

977
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:50,979
Does your offer...

978
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,149
still stand?

979
01:07:54,519 --> 01:07:55,519
What?

980
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,660
Yes.

981
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:03,859
It does.

982
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:19,240
What...

983
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,850
Why would you...

984
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:25,120
Listen, Bong Nim. For now...

985
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,720
Wait, Mom. Don't worry.

986
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:30,119
Yeon Doo will get an abortion.

987
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:32,220
I mean, she probably already did.

988
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,720
Right, Yeon Doo?

989
01:08:36,959 --> 01:08:38,060
I can't do it.

990
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,260
What? My gosh.

991
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:42,869
Then what?

992
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:46,369
Then what will you do?

993
01:08:49,869 --> 01:08:50,909
Let's get married.

994
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,180
You and I.

995
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,720
I'll give birth...

996
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:03,919
to the baby.

997
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:09,989
My gosh.

998
01:09:47,329 --> 01:09:49,770
(The Real Has Come!)

999
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:52,140
Do you love Ms. Jang?

1000
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:53,770
That's what your child wants.

1001
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:56,039
I'm really desperate here.

1002
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,680
Just spend a few nights out
until your mom feels better.

1003
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,480
I'm glad you're here.

1004
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,350
I'll kill you and kill myself today!

1005
01:10:05,449 --> 01:10:07,480
My gosh. Mr. Gong!

1006
01:10:08,949 --> 01:10:11,360
Was that you who was here?

1007
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,959
Who's there?

1008
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:19,999
